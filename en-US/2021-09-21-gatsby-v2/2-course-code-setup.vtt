00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.740
Alright, so first and foremost,

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.580
what we're gonna do is we're
going to clone this project.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.598
And so the way that we're gonna clone this
project, I'm gonna use the GitHub CLI.

4
00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.730
I love the GitHub CLI.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.602
I'm a huge fan of, So,
I'm gonna start by using let's see,

6
00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:21.196
I'm using what version 1.2.1
of the the GitHub CLI if

7
00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:25.715
you've never used it,
it's at seelye.github.com.

8
00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:28.900
And this thing is incredibly powerful.

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.656
You don't have to use it.

10
00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.920
You can absolutely do everything that
we're doing today without the GitHub COI.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.778
I've just found that it
cuts out a lot of steps.

12
00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:39.911
It removes the need to jump through the
GitHub UI and click a bunch of buttons and

13
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:41.710
copy paste things around.

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.292
So we can go real fast.

15
00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:48.795
And so
what we're going to do today is we're

16
00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:53.702
going to fork J Lang store, front end,

17
00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:58.045
masters intro to Gatsby project.

18
00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.485
So this what I want you to run.

19
00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.200
Now I've already built this project.

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.680
So I'm not actually gonna fork, but I want
you to fork it because you're gonna want

21
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.210
to deploy this later on, and
you need to own the repo to deploy it.

22
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.640
That's me forgetting how this works.

23
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.058
It's gonna be GitHub repo fork.

24
00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:23.220
So, the command you're gonna run
is actually repo fork like this.

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.268
And I'm gonna run a clone.

26
00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:35.860
Okay, so once we're in soups,
intro to Gatsby project.

27
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.957
Inside, there's not a lot here.

28
00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:40.190
So let's open this up in VS code

29
00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:47.930
And we can take a look
at what's in this file.

30
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.018
So, all that we have in here right now,
and

31
00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:58.390
let's just make sure we're
running on node 16.6.1 today.

32
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.640
If you don't have node 16, it's okay.

33
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.374
We're using that for this project.

34
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:08.090
I think Gatsby requires node
14 it might be node 12.

35
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.872
If you have nvm,

36
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.847
You can just do like nvm use 16 or
nvm install 16 to get the latest version.

37
00:02:19.847 --> 00:02:24.190
And I've installed you can
see here there's an nvmrc.

38
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.805
So if you're in this folder and
you just write nvm use,

39
00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:32.454
it's going to grab that nvmrc, and
install it and in enable that one.

40
00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:37.440
We've got a package README,
that's just a couple of notes.

41
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.104
The package JSON, as you can see here.

42
00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:44.416
It's got the standard things you would
expect the name, version are private.

43
00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:48.104
So that we don't accidentally
publish this as an NPM package,

44
00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:51.104
cuz it doesn't make sense
to do with a Gatsby site.

45
00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.930
Description, author keywords,
you can edit those if you want.

46
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.022
And then we have our
dependencies down here.

47
00:02:57.022 --> 00:03:02.040
So at its bare minimum Gatsby relies
on Gatsby, react and react Dom.

48
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.477
So we're going to be relying
on Gatsby react and react Dom.

49
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:10.900
This is the latest version of Gatsby as
of today, we're gonna be using react 17.

50
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.870
These are the latest versions.

51
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.120
And this is what's at
the core of a Gatsby site.

52
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.781
Then we get some scripts,

53
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.640
these scripts are just lined up
with the Gatsby ci commands.

54
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.010
So develop is what we're
gonna use most of the time.

55
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.183
That's the kinda the core.

56
00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.243
As you're building a Gatsby site,

57
00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:34.070
you end up running NPM run
developer NPM run, start.

58
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.863
When we're ready to build,
we can build the site.

59
00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:39.450
If we want to test our built site,
we can serve it.

60
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.470
And if something goes weird and it
doesn't feel right, we can run clean, and

61
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.045
that'll delete the cache and public files
that are the generated files from Gatsby.

62
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:56.827
You should rarely need to do this,
cleaning is not a common thing.

63
00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:58.581
&gt;&gt; This graph qL is.

64
00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:02.935
&gt;&gt; No graph qL is not
supposed to be a dependency

65
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:06.232
because it is built into Gatsby,

66
00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:11.310
which is a choice like
it's great until it's not.

67
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.635
This is again one of those things where
if you find yourself working against

68
00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:18.119
the nature of Gatsby and you're installing
a different version of graph qL and

69
00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.259
you're trying to manage a bunch of stuff,
it can get a little tricky.

70
00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.283
But Gatsby bundles all of that for

71
00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:27.330
you so that you don't have to
install a whole bunch of stuff.

72
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.362
It specifically doesn't include react and
react Dom inside of Gatsby,

73
00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:33.023
because that would be chaos.

74
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.640
Like the whole react ecosystem relies on
react and react Dom not being bundled.

75
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.507
So this is why these ones are external,
and graph qL and

76
00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:45.856
everything else is inside of Gatsby.

77
00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:50.010
In addition to that,
we've got our lock file.

78
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.057
We all know lock file is just a way for

79
00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:54.930
NPM to keep track of what
versions are installed.

80
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.330
We've got a prettier RC.

81
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.419
This is mostly just so

82
00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.668
that you don't get unexpected formatting
changes if you start editing this repo.

83
00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:05.870
I don't care about your code
formatting preferences.

84
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.823
So if you wanna edit this to be your way,
feel free.

85
00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:11.870
It's mostly just so
that you don't get surprised code changes.

86
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.797
We looked at the nvmrc, the git ignore is
just getting rid of node modules which

87
00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:21.143
we don't want to track and
get dot cache is a Gatsby internal folder.

88
00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:25.824
You don't need to look in this folder but
Gatsby will generate

89
00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:30.430
it as part of the develop and
build processes to it will like.

90
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.267
Put temporary files in there,
it'll keep versions of images and

91
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:39.187
different optimizations that it does,
they will live in that cache folder.

92
00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:43.540
And then all of that intermediate stuff
gets finalized and put into public.

93
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.434
And again, this is a generated folder,

94
00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:47.505
which is why we don't
wanna track it in git.

95
00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:50.709
And then this is a helper that
if we're using nullify stuff, so

96
00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.630
we'll leave that one in there.

97
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.415
And then finally, the only source code
we have in here is actually images.

98
00:05:56.415 --> 00:05:59.760
So these images, I didn't want you
all to have to go and find images.

99
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.970
So we're just gonna make these
available from the get go.

100
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.150
And we will work with these
a little bit later in the project.

101
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.226
So, at this point I hope everybody
has their fork of the repo ready,

102
00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:17.250
if you don't know how to fork or
don't have the CLI,

103
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.920
you can also just fork right here.

104
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.940
Just click this button and
you will fork the repo.
