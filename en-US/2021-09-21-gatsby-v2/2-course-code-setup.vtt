1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.741
All right, so first and foremost,

2
00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:04.535
what we're gonna do is we're
gonna clone this project.

3
00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:10.235
And so the way that we're gonna clone this
project, I'm gonna use the GitHub CLI.

4
00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:12.764
I love the GitHub CLI, I'm a huge fan.

5
00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:15.348
So, I'm gonna start by using,

6
00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:20.911
let's see I'm using what version
1.2.1 of the the GitHub CLI.

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:25.674
if you've never used it,
it's at Cli.github.com and

8
00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:28.759
this thing is incredibly powerful.

9
00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:29.615
You don't have to use it.

10
00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:32.820
You can absolutely do everything that
we're doing today without the GitHub CLI.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.773
I've just found that It
cuts out a lot of steps.

12
00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:39.147
It removes the need to jump
through the GitHub CLI and

13
00:00:39.147 --> 00:00:43.990
click a bunch of buttons and copy paste
things around so we can go real fast.

14
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.993
And so
what we're going to do today is we're

15
00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:53.186
going to fork jlengstorf/ frontend

16
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:58.204
masters- intro-to-gatsby-project.

17
00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:01.532
So this is what I want you to run.

18
00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:05.966
Now, I've already built this project,
so I'm not actually gonna fork, but

19
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:10.131
I want you to fork it because you're
gonna wanna deploy this later on, and

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.233
you need to own the repo to deploy it.

21
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.599
That's me for getting how this works.

22
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.089
It's gonna be GitHub repo fork.

23
00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:24.958
So the command you're gonna run
is actually repo fork like this.

24
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.593
And I'm gonna run clone.

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.755
Okay, so once we're in sups,
intro the gatsby project.

26
00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:36.905
Inside there's not a lot here.

27
00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.277
So let's open this up, in VS code.

28
00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.890
And we can take a look
at what's in this file.

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.592
So all that we have in here right now and
let's just make sure.

30
00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:58.707
We're running on node 16.6.1 today.

31
00:01:58.707 --> 00:02:02.841
If you don't have node 16, it's okay.

32
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.182
We're using that for this project.

33
00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:08.609
I think Gatsby requires node 14,
it might be node 12.

34
00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.994
If you have Nvm whoops,
you can just do like nvm use 16 or

35
00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:19.932
nvm install 16 to get the latest version.

36
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:24.101
And I've installed you can
see here there's an NVMRC.

37
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:28.136
So if you're in this folder and
you just write nvm use,

38
00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:33.156
it's going to grab that NVMRC, and
install it and enable that one.

39
00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:34.447
We've got a package read me.

40
00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:37.343
That's just a couple notes.

41
00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:38.611
The package json,

42
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:44.169
as you can see here it's got the standard
things you would expect the name version.

43
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:48.150
A private, so that we don't accidentally
publish this as an NPM package,

44
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.135
because it doesn't make sense
to do with a Gatsby site.

45
00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:54.920
Description, author keywords,
you can edit those if you want.

46
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.904
And then,
we have our dependencies down here.

47
00:02:56.904 --> 00:03:01.933
So, at its bare minimum Gatsby relies
on Gatsby react, and react DOM.

48
00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.920
We're gonna be using react 17.

49
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.513
These are the latest versions.

50
00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:12.292
And this is like what's at the core of
a Gatsby site, then we get some scripts.

51
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:16.317
These scripts are just lined up
with the gatsby CI commands.

52
00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:18.688
So develop is what we're going
to use most of the time.

53
00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:21.087
That's the the kind of a core.

54
00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:23.381
As you're building a Gatsby site,

55
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.674
you end up running NPM run
developer NPM run start.

56
00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:28.234
When we're ready to build,

57
00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:32.079
we can build the site If we want to
test our built site, we can serve it.

58
00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.281
And if something goes weird and it
doesn't feel right, we can run clean, and

59
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:42.984
that'll delete the cache and public files
that are degenerated files from Gatsby.

60
00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:45.298
You should rarely need to do this.

61
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:48.890
Cleaning is not a common thing.

62
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.928
&gt;&gt; Is graph qL supposed
to be a dependency?

63
00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:56.227
&gt;&gt; No graph qL is not
supposed to be a dependency

64
00:03:56.227 --> 00:04:01.119
because it is built into
Gatsby which is a choice.

65
00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.215
It's great until it's not this is again
one of those things where if you find

66
00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.903
yourself working against
the nature of Gatsby and

67
00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:10.795
you're installing a different
version of graph qL.

68
00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:14.624
And you're trying to manage a bunch
of stuff, it can get a little tricky.

69
00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:18.792
But Gatsby bundles all of that for
you so that you don't have to install.

70
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.960
A whole bunch of stuff.

71
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.992
It specifically doesn't include react and
react dom inside of gatsby,

72
00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:25.653
because that would be chaos.

73
00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:30.343
The whole react ecosystem relies on
react and react dom not being bundled.

74
00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:34.229
So this is Why these ones are external and

75
00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.044
graph qL and
everything else is inside of Gatsby.

76
00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:42.696
In addition to that,
we've got our lock file.

77
00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:44.888
We all know, a lock file is just a way for

78
00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:47.692
NPM to keep track of what
versions are installed.

79
00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:49.056
We've got a prettier RC.

80
00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:50.370
This is mostly just so

81
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.489
that you don't get unexpected formatting
changes if you start editing this repo.

82
00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:58.478
I don't care about your code
formatting preferences.

83
00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:02.179
So if you want to edit this to be your
way, feel free, it's mostly just so

84
00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:04.500
that you don't get surprised code changes.

85
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.188
We looked at the NVMRC.

86
00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:11.585
Get ignore is just getting rid of node
modules which we don't wanna track and

87
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:14.549
get dot cash is a Gatsby internal folder.

88
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:17.745
You don't need to look in this folder but

89
00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:21.599
Gatsby will generate it as
part of the develop and

90
00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.121
build processes to it will
put temporary files in there.

91
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:27.971
It'll keep versions of images and

92
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.742
different optimizations that it does
will live in that cache folder.

93
00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:36.119
And then all of that intermediate stuff
gets finalised and put into public.

94
00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:37.994
And again, this is a generated folder,

95
00:05:37.994 --> 00:05:40.099
which is why we don't
want to track it in Git.

96
00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.563
And then this is a helper that if
we're using natla phi stuff, so

97
00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:45.304
we'll leave that one in there.

98
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:49.165
And then finally, the only source code
we have in here is actually images.

99
00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:52.501
So these images, I didn't want you
all to have to go and find images.

100
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:56.689
So we're just gonna make these
available from the get go and

101
00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.724
we will work with these a little
bit later in the project.

102
00:06:00.724 --> 00:06:05.364
So, at this point I hope everybody
has their fork of the repo ready.

103
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.017
If you don't know how to fork or

104
00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:12.824
don't have the CLI,
you can also just fork right here.

105
00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.660
Just click this button and
you will fork the repo.
