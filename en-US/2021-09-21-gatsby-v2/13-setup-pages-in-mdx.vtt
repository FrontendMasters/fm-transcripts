1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.860
Let's actually add this MDX support here
we're going to add a few different things.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.660
The first thing that we're gonna add is a,
let's stop this development server.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.660
We're going to install some stuff.

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.890
So we're going to install a source
plugin for the file system.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.110
The reason for that Is we're gonna
keep our posts in another folder here.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.130
So let me close the open editors.

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.910
And we're going to create
a folder called posts.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.987
Now I want this folder to work
just like the pages folder where,

9
00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:38.560
whatever we put in here
becomes a page in Gatsby.

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.710
In order to do that, we need to
like Gatsby only looks for pages.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.650
So we need to make this
a special directory.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.665
And we're gonna do that with a combination
of Gatsby source file system,

13
00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:55.381
which will let us look up files and

14
00:00:55.381 --> 00:01:00.250
then we're also going to use
a plugin called page creator.

15
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.585
And what page creator does,
is it lets us set any page in the site,

16
00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:09.860
to have the same properties
as the pages directory.

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.260
So anything inside of this
should be created as a page.

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.890
We also are gonna need
the Gatsby plugin for MDX.

19
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.850
And then we need MDX itself so MDXjs/MDX.

20
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.192
We're also going to need the react
flavor of MDX, so, MDX j s react, right?

21
00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:32.560
So this seems like a lot of stuff.

22
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.850
This one is so that we can actually load
files into the into the Gatsby data layer.

23
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.369
This one is so that we can turn any
folder into a special folder of

24
00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.120
files that will get turned into pages.

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.805
The Gatsby plugin MDX which is
going to turn our files from

26
00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:58.682
just plain old files,
it'll actually enable MDX support.

27
00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:02.164
And then the MDX things so
that we can use the MDX core and

28
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:07.055
the react additional things that we
need to use it in a react project.

29
00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.234
So let's get those installed.

30
00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:18.591
And next, once we've got those installed,

31
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:22.980
we're gonna go into our Gatsby config and
add support for these.

32
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.910
So inside of this array,
we're going to, let me get this

33
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.710
scaffolded and
then I'll talk about what it actually is.

34
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.492
So, by default,
if you just put in the name of a plug in,

35
00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:40.560
Gatsby will run that
plugin with no options.

36
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.300
This is a shorthand.

37
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.574
It's for convenience so that you don't
have to write out these big old objects

38
00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:48.660
every time you wanna do a plugin.

39
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.568
But, if a plugin does need configuration,

40
00:02:51.568 --> 00:02:54.800
then we tell it to resolve
the name of the plugin.

41
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.920
So in our case, we're gonna start
with Gatsby source file system.

42
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.660
And then we can pass options to it.

43
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.438
So in our case, we're going to
give this group of files a name,

44
00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:12.659
we're gonna call them posts, and we're
going to give them a path of the dirname,

45
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.490
that's the current directory name and
we're looking source and posts.

46
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.100
So we're trying to find this directory and

47
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.010
load all the files into
Gatsby's file system.

48
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.604
So then we wanna make sure that
Gatsby will actually create pages,

49
00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:32.053
from the pages that are found in there.

50
00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:35.800
So we're going to set up
Gatsby plug in page creator.

51
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.507
And for the options on that,
we're actually gonna

52
00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:48.280
pass in the same path we want
this dirname source posts.

53
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.634
And that will cause Gatsby
to not only find these and

54
00:03:51.634 --> 00:03:55.458
load them into GraphQL but
actually turned them into pages

55
00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:59.220
with their own address that
matches the name of the file.

56
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.973
Next, we want to transform
those files from just plain old

57
00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:12.380
files into MDX nodes, and
we do that using Gatsby plug in MDX.

58
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.594
Let me scroll up here, and
for the options on this,

59
00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:20.910
we're going to start by
giving it a default layout.

60
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.295
Actually, you know what, let's start
without a default layout and then we'll

61
00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:27.658
come back in and look at it so that we can
how the difference so we'll add that in.

62
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.333
Okay, so now that we've got this,
we've got our file system,

63
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:36.840
we've got the page creator,
we've got plugin MDX.

64
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.150
Let's go ahead and
add our first blog post.

65
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.382
So let's add to I'm gonna add
one called first blog and

66
00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:50.090
we use the dot MDX extension to
signify that it is in fact MDX.

67
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.960
So we'll give this some basic markdown.

68
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.620
This is my first blog post.

69
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.240
All right, we can save that.

70
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.460
Two exclamation boys is too many.

71
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.830
All right, let's go in here and
do another blog.

72
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.705
Dot MDX, and
in this one we will say, dang,

73
00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:15.220
this blog is even better
than the last one.

74
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.176
All right, so now we've got two blog
posts both are MDX And you can see here,

75
00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:25.770
we're not using any MDX features,
we've just added in a plain old markdown.

76
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.990
And one of the reasons to use MDX,
it will actually add some react

77
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.917
stuff a little bit later on,
but, I really like this setup,

78
00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:41.137
because what we've just done if
we start the server here again,

79
00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:45.706
is we have created the ability
to now add these files in.

80
00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:49.272
And again,
all we've done here is we've said hey,

81
00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:53.163
Gatsby look in the file system,
in this post folder, and

82
00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:57.622
create something called posts,
and then use your page creator,

83
00:05:57.622 --> 00:06:02.670
to make pages out of anything ,in this
post directory, and look for MDX.

84
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.370
So, now that we've created this,
if we look in here, everything is running.

85
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.810
Now I'm gonna go to that 404 page again.

86
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.500
So I can just type in 404 and
it'll say, hey, that's not a page.

87
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.730
And down here, I can see here's our first
blog and our another blog that we created.

88
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.490
Okay.
So this is fine, ish.

89
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.540
It looks like it picked up
our default styles, but

90
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.200
it's not quite what we're after, we're
missing our header and all those things.

91
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.039
And what we could do, and this is a pain,
is we could go in here and

92
00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:46.887
we could say let's import layout
from components layout.js,

93
00:06:46.887 --> 00:06:51.220
and then we will export default layout.

94
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.280
Is that gonna work?

95
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.270
No, it wouldn't be like that.

96
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.340
It would be like this.

97
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.140
It has to be a component like this.

98
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.971
So we would do layout, and
then inside we would send the children,

99
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:06.890
which means we have to get
the children as a prop.

100
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.570
I don't ever do this.

101
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.640
So I'm, I'm trying to remember
exactly how it works.

102
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.170
There it is.

103
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.913
Okay.
So, upon doing this by doing a default.

104
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:19.850
We've provided a kind of a layout here.

105
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.516
And if we wanted to do something like,
this is part of my blog.

106
00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:29.520
Then we can add like custom markup.

107
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.990
And this is all fine, right?

108
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.470
But this is kind of I want to do that for
every blog post.

109
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.240
So instead what we can do is we
can get rid of that entirely.

110
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.590
And we can come back out here and
I wanna set a default layout.

111
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.175
So inside of Gatsby plugin MDX,

112
00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:50.360
one of the options that I have
is to set a default layout.

113
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.170
And so I'm gonna say default layouts and
four posts.

114
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.060
This needs to match this,
that's how that works.

115
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.291
And we're going to say require dot
resolve, require dot resolve is a way

116
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:10.620
to get the node internals to give you
like the absolute path to a file.

117
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.523
So what we're doing is we
are doing the required resolve to

118
00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:19.244
source components, layout.js, right?

119
00:08:19.244 --> 00:08:22.168
So now we've got a default layout set and

120
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:27.340
see our Gatsby saying we need to
restart because we change the config.

121
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.590
I love this feature so we can hit OK.

122
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.510
And it's gonna restart
the development server for us.

123
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.432
And when it's done,
which we can watch happen over here.

124
00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:44.680
What we should see happen is the page
in the background is gonna refresh.

125
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.710
And it will actually use that layout.

126
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.760
So check that out.

127
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.810
We have our first blog post.

128
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.850
So, I'm happy about this.

129
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:56.249
We've got our blog post is here,
it has the header,

130
00:08:56.249 --> 00:09:02.890
and again, we did not have to
add the layout, it's just there.

131
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.464
And if we go to the other ones, so
let me go back to this 404 page,

132
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:11.571
click through to another blog, and
there it is, no changes to another blog,

133
00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:16.155
which again, no layout included, but
because we set a default it brings it in.

134
00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:21.901
Now we can override this if we wanted to
go back into the first blog, and instead

135
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:27.495
of using the layout, I could just set it
like a div and get rid of this layout.

136
00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:34.510
Then this one stays the same
because we didn't edit it.

137
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.990
But the first blog now it
doesn't have that setup, right?

138
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.836
So we can optionally override whenever
we need to if we need custom layouts,

139
00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:47.500
but by default, it'll use the same one.

140
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.290
And that is a really nice feature.

141
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.280
That's a really slick way
to get this up and running.

142
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.881
So this to me is a really powerful
workflow because with fairly

143
00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:02.127
minimal config,
we had to get into Gatsby config here and

144
00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:05.760
we had three plugins and
this can feel like a lot.

145
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.586
I think that one of the most overwhelming
parts of working with Gatsby can be,

146
00:10:10.586 --> 00:10:12.220
there's a lot of config,

147
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.520
it can start to feel like it's
hard to track what's going on.

148
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.178
One way that you can group this is
you can actually just go in here and

149
00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:27.637
start adding comments to let
yourself know, this set of plugins

150
00:10:27.637 --> 00:10:34.030
is to enable creating MDX blog posts
from the source posts folder, right?

151
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.380
And then down here you can
do like end of MDX config.

152
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.570
And then more config down here.

153
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.085
So if you start to notice that you're
getting overwhelmed by the amount of

154
00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:47.480
things you're putting
into your Gatsby config.

155
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.683
Leave yourself some signposts like let
yourself know why you did something or

156
00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.590
why it's configured the way it is.

157
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.631
Our site is not particularly complex, so

158
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:57.324
I'm not gonna stress too much
about doing all of that.

159
00:11:01.018 --> 00:11:03.641
But
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to make that generic so

160
00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:07.995
that it would pick up multiple
folders not just posts would I have to

161
00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:09.720
double that config?

162
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.245
&gt;&gt; The the part that gets tricky
about this is the more generic these

163
00:11:12.245 --> 00:11:13.980
are the harder they are to track.

164
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.459
So there's there's
something to be said for

165
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.310
being pretty explicit about
what you're loading and why.

166
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.370
But, you know, again this this kind
of comes down to personal preference.

167
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:30.280
The other thing to consider is like,
if you just did that it would work.

168
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:36.160
But then you'd have in your GraphQL
layer a bunch of extra stuff.

169
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.080
But if we create another
folder inside of posts.

170
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.754
Like, let's call this like a series and
let's copy one of these.

171
00:11:48.946 --> 00:11:53.620
Call this one post one.

172
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.974
This will get picked up in here, so

173
00:11:57.974 --> 00:12:04.050
if I go here now to series post one,
it works.

174
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.930
So if you put a folder in all of
the sub folders will also get parsed.

175
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:14.537
And that's where this ignore option comes
in like if you want it to ignore specialty

176
00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:19.599
stuff like this one saying ignore
anything with a dot that starts with dot.

177
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:24.080
You could say like, I only want to get
things that have the dot page dot j s

178
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.190
suffix, if you wanted to
do something kind of mixed.

179
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.926
It's generally speaking
easier to be pretty

180
00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:33.950
explicit about like this is a folder for
pages, so

181
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.774
that then your folder directories tend
to line up pretty one to one like, okay,

182
00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:43.250
I'm in posts, so this means that
the URL will be slash series, post one.

183
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.586
And that way you don't have to remember
like, yeah, it'll work like that except

184
00:12:47.586 --> 00:12:50.130
for this one that we ignored
because it's for utilities.

185
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.465
Like if you've got utilities,
pull them out of the post folder and

186
00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:53.780
put them somewhere else.

187
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.270
And in that way, you don't have to have
these like exclusions and special cases.

188
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.617
Generally speaking,
the easier you make it on yourself,

189
00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:04.910
the happier you'll be in the long term for
maintenance.

190
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.750
&gt;&gt; Is there any way to pass like metadata
with the config other than just wrapping

191
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.180
it in a layout tag and
then passing it to the props?

192
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.410
&gt;&gt; Yep, we're actually gonna
do that right now I think.
