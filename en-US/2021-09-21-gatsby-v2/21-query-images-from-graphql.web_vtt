1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.403
We're gonna do some dynamic images so
let me just clean this up a little bit,

2
00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.090
get us down to an empty folder.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.800
And let's start by opening
up our about page.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.640
So on our about page,
I wanna get an image.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.100
By querying for it.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.870
So to do that,
I'm gonna get graph QL out of Gatsby.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.657
Now note I'm not getting use static query,

8
00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:25.630
we're gonna introduce
something called a page query.

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.690
So page queries in Gatsby,
they were the original concept.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.350
But they introduce a little
bit of a cognitive leap.

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.932
And that's why I usually recommend if
you can just do a static query and

12
00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:46.826
in this case, I'm intentionally not
doing a static query despite the fact

13
00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:49.730
that we could to show how this works.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.800
So let's export a new
concept called query.

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.100
And this tells Gatsby that
this is a page query.

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.330
So it's gonna go in and look for
all of these so that it can pull them out.

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.924
And anything that we run as
a query like this export const

18
00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:12.870
query is gonna get injected
into our component as a data.

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.480
So this is a very cool concept.

20
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.110
Like I love the idea what we're basically
doing is saying hey, Gatsby, build time.

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.800
Take this query and convert the results
of this query into a prop called data.

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.190
That's just a JSON object with
the graph QL query that ran.

23
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.160
Love it as a concept.

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.880
It's very, very cool.

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.385
Significantly more complicated
to learn then Use static query,

26
00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:39.905
which effectively does the same thing, but
doesn't require you to know that you have

27
00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:43.090
to export a query and
that it's gonna show up as data.

28
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.890
You get to just const data
equals use static query.

29
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.590
Page queries though,
get access to that page context.

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.622
Which were not gonna use in
this particular example, but

31
00:01:56.622 --> 00:02:00.910
we'll use it in the shortly when
we look at third party data.

32
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.300
So in this query,
I wanna load a one image.

33
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.480
So I'm gonna head over here.

34
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.050
Let's load a single image,
so I'm gonna get file.

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.000
And I wanna load a file.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.325
That is called Cocktail.

37
00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:26.070
And In that I want

38
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.894
the child image sharp and
I want the Gatsby image data and

39
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:35.309
let's get the placeholder
to be dominant color and

40
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:41.077
again you can choose any of the normal
ones will do dominant color.

41
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:45.880
So if I run this,
we will get back this Gatsby image data.

42
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.810
We've looked at this, here's our fallback.

43
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.650
Here's our sources.

44
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.350
We've got the web p version,
the JPEG version, so on.

45
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.018
This is gonna be my query but

46
00:02:56.018 --> 00:03:01.755
I wanna change it will say what's
called like cocktail party or

47
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:05.990
something and, In here,
I can paste that in.

48
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.040
Now this is gonna be the graph
qL query that gets executed.

49
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.357
And then we'll get data
dot file dot child image,

50
00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:22.151
sharp Gatsby image data.

51
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:27.124
Then I'm gonna get a another
helper from Gatsby, so

52
00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:31.090
this one is gonna be called Gatsby image.

53
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.700
And then we want another thing called
get image which is a utility function.

54
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.134
And we're pulling that in
from Gatsby plugin image.

55
00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:44.890
Down here with this data we're
gonna actually grab this out.

56
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.970
So we'll go right under the layout.

57
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.760
And we're gonna say Gatsby image.

58
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.643
And I want the image to
be get image data file

59
00:03:57.073 --> 00:04:04.002
And we can set alt and it'll be like
a cocktail set inside an elaborate

60
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:09.756
floral arrangement with dry
ice mist curling around it.

61
00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:17.093
This is a cocktail from a bar called
bar chef in Toronto that is famous for

62
00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:22.372
effectively making diagram
as you can drink from.

63
00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:27.335
And let's go take a look
at what it looks like.

64
00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:32.405
So let me head over to the about page and
look at that cocktail.

65
00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:32.925
See in there?

66
00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:33.995
That's the thing that you drink.

67
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:36.110
And this is all the stuff
that's around it.

68
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.030
But these are the like, we were able
to query for that image and load it in.

69
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.390
And this is useful if for example,
you were trying to show an image gallery.

70
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.274
You could query all file and get the
source instance name of images, and then

71
00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:57.110
grab out these child image sharp and kind
of loop over them and show Gatsby images.

72
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.020
This is a bit of a contrived example
just to show how you would do it, but

73
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.014
the principle kinda holds the same we
would do this the same way If we were

74
00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:11.944
getting a group of files or if we
wanted to load a few different images.

75
00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:16.921
Or what we'll look out in the future
is when we don't know what's gonna be

76
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:21.418
on the page cuz we're building like
a template that gets reused for

77
00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:24.630
all of the data from a third party system.

78
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.490
That's when these page queries really
start to shine cuz we can Can't do.

79
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.980
Like I can't put if we look at the index.

80
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.780
I can't put variables in here.

81
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.770
If I tried to put
a variable in here it will.

82
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.269
It will tell me No.

83
00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.890
So, that's why you use static
queries until you can't.

84
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.718
As soon as you have some kinda variable
data dynamic data, you have to

85
00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:52.206
introduce page queries cuz they're the
only ones that can support variables and

86
00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:53.400
any kinda dynamism.

87
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.569
But this is not so
bad like we know how to query in graph QL.

88
00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.160
We just get to click around until
we find the thing we want in here.

89
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.110
That's why this Explorer is so great.

90
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.979
The Gatsby image data thing if
you're new to Gatsby three, but

91
00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.432
you remember what it was like to get
images in Gatsby two and previously,

92
00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:19.110
Gatsby image data is a is incredible
like what a great upgrade to the system.

93
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.260
For me, this is the whole reason
to upgrade to Gatsby three.

94
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.870
Like there's a lot of good things that
happen but this is night and day.

95
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.750
It's so nice to use.

96
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.523
So now that we've got
this Gatsby image data,

97
00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:35.819
what if we wanna do that in our MDX files.

98
00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.411
What if we wanna pull in our MDX,

99
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:43.960
let's say we wanna put something
into another blog here.

100
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.890
To do that we can actually do
almost exactly the same thing.

101
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.490
So I'm gonna grab this import here.

102
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.536
And then we can actually just,

103
00:06:58.536 --> 00:07:03.364
I also need to import graph QL.

104
00:07:03.364 --> 00:07:09.700
Oops, from Gatsby and then down here.

105
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.437
We can export a const called query and
that's gonna be graph QL.

106
00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:23.030
Now I already know what that
query is gonna look like.

107
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.570
It's gonna be identical to this one.

108
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.530
So I'm gonna pull it over but
instead of this one.

109
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.470
We're gonna call this one
The Smashburger query.

110
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.332
And this one is gonna query for
the Smashburger.

111
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:43.640
So this all effectively the same and
then we just do the same thing.

112
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.889
Let's get a Gatsby image in here, we're
gonna set the image to be get image and

113
00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:56.380
I can't remember who asked before but
about getting things from the file.

114
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.570
Like when we do this,
we've now added a data prop to our page.

115
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.765
We don't have access to the props in
a traditional way where we're not seeing

116
00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:09.810
a function with the props added.

117
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.280
But MDX just adds props.

118
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.250
So whatever gets passed to this page
will get stored into the props.

119
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.430
So we can do props data file.

120
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.530
And so that is exactly the same
as we did on this about page.

121
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.885
The only difference is instead of D
structuring data, it's like you did this.

122
00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:36.390
So that's the only measurable difference
is that in this one we can D structure and

123
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.880
in MDX we can so props data file.

124
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.130
Then as an old we'll say Smashburger on a
plate with french fries in the foreground.

125
00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:57.745
And if we save that,
head back to our homepage and

126
00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:02.477
navigate to another blog hey
look at that we've got ourselves

127
00:09:02.477 --> 00:09:06.665
a Smash burger right on
the page queried from graph QL.

128
00:09:06.665 --> 00:09:11.505
So the the work Flow is very similar,
between MDX and

129
00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:15.690
using it in a standard react component.

130
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.950
There's a couple of things to just
know like that props is set here.

131
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.641
That's if you've never seen that before,
that can be a little, un-intuitive but

132
00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:29.208
it's one of those things that,
a little bit of a curve with MDX, but

133
00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:35.000
things start to smooth out pretty quickly
and suddenly you're just often humming.

134
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.860
I really love this ability to write MDX or
write markdown and then drop in

135
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.090
a react component and then go right back
to writing markdown and not have to.

136
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.841
It would just not be fun
If I had to go in, and

137
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:51.700
I hate having to write
paragraph tags every time.

138
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.440
It's not hard.

139
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.580
It's not much.

140
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.989
But it just adds up, and

141
00:09:55.989 --> 00:10:00.170
it's just enough friction that I
talk myself out of doing the work.

142
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.560
And it keeps me from publishing.

143
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.960
It keeps me from writing.

144
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.990
So I really like this idea of
being able to only pull things in.

145
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.960
When I actually need something special and
otherwise I'm just writing content.

146
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.101
I really like that as a general flow.

147
00:10:17.004 --> 00:10:18.880
So that's a huge section.

148
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.200
We've just learned a lot about images.

149
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.186
And kinda digging into this going through
it again we looked at how to pull in

150
00:10:26.186 --> 00:10:28.040
images statically.

151
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.953
When you pull in a static image,
you are able to get it just by its path.

152
00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:38.500
Wherever you are you do a path to where
that image is in your source code.

153
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.910
Gatsby will do the rest.

154
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.449
It's gonna drop all this stuff in and

155
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:44.580
then you can figure it with
the placeholders width and height.

156
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.190
There's a full API that you can use,
we only looked at a few of the properties.

157
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.580
Honestly, you probably won't need most of
the properties most of the time there.

158
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.860
This is usually gonna be enough.

159
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.722
If you wanna use that in a MDX post,
you can install that remark plug in and

160
00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:03.250
just drop in markdown the way
that you always would.

161
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.073
You can query using graph QL that
shows up as a data prop any graph

162
00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:16.440
QL queries export ID As a constant
called query, we'll get added as data.

163
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.390
At which point you can
use this Gatsby image.

164
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.794
And if you wanna do something in your MDX,
it's the same flow,

165
00:11:23.794 --> 00:11:25.786
you export a constant called query,

166
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:30.170
you're gonna get props that have data,
and you can use that Gatsby image again.
