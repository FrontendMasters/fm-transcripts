00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.024
So Gatsby is showing us,

2
00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:05.680
it's building out everything that
we need to show these placeholders.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.240
It's giving us modern fallbacks,
it's giving us responsive images.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.820
And it's giving us a placeholder in
case of JavaScript not being enabled.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.200
And we didn't have to do anything.

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.420
We just had to put in this
sort of the static image tag.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.818
So that's kinda what I'm talking about,
why Gatsby was so attractive to me when I

8
00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:28.430
first got into it, it was because
specifically, I wanted this.

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.472
I wanted to be able to not
think about images but

10
00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:33.900
still get a great image experience.

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.563
So if I build this, let's just go
ahead and do an npm run build.

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.944
And then, once that's built,
we'll serve it.

13
00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:52.750
Almost, there we go.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.761
Now I can serve it.

15
00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:57.540
There we go.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.165
So we can open up this 9000 here and

17
00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:04.710
if I may actually slow down
the browser artificially.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
So I'm gonna switch this
over to be throttling.

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's make it fast 3G.

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.676
So the experience for somebody on
a slow computer if I come over here and

21
00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:21.190
hit Refresh is SEO it's got that that gray
and then the photo slightly comes in.

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.860
So that's the dominant color.

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.730
We basically said what is
the main color in this image?

24
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.063
Show me that, that can look really nice.

25
00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:31.202
If you've got a lot of photos on a page
like they all have subtly different

26
00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:33.330
colors, it can be really cool.

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.078
Another option that you have is actually,
let's play with a couple of these,

28
00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:44.492
but you can see in here, if I go in and,
let's disable JavaScript again.

29
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:51.730
And if I disable JavaScript, we're still
on 3G, you can see it, it kind of got in.

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.440
It's still got in pretty quickly,
we were able to get that image in.

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.209
And most importantly, note that even
though we didn't have the placeholder,

32
00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.770
it still didn't cause the content to jump.

33
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.912
Gatsby reserves the space of the image,
so that the content is

34
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:10.854
predictably the same size, and
that prevents that like content gender,

35
00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:15.740
we're not seeing I think they call
this cumulative layout shift.

36
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.633
We're reducing cumulative layout shift,

37
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.786
which is something that
makes Google very happy.

38
00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:27.560
So there we go again,
got that nice fade in.

39
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.590
Now, let's try another approach here.

40
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.418
I want to instead of using dominant color,

41
00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:35.880
I wanna use one of the other
ones let's use blurred.

42
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.237
And there's TypeScript autocomplete here,
so I just did Ctrl+Space, and

43
00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:45.680
let me see all these options,
so I'm gonna use blurred.

44
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.304
Alright, so let's do blurred,
I'm gonna build again.

45
00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:54.516
And the build should be much faster
this time because we just built,

46
00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.112
which means all of that work
that was done is cash, so

47
00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:00.780
this should happen much quicker
this time than it did last time.

48
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.471
Yeah, there it is 8 seconds
to build that site this time.

49
00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:04.367
It's NPM run serve.

50
00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:14.690
And now when we do this,
it's a blurred image that fades in, right?

51
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.755
So it's depending on the images,
depending on what you're trying to do,

52
00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:21.269
you can get some really cool effects here,
and

53
00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.450
let's just take a look at
the last one which is traced SVG.

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.122
This one got a lot of attention for
a while, and then I don't know,

55
00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:32.880
I think people just stopped using it,
I'm not sure why.

56
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.873
But I've always thought this is a pretty
cool way to do it, where it is going

57
00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:43.150
to take that image find the edges and
make like a two color traced SVG.

58
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.250
So it's pretty cool.

59
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.981
So let's build that,
there goes serve it, and

60
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:54.069
it's not that cool like
kinda takes the image in and

61
00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.918
does a little bit of jumping
around to make it look

62
00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:02.380
like it's kind of coming in soon.

63
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.850
I've always thought that
was a cool approach.

64
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.605
But anyways, for our particular purposes,

65
00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:11.022
let's stick with the dominant color,
I like that one.

66
00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:15.568
So I'm going to close this served one and

67
00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:19.452
let's instead go back to NPM run.

68
00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:23.160
So static images are great for
a lot of reasons.

69
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.230
And the first and foremost is that they're
very friendly to get started with.

70
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.960
All we have to do is import
this static image component,

71
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.692
and then use it like an image
like we can even take all this

72
00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:43.135
off if I slip this get run in there it is,
get out here.

73
00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:49.925
Okay, so I can take all this off,
let's just get rid of that.

74
00:04:53.323 --> 00:04:55.900
So no custom anything.

75
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.455
It just drops in that image,
properly sized, and

76
00:04:59.455 --> 00:05:02.210
doing all the things that we want.

77
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.571
I just wanted to have a little bit more
style, so I'm gonna add those pieces in,

78
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:09.190
and we get all the details that we want,
right?

79
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.790
That looks nice.
