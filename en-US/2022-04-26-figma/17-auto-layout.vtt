1
00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.558
I think that's like a really good
segue though, into our next topic,

2
00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:09.463
which is this idea of like,
auto layout, right?

3
00:00:09.463 --> 00:00:14.260
Which again, there's a question here about
like, copy figma grid to a CSS file.

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.560
Let's say let's see what
happens when we have inspect.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.078
I'm not totally certain what
we're gonna get but let's see.

6
00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:25.723
This one we don't seem
to have much in the way,

7
00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:29.660
this is the overall grid
in this case to work with.

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.872
So, I don't know if we can like get
as much help as we did with some

9
00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:36.139
of the other pieces for our grids.

10
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.836
Like we might be a little
bit on our own in this case.

11
00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:43.810
But let's look at something that is kind
of related to this idea of like flexible

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.123
things to figure stuff out, right?

13
00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:49.968
Which is kind of the theme of some of
the questions that I'm seeing right now,

14
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.610
which is this idea of like auto layout,
right?

15
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.525
Because we kind of got there
a little bit with our constraints,

16
00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:57.733
but we're still placing
everything in there.

17
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:02.506
But in my CSS we have a bunch of
things that will kind of like we

18
00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:07.291
determined some rules and
it lays stuff out for us, right?

19
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:10.282
Which is again like looking at
the chat right now theme of some of

20
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:12.991
the questions so
let's talk about a little bit which is,

21
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.260
let's say I wanted to
have a sidebar well like.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.140
I don't know I could grab some things.

23
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.240
And I could try to arrange them.

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.210
And I can use that trick that we saw
in the very beginning of the course.

25
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.800
And also just happened to
be distributed nicely.

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.860
And I can like tuck them in.

27
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.746
And if I wanted to switch these two we
saw with the dots I can go in like,

28
00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:36.290
grab that and
try to flip it with that one.

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.590
There are ways to do this and
I like don't it, right?

30
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.583
It's somewhat tedious.

31
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:49.684
Auto layout is incredibly powerful
especially if you're coming in

32
00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:55.678
with the like, paradigm of like a software
engineer who has been developing for

33
00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:57.029
the web, right?

34
00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.584
Like a lot of times we
just say some rules.

35
00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:04.322
Like, if your brain immediately jumps like
some of the questions were like about CSS

36
00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:08.523
grid, like if as I show you some of this,
your brain starts thinking like,

37
00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:10.339
that's like flexbox, right?

38
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.471
And nowhere in the figma UI is it using
the word flexbox or CSS grid, but

39
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:18.406
if your brand jumps to that,
that's like let it go there, right?

40
00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:21.338
That's a useful metaphor for our term for

41
00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:25.459
our case of like kind of figuring
some of these pieces out.

42
00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.841
So, If I can grab any given
frame that has some stuff in it,

43
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.508
I can grab on that doesn't
have stuff in it too but

44
00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:37.543
ideally this is more useful
if it has some stuff in it.

45
00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:40.001
And let's take a look some real quick,

46
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:44.410
we'll see that these are they've
got about three pixels between it.

47
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.050
Let's just change that to
really purposeful value of 17.

48
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.330
We would never purposely use, unless we're
just feeling extra chaotic that day.

49
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.770
But let's go with 17,
just to make a point.

50
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.444
And we'll grab this frame, we'll go
to design, and we'll hit auto layout.

51
00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:07.970
And you'll see that it's shrunk to
the size of these components, and

52
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.727
again this is where the flexbox
metaphor works, space in between items,

53
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.892
that sounds somewhat familiar.

54
00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:17.580
You can set the various margins and

55
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.499
padding around the items and
then like the alignment, right?

56
00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:27.494
Now in this case if you look,
I purposely set that to 17 before

57
00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:32.679
you can see by default figma did its
best to figure out the rules for

58
00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.240
how my auto layout should work.

59
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.400
It's like you add a bunch of things
evenly spaced out by 17 pixels.

60
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.350
You probably want a spacing of 17 pixels.

61
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.600
I don't, but it wasn't wrong for

62
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.030
assuming that because I did it to
be chaotic to make a point, right?

63
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.511
And so I can say, okay, 17 pixels.

64
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.346
If you can have some padding, right?

65
00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:56.581
You can kind of see that you can almost
I'm holding and dragging this case.

66
00:03:56.581 --> 00:04:02.114
You can adjust the padding too, you can
actually grab anything in here now,

67
00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:08.269
hold on let me grab one thing I could just
literally flip it around like this, right?

68
00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.212
Because it is saying like cool it's
effectively a flexbox in this case.

69
00:04:12.212 --> 00:04:16.473
This is a collection of things,
they all have like a gap of,

70
00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:19.553
how many pixels I have
it set to these days.

71
00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:24.158
And in this order with effectively
like a flex start I can this case

72
00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:29.098
are all the right size but so
this doesn't matter I can set the margin,

73
00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:33.645
effectively like it's very much
like what we think of from CSS.

74
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.180
And now if I add more items in so
I just like, grab settings,

75
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.705
hold on let me grab it and
I just drop stuff in.

76
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:51.708
And it'll all just rearrange and
lay everything out for me,

77
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.340
kind of like as we would
assume that it might.

78
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.163
This is powerful in a lot of ways,
it's powerful for a list, navbar menu,

79
00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.730
you could see it being really useful like,
cool.

80
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.095
We just wanna add a thing.

81
00:05:02.095 --> 00:05:03.797
I don't wanna sit there and

82
00:05:03.797 --> 00:05:07.867
like distribute everything all
over again every time I'm like,

83
00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:13.370
changing like a word or imagine like,
think about if you had to handle it out.

84
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.530
Your navbar and
then you just change one word, right?

85
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.209
Like yeah, maybe you got that grid
in those constraints perfect and

86
00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:21.200
everything works.

87
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.984
But chances are you're gonna have to
do some amount of like readjustment and

88
00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:24.990
that's no fun.

89
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.434
But it's useful and
powerful in a lot of other ways, as well.

90
00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:34.880
So, yeah, you can see and
you can adjust all of these things.

91
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.530
I'm just gonna play around some settings
as well just to kind of experiment.

92
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.660
I can change the direction.

93
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.028
Let's just move this real quick.

94
00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.050
And now it's almost like
a navbar in this case, right?

95
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.430
I just said instead of flex column,
flex row, right?

96
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.300
And it automatically lays everything
out just as I might expect.

97
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.310
I can go switch that again.

98
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.612
The other powerful thing,
right now it's sorta set to hug contents.

99
00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:04.206
That's when you saw it shrink down when I
first set that auto layout it's like cool

100
00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:06.337
the frame itself like just gives up and

101
00:06:06.337 --> 00:06:10.353
says whatever is in it that will
determine my width and height, right?

102
00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:15.630
Not unlike CSS but
we have a few other settings here I

103
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.803
can say it's actually got a fixed width,
right?

104
00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:24.392
And what we'll do here is
we'll go a little bit.

105
00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:31.010
And in this case you can see
that they're centered I can do

106
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.619
almost a flex justify start with flex end.

107
00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:39.495
I can also do space between where
it'll spread them out just like

108
00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:41.129
we would in flexbox.

109
00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.198
If we go into inspect, you can see that it
does in fact, in this case like it didn't

110
00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:51.119
before with our layout grids, it didn't
like try to figure that all out for us,

111
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.700
but in this case it is such
a similar paradigm to flexbox.

112
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.139
That in this case like, yeah, it will
actually give us at least the beginnings

113
00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.794
again, I wouldn't just copy and
paste it and throw it in there.

114
00:07:02.794 --> 00:07:07.300
But you can like again,
because like as I joked before, like,

115
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.649
who amongst us hasn't visited
that one CSS tricks article?

116
00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:16.150
Reminding us some of
the different terms in flexbox.

117
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.910
And so yeah, we'll go ahead and
we're going again, in this case,

118
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.930
I'm gonna just change it to column again.

119
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.680
Because now it's got a known width and
height and I can change in this direction.

120
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.910
And again, this is space between as
the setting that we have right now.

121
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.862
And again, I can like grab one more thing,
toss it in there and

122
00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:39.580
everything automatically readjust.

123
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.440
This is incredibly powerful.

124
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.310
Let me show you one more way
in which it is powerful.

125
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.100
Who doesn't like to make buttons?

126
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.216
Right?
One way that you might choose to make

127
00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:54.556
a button is you make a rectangle like,
y that like meme of like,

128
00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:58.750
there's the brain and there's like
eventually get to galaxy brain.

129
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.510
Basically, we're gonna do here, right?

130
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.398
So, I can make a rectangle and
I can put some words over it.

131
00:08:04.398 --> 00:08:07.030
That, I mean has the problem
of they're separate, but

132
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.110
like I'm better than
that I can group them.

133
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.980
I could do that.

134
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.980
I could put it in a frame together.

135
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.680
That seems fun, right?

136
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.139
The problem here is the rectangle
is part of the frame.

137
00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:24.395
So, like the next level
up is that I could make

138
00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:29.106
the frames background color that green,
right?

139
00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:32.307
But like I don't I wanna sit there,

140
00:08:32.307 --> 00:08:37.127
like I could set constraints
I could do that, right?

141
00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:42.518
I could like, okay, let's do this again,

142
00:08:42.518 --> 00:08:47.471
now as a frame instead
of a rectangle I can

143
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:52.718
say center it and
that will work it'll stay

144
00:08:52.718 --> 00:08:57.839
centered until I give it a very long name.

145
00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.590
Again, I'm gonna sit here manually
tweaking stuff over and over again.

146
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.400
I don't wanna leave like this.

147
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.430
So, what I wanna do is I wanna say,
hey frame, you're an auto layout now.

148
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.053
And you know what, like,
let's say you've got,

149
00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:18.720
I don't know 16, 8,16 and 8.

150
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.626
And just to make you
a little more buttoned,

151
00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:27.280
like we give you a border ready
still to give it a stroke as well.

152
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:34.619
But now, short name, longer name.

153
00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:36.618
Now we have a button that grows and
shrink even like so,

154
00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.740
auto layout is great if
you have a lot of things.

155
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.790
Auto Layout is really great for
just one or two things.

156
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.560
Now you can imagine if this
is a button with an icon.

157
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.111
Now it's two things, it's still useful.

158
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.121
It's kind of like what these are, right?

159
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:52.854
So, I can grab any given one of these and
say I can also hit Shift A.

160
00:09:52.854 --> 00:09:56.550
And you can see that I do need
to change this to like centered.

161
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.360
And I might say that like fill container
because it's in another auto layout.

162
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.475
Now this one is filling the width of
the fixed width frame that it's in, but

163
00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:10.350
then on width and height hugging and
centering its contents, right?

164
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.447
And so I can do that for all of these and

165
00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:16.120
then like effectively have auto
layouts nested in auto layout.

166
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.847
So, should explore a little
bit more in a second or two.

167
00:10:20.847 --> 00:10:26.095
One easier way if you find yourself making
a lot of buttons and you don't have

168
00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:31.427
button components yet If you can literally
just take just some text grab it and

169
00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:35.627
either right click and
say create auto layout or hit Shift A.

170
00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:40.315
It puts it in a frame with an auto layout
with some sensible defaults that you can

171
00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:42.100
now like change the color of.

172
00:10:49.287 --> 00:10:53.200
And like effectively create
stuff very quickly, and easily.

173
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.070
You can create a menu bar like we
saw before with the space between.

174
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.617
Auto layout is incredibly powerful for

175
00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:04.796
like having pieces that you can kind of
put in there and play around with as well.

176
00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:10.893
There are some limitations, which is
basically because layout grid is doing so

177
00:11:10.893 --> 00:11:13.532
much it supersedes, I'm sorry.

178
00:11:13.532 --> 00:11:18.530
Because auto layout is doing so much,
it supersedes any layout grids or

179
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.544
constraints that you have.

180
00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:25.600
It's rules basically are more important
than the rules of your layout grid,

181
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.260
your constraints or
anything along those lines.

182
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.387
Cool, so, there's a bunch of things
that you can try like what would be like

183
00:11:33.387 --> 00:11:35.140
to make an input field, right?

184
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.368
That's kind of like got some center text
it should theoretically align it to the to

185
00:11:39.368 --> 00:11:40.050
the left.

186
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.210
So, you can definitely check
out making an input field.

187
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.684
We'll do that a little bit more later.

188
00:11:44.684 --> 00:11:49.204
The other you can try out real quick just
to get your hands dirty with it is like,

189
00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:52.782
what would it look like just be
able to add another tab in here?

190
00:11:52.782 --> 00:11:55.040
Add another button in here.

191
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.120
Just put courses in here.

192
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.447
We could theoretically, if you think
about the way that the web works,

193
00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:04.559
unlike more other pixel perfect
designs that you might implement,

194
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:09.051
like this entire frame, could be just
a series of layoffs grids, right?

195
00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:11.140
Like, I wanna add another
course like cool.

196
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.423
There's my course, I wanna add another div
on top of this it should stack up just

197
00:12:14.423 --> 00:12:16.150
like it would with an auto layout, yeah.

198
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.320
&gt;&gt; Can figma do something like flex wrap?

199
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.966
&gt;&gt; No, I wish, you can't like have it
wrapped around stuff like that yet again,

200
00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:30.310
this is a feature that was relatively
new like somebody was using.

201
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:37.740
If someone new so like, hopefully, but
like at this present moment, you cannot.

202
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.525
So, what I want you to do is at this
point like go ahead, make a button,

203
00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:42.677
make an input field,
they don't have to be perfect.

204
00:12:42.677 --> 00:12:46.947
We'll make better ones with some of
the accoutrements in a little bit and

205
00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:51.572
see like, what would it be light implement
Is some kind layout grid in this UI.

206
00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:55.353
We won't do the like you can take this as
levels of extremely everything kind of

207
00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:58.845
lays out like a wood on the web that
would take us like more time than we have

208
00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:01.516
patience for watching but
like you could do it, yeah.

209
00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:06.463
&gt;&gt; Jut like sort of like a brugstor now
that we are talking about buts and stuff,

210
00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:10.502
does figma have any ability to
mock functionality in any way?

211
00:13:10.502 --> 00:13:13.647
Right like I think about a button
that you click and then it opens and

212
00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:17.412
modal would if I'm doing something like
a mock in figma what I have to create like

213
00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:18.490
two separate frames?

214
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.963
And this is where my button lives so
then this is the modal that would open, or

215
00:13:21.963 --> 00:13:25.005
can we map that functionality of
opening a modal onto the button and

216
00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:26.655
create a sort of interactive mock?

217
00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:30.043
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you a little
bit spoiler alert, oops, so

218
00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:34.363
figma has a full prototyping,
we can like jump between frames, right?

219
00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:37.661
That's like the first part
of your question, but

220
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:41.990
a relatively new feature I think
it's only like a few months old.

221
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.540
I don't have the timelines memorized.

222
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.750
But like is there's an idea
of interactive components.

223
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.740
So, you can actually say here's a button,
here's the buttons hover state.

224
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.803
Here's one's active say when
the hammer clicks on it, right?

225
00:13:54.803 --> 00:13:56.479
Here's a hole and also like,

226
00:13:56.479 --> 00:14:00.851
do an animation like the same way you'd
have a CSS animation between the two.

227
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:04.692
And then in the prototype when they hover
over the stuff will your hover state you

228
00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:06.768
can have it transition to the hover state.

229
00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:10.809
You can have, like zoom you have a lot
of that interactivity kind of like built

230
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.307
in by some stuff you will
move to another frame.

231
00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:16.930
Some stuff you may like choose if it's
like actually triggered by the click,

232
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.339
you might have a second
frame that has the modal up.

233
00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:23.839
But for a lot of the like this should be
highlighted when I mouse over it this

234
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.799
should like you know raise up and

235
00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:30.540
have a background drop shadow behind it
you can actually do a lot of that, yeah
