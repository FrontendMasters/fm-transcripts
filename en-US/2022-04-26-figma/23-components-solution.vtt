00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.636
One of the things that someone
mentioned in the chat which is and

2
00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.997
we should just address right
now before I forget which is so

3
00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:11.060
we have these overrides what happens
if you're like I did a bad thing?

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.652
And it's too late to
hit the Undo button and

5
00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:16.968
I would like to reset these overrides and
start fresh.

6
00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.891
You can right click.

7
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:22.135
And you said reset all overrides and

8
00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:27.876
it will go back in both cases to
the original set of components.

9
00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:33.377
So there is a takes the back sees for
overriding pieces of a component.

10
00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:36.349
One thing that just want to put in your
brain is this is an instance component of

11
00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:38.562
this main component,
that's part of the terminology.

12
00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:44.145
But weirdly, I can also make
a component out of a component, right?

13
00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:48.963
Cuz who doesn't like inheritance chains?

14
00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:51.994
[LAUGH] Yeah, we'll use that.

15
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:56.257
But first, let's go make an input field.

16
00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:58.717
Again, this is pretty simple.

17
00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:01.689
We might have done it before as well.

18
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:04.860
But we can go ahead and
we'll start with just some text.

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.319
And we'll say like, input value.

20
00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.171
Let me zoom in on that a little bit.

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.400
And I will go grab that and

22
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.221
I'm gonna change that to, it feels right.

23
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:27.475
They will go out this
making an auto layout.

24
00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:31.253
It's got some pretty aggressive margins.

25
00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:35.205
So we'll change that a little bit.

26
00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:38.526
And we'll say 10s of
1000s zoomed in a lot.

27
00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:42.486
Let's go ahead and say now unlike
a button which might be in the middle,

28
00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:44.994
we'll say this should
mostly be at the edge.

29
00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:46.132
Say 8 all around.

30
00:01:46.132 --> 00:01:48.909
We can adjust it if we
don't like it later.

31
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.779
And then we will go ahead and say,

32
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.071
this one actually has a fixed width.

33
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.576
So we can drag it into any kind of layout
grid and have it stretch across columns.

34
00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:02.633
And we can control the button.

35
00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.614
We're like,
just be the size of the button.

36
00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.347
And you could make a like
full width button that like,

37
00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:11.357
was a variation on the theme where this
one gives you the ability to like stretch

38
00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:13.752
it out versus the other
ones that hug the text.

39
00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:18.076
You can do all that but our input fields
generally speaking don't shrink to

40
00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.242
the size of the text in them and
grow as you type in them.

41
00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:23.779
I'm sure you could do that.

42
00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.743
Please don't do that.

43
00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:31.671
So go ahead and
give this one a stroke and fill.

44
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.949
Okay, doke, so
let's say fill this light color.

45
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.085
Love me a good border radius.

46
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:48.207
In this case, okay, that looks
mostly might make that 16 though.

47
00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:51.593
Nope.

48
00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:03.481
And the trick that we
haven't talked about yet

49
00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:06.761
is that we've all seen UIs before, right?

50
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:12.723
One does not just make a button and
an input field and call it a day.

51
00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:16.443
And one of the things I did kind of like
putting this all together I tried to do

52
00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.633
like every conceivable variation
of a button and input field and

53
00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:20.655
it was horrifying.

54
00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:27.394
Cuz like labels, error messages,
required, focus disabled.

55
00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:31.394
You can you can get like there are a lot
of variations here, so we're gonna need

56
00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.987
other than just making like one offs and
hoping they all stay the same.

57
00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:40.292
We're gonna need some
kinda like strategy for

58
00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:45.742
managing a growing desire and
system, right?

59
00:03:45.742 --> 00:03:47.690
But this is a fair start.

60
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.363
We'll also give it that same shadow
that I've given basically everything.

61
00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:56.231
And so we've got the beginnings here,
right?

62
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.728
Like a display or a empty one might
have some placeholder text, right?

63
00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:02.438
There can be a lot of
different variations.

64
00:04:02.438 --> 00:04:06.776
We'll learn how to do that in a second but

65
00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:11.497
first let's just start
with input field and

66
00:04:11.497 --> 00:04:15.327
go ahead Command+Option+K, and

67
00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:19.173
it got added as a component as well.

68
00:04:19.173 --> 00:04:22.181
This one is just under components
because it's not in a frame.

69
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.612
If however I renamed it.

70
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:33.756
You can see that automatically jumped
into its own little category down here,

71
00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:35.507
which is just my input fields.

72
00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:40.205
This is going to be super useful later
to have some kind of hierarchy not just

73
00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:43.571
a long running list of every
conceivable component.

74
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:48.387
Because we'll be able to swap between and
swapping between components in the same

75
00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.804
folder is a lot easier than
having to kind of navigate up and

76
00:04:51.804 --> 00:04:53.365
down a hierarchy as well.

77
00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.575
Cool.

78
00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:59.586
One of the questions is there a way
to clip the text of the width of

79
00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:04.217
the input is fixed and smaller than
the text so does not get out the input.

80
00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:07.944
So like if it gets too long,
a lot of times you're gonna have to adjust

81
00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:11.762
like you have that clip content so
like, of the frame itself, right?

82
00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:18.640
So here we can go I think this will answer
the question we'll hit clip content.

83
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.877
It's always gonna look some kind of gross
you can get really clever by like Having

84
00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:24.568
a gradient and stuff like that.

85
00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:29.510
So it like looks a little bit better,
But at least in this case,

86
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.050
it won't like expand outside.

87
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.916
Versus if I uncheck this box,
that's weight grocer.

88
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.226
So this is a little bit better.

89
00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:40.424
Like if I was gonna get real fancy,

90
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:45.729
I might have a very subtle
like gradient shape over here.

91
00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.069
So it looks like it kind of fades out or
something along those lines and

92
00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.864
you could have that clipped as well.

93
00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:53.566
It's probably not actually
that hard to do but yeah.

94
00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:55.348
&gt;&gt; What do you do to keep it from

95
00:05:55.348 --> 00:05:57.109
growing vertically cuz-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

96
00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.962
&gt;&gt; I did but I messed mine up somehow.

97
00:05:58.962 --> 00:06:00.354
&gt;&gt; Right on.

98
00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:03.349
So, in here you can have hug contents.

99
00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.945
If I have that as fixed height, then I
can do all sorts of terrible things.

100
00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:10.485
&gt;&gt; Okay,
now that was on like the outer frame?

101
00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:12.847
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the easiest way to do
this is to click the title and

102
00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:14.670
that'll be the outer frame at this point.

103
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.134
So I can change that to hug contents and
it will shrink down.

104
00:06:18.134 --> 00:06:23.206
And if I change that to like, on the width
as well It will, like with a button,

105
00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:27.809
grow and shrink in the width, which
is not what I want for an input field

106
00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:32.283
definitely what I want for a button or
maybe what I want for a button.

107
00:06:32.283 --> 00:06:35.644
The kind of one question
that might come up is like,

108
00:06:35.644 --> 00:06:39.643
what about a min width to my knowledge,
that's not a thing.

109
00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:42.958
So at that point,
you just go with a fixed and kind of,

110
00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.824
if it's fixed you can adjust it like once
you've thrown an instance on the page

111
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:51.385
you kind of left on a given
component by component basis.

112
00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:54.949
So you start out with a base set you can
like make it smaller you make it bigger

113
00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.226
with affixed with you
are in charge of the size.

114
00:06:57.226 --> 00:07:02.664
So main width is it kinda up to you,
right?

115
00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.876
All right, cool just making sure
that we don't get any more note.

116
00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:09.332
We are still hugging.
So let's change that to a fixed width.

117
00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:12.923
And there we go, cool.

118
00:07:12.923 --> 00:07:13.526
All right.
