00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:03.013
So real quick, let's just talk
a little bit about constraints.

2
00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:04.404
And these are super useful.

3
00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.136
They're more useful when we
get to layout grids as well,

4
00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:10.638
but they are also useful in this case.

5
00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:17.660
And they're term differently
if you do iOS development,

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.539
you have constraints in the UI builder.

7
00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.630
In CSS,
we don't necessarily have them as much.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.881
We have similar concepts, especially
when we're absolute positioning a div,

9
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.512
which we don't do that much, but
they're pretty easy to wrap your head

10
00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:37.621
around once you get the kind
of basics in place.

11
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.369
So by default, if we go in here and
we look at Design,

12
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:45.914
you can see that there's this
Constraints section over here.

13
00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:51.049
On average, generally speaking,
unless you've done something special,

14
00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.219
everything is constrained to the top and
left.

15
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.568
What does that mean?

16
00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:59.570
So if I grab this frame, and
I move it like this, yeah,

17
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.368
that behaves the way I expected it to.

18
00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:04.584
If I grab it from the top left,

19
00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:09.210
you can see that that box follows
the top left corner, right?

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.222
Its constraint is top into the left,
so if the top and left moves,

21
00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:18.249
it moves relative to the top and
to the left, right?

22
00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.452
At first, you probably didn't even notice
anything even though we've resized

23
00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:25.867
stuff before because that's just
kind of what you would expect.

24
00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:30.358
What would happen if I change
this to Right and Bottom?

25
00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:32.638
And now, I grabbed this frame.

26
00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:36.406
And now,
it stays when I move the top and left.

27
00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:40.497
But if I move right, it slides along
with the right edge, if I move down,

28
00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:41.920
it slides down, right?

29
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.037
So you can be like, cool,
I'm making something where those

30
00:01:46.037 --> 00:01:50.894
little things that sit down here that
then eventually open up a little.

31
00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:53.997
Would you help buying whatever
you're buying kind of thing, right,

32
00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.267
if that should always be
in the lower right corner.

33
00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:57.588
Let's say you're changed in the viewpoint.

34
00:01:57.588 --> 00:02:03.818
All right, did the iPhone 13 mock up,
now I'm gonna do the iPad Mini or

35
00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:09.867
what have you, but it should always
be in the lower right hand corner.

36
00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.335
You can just make
the constraint like that,

37
00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.941
now it'll follow that piece as well,
right?

38
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:19.424
But there's a few other kinds of
nuances here as well, which is,

39
00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:24.884
let's say hypothetically, you're making
a design that had, I don't know,

40
00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:30.040
a top bar, or navigation menu, or
those things along the bottom, right?

41
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.932
Any other things that we normally see even
if you look over on the course page that

42
00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.647
we've played around with before, right?

43
00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:42.893
What I would love to have happen
is that not happen, right?

44
00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:46.923
That's not what happens when
I implemented myself and CSS,

45
00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:49.461
that bar should take 100% width.

46
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:54.453
And as I expand the viewport, it should
also expand, and I do not want to have

47
00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:59.526
to manually adjust all these things every
time I change the size of the frame.

48
00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:00.678
So let's see how we might do that.

49
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.475
We go back here.

50
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.971
Let's imagine for
a second this was a top bar.

51
00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.129
I'll make it a top bar, check this out.

52
00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.702
[SOUND] Now it's a top bar.

53
00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:18.655
And what I would like to
happen is that not to happen.

54
00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:22.508
So we know how to do top and
left, we know right and bottom,

55
00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:24.404
everything's good so far.

56
00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.957
What about left and right?

57
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.898
[SOUND] Now it will actually change
this width relative to the frame.

58
00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.844
It's bound to the left and the right
edge of the frame and it will change.

59
00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:44.941
Grabber, I don't want the whole frame,
I just want that.

60
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.985
And let's give it a width of,
I don't know, 100.

61
00:03:54.945 --> 00:04:00.476
Unbound those for a second,
also make it 100 there as well.

62
00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:02.933
You also have the ability
to center something, so

63
00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.165
it should always stay in the center,
right?

64
00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.512
Those of us who have been doing CSS for

65
00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:12.222
a long time know that vertically centering
the div was not fun for a while.

66
00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:18.964
But so we can hit Center for
both the vertical and horizontal axes.

67
00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:21.375
And now it will, oops, I selected both.

68
00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:28.852
That went down to the bottom, so
we'll say that just stay with the top.

69
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.101
This should be the center.

70
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:33.030
And now, that one kind of goes with,

71
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.158
this one will always stay in
the middle somehow somewhere.

72
00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:39.565
Exercise to the reader, you can hit Scale.

73
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:45.929
And now, it will grow and shrink along
with the frame that it's in, right?

74
00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:50.609
So depending on what you're trying to do,
these constraints will allow you to have,

75
00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:53.339
in CSS ,or HTML, or
the web platform writ large,

76
00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.335
we would loosely use the word
responsive for, right?

77
00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:58.769
Take up 100% of the width
of your container.

78
00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:01.681
There's some other ways to do
this when we see auto layouts and

79
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:02.915
stuff along those lines.

80
00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:04.643
But generally speaking,

81
00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:09.430
this is kind of a way in your designs
to have stuff the way that you want it,

82
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.790
right, for all sorts of different kinds
of UI pieces that you might be building.
