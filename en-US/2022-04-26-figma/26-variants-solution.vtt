1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.690
So I've got some pretty little
radio buttons and some checkboxes.

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.340
Again, we can use the naming trick here,
as well.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.984
What I would probably do is I would
keep these as separate components.

4
00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:13.287
We'll kinda look at how
to do that momentarily.

5
00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:14.745
So I might even make a frame, and

6
00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.446
we'll see a little bit more of
the component sets shortly.

7
00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.655
We'll have a section dedicated to that.

8
00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.704
But let's do a sneak peek
because it's come up.

9
00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:28.005
As I do this, I will say that in the chat,
we're talking a little bit about there's

10
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:33.345
a lot of Reports that also,
if you get really carried

11
00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:38.158
away with too many variants,
Figma's performance slows down a lot.

12
00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:40.810
That checks out, it seems complicated.

13
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.177
We mostly, for our purposes,
have it as shared components.

14
00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.503
So I haven't felt that pain personally.

15
00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:53.285
For me, the ergonomics of having just so
many toggle switches that I had changed

16
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:59.262
every one got unbearable fast enough,
that I didn't want to continue like that.

17
00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:04.169
And I ended up losing part of a day
just undoing it before I made it too

18
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:05.671
far down that road.

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:12.390
But reports from the field say that
also that could be the case, as well.

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.078
So I might call this one checkboxes.

21
00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:18.208
We'll make another frame.

22
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.240
These probably got bigger at some point.

23
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.973
And we'll call this one Radio Buttons,
right?

24
00:01:23.973 --> 00:01:29.186
And what we'll see is this
will add organization and

25
00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:33.346
a hierarchy to our components, as well.

26
00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:36.670
We'll also see some other problems
that we'll have to solve shortly.

27
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.503
But let's start with a happy talk about
how to just make a bunch of variants in

28
00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:42.269
this case.

29
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.411
And we'll talk about all the problems
that we're introducing momentarily.

30
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.609
So I add these in.

31
00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.975
Again, I'm going to call this one

32
00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:57.849
One fun fact is, if a frame is
kinda just on the page by itself,

33
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.432
you get this little label on it, and
you can just click it and change it.

34
00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.364
If a frame is already nested
inside another frame,

35
00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.418
the name of the frame is invisible.

36
00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.323
And you're like, that's annoying.

37
00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:13.553
It makes sense, because otherwise, how
would you see anything in a new UI, right?

38
00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:15.096
I'm into it, but, yeah.

39
00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:22.702
So here we'll say Checked=True,
Checked=False.

40
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.350
And we'll do the same for
these two, as well.

41
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.075
These are just an auto layout
one with a label on it.

42
00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:36.199
We'll go ahead and
we'll say, also hit Cmd+R,

43
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:43.164
just click on hit Cmd+R, and
I can do Checked=True, no, False.

44
00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:45.440
That was a trick to see
who's paying attention.

45
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.630
And I'll hit Cmd+R, and
I'll say Checked=True.

46
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.725
That's what happens when you talk and
design at the same time.

47
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:58.570
And I could do the same for
the radio buttons, I'm gonna spare you.

48
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.285
We'll go ahead and
we'll create a component set.

49
00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:05.626
This one's now called Component 1,
just Cmd+R.

50
00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:08.188
We'll hit Checkbox.

51
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.887
It's under Checkboxes, so
you might just call it without label.

52
00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:16.868
This is a you decision,
whatever in your heart feels right.

53
00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:18.909
I can't do it.

54
00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.214
Checkbox Without Label.

55
00:03:23.214 --> 00:03:24.586
I don't know if I'm gonna move it.

56
00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:27.436
No, I can't.

57
00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:30.970
And here we'll go Create component set.

58
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.824
We'll call this one Checkbox With Label.

59
00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:41.248
One thing that I a lot of times do,
if I'm making these frames just for

60
00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:45.139
holding components is,
I don't have the time to sit here and

61
00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.141
try to arrange these in
a way that is pleasing.

62
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.091
Auto layout, and
just let it organize itself.

63
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:54.382
And I can drag additional
versions in there, and

64
00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:56.879
I never have to think about it again.

65
00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.383
Now, so

66
00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:02.356
we've got these checkboxes, let's go
over to my assets here under Checkboxes.

67
00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.365
That makes sense.

68
00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:04.712
That's a good place.

69
00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:09.318
So I can go ahead, and
because these have the same name,

70
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.965
I should be able to hit Checked.

71
00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:15.609
But if I wanna get rid of the label later,
it stays Checked.

72
00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.497
It's cuz those variants had the same name.

73
00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:24.915
So basically, we're on our way to both
having cake, as well as eating cake.

74
00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:28.351
Cuz what's the point of having cake
if you're not gonna eat it, right?

75
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:33.051
So as long as the variants are named the
same way, they will persist as you swap.

76
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:38.236
If I'm not mistaken, we can even,

77
00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:45.947
Let's find out.

78
00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:50.381
Pretty sure, yeah, the label will also
kind of persist and be remembered,

79
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.860
as well.

80
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.236
So you can basically have, like yeah,

81
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.913
could I have a whole bunch
of different things?

82
00:04:54.913 --> 00:04:56.660
I could tweak here With Label,
Without Label.

83
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.410
Could I make that a second toggle?

84
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.879
Sure, but this isn't bad either.

85
00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.733
And now I get both versions
that I could drag in, right?

86
00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:07.687
For me,
this is the best of multiple worlds.

87
00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:11.989
Now, one of the problems that we're
gonna have is, all right, this button.

88
00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:17.058
Again, rounded corners are very 2021.

89
00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:23.188
It is 2022, we're going with the more
Microsoft squared off corners, right?

90
00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:25.471
So let's go ahead,
we're gonna get rid of that radius.

91
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.914
Only that button changed.

92
00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:38.163
Okay, I'm gonna need to solve for
this problem.

93
00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:42.893
So let's go ahead, and
we need a better strategy for this.

94
00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:46.870
We had this idea of swapping
out the components.

95
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.639
What we kinda need to
do now is have a way.

96
00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.567
What I really wanna do, cuz this, again,
this isn't even a complete set of

97
00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.653
different buttons that we could have,
right?

98
00:05:57.653 --> 00:06:00.563
I've been in enough design
systems to know that there

99
00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:03.222
are more than however many
buttons are in there.

100
00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:07.640
24 plus another, there's 36 there,

101
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.575
but there's more buttons than that.

102
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:16.926
And so you could see that having
a way to have those changes persist

103
00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:22.290
over even all of my different
components would be great.

104
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.790
And to be clear, there's a certain
complexity cost here, right?

105
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.471
One would argue that if you had all
your buttons in the same frame,

106
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:39.180
and you got to the point where it's
I need to change the border radius.

107
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.824
If you keep all the main components
separate in its own file,

108
00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:46.980
you could just select them all and
change the border radius, right?

109
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.876
But in a long enough timeline, not having
this setup, because there's a whole other

110
00:06:51.876 --> 00:06:56.636
set of features that we're gonna see where
it's not having some place where you can

111
00:06:56.636 --> 00:07:00.332
make one change and have it affect
all the different varietals.

112
00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:02.188
Not variants, varietals,

113
00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:06.064
of a given component will bite
you at some point or another.

114
00:07:06.064 --> 00:07:10.969
So being like, I don't need this,
you might not, but you might.

115
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:14.450
So let's talk about how to, maybe,
think about this in a different way.
