1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
So let's jump to this
idea of shared styles.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.389
I've used some of these as I was kind
of just putting together the workshop,

3
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.008
cuz doing it myself and manually having
to change all the colors seemed terrible.

4
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:17.580
You can kinda see some of them that
I've used as I'm going through this.

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.559
I have this idea, that's not just the hex
value, but I have theoretically a set

6
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.039
of colors that I had predetermined
that I could just pick from, right?

7
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.194
Wherever you work, there's probably

8
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:36.416
a primary brand color, right?

9
00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:41.256
Twilio's was red, SendGrid's was blue,
so on and so forth, or

10
00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:43.105
is for both those cases.

11
00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.457
And so you have these colors
in these palettes, so

12
00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:49.212
you're not just kind of guessing at the
hex code or copy and pasting it, right?

13
00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:54.406
This idea that we would wanna have
some shared styles in this case.

14
00:00:54.406 --> 00:01:01.861
You can create shared styles for
really any of the following colors, right?

15
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.747
So we wanna use our brand blue,

16
00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:10.409
our primary button color blue probably,
so on and so forth.

17
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.969
Text, and you'll notice that we treat
a textile and a color separately, right?

18
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.088
This means that you can have different
font weights and typography.

19
00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:22.437
But you can also have text be different
colors, they're kinda two separate things.

20
00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:27.102
You can take a given piece of text,
you can set what font, what size,

21
00:01:27.102 --> 00:01:30.974
what weight, and
the color has two independent styles.

22
00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:36.109
That might feel a little tedious but
generally speaking, it's better.

23
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.533
You can also take those cool shadows
that you perfectly honed in,

24
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.593
as we joked about in the previous section,
and save that.

25
00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:47.104
So you can just like, okay, cool,
use the shadow that I used for everything.

26
00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:50.843
As we go through, layout grids,
which we haven't discussed yet,

27
00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.687
you can also save those, right?

28
00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:57.131
Cuz theoretically, there's probably,
for whatever app you're working on,

29
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:00.544
one 12-column grid that you're
using all over the place.

30
00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:03.028
You probably don't have that many
different grids that you're using

31
00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:04.175
throughout your application.

32
00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:05.761
You might have more than one,

33
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.877
but probably not bespoke ones
all over the place, right?

34
00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:12.465
And so you can kind of take
any of these things and

35
00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:17.312
save them into kind of effectively
variables or saved values and

36
00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:21.458
apply them to different
objects as you kinda go along.

37
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:26.058
And that's useful because then,
as soon as we kind of take this from

38
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:30.094
being a hard coded color and
associate it with like, okay,

39
00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:34.393
primary button blue, right, or
warning red or what have you.

40
00:02:34.393 --> 00:02:38.417
And then you're like,
we're changing the brand, right?

41
00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:42.496
We're no longer a blue company,
we're purple now.

42
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:47.212
You're hopefully in your CSS or your SASS
or whatever you had to CSS variable or

43
00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:51.798
something along those lines and
you just change the value and you're good.

44
00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:54.014
Ideally, for your designs,
you would love the same thing.

45
00:02:54.014 --> 00:02:56.140
I wanna change all the buttons,

46
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.114
everything that references the brand
color won't change at all, right?

47
00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.759
And we can definitely do that.

48
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.422
So let's talk about how to do it manually.

49
00:03:05.422 --> 00:03:11.472
And then one of my favorite quotes is
Larry Wall who is the creator of Perl,

50
00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:16.072
everyone's favorite programming language,
right?

51
00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:21.024
But his his quote is that the three
most important virtues of

52
00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:26.388
a programmer are laziness,
impatience, and hubris, right?

53
00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:28.990
And like I said before,
something is tedious,

54
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.209
you should probably not do it like that.

55
00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.464
So we're gonna set one style, cuz a lot of
times, yeah, I just need to set one thing,

56
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.155
I need to store this value,
I need to use it.

57
00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:40.588
But could you, this is even a very
limited color palette, right?

58
00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:44.960
I didn't even do the normal 50,
100, all the way to 900,

59
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.038
I even stopped at 500 here,
and only did 5 of every color.

60
00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:52.561
Could you make these colors one by one?

61
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.699
Of course you could, do you want to?

62
00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.467
No, [LAUGH] you don't want to.

63
00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:03.306
So we'll look at how to
automate that in a second.

64
00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:07.845
One of the questions that I really
love in the chat, is would it be

65
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:12.485
awkward if we name something primary
blue and then is now purple?

66
00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:13.946
Yes, right?

67
00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:19.145
The one thing I learned from people
who work on design systems for

68
00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:25.209
a living, and designers, is that
typically not just your primary color,

69
00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:29.156
but you tend to not name
the colors that are kind of

70
00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:33.598
meaningful in your application
by the color, right?

71
00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:39.951
So for instance, if your primary buttons
were all blue, and now they're purple,

72
00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:45.609
call it primary button blue,
that's gonna be awkward forever, right?

73
00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:49.966
A lot of times you just call it primary,
we give them meanings and

74
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:55.049
if we ever change the colors for those
meanings, and I mostly took this from

75
00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:59.834
console error versus console warning,
right, as the inspiration.

76
00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:03.689
But yeah,
normally you name it after their meaning.

77
00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.154
And then you can change the color,

78
00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:11.425
depending on what you need to do in
that case, brand especially, right?

79
00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:15.334
Generally speaking,
there are some connotations to the colors,

80
00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:18.210
green means go,
red means stop most of the time.

81
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.274
But brand colors might change,
acquisitions happen,

82
00:05:22.274 --> 00:05:26.434
executives change their mind,
stuff happens, right?

83
00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:29.689
So we tend to not name
them after the colors.

84
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.490
This is not an official design advice,
this is my personal opinion that

85
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.698
you're gonna get,
even though you didn't ask for it.

86
00:05:34.698 --> 00:05:39.642
I mean, technically there's
a question I can vaguely use that.

87
00:05:39.642 --> 00:05:44.362
What I tend to do is, for like my
actual UI, I'll have these warning,

88
00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:48.137
dangerous, success,
information, brand, right?

89
00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:50.542
But then in my general library,

90
00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.918
sometimes orange means a warning or
a danger or whatever.

91
00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:58.287
Sometimes I want something to be orange.

92
00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:02.391
If I wanted to given name to be orange for
a given reason, I don't wanna have to be

93
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:07.315
like, cool, it's actually gonna be warning
200 when it doesn't mean a warning, right?

94
00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:11.110
So for my just general color palette that
I have saved in my team library that we'll

95
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.380
look at later,
I tend to name them after colors.

96
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.286
And then as I'm putting down the basis
of the design that I'm working on,

97
00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:20.249
I will then attribute those
colors to their meanings and

98
00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.470
use the meaning in the actual UI, right?

99
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.574
But we're gonna do it with the actual
names that are not signifying any color.

100
00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:32.690
So again, if we change the brand
eventually to purple or whatever,

101
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.805
hot pink, you can just change that and
it's still the brand color,

102
00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:40.802
none of your CSS code changes, right?

103
00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:43.923
And none of your design
tokens change either as well.

104
00:06:43.923 --> 00:06:47.080
Because, yeah, if you use that
name as a variable in your code,

105
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.075
now you have the problem in both places.

106
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.443
But nobody wants that.

107
00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:56.097
All right, so let's just talk
about how to make a shared style.

108
00:06:56.097 --> 00:06:59.447
And then we'll talk about
how to do it at scale.

109
00:06:59.447 --> 00:07:04.846
So let's say hypothetically,
I had a bunch of these models, right?

110
00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:08.724
In fact, let's go ahead, I'm gonna
grab this, I'm gonna make, actually

111
00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:12.854
let's get it in place, let's do this first
and then I'll make a bunch of copies.

112
00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:16.904
Okay, if I select this frame here,

113
00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:23.114
you see I got basically two
shades of cornflower blue.

114
00:07:23.114 --> 00:07:27.983
There's the Crayola box, I had it as
a kid, it all come back to me now.

115
00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:32.649
That was the button that lets me
select everything that is that color.

116
00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.053
But what's this other one?

117
00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:38.534
These four little dots,
that obviously means style.

118
00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:40.193
I can click that.

119
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:44.177
And you probably, if you're just
using Figma for the first time,

120
00:07:44.177 --> 00:07:47.819
I think it just gives you fuchsia and
another color in there.

121
00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:52.756
I will show you how to change this and
update this later.

122
00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:56.765
But you can theoretically pick from
a color that you have in your palette.

123
00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.800
The chasis, iris is the other ones,
fuchsia and iris come by default.

124
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.810
So you can go in here and
you can pick one of these colors or

125
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.121
you can take the current color, hit the
plus button, and you can give it a name.

126
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.122
So I can name it,
let's call it cornflower blue,

127
00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.617
even though we said we weren't doing that,
we're gonna delete the style in a second.

128
00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:18.653
Cornflower Blue, Create Style, and

129
00:08:18.653 --> 00:08:22.324
now you can see instead of the hex code,
it is Cornflower Blue.

130
00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:26.338
And ladies, I don't,
what's the other clip?

131
00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:29.338
The hardest things in computer
science are naming things,

132
00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:32.585
cache invalidation off by one errors,
the two hardest things.

133
00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:34.889
Darker Blue.

134
00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:39.635
All right, so I've got those two,
and we got that white but

135
00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:40.906
we're not gonna deal with it.

136
00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:42.566
So I can grab this and

137
00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:47.267
now they all reference these
two styles that I just made.

138
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.368
We'll go ahead and make another one here.

139
00:08:51.368 --> 00:08:52.599
Zoom out just slightly.

140
00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.045
Move that sticky over.

141
00:08:55.045 --> 00:08:58.869
And now, let's say I was using these
colors all throughout my design,

142
00:08:58.869 --> 00:09:01.243
across all these pages,
so on and so forth.

143
00:09:01.243 --> 00:09:03.470
I can actually go ahead and either,

144
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.851
if I go the Inspect tab when I have
nothing selected or the Design tab but

145
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:11.503
I have nothing selected,
I can see here are all my styles.

146
00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:17.453
So I can say, okay, this blue, I'm gonna
hit these two little sliders here,

147
00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:20.082
and guess what we're going to be?

148
00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.501
It's kinda fuchsiaish, purpleish,

149
00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:29.835
you can see that changed
across all of them, right?

150
00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.201
And we can do the same for
the darker blue.

151
00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:41.528
Let's pick something obnoxious,
let's do a lime green, Right?

152
00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:42.803
And they can change across everything.

153
00:09:42.803 --> 00:09:43.472
Yeah.

154
00:09:43.472 --> 00:09:47.146
&gt;&gt; Does Figma give you
color contrast by default?

155
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:51.257
&gt;&gt; Figma does not, there are plugins that
you can install that will kind of let

156
00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.470
you select a given, I use Stacks,
I think it's not free.

157
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.261
But there's a bunch of free ones as well
where you kinda give a selection and

158
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.846
it will give you the double A and
triple A ratings for

159
00:10:00.846 --> 00:10:04.292
everything as well and you kind of
adjust that and figure it all out.

160
00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:08.347
Okay, so that's how we make one style, and

161
00:10:08.347 --> 00:10:13.401
I can do that for
individual things one by one, right?

162
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:15.635
That sounds tedious, right?

163
00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:19.984
I say it sounds tedious because
before I learn this technique,

164
00:10:19.984 --> 00:10:24.591
that's what I did for a while, and
I don't ever wanna do it again.

165
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.070
So let me save you that and
we'll kinda talk about how to handle this.
