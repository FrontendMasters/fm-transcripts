WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.837
So with that, this entire workshop
is gonna be taught about Figma,

2
00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.820
inside of Figma, using Figma, right?

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.725
So let's actually hop
over to just kind of,

4
00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:12.110
we'd spent all day in this interface,
right?

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.970
Let's figure out what's going on.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.587
Cuz this, maybe you're all
are better people than me.

7
00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:20.092
But typically,
what I do when I find a new tool is,

8
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.377
I just pretend that I know what I'm doing,
and then realize that I

9
00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:27.465
don't actually know what any of these
options are, what any of these tools are.

10
00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:31.449
And then find myself underwater,
and confused, and sad,

11
00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.720
usually before a deadline.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.040
So let's not do that.

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.530
Let's actually get the lay of the land,
understand what's going on here.

14
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.720
And that way we're coming here
from a place of confidence.

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.700
The middle part is easy.

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.839
The middle part is my design,
my user interface,

17
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.470
my prototype, my what have you, right?

18
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.408
That's done.

19
00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:55.873
We've got a quarter of all the different
kind of pieces here handled.

20
00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:59.201
Along the top, we have a toolbar.

21
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.998
Here, you've got a little Figma Menu
that has a whole bunch of options.

22
00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:06.678
We will dig into this over
the course of our day together.

23
00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:10.408
You've got two tools for
moving stuff and scaling stuff.

24
00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:15.834
Moving, moves things,
scaling makes things bigger and smaller.

25
00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.907
You can also make stuff big and
small with the Move tool, and

26
00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:21.321
we'll talk about
the difference in a second.

27
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:26.083
Probably, the most important tool that
we're gonna use today is this idea of

28
00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:26.678
a frame.

29
00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:31.790
A frame is kind of any kinda
container that holds stuff, right?

30
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.160
It's a div, right?

31
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.548
It's going to be the thing that
has other elements within it,

32
00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:41.280
obviously can have a width and
a height, so on and so forth, right?

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.758
In the same way that you would use a div,
or if you're more enlightened,

34
00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:48.475
a section tag or something along those
lines, or the correct semantic HTML.

35
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.782
It is the given container for
other things.

36
00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:56.268
So our screen when we get to prototyping,
that's a frame, right?

37
00:01:56.268 --> 00:02:01.268
It's very tempting to just go into these
other tools here and just draw rectangles.

38
00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:03.936
But rectangles are just squares,
they don't hold things,

39
00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:08.080
they're not containers, they're just
squares, and you will eventually be sad.

40
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.030
When I implemented this course page,
I purposely did bad things.

41
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.490
That's partially why it took me so
long, right?

42
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.473
It's actually a lot easier to go from
a screenshot to a Figma design, but

43
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.540
I was purposely trying to do it poorly,
and the bad way so

44
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.920
we could refactor it a little bit.

45
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.879
But frames are kind of the most
important tool that we're gonna use.

46
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.257
We've got a pen and
a pencil that we're not going to touch.

47
00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:37.691
The pen and pencil for drawing vector art,
which nobody wants to see me do, right?

48
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:39.436
Text, that seems important.

49
00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:42.146
Most of our UIs have some
amount of text in them.

50
00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:44.723
The text lets you type.

51
00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:49.220
We've got this kinda hand that we
can kinda move around, as well.

52
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.458
You can always hold the space bar and
move too.

53
00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:56.765
And then we've got some
commenting features, as well.

54
00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:59.276
Along the top, some of these
change as we're moving around.

55
00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.542
We've got the ability to make components.

56
00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:05.579
Components are reusable pieces of our UI,
right?

57
00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.971
The metaphor here is rather than
copying and pasting the same HTML,

58
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:14.330
all over the place, if you're using React,
for instance, you might make a component.

59
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.241
The word means roughly the same
thing in Figma, right?

60
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:22.850
Mask, again, is for creating vector art,
as well as subtracting, adding those.

61
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.372
You can also do full on
vector art in here, as well.

62
00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.536
You can, I can't, kinda thing.

63
00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:32.495
The tool will allow you to, again.

64
00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:34.806
You can see collaborators like
you might in a Google Docs, or

65
00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:35.998
something along those lines.

66
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:38.440
You can share it, so
you can see everyone using it.

67
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.833
You can give them editor access so

68
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.540
multiple people can work on
the design at the same time.

69
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.940
And they'll all see the latest and
greatest version.

70
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.967
You can also play through a prototype.

71
00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:49.800
So that's kind of everything
along the top bar.

72
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.325
Let's talk about this left side over here.

73
00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:54.812
So this is,
you've got a series of pages, right?

74
00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:57.391
As we work through
the content of this course,

75
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.829
where you can basically go in down
the list of pages one by one,

76
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.885
jumping around occasionally, but
kind of as we work through each page.

77
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:06.407
And then over here,

78
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:11.524
we have this list of basically all
of the layers on the page, right?

79
00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:15.255
So this is basically everything happening
on this page is kind of listed in this

80
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.753
hierarchy, this tree-like structure,
as well.

81
00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:20.820
If you hover over something,
you can kinda see there's a rectangle.

82
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.974
It's highlighted over here and
here, as well.

83
00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:25.177
Assets are the reusable components.

84
00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:26.670
So we're gonna make a whole bunch.

85
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.374
Right now the only thing kind of
included here is the raw materials I

86
00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:34.600
used to put together the course itself.

87
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.903
And then on the right side is
where the magic happens, right?

88
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.708
This is where we can kinda tweak and
adjust everything.

89
00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.375
So, for instance,
if I grab this tool here and

90
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:50.391
I select this frame right here, you can
see I change the x and y, the width and

91
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:55.490
the height, the border radii,
a bunch of other things as well.

92
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.471
We will spend most of the day learning
about everything in this right side panel,

93
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.570
so don't fret.

94
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.114
This is where most of the kind of
adjusting and moving stuff happens,

95
00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:07.070
really, in one of these
two views right here.

96
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.330
But there are two other tabs in here that
I just wanna kinda draw your attention to.

97
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.352
Prototype, so tools like Sketch,
for instance,

98
00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:18.230
in the past, I guess it's still
in the present, Sketch exists.

99
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.841
Would allow you to do the design and
you use Zeplin or

100
00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:24.624
something else to make a prototype
that you could interact with, right?

101
00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:28.731
This is usually really great because some
of the really best designers I've worked

102
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:32.794
with will make the full prototype, put it
in front of customers before I build it.

103
00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:36.926
Which is usually, yeah, I like to know the
thing I'm gonna build is something that

104
00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:38.415
people like, before I do it.

105
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.887
I mean, I'm happy to rebuild it over,
and over, and over again,

106
00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:43.879
as long as the paychecks keep coming.

107
00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.098
But if you start building
things people don't want,

108
00:05:46.098 --> 00:05:48.170
the paychecks tend to stop coming.

109
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.020
So it allows you actually create fully
interactive prototypes that you can kind

110
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.212
of put in front of users and
play around with.

111
00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:58.720
And then Inspect kind of is one
of your very good friends for

112
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.575
when you go to implement the design.

113
00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:03.754
It kinda gives you some of
the high level details.

114
00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:08.788
You could glean a lot of this information
from kinda going through here.

115
00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:12.146
But this is a nice compact way to just
let you see, okay, here's the width and

116
00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:14.690
the height of whatever I'm
currently building, right?

117
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.785
Again, the pixel width might not be
the most important thing is you implement

118
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:23.010
the WebView cuz it might be cool,
responsive design as a thing, right?

119
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.978
But it gives you a sense for,
at least the radii, the padding,

120
00:06:25.978 --> 00:06:29.170
and stuff along those lines,
helps you, at least, figure out what

121
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.113
you're looking at without saying they're
counting pixels or guessing, right?

122
00:06:33.113 --> 00:06:37.082
There are previous tools where I have
sat there and either zoomed in and

123
00:06:37.082 --> 00:06:41.518
tried to count the number of pixels or
just tweak the CSS, look at both of them,

124
00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:43.624
tweak the CSS, look at both of them.

125
00:06:43.624 --> 00:06:45.418
I don't wanna live like that, right?

126
00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:48.236
And so this panel helps you
in that regard, as well.

127
00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:53.608
And again, it will generate some of
the CSS, or if you are building for

128
00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:58.087
iOS or Android,
it will show you the SWIFT code, as well.

129
00:06:58.087 --> 00:06:59.598
I don't wanna look at that ever again.

130
00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:04.409
So yeah, next time you complain about CSS,
just switch to one of those other tabs,

131
00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.900
it'll make you feel better about the web.

132
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.374
And you can kinda see some of these
different things here, as well.

133
00:07:09.374 --> 00:07:14.380
Cool, so, layers and frames and
some of these kind of important pieces.

134
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.640
A layer is basically a thing in Figma,
right?

135
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.165
In JavaScript, we might say an object.

136
00:07:20.165 --> 00:07:25.411
Well, JavaScript has primitives, but
everything that's not a number or

137
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.670
Boolean or
string is an object in JavaScript.

138
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.438
So everything is basically a layer
in some way, shape, or form, right?

139
00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:37.212
So we could go ahead and we could just,

140
00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:41.571
let's start with a rectangle,
we could draw a rectangle.

141
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:45.831
If you just click,
you'll get about 100 by 100 rectangle.

142
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:53.070
You can click and drag and
create a rectangle of your choosing.

143
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.097
One quick thing is you'll notice
that after I draw the rectangle,

144
00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:57.870
it goes back to the Move tool.

145
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.723
If you hover over each tool here,

146
00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:03.507
you'll see that they have a very
easy keystroke that you can press.

147
00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:10.495
So if you wanna get back to the rectangle
tool, that's R, the frame is F, move is V.

148
00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:13.473
I don't make the rules here,
I just have to tell you about them.

149
00:08:13.473 --> 00:08:16.970
But the rectangle is R,
that makes a lot of sense.

150
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.140
So if I can just drag, and that's fun.

151
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:27.630
I can also hold Shift and drag and
I will get a evenly spaced out one.

152
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.458
If you start dragging, you're like,
I actually need one that's equal,

153
00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:32.233
you can start just holding
Shift at that moment and

154
00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:34.190
it will snap to one that is
of equal width and height.

155
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.330
What happens if you hold down
Option while drawing one?

156
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.605
Let's see.

157
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:42.332
You'll see that it kind of
grows not just from the top and

158
00:08:42.332 --> 00:08:45.459
left down, but in both directions.

159
00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.470
Option on MacOS, Alt on Windows.

160
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.190
Let's hold them both down.

161
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.795
And you can see that it's both even and

162
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:57.840
growing in every direction
at the same time.

163
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.590
And if you started drawing in the wrong
space, actually, let's go with that.

164
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.370
You can hold the Space bar and
move it around.

165
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.330
And, yeah,
some combination of all these things.

166
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.056
And depending on how,
if you're a guitar player,

167
00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:17.166
maybe you can hit all the keys all at
once, and find new fun combinations,

168
00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:20.730
but that's the kind of high level there,
as well.

169
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.077
Selecting works just
like you think it might.

170
00:09:23.077 --> 00:09:25.120
You can delete stuff, as well.

171
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.590
If you mess up, you can kind of change
any of the properties along here also.

172
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.250
So let's check this out.

173
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.789
Like we said, a lot of these will give
you proportion, you can hold Space, so

174
00:09:36.789 --> 00:09:38.130
on and so forth.

175
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.920
But when you have the Move tool,
you can grab it, you can move it around.

176
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.710
You'll notice some guides
are trying to help you out.

177
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.449
We're gonna talk a little
bit more about alignment.

178
00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:51.109
If you find yourself slamming on the left
or right key, to try to get stuff into

179
00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:56.004
the right place, let's talk cuz there
are probably better ways to handle that.

180
00:09:56.004 --> 00:09:58.850
And we will talk over the course of this,
as well.

181
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.902
All right, so

182
00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:04.720
creating a frame is basically
the same as creating a rectangle.

183
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.381
So this time we just hit the F key and
we can draw this frame.

184
00:10:08.381 --> 00:10:11.159
And you can see this frame has
a white background by default.

185
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:17.406
If you draw it inside an existing frame,
however, it will be transparent.

186
00:10:17.406 --> 00:10:19.920
So you can draw frames,
you can put frames inside of frames.

187
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.512
You can see that when I
put a frame in a frame,

188
00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:25.850
we get this nested structure
on the sidebar, right?

189
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.990
Rectangles will just overlap.

190
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.684
There's no idea of having a rectangle
inside of a rectangle, it's just a shape.

191
00:10:30.684 --> 00:10:35.425
Other than getting started for
a button or an input field,

192
00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:41.054
as a UI developer, you probably
almost always want a frame, right?

193
00:10:41.054 --> 00:10:43.883
But the rectangles are there if you
need to do a particular shape or

194
00:10:43.883 --> 00:10:47.502
if you're trying to put together some kind
of logo or something along those lines.

195
00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:50.845
Like I said before, you can use them to
get started with buttons or input fields,

196
00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:52.925
or something where it is
the shape of a rectangle.

197
00:10:52.925 --> 00:10:57.062
But you're probably gonna end up
turning into a frame, eventually.

198
00:10:57.062 --> 00:11:01.020
All right, so, yeah, we talked
about all of these different facts.

199
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.440
So you can move stuff, as well.

200
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.870
So Select Layers, there's a bunch
of options that you have here.

201
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.026
You can hold Shift to select
multiple things at the same time.

202
00:11:10.026 --> 00:11:14.407
If there's a layer inside of a layer
that you need to get to, at first,

203
00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:18.440
you might end up with just the overall,
the big box in this case.

204
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.355
But if I really wanted
to get that text layer,

205
00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:26.060
double clicking will kind of drill
down into the nested layers, right?

206
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.714
So first click,
if you are hovering over something, and

207
00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:32.583
we'll kind of see this a little bit later,
but I just wanna put it in your brain now,

208
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:35.920
that way when I repeat it,
we've got something to hook onto.

209
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.222
If you're trying to select something like,
okay, this frame is clear, I wanna

210
00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:44.671
select it, but I'm not getting it, holding
Cmd will always kind of like help you.

211
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.444
Cmd, or I guess, Ctrl on Windows,

212
00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:49.354
will help you get directly to
whatever your mouse is over.

213
00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:53.024
So you can either skip the double
clicking, or if you have a hard time like,

214
00:11:53.024 --> 00:11:56.605
hey, this thing is transparent and
my mouse is kind of going through it.

215
00:11:56.605 --> 00:12:00.991
You can hold Cmd and
it will help you get to it a lot easier.

216
00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:05.350
All right, so we have a bunch of fun
ways to kind of change sizes and

217
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.415
align objects, as you saw before,
like clicking and dragging.

218
00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:12.269
They will try to be some help here.

219
00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:14.810
And that'll work.

220
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.416
The other thing that you can do is,
you can adjust these numbers.

221
00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:25.040
However, if you're like I'm too tired for
basic arithmetic.

222
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.053
One thing that you can do is, let's say
if I wanted to move this 64 pixels,

223
00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:32.790
let's say 63 pixels,
that way it's not as easy for me, right?

224
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.590
I could sit there and
I could do the math in my head.

225
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.175
I could pull out a calculator,
or I can just say plus 63 and

226
00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:44.380
hit Enter, and
it will move 63 pixels, right?

227
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.978
Where this is also super interesting
is if I have multiple things picked,

228
00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:49.730
you'll see it says mixed, right?

229
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.570
Cuz there's a lot of x's and y axes here.

230
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.023
This will still work.

231
00:12:56.366 --> 00:12:59.396
It'll move everything 100 pixels.

232
00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:03.119
When we get to the size of something,
let's say I wanna take this image,

233
00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:07.596
you can also go to the width, yeah, I can
add numbers, I can subtract numbers, yeah.

234
00:13:07.596 --> 00:13:09.818
&gt;&gt; Can you do percents with that or
is it just pixel?

235
00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:11.186
&gt;&gt; That was the best question ever.

236
00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:15.179
[LAUGH] I can also do percents
with that [LAUGH], all right?

237
00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:20.993
So I can type in 200% to the width,
and it will double the width, right?

238
00:13:20.993 --> 00:13:24.169
So you can kind of like most,
you can do multiplication if you want,

239
00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:25.560
you can do division.

240
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.690
It all works the way you
think that it works.

241
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.480
There are some kinda tools for
aligning things, as well.

242
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.156
Like I said, you can just sit there and
try to get it right.

243
00:13:37.156 --> 00:13:42.368
One other quick, as long as we're holding
down different keys while we're doing

244
00:13:42.368 --> 00:13:47.367
stuff is, sometimes you're trying to
get just stuff on the x-axis, right?

245
00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:50.227
These trackpads are really
good these days, and

246
00:13:50.227 --> 00:13:55.220
you're worried that you might
accidentally move a pixel north or south.

247
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.051
You can hold Shift and
you'll only kind of move along one axis.

248
00:13:58.051 --> 00:14:01.922
Unless you really try, and it will
jump to the next thing it snaps to.

249
00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:05.930
But it will kinda keep it straight
along a given axis, as well.

250
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:11.913
You can also grab two things, and
you've got these tools up here.

251
00:14:11.913 --> 00:14:15.397
So if let's say,
I wanted them kind of on the same x-axis.

252
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:20.357
I could either have them aligned in the
center and they'll kind of both move, so

253
00:14:20.357 --> 00:14:23.331
they share the similar
kinda horizontal axis.

254
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:27.280
I can align them to the topmost one.

255
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.580
I can take these and
I can align them this way, as well.

256
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.759
One of the things Figma will try
to help you with, if it can,

257
00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:40.082
you'll notice that if it's things like,
hey, these are a bunch of objects that

258
00:14:40.082 --> 00:14:43.661
are almost spaced out properly,
you go ahead and hit that button.

259
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:47.866
One of the things that we'll see later,
but it's showing now, so

260
00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:52.914
I'm just gonna show you is, you have
these circular dots here and these lines.

261
00:14:52.914 --> 00:14:56.103
These are when Figma has kind of,
once you have at least three objects,

262
00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:58.241
it's hard to tell about
even spacing with two.

263
00:14:58.241 --> 00:15:00.837
With three, you can kind of figure
out what the spacing should be.

264
00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:04.850
And once they're evenly spaced,
you can kind of adjust them both.

265
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.880
The other thing you can
do is grab the circle.

266
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.426
And if you hold Cmd or
I think Ctrl on Windows,

267
00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:13.570
you can begin to swap them around,
as well.

268
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.210
So, hey, this was the topmost one,
I just wanna flip them.

269
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.570
You can do that also.

270
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.010
Yeah, and so yeah, and
then there's tidy up which is, again,

271
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.985
it tries to do both the horizontal and

272
00:15:23.985 --> 00:15:28.030
the vertical and just arranging
everything in a way that makes sense.

273
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.790
Will it always get it right every time?

274
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.933
Probably not, especially if you have
things that are roughly all the same size

275
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.994
and should have been in a grid to begin
with, you'll probably get it right.

276
00:15:36.994 --> 00:15:40.887
Here, I've got various different images of
different sizes and different layers and

277
00:15:40.887 --> 00:15:42.070
stuff along those lines.

278
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.216
It did a pretty good job.

279
00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:48.364
It'll get you most of the way there, and
then you can kinda do the rest by hand,

280
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.426
and kind of adjust it a little
bit more manually if you need to.

281
00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:57.514
Some of these options are here as well,
as you can see in this lovely screenshot.

282
00:15:57.514 --> 00:16:00.683
And you can kind of pick
whichever one you wanna use.

283
00:16:00.683 --> 00:16:02.550
And again, it will try to do its best.

284
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.452
Again, with very normalized stuff,
it works better.

285
00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:07.219
It's kinda like working with data, right?

286
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:09.939
When your data is normalized,
it's easier to process.

287
00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:13.557
The same thing kind of applies here,
as well.
