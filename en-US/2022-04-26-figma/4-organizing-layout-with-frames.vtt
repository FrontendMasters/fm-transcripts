1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.825
All right, one other tool that is
useful is we talked a little bit about,

2
00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:10.790
there was move and then resize,
or move and scale rather, and

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.775
you didn't really see me use scale.

4
00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:17.395
Now for things like a rectangle,

5
00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:21.929
it's basically the same thing, right?

6
00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:22.589
I move it.

7
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.340
It's now a bigger rectangle,
that feels like scaling, right?

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.179
But what happens if I grab
something that has text in it or

9
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.312
something along those lines?

10
00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:35.750
Well, it'll change
the bounds of the frame.

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.234
But it'll leave all the texts
the same size, right?

12
00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.624
Scale is like no,
you weren't listening to me, right?

13
00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:46.986
What I really wanna do is I
want to make the thing bigger.

14
00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:51.681
So hit the Scale tool, it'll actually
scale the type as well, right?

15
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:54.516
And so
you can kind of do both in this case.

16
00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.284
So yeah, it's like no, I don't wanna
change the bounds and refill the text,

17
00:00:58.284 --> 00:01:00.855
I literally want to bigger
eyes everything, right,

18
00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.645
that is when you pull the Scale tool.

19
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:08.699
Obviously, the key for the Scale tool is,
you guessed it, the letter K.

20
00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:15.830
I don't make the rules here,
I just have to tell you about them, okay.

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.508
So the other thing that we
are going to do in this course,

22
00:01:19.508 --> 00:01:24.284
it'd be really great if we spent the day
together, and I showed you how to

23
00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:29.409
start from a perfect empty Figma and
create the correct way to do everything.

24
00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.681
And that would be wonderful
until the first time you either,

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:37.000
we can blame other people and say until
we receive somebody else's Figma file.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.594
And it's not using some of these
practices and then you're like,

27
00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:44.384
now you're just sad and resentful, but

28
00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:50.310
we all know who everyone's least favorite
engineer is, right, you six months ago.

29
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.764
You six months ago racked up some tech
debt that current you has to deal with.

30
00:01:56.764 --> 00:01:58.857
So let's look about how to take a design.

31
00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:04.226
As I mentioned before, I mocked this up,
but I did bad things, right?

32
00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:09.295
When I say there's no concepts of frames,
there's a few frames in here for

33
00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:14.862
where doing it the bad way was so tedious
that I couldn't take it anymore, right.

34
00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:20.428
And so for some of the buttons,
they're technically frames in this case.

35
00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:25.557
But what I wanna do is show you a few
ways you can begin to take something

36
00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:30.439
that isn't set up great and
begin to bring order to the universe.

37
00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.659
And we won't take
everything we learned and

38
00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.485
apply it to this cuz it's just
tedious in its own right.

39
00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:37.391
But we'll take a few of these concepts so

40
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.361
you can kind of figure
out how to apply it.

41
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.465
We're not gonna get it all
the way to perfection.

42
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:45.781
But we'll kinda use it as
a case study as we go through.

43
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.285
So like I said,
there's no real concept of layers here,

44
00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.703
of grouping in any way, shape or form.

45
00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:56.410
I at the very least named the layers for

46
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.125
my own sanity, but that's about it.

47
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.070
So there's a few things
that we can do here.

48
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.927
So for instance,
let's say I wanna move this card.

49
00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:10.603
Right now it's real hard because
nothing has any sense of grouping or

50
00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:12.385
hierarchy to it, right?

51
00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:15.125
And this is both sad to design with.

52
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:19.477
And sad if hypothetically you're
a front end engineer who receives this,

53
00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:24.321
cuz then you basically have to reverse
engineer the component hierarchy, right?

54
00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:28.782
We can argue that getting some of
these hierarchy and organization and

55
00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:32.864
instructional pieces right into design,
if you're doing it,

56
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:36.656
it helps future you the engineer
implementing it, right?

57
00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:41.894
Or, there's some old Figma around,
your current designer is great.

58
00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:42.949
Everyone knows that.

59
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.633
But maybe the previous designer wasn't,
right, and

60
00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.326
you still have that design
that you're working with.

61
00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:49.720
And you're the one implementing it.

62
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.581
It's helpful for you, at least you to be
the one that brings order to this as well,

63
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:55.085
right?

64
00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:58.415
And like I said, I started using this
tool at work but then eventually,

65
00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:02.022
on side projects and other things, instead
of like, you get an idea for a side

66
00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:05.797
project and you start writing code and
then you realize your layout is terrible,

67
00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:08.444
you start tweaking stuff by hand,
this is a lot easier.

68
00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:12.156
So how do we bring some order to this?

69
00:04:12.156 --> 00:04:16.881
Well, for some of these pieces,
we could actually just select, and

70
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.547
like I said before,
we can hit Command+Option+G,

71
00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:25.037
and now I can move this thing around
as one kinda contiguous unit.

72
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:30.786
Now you might imagine that you could
probably make sub frames in here as well,

73
00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:31.409
right?

74
00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.461
Chances are that I wanna
maybe move the name and

75
00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:36.894
the company around at the same time.

76
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:41.149
So you could theoretically
Command+click and hold Shift and

77
00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.614
create additional frames as well.

78
00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:45.613
I'll do one here.

79
00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:48.796
And I could make that a frame, so now I
can move this around within the balance.

80
00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:53.978
Also, kind of in the same way that
you would look at a JPEG of a UI and

81
00:04:53.978 --> 00:05:00.602
in your front end engineer brain try to
reverse engineer the component structure.

82
00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:05.439
Those neural pathways are super helpful
right now, right, cuz it's the same idea.

83
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.891
And frankly, I would be lying to you if I
said that I didn't sometimes just do this

84
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:13.442
as I'm thinking about the architecture
of a UI as well, right?

85
00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:17.332
Looking at it, even before Figma,
you draw some boxes around some stuff,

86
00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:21.533
you think about, what is the component
structure before you start digging a hole

87
00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:23.845
of tech debt as you just
start writing code.

88
00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:28.039
Stopping and thinking and
breaking stuff down is super useful.

89
00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.921
So there's a bunch of stuff, we can grab,
for instance, hold Shift and

90
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:38.456
we can grab a few different things here as
well, and see if we got everything here.

91
00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:42.774
And one of the ways to check is just to,
see, I missed something, grab all of that,

92
00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:45.576
put in a frame, and
now I can move this around as well.

93
00:05:45.576 --> 00:05:48.524
The other thing that we could do is,

94
00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:53.636
there's some cases where this
background or even over here,

95
00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:58.651
if I wanted to basically eventually
move both the heading and

96
00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:03.990
the search field, let's say this
is a contiguous unit of my UI.

97
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.282
There's no even implicit box
rectangle that this is over.

98
00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:09.957
This, before I made a frame,

99
00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:13.177
was just a rectangle that had
some texts just on top of it.

100
00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:17.030
When I turned it into a frame, there's
an invisible box that the rectangle is in

101
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.343
with everything else
that I'm moving around.

102
00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:21.396
Eventually I probably
delete the rectangle and

103
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.249
change the background color of the frame.

104
00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.747
But we have this other issue here which
is, behind these two cards, if I wanted to

105
00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:32.267
move this entire section around,
that's just the iPhone background, right?

106
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.074
There's nothing for
me to kinda grab on to here.

107
00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:40.375
The super interesting thing is if
you just grab, you hit the F key and

108
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:44.565
you kind of just draw where
you wish there was a frame.

109
00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:47.119
I wish my code worked like this, right?

110
00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:50.729
I'm just gonna write the code that I wish,
like APIs, right?

111
00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.841
I'm gonna pretend I have the APIs that I
wish the backend engineers gave me, right?

112
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:59.469
It doesn't work for engineering, but
it does work in Figma in this case.

113
00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:05.587
You can kinda draw the box around it,
and you'll see in this case that it,

114
00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:10.816
let me see, did I get it right,
yep, that it kind of implicitly

115
00:07:10.816 --> 00:07:16.366
put everything that I ensnared in
that frame inside of it, right?

116
00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:18.729
And so
these things were not in the same frame,

117
00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.893
there was no real common rectangle
that they were in front of.

118
00:07:21.893 --> 00:07:28.166
I just drew a square around both of
them and I got a mostly accurate,

119
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:35.240
actually completely accurate frame
where there was none before, right?

120
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.402
And like I said, we can keep going
with this, I won't belabor the point.

121
00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:43.195
In cooking shows where they have,
they show you how to make a turkey.

122
00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:47.263
And then there's one that they pull out
the oven four seconds later, right,

123
00:07:47.263 --> 00:07:48.778
as if time elapsed, right?

124
00:07:48.778 --> 00:07:53.429
We have one that's kind of all parted
out that we can kinda use as well, but

125
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.940
this technique works.

126
00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.365
And again, you can either take existing
things, select them all, hit Cmd+Option+G.

127
00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:05.157
Or when you don't have anything to work
with, like again here, if I wanted to

128
00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:09.875
kind of zoom in a little bit, I can see
like there's a difference there, and

129
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:12.639
it will snap to like
where other shapes are.

130
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.928
But these are now implicitly
inside of a frame, and

131
00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:19.370
I can kind of begin to draw out and
componentize my UI,

132
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.752
which is again helpful if you're
the one maintaining this design.

133
00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:27.608
Also helpful if you wanna use any
of those measurement tools and

134
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:31.699
you didn't have the right kind
hierarchy and structure, right?

135
00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:37.007
Kinda like when HTML has no real divs or
anything and you can't move stuff around.

136
00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:41.069
You can kind of bring order to some of
the chaos that in this case I made but

137
00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:44.526
sometimes you've inherited,
you can kinda pull this in and

138
00:08:44.526 --> 00:08:47.070
begin to bring some
structure to it as well.
