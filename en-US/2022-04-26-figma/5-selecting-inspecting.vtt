00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.669
Let's do one last little thing
about inspecting stuff and

2
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.940
figuring out how to select
different things, right?

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.820
Cuz sometimes you're like, okay,
I need to get all the buttons.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.476
But again, we haven't brought
any order to that yet, so

5
00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:21.380
how do I get, or I need to change
all of the red boxes here.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.869
Could I hold Shift and
select them one by one?

7
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.300
I could, that's a thing that I could do.

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.700
I don't want to, but
it's a thing that I could do.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.698
There's a bunch of ways that
we can go about doing this.

10
00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:39.200
So I could grab one of these.

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.680
I could go up to this Figma menu, I could
Edit, select all with the same fill.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.660
We'll grab all of the boxes that
have the same fill color, right?

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.773
That's super useful.

14
00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:58.378
The easier way to about doing
this is if you go and select,

15
00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:01.157
and this is also useful
if you get a design and

16
00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:05.085
you're trying to figure out what
the CSS needs to be, right?

17
00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:08.194
You're like,
what are all the colors happening here so

18
00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:10.982
I can make either SAS variables or
CSS variables?

19
00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:16.426
You can actually go ahead and
see all the hex code colors and

20
00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:20.998
begin to set up your
variables in your CSS or SAS.

21
00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:25.230
You can also, for any one of these,
hit that little target.

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.053
And now I will have just the ones
that are that color as well.

23
00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:33.345
So that's a super useful way of selecting.

24
00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:36.025
So I wanted to get for instance,

25
00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:41.200
I would just grab an entire frame,
so I command clicked on it.

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.720
I can see all the colors that
are being used in there.

27
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.345
And if I just wanted to get these
yellow circles and delete them,

28
00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:50.600
I could do that as well, right?

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.402
These are the things that,
I think this is true for

30
00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:56.415
both engineering as well
as using Figma for designs.

31
00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.380
In a lot of cases,
if something feels tedious and

32
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.316
painful, it probably is and you probably
don't need to do it like that, right?

33
00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:09.840
Nurture that sense that there's
a better way to live your life,

34
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.660
and that there's probably
an easier way to do this.

35
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.170
So yeah, we talked about selecting and
adjusting multiple layers.

36
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.943
We saw that we could see all
the colors in the sidebar as well.

37
00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:26.399
The other thing that we kind
of mentioned earlier is,

38
00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.773
we've got this Inspect panel, right?

39
00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:33.305
And Inspect will kind of do
some interesting things here,

40
00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:37.414
which is it helps you as you receive
this design to kind of parse out,

41
00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:40.100
how am I gonna implement this, right?

42
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.140
At least give you the initial inspiration.

43
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.755
So if I go grab this frame,
as we saw before.

44
00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:51.187
So this is what I use Figma for
a lot, even when I'm not supposed to.

45
00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:56.540
Don't tell anyone, which is, I will never
remember the CSS syntax for box shadows.

46
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.411
I've been doing this now for longer
than I care to admit, like a decade and

47
00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:01.620
a half longer.

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.572
I will never remember the HTML tag for
putting a CSS stylesheet in an HTML file.

49
00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:08.740
No idea, it's a link.

50
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.893
No, cuz I do it so infrequently.

51
00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:13.486
Same thing with box shadows.

52
00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.508
So a lot of times I will, even if I know I
need to implement a box shadow, I'll open

53
00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:22.040
up Figma, get the box shadow looking just
right, and then figure out what I did.

54
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.543
Getting that visual feedback loop is a lot
easier sometimes than tweaking the CSS,

55
00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:27.970
looking at your browser.

56
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.487
Nope, still looks like garbage.

57
00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:31.814
Flipping back, nope,
it still looks like garbage.

58
00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:33.614
This is sometimes a lot easier.

59
00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:39.836
The other nice part is it will
begin to set up some of your CSS.

60
00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:41.998
Now, again, height, a lot of times, yeah,

61
00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:44.727
the height should just be
relative to the size of the text.

62
00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:49.196
We're not hard coding in pixel values for
height anymore.

63
00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:55.243
But some of these are somewhat useful and
the colors are probably pulled out.

64
00:03:55.243 --> 00:03:57.586
Border box,
you probably did on the HTML tag.

65
00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.964
Copy and pasting this CSS is a way
to lose the respect of your peers.

66
00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:08.789
But it at least kind of helps inspire
some of this for you, as well.

67
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:13.373
But yeah, take the box shadow,
they know that you want it,

68
00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:17.329
so you can copy the box
shadow directly to even CSS.

69
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.794
And you can hit Copy and
there's your box shadow.

70
00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:23.511
I'll just paste it in here real quick,
right?

71
00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:27.499
And then you feel like a genius,
instantly.
