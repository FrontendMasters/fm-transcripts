00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:02.138
So now we have kinda two guides in here.

2
00:00:02.138 --> 00:00:05.457
And for an exercise, you can kind of take
a look at trying whichever one of these

3
00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:07.336
seems a little bit more
interesting to you.

4
00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:09.969
And then we'll kinda do them together.

5
00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.010
But we're gonna try to build that card
component that we kinda used in a previous

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.565
example.

7
00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.119
Which, if you look at it
at the end of the day,

8
00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.109
let's just kind of like look at
the anatomy of what this might be like.

9
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.380
So we definitely know we've
got the stack in here, right?

10
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.095
We will probably have an auto layout for
these three pieces.

11
00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.512
But then if you also look,
we've got a place in there as well.

12
00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:35.956
Now, could this theoretically just be laid
out normally with a set of constraints,

13
00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.267
you could, right?

14
00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.191
But the interesting part is, this now,

15
00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:42.652
if you add a third thing in there will
just kinda balance automatically.

16
00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:46.292
If any of these kinda grow or
shrink, if the text grows,

17
00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:49.942
it'll automatically grow
the height of either sides.

18
00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:54.565
They'll behave very much like
they do in the web, right?

19
00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:59.169
The other version that we have is also a
set of nesting, auto layouts in this case,

20
00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:03.641
where we would have a button bar where
they're all kind of aligned to the right,

21
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:07.740
but then also a vertical hierarchy for
the other pieces as well, right?

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.215
So I'm gonna give you a little bit of
time to kind of try out one of these.

23
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.488
And then we'll kinda step through either
one or both of them as a group and

24
00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:16.000
kind of explain it as we go along.
