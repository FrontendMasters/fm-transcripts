00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.715
So now it's your turn,
I kinda have this little iPhone here.

2
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:10.333
And what I wanna do is not
have that happen, right?

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:15.359
I want my bottom bar to expand
along the left and right, top bar.

4
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.117
And I want these to either, your choice,
get to, I gave you two boxes for

5
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:25.188
a reason, keep in the center, but
maybe only horizontally, have it scale.

6
00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:28.730
Try out some different options,
that's why I gave you two.

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.532
Hypothetically, if you
need some inspiration,

8
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.300
did you know that you can hide and
show layers?

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.240
There's a hidden layer with an implemented
version that you can go take a look at and

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.086
reverse engineer if you want.

11
00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:45.379
Or you can kinda do it without
looking at the answer key first.

12
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.785
But spend about five minutes,
and take it for a spin and

13
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.465
see if you can get at least the top and
the bottom bar working.

14
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:54.174
And then try something that interests
you with the two kind of divs in

15
00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:55.161
the middle here.

16
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:56.860
I guess rectangles, not divs, right?
