1
00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:02.668
Let's go build this card together.

2
00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:03.802
Was kinda start from scratch and

3
00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:05.945
just walk through it even though
it stepped out a little bit.

4
00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:10.639
But I think it's still helpful to kinda go
through it and see it in action, right?

5
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.234
So, we'll start with a frame,
I'm gonna hold Shift to give it

6
00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:19.234
some kinda standard size
400 by 400 seems good.

7
00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:23.004
We didn't really talk too much about
the ability to set like a stroke.

8
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.801
That's just the kinda side and
edges here, right?

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:30.145
You can see this is gray but if I chose
a different color, you kinda see,

10
00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:31.747
that color there as well.

11
00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:36.082
We kinda mentioned before
this workbook came with

12
00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:41.457
a Drop Shadow that we can just use,
but we can set that as well.

13
00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:44.331
And then changing the border radius.

14
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.743
We can either if you wanna just see
what different border radiuses are like,

15
00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:49.734
you can grab it and
kind of turn it yourself.

16
00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.370
You have a lot of room to work with.

17
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.382
Let's go with eight.

18
00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:58.410
Like I said, you could if you hold Shift,
it'll go by 10s.

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.168
Whatever feels right to you,

20
00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:04.528
like you don't have to implement these
designs exactly the way that I am,

21
00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:08.468
it's more about the technique
rather than the actual specifics,

22
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:13.135
of like well your border radius was
actually 10, so you get five points off.

23
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:14.585
No, that's not how this works.

24
00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.405
So we've got this in place.

25
00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.859
And like I said before,
the closer you can get it,

26
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.736
you don't at any point have
to have it exact, you don't.

27
00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:25.311
But the closer you can lay it out
before you apply the auto layout,

28
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.303
the easier your life is,
the less you have to do later.

29
00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:31.299
And it's like sometimes it's easy
to get it right the first time.

30
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.319
So let's go ahead and we'll give this a I
don't even remember exactly what it was.

31
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.654
I'm assuming it was about 48 though.

32
00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:45.840
Like I could go in there and
measure that back one pixel.

33
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.740
Here we go.

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.087
Now I'm just gonna type it in by hand.

35
00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:52.222
48.

36
00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:57.196
Cool and then it's roughly I might
give that one a stroke as well mostly

37
00:01:57.196 --> 00:02:02.108
to have there's no way to do as far
as I know just like a bottom border.

38
00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:04.482
So I usually what this
is kinda as you can see,

39
00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.993
we get the effect that we're looking for
here.

40
00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.612
That's not true.

41
00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:13.460
You can do all sorts stuff with unions and
subtraction but like easy, right?

42
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.234
And like we are clipping the content.

43
00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:19.503
So like I don't have to match up the
border radius there because like anything

44
00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:20.922
outside of the frame is clipped.

45
00:02:20.922 --> 00:02:23.071
So I'm getting the effect that I want.

46
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:24.809
This isn't the actual implementation.

47
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.841
This is again, a representation of
what we'll implement as engineers.

48
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.586
But keep in mind that like you like yeah,
this is what it looks like.

49
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:34.413
There is a middle piece as well.

50
00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:37.257
So we can go ahead and
add one more frame in there.

51
00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.474
And you can see I missed a little bit, but

52
00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:44.455
I can also just grab the top and
snap it into place.

53
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:49.422
So now we've got the general kind of
like cheeseburger structure of our card

54
00:02:49.422 --> 00:02:50.824
component, right?

55
00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.971
We go in there and
add in some text as well.

56
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.545
So we'll say like, title.

57
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:06.082
Center that and
I'm gonna say it's got an x of 16.

58
00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:11.219
And then we'll go ahead and
we'll just make a copy of that over here.

59
00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.211
What I normally wanna do what I
normally do cuz I'm It's tricky

60
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.540
as I'll put it over on the edge and
like we saw in the very

61
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.173
beginning I will then go ahead and
subtract 16, right?

62
00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:28.880
And let's go ahead and just do one
more now that I have that as a guide.

63
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.567
I'm gonna hold Shift so
it keeps the same vertical axis here and

64
00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.464
then align it with the Center for

65
00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:42.096
these two actually I'm also
gonna say I missed it.

66
00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:50.941
I'm gonna say that they should be
aligned to the right in this case,

67
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:57.903
and now we'll just give this like $1.

68
00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.304
What else do I have in here?

69
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:02.304
That was down there?

70
00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.037
So put the artist title up here this time.

71
00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:09.183
All right so
we've got the basic shape in there.

72
00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:13.318
The other thing that we don't
do at the middle one year.

73
00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:16.597
One of things I also do a lot of times
pretty early as name stuff appropriately

74
00:04:16.597 --> 00:04:19.930
because it's like really helpful sometimes
especially when you have a lot of

75
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.662
color to everything you just name it,
so we'll call this one.

76
00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.206
Bottom bar.

77
00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:27.534
You'll notice the text fields
automatically just get the name of

78
00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.178
whatever's in the text field.

79
00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:33.364
This is great as we're making
one off components, but

80
00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:35.828
a one off, yeah, components.

81
00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:38.129
They're gonna be components in the future,
I spoil it for you.

82
00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.138
Like eventually we'll make reusable
components where it won't just

83
00:04:41.138 --> 00:04:41.859
always be $1.

84
00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:45.309
A lot of times I'll give it like
some name that makes sense.

85
00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.513
We'll call this one top bar.

86
00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:52.481
And so that C frame 13
which should be the middle,

87
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.346
I accidentally nested inside.

88
00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:57.676
So one way you can do is
just in this outline view.

89
00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:00.587
You can just move it up like this as well.

90
00:05:00.587 --> 00:05:03.931
And so
now it came out from a child have that

91
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.959
bottom frame that was cut
with the clip contents.

92
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:10.966
Now it's actually just
appear with the other ones.

93
00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:14.841
So we'll call this one content as well.

94
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:17.375
Cool.
So now that is the layout of a car

95
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:18.316
component.

96
00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:21.866
Now like I said before, you could
drag in an image from your computer.

97
00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:25.454
And the nice part is when you make these
reusable components you can just like slap

98
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:28.594
another image on it on each given
instance and it will be totally fine.

99
00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.181
We can start with a default one.

100
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:31.989
I could grab an image.

101
00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:35.175
I'm just going to right now just
fill it with like a gradient or

102
00:05:35.175 --> 00:05:38.011
something you can fill with
a color anything you want.

103
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:43.146
So go here, you can just literally drag
an image from your desktop into sigma

104
00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:48.284
you can choose any one of these let's go
with a diamond gradient this time and

105
00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:55.687
we'll say that this color should
be Cool some version of that.

106
00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:59.159
In there as well,
I like the other one that I did for

107
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.901
but like live gradient dean is not
a thing that I plan on doing today.

108
00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:06.391
Hopefully like that as well.

109
00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:11.001
And there's no auto layout to this
at all if we stretch out anything,

110
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:13.634
it's just sadness all the way around.

111
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:15.470
But there are a bunch of pieces here.

112
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.343
Now we could grab the frame as a whole.

113
00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.616
We can auto layout it.

114
00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.806
And now will automatically
just kind of work.

115
00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:24.470
I'm probably going to out of the box,

116
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.602
say that like it's hugging the contents.

117
00:06:28.602 --> 00:06:30.108
I don't know if I really want that, right?

118
00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:32.011
Cuz this doesn't work
the way that I wanted.

119
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:36.273
So what we'll say in this case is
that it should be a fixed width and

120
00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:37.445
then each of these

121
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.706
Should Grab

122
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:51.539
that they should fill the container.

123
00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:57.865
And so
now almost easy to fix tight I didn't set.

124
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.745
In this one, you should be fixed and
that one should fill.

125
00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:08.442
Okay, so
we want the top of the bottom to be fixed.

126
00:07:08.442 --> 00:07:12.047
And we'll say the center one,
fill whatever's left over, right?

127
00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:14.110
So we'll go ahead and
we'll drag that down.

128
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.546
And you can adjust this any way you want.

129
00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:18.714
You see that like these are now
set to whatever I tell them to be.

130
00:07:18.714 --> 00:07:22.158
This one is going to take out
whatever's leftover, right?

131
00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:24.940
Very similar to how you might
do it in flexbox as well.

132
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.071
So say this is 48 again.

133
00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:31.438
I'll probably change that in a second.

134
00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:34.323
Now each one of these can also
be an auto layout as well.

135
00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:38.361
So Shift A you can see the bottom
says Auto Layout added.

136
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.109
In this case, I wanna say that
you should start with your

137
00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:46.354
alignment here and we'll center it.

138
00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:49.299
But it's still hugging the contents.

139
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:52.106
So we'll also fill the container as well.

140
00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:59.249
And we'll fill the container and
in this case, let's do it space between.

141
00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:03.010
So like there it set a margin between
these two that just happened to fill up

142
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.807
all the space.

143
00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:05.475
But if I dragged a third item in there,

144
00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:07.569
it wouldn't have worked
the way I wanted it to.

145
00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:13.183
So now theoretically I could grab
like another piece of text here.

146
00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:15.409
Go in there,
it'll be that if I do it again.

147
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.738
They'll start to automatically spread
everything out just like it would with

148
00:08:21.738 --> 00:08:22.263
a flexbox.

149
00:08:22.263 --> 00:08:27.104
So if I really wanna be like extra
like obnoxious about the price,

150
00:08:27.104 --> 00:08:31.339
I can just put it in the box
nine times and it'll workout.

151
00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:39.402
Versus this one, it's aligned to the right
with a 10 pixel margin in between them.

152
00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:43.355
So if I drag one in here, you can see
that it behaves differently down here.

153
00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:47.497
So you can begin to compose various
different auto layouts within auto

154
00:08:47.497 --> 00:08:51.088
layouts, but this will all
respond as it changes and grows.

155
00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:55.950
If I make this a lot longer I
don't have to readjust anything,

156
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.674
everything takes care of itself.
