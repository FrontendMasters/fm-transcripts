1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.415
So we've learned a little
bit about auto layouts.

2
00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:06.679
And like I said, we could go all the way.

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.419
We could turn each and every one of
these buttons into an auto layout.

4
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.238
We could do every card
into an auto layout.

5
00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:16.852
We could go all the way, and it would be
a lot of me doing the same thing over and

6
00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.922
over again, which is maybe useful,
but not great television.

7
00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.288
So let's kinda just look at how we could
take existing things that might be in

8
00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:28.260
a mock-up, and convert one or
two of them into an auto layout.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.615
So in this case,
we have these tabs, right?

10
00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:39.285
And each one of these is they've separated
the background from the actual text.

11
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:43.787
But we saw with the button before that
we can easily take two shapes and

12
00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:46.605
create an auto layout out of that.

13
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:51.867
So I could theoretically kinda zoom in
a little bit here and select these two and

14
00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:56.346
hit Shift+A, and you're like,
no, what happened, right?

15
00:00:56.346 --> 00:01:00.496
Well, the default in a lot of
cases is to do the hug contents.

16
00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:04.055
So we go ahead, and
as much as I love a good hug, let's see,

17
00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.632
we can stretch it out
just like that again.

18
00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.550
And we're gonna have to do this for

19
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.070
all three of them, but
it effectively looks the same, right?

20
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.580
And we can actually
take these two as well.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.300
I'll do them both kinda at the same time.

22
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.550
They're the same color, but
they're different rectangles.

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.466
And we'll go ahead and
we'll change these to fixed, and

24
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.910
then I will kinda stretch
them both out as well.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.499
So each one of these tabs
is now an auto layout,

26
00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.362
very similar to what
we do with the button.

27
00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:38.465
If I changed the text, it would grow or
shrink along with the text,

28
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.763
cuz this page,
when it appears on a desktop browser,

29
00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:44.867
are kind of like tabs as we know them and
love them.

30
00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:49.222
So in that world, we might want
them to expand and contract, right,

31
00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:53.291
especially as we get into making
reusable components, right?

32
00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:56.544
Having ones that behave
the correct way on both mobile and

33
00:01:56.544 --> 00:01:59.280
desktop is somewhat important.

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.860
And then we can take this overall frame,
hit Shift+A again.

35
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.039
You see it moves slightly,
we can adjust that.

36
00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.780
But now this is an auto layout tabs
container with these three tabs.

37
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.070
And if I took one of these, I held Alt,
I can just add another tab.

38
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.045
Now, that does overflow a little
bit in this case cuz it's growing,

39
00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.910
cuz that's the way auto
layout is supposed to behave.

40
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.135
If I took kind of the entire frame here,
let's see if I can actually do it.

41
00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:34.524
So I just turned the set of the five high
level tabs into an auto layout itself.

42
00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:40.040
So we'll zoom out, which is kinda the way
the divs stack normally in the browser.

43
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.426
So now if I go ahead, and
we can grab one of these.

44
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.990
There we go.

45
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.205
We'll kinda add it in there.

46
00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:53.214
You can see that the entire layout
just moves down as well, right,

47
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.513
so each one of these.

48
00:02:54.513 --> 00:03:00.570
And we can go ahead we can make the navbar
that space between auto layout.

49
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.183
I wonder if I just take this
one real quick as well,

50
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.370
cuz I wrapped this one in a frame earlier.

51
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.888
It was just two kind of two flat
shapes laid on top of each other.

52
00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:17.033
Earlier in the course, I took each one,
and I made it at least a frame,

53
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.864
which means I should be
able to do the same here.

54
00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:22.380
Now, sorry,
I could do this with each button.

55
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.511
I can go on and on and on, but now I
could theoretically, let's do play me.

56
00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:33.390
We gotta get the whole frame in this case.

57
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.060
So grab that course card.

58
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.219
And now you can see that my layout just
kinda grows along with the content.

59
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.370
And again, I could take this through
all of its natural conclusion, right?

60
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.872
If I turned even the card into an auto
layout, I could write more texts.

61
00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:47.800
It would grow and expand.

62
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.354
Everything would shift around
as I would want it to, right?

63
00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:57.082
So the actual kind of pieces as well,
you'll notice that I have that problem

64
00:03:57.082 --> 00:04:00.344
that we solved in the constraint
section earlier where it won't,

65
00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.970
in this case, grow.

66
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.621
But I can at that point also,
for these higher level pieces,

67
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.919
have them either fill the container.

68
00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.797
Yeah, let's go for it,
actually, in this case, and

69
00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:12.996
you could see that they start to fill out.

70
00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:14.906
This is not an auto layout, but

71
00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:18.443
I can begin to take the same
approach all the way through.

72
00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:23.470
And the term of art that we
would use is responsive, right?

73
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.392
Would I need to theoretically,
to Omar's question earlier,

74
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:31.910
maybe have a slightly different layout for
as we get to the bigger sizes?

75
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.576
Yeah, but in a lot of cases,

76
00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:38.770
that's the same way we're writing a lot
times custom CSS for various breakpoints.

77
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.580
We do something similar in design.

78
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.938
That said, there is something to his
question still that we need to address,

79
00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:48.162
right, this idea of reusable pieces.

80
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:53.425
If I can make styles for the header here,
and I can change this color from

81
00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:58.513
primary 400, and I can change it
to this one to a different color,

82
00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:02.411
but you'll notice the other
card doesn't change.

83
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:04.973
We would want them all to kind
of ideally all sync up, so

84
00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:06.607
we'd make one change to one card.

85
00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:08.916
I can change what this color means.

86
00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:12.143
I could change all
the primary 400 to a teal.

87
00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:13.369
But I couldn't necessarily.

88
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.610
I'd still have to do each
one of these by hand, right?

89
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.610
Clearly, if there's a little
voice in your head going like,

90
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.770
this seems like a solvable problem,
you're right, it is a solvable problem.

91
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.730
And we will begin to solve
it in about two sections.

92
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.416
First, we're gonna kind of
just go all the way a little

93
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:33.314
bit deeper with these nested auto layups.

94
00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:37.942
So one of the examples we talked
about before is this ability to

95
00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:40.670
build a navigation bar, right?

96
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.207
And this can become super easy
once we have auto layout, but

97
00:05:44.207 --> 00:05:47.259
there's a few auto layouts going on here,
right?

98
00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.958
If we take a look at some various
implementations of a navbar, well,

99
00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:57.717
that's an auto layout right there,
like you're given navigation items, right?

100
00:05:57.717 --> 00:06:02.187
But then even in the context of larger
navigation bar, also an auto layout.

101
00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:03.267
You can have auto layout.

102
00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:05.196
It's like,
I heard you like auto layouts, so

103
00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:07.234
I put auto layouts in your auto layouts,
right?

104
00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:10.813
You can begin to build up more
sophisticated components by kinda taking

105
00:06:10.813 --> 00:06:13.628
all of these techniques and
beginning to combine them.

106
00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:18.364
We'll kinda basically take that to its
natural conclusion in the kinda last

107
00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:19.699
half of this course.

108
00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.111
So if we wanna implement something
like this, we can go ahead.

109
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:24.143
Let's start with a frame.

110
00:06:27.207 --> 00:06:29.970
And let's see, I think it's 48 pixels.

111
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.027
We can adjust it later.

112
00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:33.278
It's not a big deal.

113
00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:37.840
48 in height, 1024 seems good.

114
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.780
I have some various pieces
that I can use in here.

115
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.750
So for instance, I could start by just
taking one of these and drag it in there.

116
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.542
And right now,
we're not using auto layout.

117
00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.138
It's kinda just floating around.

118
00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:55.153
One of the tricks is the closer you
get it to how you want it before

119
00:06:55.153 --> 00:07:00.653
you switch to an auto layout,
the more Figma will do for you, right?

120
00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:05.316
And so as we saw before, if it's kinda in
the center of the button, it will guess.

121
00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:10.246
When we had that 17 in between each one
of those navigation items, it's like you

122
00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:15.264
must want a space of 17 in between each
one of these items, like totally, right?

123
00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:19.712
The closer you can get it,
the better off you are, in a lot of cases.

124
00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:25.712
So let's go ahead, and we'll give
this a height of, in this case, 48.

125
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.337
We'll kinda center it in
there a little bit, right?

126
00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:30.639
Maybe we could even make it smaller,
I don't know.

127
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.578
Let's make it 40.

128
00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:39.732
Yeah, we can always
adjust all of this later.

129
00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:41.882
Nothing is really set in stone.

130
00:07:41.882 --> 00:07:46.356
These are all right now just
individual words that we can bring in.

131
00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:50.251
They are in a quick little group,
just so I can move them around easily.

132
00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:54.074
But if we wanted to kind of pull out
each one of them, it's just a group.

133
00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.721
It's not even a frame at this point.

134
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:57.687
So let's kinda bring it in there.

135
00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:02.327
When we turn it into an auto layout,
it'll become a frame.

136
00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:03.835
My groups don't really do anything.

137
00:08:03.835 --> 00:08:07.916
You can't have any kind of spacing between
them, or they're just a very simple way to

138
00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:11.048
collect things if you're trying
to move a bunch of stuff around.

139
00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:14.164
But we'll see if we can turn
that into something a second.

140
00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:18.019
And let's grab some icons,
which ones make us happy?

141
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.591
Let's grab the account one.

142
00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.442
I should copy it instead.

143
00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:28.643
Notice I started to drag it, and
I was like, I wanna copy, so

144
00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:30.174
I just held down Alt or Option.

145
00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:32.828
And it's like, you wanna copy,
cool, cool, cool.

146
00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:37.284
And we'll go and
grab the shopping cart as well.

147
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:42.180
We'll put it over there.

148
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.136
Now, the important part is if
I just hit auto layout now,

149
00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:51.075
it's not really sure
what the hierarchy is.

150
00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:54.386
We know intellectually
that this is a piece.

151
00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:56.497
That's fine,
that's a frame in its own, right?

152
00:08:56.497 --> 00:08:58.944
This is a group, in this case.

153
00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:01.170
If we had them all individually,
that would be cool,

154
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.007
these should all be
roughly the same thing.

155
00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:04.310
Let me even them all out.

156
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.040
That's not really the design
we're going for, right?

157
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.038
And so the trick here is to begin to kind
of think about the actual hierarchy in

158
00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:16.800
the same way you would do it with
your components in React, Vues, FELT,

159
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.380
what have you, right?

160
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.205
So we know that these two icons,
okay, that's the thing.

161
00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:25.577
Let's go ahead and hit Cmd + Opt + G, or

162
00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:31.374
Ctrl + Alt + G and
put them in a frame, these as well.

163
00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:33.705
I'm curious to see what will happen
if just leave them in the group.

164
00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:37.942
I could ungroup them and put them in
a frame, but let's find out together.

165
00:09:37.942 --> 00:09:39.751
So we can go take this navbar.

166
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:42.033
I'll hit Shift+A and
turn it into an auto layout.

167
00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:47.146
And not bad,
it's definitely top aligning everything,

168
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:50.076
but we can fix that super easily.

169
00:09:50.076 --> 00:09:53.941
We can center everything, and
I can also do space between.

170
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.321
So these nav items are still a group.

171
00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:57.829
They're not auto layout themselves.

172
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.254
This is just a frame with two items.

173
00:09:59.254 --> 00:10:02.599
And it's not auto layout, so
if I drag things into either one of these

174
00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:05.268
two sections,
that will not behave like I would like.

175
00:10:05.268 --> 00:10:08.480
But the actual overall navbar
is presently an auto layout.

176
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.021
So let's go ahead and let's see
what happens if I stretch this out.

177
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:14.404
How does it behave?

178
00:10:14.404 --> 00:10:17.818
Not bad for the very beginning, right?

179
00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:21.526
You'll notice that these don't stretch
out, or anything along those lines,

180
00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:24.975
cuz again, it's not an auto layout if
I dragged in an extra word, right?

181
00:10:24.975 --> 00:10:28.670
So for instance, if I take this one,
let's make a copy, and

182
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.511
let's take one of these icons and
make a copy.

183
00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:35.572
If I drag these in, you'll notice that
if you see that little blue cursor,

184
00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:39.318
it's gonna try to put it in the layout
with everything else, right?

185
00:10:39.318 --> 00:10:42.244
So we have one auto layout for
the navbar, but

186
00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:46.550
there are kind of these child
auto layouts, if you will.

187
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.087
So let's bring that back out again.

188
00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:55.885
So now we can grab this group,
And let's hit Shift+A.

189
00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:59.575
And now you can see it is now
a frame instead of a group.

190
00:11:00.775 --> 00:11:05.408
And now I can drag this one in,
and it behaves pretty much

191
00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:10.053
like we would expect, and
then we'll turn this group.

192
00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:12.225
Again, I can also hit the + sign here.

193
00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:14.580
This is now an auto layout as well.

194
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.867
And like I said, we can add things.

195
00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:20.200
Everything's kind of shifting around, as
we would expect in the appropriate place.

196
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.292
Just want the word create.

197
00:11:23.292 --> 00:11:25.596
And I can pull that out.

198
00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:27.673
I made a copy, wee.

199
00:11:27.673 --> 00:11:30.434
And everything shifts and
readjusts like it would in the CSS.

200
00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:32.682
This is great for thinking some stuff out.

201
00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:37.486
I can go ahead and
grab a search bar as well,

202
00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:40.969
and let's toss that in there.

203
00:11:46.448 --> 00:11:49.129
Might be a little bit
too big in this case, so

204
00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:54.483
let's, There we go.

205
00:11:54.483 --> 00:11:59.050
All right, so now this is getting
a little bit squirrely in this case.

206
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.480
This is set to fixed width.

207
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.232
We could have it just fill a container.

208
00:12:03.232 --> 00:12:06.268
Now you can see if we've got
the space between, right?

209
00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:09.115
Our hierarchy is still
not great in this case,

210
00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:12.986
right, cuz it's giving equal
spaced to all of these, right?

211
00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:16.187
This naturally just takes
up a whole bunch as well.

212
00:12:16.187 --> 00:12:22.736
So things that we could do is we could
theoretically adjust any of this.

213
00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:24.420
I can tighten this up a bit.

214
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.894
I could put these in an auto layout as
well and kind of have the space in between

215
00:12:27.894 --> 00:12:31.830
these two items, cuz then we'd have
three elements in here instead of four.

216
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.982
See what happens.

217
00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:40.175
These are both in here now, and

218
00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:44.703
let's shrink that down
a little bit as well here.

219
00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:49.502
We can go ahead and
kind of adjust accordingly.

220
00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:53.006
But everything will be laid out in that
kind of just general sense as well,

221
00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:54.315
and you can kinda play out.

222
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.932
These are still pretty spaced out.

223
00:12:55.932 --> 00:13:01.850
So if we go in here, we could say okay,
these should be 32 apart.

224
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:08.060
All right, we don't need three icons,
so let's go ahead and take that one out.

225
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.510
And we're starting to get more and
more what we're going for over here.

226
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.620
And the nice part is you don't have
to sit there and measure things.

227
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.420
You can basically say here are the rules.

228
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.370
I will group things, kind of adjust the
space in each kind of nested child group

229
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.200
and get more and more sophisticated
layouts as we go along in this case.

230
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.189
&gt;&gt; Do you recommend to adjust
it from up to down when

231
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:34.445
you resize, or do it in a head?

232
00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:35.405
&gt;&gt; I'm not totally sure.

233
00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:40.015
A lot of times I will put everything
in there roughly just the normal

234
00:13:40.015 --> 00:13:45.120
non-auto layout way first, and
let auto layout start with the guesses,

235
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.190
cuz I'm just kind of just placing
stuff in an unsophisticated way.

236
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.239
And yeah, if I have them aligned,
it'll work a little bit easier.

237
00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:57.897
And then most of the time,
one of the questions earlier too was,

238
00:13:57.897 --> 00:14:03.345
generally speaking, you have some
amount of standardized measurement.

239
00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:10.119
So Tailwind will have a certain p2 is 4
pixels, or 8 pixels, or whatever, right?

240
00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:12.439
And you'll have these
standardized units that double.

241
00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:14.729
So you wouldn't just have
arbitrary numbers in there.

242
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:18.829
You start out with okay,
things should either be 2, 4, 8, 16,

243
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:22.028
32 pixels apart,
something along those lines, and

244
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:25.384
start out with those just
general rough places in there.

245
00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:27.850
And then you can kinda tweak in
the auto layout as you need it.
