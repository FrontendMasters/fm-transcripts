00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.624
There are a bunch of plugins
that will take a whole

2
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:09.280
bunch of layers and
make styles for you, right?

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.453
So for instance, Styler is the one I use,
and you can go ahead and

4
00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.494
you can just hit Install and
then it's instantly available.

5
00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:21.526
And then you can use it, so
that's kinda your cue to go and

6
00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:23.966
install it right now while I talk.

7
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:28.816
You can install Styler, and what it will
do is that it'll take a bunch of layers

8
00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:33.763
and it will just automatically create
color styles for you out of those layers.

9
00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:35.250
Then you're like, neat.

10
00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:40.873
What are they called, right?

11
00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:44.420
Well, that's where, so
you're not out of the woods yet.

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.696
It names them after whatever
the name of the layer was.

13
00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:56.992
So, if you select all of these,
and you go in, and go to plugins,

14
00:00:56.992 --> 00:01:01.815
and you go to Styler, and
you go Generate Styles.

15
00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:08.106
You can see if I go now in here, I've
got a bunch of colors called circle and

16
00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.755
whatever number Figma gave it.

17
00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:19.490
That's not what I wanted,
I could go hand by hand and rename them.

18
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.219
And the one thing you'll see is
that if I give it a slash like

19
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.407
a directory structure,

20
00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.334
It will create folders that I
can organize stuff with, but

21
00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:42.068
still I don't wanna do this, so I'm gonna
delete all these cuz these are gross.

22
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:46.553
I'll select Shift and just get all of
them, delete them, I don't want them.

23
00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:51.174
What I wanna do is I want to rename

24
00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:55.459
all of these in bulk, right?

25
00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.578
So there's a bunch of ways
that I can do that, but

26
00:01:57.578 --> 00:02:00.236
there's one kind of built into
Figma that's super useful.

27
00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:05.778
I can select a bunch of these,
let's take all the brand ones,

28
00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:12.082
and I can hit Command+R,
you'll see I get this bulk rename, right?

29
00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:14.136
The one thing I have to check is
depending on which order you select,

30
00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.120
they're slightly different.

31
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.600
So circle five is the lightest one,
that's the one I want to be 100.

32
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.360
And then it means circle 1
is the one I want to be 500,

33
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.850
so I'll show you how to do this.

34
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.991
You select a bunch, you hit Command+R.

35
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:31.698
And you can do a regex in
here if you love regex and

36
00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:33.813
that's the way that you wanna live.

37
00:02:33.813 --> 00:02:37.029
I don't need to in this case,
so I'm gonna say Brand, so

38
00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.720
this would rename them all Brand.

39
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.238
Still not great, there are a bunch
of variables that I can use here.

40
00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:50.538
And so if I do $n,
you'll see that it is giving me a number,

41
00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.407
right, in incremental order.

42
00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:58.011
Capital N will give me
in descending order.

43
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.512
Two n's will actually just pad
it with a zero, so that way,

44
00:03:01.512 --> 00:03:05.453
you don't have to figure all that out,
so on and so forth, right?

45
00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:07.545
What I want is kinda the opposite.

46
00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:12.444
I wanna say that the one that
is circle 5 which should be 100,

47
00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:16.163
and the one that is circle
1 should be 500, so

48
00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:21.465
I'll just put two Os at the end myself,
and then that slash in there.

49
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.530
And I can check, and
you could see that I got it wrong.

50
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.433
So there's a bunch of
ways you can handle this,

51
00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:35.011
you can do a replace, I'm just
gonna undo and will hit Brand, $n.

52
00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:42.109
And now all of these are renamed
the correct way, right?

53
00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.312
So again, as you saw the input field above
that, there's pattern matching, right?

54
00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:49.201
You can literally just type in a string,
you can put in a regex, and

55
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:53.010
then you can use that value, then you
can do everything after the value.

56
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.200
There's a whole bunch of nuanced
things that it's really hard to come

57
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.955
up with a fictitious use case for
why I would wanna do that, so

58
00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:00.110
you have a bunch of ways.

59
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.879
The other way you could
theoretically do this is,

60
00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.185
I could grab a bunch of these,
I could rename them all 200, right?

61
00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:14.259
And then, I could theoretically match
it and then fill in the other piece.

62
00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.459
I like the initial way that I did it,
so you can go through and

63
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.728
rename all of them one at a time.

64
00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:24.598
So here we'll call this one,
was this Information,

65
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.265
was that Success, or was it Danger?

66
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:36.145
Danger/ Warning/,

67
00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:40.901
might grab that real quick and
not type it again.

68
00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:49.597
Still like not tedious, but
ideally you're doing this once.

69
00:04:49.597 --> 00:04:56.193
It's kinda like setting up Webpack,
that's gonna get me in trouble.

70
00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:57.943
And then we'll call this grayscale.

71
00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:06.876
Awesome, and so
now I can select all of these,

72
00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:12.604
I can go back into Styler and
I can say Generate Styles.

73
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:17.568
And now you can see,
I didn't rename that one properly.

74
00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:22.500
At least for the other ones, I've got my
entire color palette that I can now use

75
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.414
throughout the rest of
my day as we go through,

76
00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:27.833
I do need to undo that last one though.

77
00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:41.060
All right, and go ahead, and
we'll just try it one more time.

78
00:05:46.902 --> 00:05:49.971
Generate Styles, and now I have, oop,

79
00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:54.682
I got an extra sticky note in there,
you can just delete them.

80
00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:58.345
And now I have all the colors is that
I need, so you can create a scale.

81
00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:00.723
The other thing is super interesting is,
neat,

82
00:06:00.723 --> 00:06:03.435
you've just moved the problem forward,
right?

83
00:06:03.435 --> 00:06:07.185
Yes, now you're a designer, which could
be you or it could be somebody else, or

84
00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:10.271
it could be you trying to just figure
out all the colors in a design,

85
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:12.205
has a bunch of well named styles.

86
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:17.174
There's another one called CSS Gen, which
again, you probably just don't wanna use

87
00:06:17.174 --> 00:06:21.734
wholesale, but you could theoretically
take the styles from a Figma file, and

88
00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.183
this is another plugin.

89
00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:29.669
And you can go in here and we'll go to CSS
Gen and we'll say, I want CSS variables,

90
00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:36.357
you can choose your color mode that makes
you happiest, you can choose your casing.

91
00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:41.282
You hit Generate, and it will give you a
bunch of variables that you can just use,

92
00:06:41.282 --> 00:06:44.192
and so
you're not porting them over one by one.

93
00:06:44.192 --> 00:06:48.946
So now you can set up the colors and
again get the accessibility right.

94
00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:52.043
A lot of times what I'll do for
both typography and

95
00:06:52.043 --> 00:06:56.837
colors is I'll make a bunch of just
random buttons and divs and headings, and

96
00:06:56.837 --> 00:07:00.595
do even just a very loose mock
up of what I think I'm gonna do,

97
00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:04.262
get the line spacing right,
and stuff along those lines.

98
00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:07.106
Then I will delete all those things,

99
00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:11.876
I'm not gonna actually use them,
but that sets up my styles,

100
00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:17.312
now I have them ready to go in both my
CSS as well as in my design, right?

101
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.395
You might not just use this as
a class name, you could choose,

102
00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:22.723
if you're using SAS,
you might make a mixin.

103
00:07:22.723 --> 00:07:26.259
But it at least gives you
the starting piece here for

104
00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.710
all the styles that you might
choose to use in your application.
