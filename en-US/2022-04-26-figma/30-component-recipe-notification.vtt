00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.914
There are some advanced tricks
that we can use to implement some

2
00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:09.241
different strategies as well,
so let's look at that.

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.040
This is what I'm just calling
advanced component recipes, right?

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.643
These are things that are like,
there's some tricks that I wanna do,

5
00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.740
this is interesting.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.156
All right, so if we look at,
our notification, we'd love to speak

7
00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:31.020
in a world where I gotta have one
with an icon and without an icon.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.698
But if you remember in the very beginning,
when I was introducing

9
00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:40.640
this idea of components,
I was like things that you can't do right?

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.810
Like change most of the stuff,
you can edit the text, but

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.975
you can't like in a instance move
the title under the body, right?

12
00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:55.151
You can't like change
like the bounds of stuff,

13
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:59.600
they're kind of locked to a certain
amount of their structure.

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.230
There are things that you can override but

15
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.610
a lot of their core
structure is not changeable.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.506
So for instance, I mean this isn't
a component yet, but if I go ahead and

17
00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:13.007
just make it a component real quick.

18
00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:19.375
And we'll go ahead and
pull in an instance here,

19
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.964
Right and like cool I can change the text.

20
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:34.960
But I'm kind of there's not a lot
that I can do with this icon right?

21
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.801
And you can see a world where it's like
cool yeah, I don't want the same icon for

22
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:45.230
all my different notifications, maybe I
want like a thumbs up for the success.

23
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.656
Or like warning sign for
the warning or, I don't know,

24
00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:55.280
different things, there's icons over here.

25
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.603
I don't know what they call,
I named them all at one point, but

26
00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:00.190
I've since forgotten.

27
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.065
Perhaps I want one that I found
in the Material Design icons,

28
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:09.570
which was cowboy account,
or account cowboy, right?

29
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.980
You wanna use that for something,
just having one static icon isn't great.

30
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.574
But if we recall that list I shared
when I first introduced components,

31
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:23.244
there was one little
caveat that we can use.

32
00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:26.268
Which is you cannot change anything but

33
00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:31.800
you can swap out a nested component for
another component, right?

34
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.552
So it's kind of a little bit annoying, but

35
00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:40.010
you basically, if you had an icon in here,
you're stuck with the icon.

36
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.149
But if this icon was a component,
you could swap it out for

37
00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:50.520
another component which could
also be another icon right?

38
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.780
So in the same way we had all those
buttons kinda grouped together.

39
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.893
We can also do something similar here
where we basically take all of our

40
00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:04.296
icons and turn it into a set of components
that we can swap the instances of.

41
00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:08.941
I should say that font awesome exists and

42
00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:13.310
that is icons that are just a font, and

43
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.969
we saw that you can change text, right?

44
00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.325
And so I'm using this one cuz there's
a case where you can't use Font Awesome,

45
00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:23.506
you have an icon set.

46
00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.986
Which case this is what you gotta do but
also like this is a metaphor for

47
00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:30.160
anytime you need to swap out
stuff inside of a component.

48
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.808
This case is icons, but
it could be anything and

49
00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:33.520
we'll actually see some other cases.

50
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.525
But I should just do the quick PSA
of you could switch the font to

51
00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:43.904
font awesome here and go And
you gotta do font awesome free and

52
00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:45.920
then you've got, yeah,
it's got to be solid right?

53
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.629
I check out what happens if I type search.

54
00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:52.624
Angle right.

55
00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:56.114
Right and those are the ones that yeah,

56
00:03:56.114 --> 00:03:59.750
there's a whole bunch that I've
memorized I use all the time, right?

57
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.174
So, it's worth thinking about before you
go down this road if you need to go down

58
00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:04.845
this road.

59
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.910
But like if it's not the icons,
it's gonna be something else eventually.

60
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.556
So like the strategy still holds up but
for the use case of icons in particular.

61
00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:22.167
You might consider just using a icon font.

62
00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:27.126
So what we could do here is we can
grab all of these then copy and

63
00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:29.966
paste them over here for a second.

64
00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:35.526
And now we have a whole
bunch of these in place and

65
00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:42.486
we can go ahead I'm gonna wrap
them in a frame called Icons.

66
00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:46.372
That seems like a good name, and will
kinda just select all of them a lot of

67
00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.129
times it's easier to do it
from the menu honestly.

68
00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:55.750
Select all of them and
we'll go to create multiple components.

69
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.673
And now if we go into assets I'm
really making a mess out of this

70
00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:06.720
Let's see we're in advanced
component recipes under icons.

71
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.700
You can see that I can drag
in one of these icons.

72
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.670
And now I can swap between them, right?

73
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.390
So in here, I'm kinda stuck with this.

74
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.160
And let's actually make that
let's get rid of this one.

75
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.220
How do you get rid of a component?

76
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.630
Get rid of the component, it's prototypal
inheritance, just delete the object.

77
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.340
So this will be our new base one.

78
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.397
And what I'm gonna do in this case
is now that this is just detached,

79
00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:38.970
I'm gonna make sure it's detached yeah.

80
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.830
Let's see pick the overall frame.

81
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.298
Like just be yourself.

82
00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:49.800
Cuz what you don't want people to do
is hey, they wanna replace this icon.

83
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.723
They detach from your component and
now any updates you publish,

84
00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:53.689
they'll never get.

85
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.998
It's one of those things
unless you make it easy for

86
00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:58.640
people they will do bad things,
and then you will suffer.

87
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.823
So now instead of having an icon
in there I will bring in.

88
00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:09.523
Let's see, where's that box in there?

89
00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:10.605
What's that box doing?

90
00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:16.110
The pause icon there like in frame.

91
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.380
So there's some auto layout going on here.

92
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.030
And we'll just drag it in over there.

93
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.390
This looks the same, but
it's now a component instead of an icon.

94
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.730
Right, so
I could if you see if I click on it.

95
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.333
I could swap it out with
an electric guitar.

96
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.768
But this isn't an instance yeah this
is just a normal layer so I can do

97
00:06:35.768 --> 00:06:40.011
whatever I want to begin with but the fact
of matter is this behaves almost the same.

98
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.061
But instead of like directly
dragging in an SVG or an icon,

99
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:46.500
now I'm dragging into component and
there's different roles.

100
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.334
So let's go ahead and in this case,
we will turn it into a component.

101
00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:58.095
We'll drag it in, and
now I couldn't change that icon before.

102
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:03.559
I'm just gonna make sure
that now I can go ahead and

103
00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.530
change it to any of the other ones
that are in that component set.

104
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.011
So the rule of you can't change
things in component instances that

105
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:17.776
are part of the structure does not
apply to swapping out one component

106
00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:20.910
slot with another component slot.

107
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.680
And one could behave poorly with this.

108
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.770
You hold Command, no,
let's actually just do it over here.

109
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.073
One could behave real poorly.

110
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:42.427
And this is why the entire instance,
I'll see if I got the.

111
00:07:46.138 --> 00:07:48.101
Let's go get it here.

112
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:56.164
Take the star believe, hopefully, ideally,
if I can't do this is even better.

113
00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:01.646
That's itself let's see.

114
00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:11.801
Yeah, I can put in any component in there,
now it will contain the generalized shape

115
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:15.103
and stuff along those lines, that's
the border radius and stuff like that.

116
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:19.865
So having that hierarchy so that like,
at least you saw that the sensible default

117
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:24.290
there is the other icons,
that makes sense, you should do that.

118
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.250
But you can now swap out the icons and
all the different instances.

119
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.715
So you could have a different one for
your info, for your primary, I mean for

120
00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:33.340
error, for your warning,
so on and so forth.

121
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.497
It's a little trick that allow you to have
more flexible components because again,

122
00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:39.254
any world where someone detaches,

123
00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:43.190
they can make a change is a world that
involves future sadness what's up?

124
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.822
&gt;&gt; So could you swap out the icon for
an empty component or

125
00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:50.788
that have to just be a separate
instance of the component?

126
00:08:50.788 --> 00:08:53.328
Cuz above you have like the title no icon.

127
00:08:53.328 --> 00:08:59.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I could swap it out for
l think it'll keep the general shape.

128
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.184
This case I would probably have the same
we had with label and without label.

129
00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:07.300
However, you're onto something here,
right?

130
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.660
Where could I swap it
out with an empty one?

131
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.202
Possibly but
then the inverse is also true,

132
00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:18.620
which is this one has a default icon, what
if you don't know what should be in there.

133
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.081
You could actually create
a empty component and

134
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:25.580
swap that in with all the different
variations that you might want.

135
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.920
We'll actually see that
in like 2 examples.

136
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.352
So I love that question [LAUGH].

137
00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:36.636
But I've always just made
the two variations so

138
00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:43.911
I can just drag in the one I want
cuz what I can basically do here is.

139
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:46.478
Let's say I turn this into a component.

140
00:09:48.201 --> 00:09:50.959
And I'll show you why I've
never tried to do it.

141
00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:55.603
If I make that and
I move this on up here, and

142
00:09:55.603 --> 00:09:58.970
I put them in a frame together.

143
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.551
And then I drag in either one of them.

144
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.680
Right the reason I've never tried to do
that really is because as soon as I have

145
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.440
them in a folder together,
I can just do this.

146
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.530
And if they inherit from the same
base component, could I do it?

147
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.571
Could I play tricks or like a one pixel
component and do a whole bunch of hacker,

148
00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:23.560
I probably could.

149
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.871
I don't know what gains me over just
having the two next to each other, right?

150
00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:33.458
And that's nice and easy and
stuff like that so could you, possibly,

151
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.340
should you, probably not.
