1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.036
So that is the kind of
basis of components, but

2
00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:04.110
now this is where it gets interesting.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.702
One of the questions that came
up earlier was like, okay, yeah,

4
00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:13.225
but when I make prototypes,
can I have various states, right?

5
00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:18.358
A variant, like, I'm not gonna
have spoiler for loci in here, but

6
00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:24.411
like a variant is the idea of different
states that a button could be in, right?

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.342
And to be clear, you can take
a bunch of different approaches,

8
00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:34.459
in a lot of UIs like the one that we
had back when I worked at Twilio,

9
00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:36.247
when we called paste.

10
00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:39.174
There was a primary button
which was like a blue color,

11
00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:42.560
a secondary button was like a white
button with a blue outline.

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.452
There was a danger button which was
a red button with danger primary button,

13
00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:52.590
danger, secondary button, there were
buttons that look like links, right?

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.582
But we're semantically
buttons in the HTML, right?

15
00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:59.315
There are links that look like buttons,
right?

16
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:04.559
Actually getting, it's one of those things
like getting it like design system,

17
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.664
you can probably do in a day, doing
a reopen design system takes years, right?

18
00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:14.292
I think there was one, so
one talk on Figma where a new designer of

19
00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:18.751
Bumble tried to just create
a component for a chat bubble, and

20
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.499
found out there were 300 variations
of a chat bubble, right?

21
00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.698
A chat bubble with a reply, a chat
bubble with an image, a chat bubble for

22
00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:29.438
each side, so you already
doubled the number there, right?

23
00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:33.458
Like 300 different variations for all
the things, a one with a link in it, so

24
00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:37.550
it's got the preview, think about even
like I messaged or something like that.

25
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.893
Or what have you, there are a lot of
variations for these things, right?

26
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:46.014
Even like I said before, buttons and
input fields alone could have

27
00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:50.961
like 36 variations,
there are a bunch of ways to handle this.

28
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:54.014
One, is to have multiple components,
right?

29
00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:58.713
And another is to have variants, and could
you just do any of these things solely

30
00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:01.330
with either one of these strategies?

31
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.079
You could, we'll make trade-offs,

32
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.872
my suggestion is we're gonna
exploit both strategies, and

33
00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:17.010
my recommendation towards the end
is going to be yes, right?

34
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.246
There's a time and place for both
strategies, and I will give you kind of

35
00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:26.180
like I will shepherd you through this
process and figure out when to use each.

36
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.192
So, my basic thing is, again, and
we say that there's a primary button and

37
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.956
a secondary button, a danger button,
a dangerous secondary button,

38
00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:35.545
those could all be variants.

39
00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:39.629
I'm going to implore you that they should
be their own components, you're like but

40
00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.593
what if I just change the border radius?

41
00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:46.847
I will get there, I will argue that the
state of a given component is it hovered?

42
00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:47.834
Is it active?

43
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.910
Is it focused?

44
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.829
Is it disabled?

45
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.041
That is one component that could
be in these various states,

46
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:59.172
if it is an attribute that you are going
to give it an HTML or a class name no.

47
00:02:59.172 --> 00:03:00.716
If it's an attribute that
you're gonna give it or

48
00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.204
something in the browser like,
is it focused?

49
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:06.046
Anything follows a colon, in the CSS,
I would say is a variant,

50
00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:10.675
anything that's in a class name is
probably actually a separate component,

51
00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:13.040
and we'll figure out how to manage it.

52
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.810
So you can basically have your cake and
eat it too, because who doesn't love cake?

53
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.564
Okay, so when you choose variants,

54
00:03:19.564 --> 00:03:23.540
you have multiple similar components
that share a lot of the same properties.

55
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.537
But, number two is kind
of a point I just made,

56
00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:28.370
you've got some state that you
want to be able to toggle between.

57
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.187
Enabled, disabled, checked, unchecked,
on off for a toggle switch, kind of so on,

58
00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:40.367
and so forth so let's go ahead,
and let's make a button, right?

59
00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:44.386
That theoretically can have
some states to it, right?

60
00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:48.813
Some variants, if you will,
I'm gonna take this button right here,

61
00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:51.890
we will make a real button
set in a little bit, for

62
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.415
now, we'll just grab a button that works,
and I will drag it out here.

63
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.158
And, I'm actually gonna detach
this one real quick, so

64
00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.200
this is just a button that I made.

65
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.744
Here it is, now what I might choose
to do is I'll make another one.

66
00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:15.557
Yeah, I'll make another one, cool,

67
00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:20.950
let's say a button you can hover over it,
and you can click on it.

68
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.987
So this will be our default button, and

69
00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:29.796
this one will be a hover state eventually,
and this one will be our active.

70
00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:34.144
Again, let's just do something
simple here, we'll say,

71
00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:38.405
you hover, it gets a shadow
behind it like it's lifted up,

72
00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:43.030
and maybe when you click on it,
it gets a slightly darker color.

73
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.360
I made a lot of these, like example ones,

74
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.460
without trying to pollute all the styles,
so these have hard coded values.

75
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.550
We could also theoretically switch all of
these and use our new colors that we made

76
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.910
earlier in the course, so, we can say
that this is going to be a brand button.

77
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.550
So be the primary button,
we'll say by default,

78
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.396
we'll change this to
That's a little bright,

79
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:17.276
that's all dark, we'll go with
a brighter color in this case, and

80
00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:20.563
we'll say that this one is
going to be that darker color.

81
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:31.605
Let's actually keep the hover state
the same color as the main button,

82
00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:35.780
but when they click it, it will go
back down and be a little bit darker.

83
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.779
Like again, you can sell these however
you want, you don't like my colors,

84
00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.400
change your colors.

85
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.100
But we have these three states, so I could
do this point is I could select them all,

86
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.170
and you'll notice that I have
this create component set.

87
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:57.078
Yeah, let's do that, and now they get
surrounded in this fancy purple border,

88
00:05:57.078 --> 00:06:01.560
and it's button, and
I'm getting yelled at here.

89
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.628
Some variants of the same
property values apply,

90
00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:07.740
cuz they all have this thing called
property one, and it's set to default.

91
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.237
That's not great, so, we'll say that the
property one is the state that it's in.

92
00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:20.270
All right, sure that one's default,
that makes sense, I like that.

93
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.022
This one will actually
say that it's hover, and

94
00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:28.413
this one will say that it's active,
as soon as I do that,

95
00:06:28.413 --> 00:06:32.530
that warning that we saw before,
goes away.

96
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.158
So I have this idea of a button, this
is a set, if we go over into my assets

97
00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:41.555
right here, and we see the under
variants of the button I just made,

98
00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:45.300
there's just one button in here, right?

99
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:53.050
I can drag it in, and now, I can switch it
between default, hover and active, right?

100
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.424
There's a few other ways
to go about doing this,

101
00:06:56.424 --> 00:07:00.551
let's try it again real quick,
let's just grab a button.

102
00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:10.578
Get out of there, get out,
this is not a component of any sort,

103
00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:15.890
but that as a component,
let's just attach it again.

104
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.029
Just gonna show you another way that you
can make a button, all right, so for

105
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:26.190
this one let's change it to a dangerous
button, so danger primary button.

106
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.019
What I could do is, I could create
a component out of it, neat, and

107
00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:36.369
now I can hit this plus sign, and
you see there's property one I can call,

108
00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:39.530
this one's gonna be called hover.

109
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.154
If I wanna change the name of the property
actually have to go to the set state,

110
00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:49.520
default, and hover, and now you can either
add a new variant or add a new property.

111
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.363
So if I wanted to say disabled or
enabled that would be a new property, but

112
00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:56.639
a new variation of a current
property in this case this state,

113
00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.670
we could say is now hovered or active.

114
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.732
That gives me the same effect, now,

115
00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.075
remember I said you could use
a slash to organize onces.

116
00:08:06.075 --> 00:08:08.068
Well, there's also
a trick that you can do,

117
00:08:08.068 --> 00:08:11.539
let's make one more button because yeah,
who doesn't like making buttons?

118
00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:14.367
Let's go, this one will detach
the instance real quick.

119
00:08:17.053 --> 00:08:21.463
And we'll make a secondary button
in this case, and the strategy for

120
00:08:21.463 --> 00:08:25.798
making the various forms of buttons
is already flawed cuz if I change

121
00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:27.943
the border radius on one of them.

122
00:08:27.943 --> 00:08:31.559
I have to do each at least set
individually, that's not great, but

123
00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.780
we'll see how to handle that in a second.

124
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:41.151
So in this case,
we'll give it a stroke of same color,

125
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:46.413
and we'll take the fill,
and make it light,

126
00:08:46.413 --> 00:08:52.230
and we'll take the text
I'll make it dark again,

127
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:58.497
nope, gotta grab the text there,
I'll say, dark.

128
00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:01.373
I might even make it a white background,
but

129
00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:06.366
I'm not gonna keep this button, so
I'm not gonna over rotate on it, cool.

130
00:09:06.366 --> 00:09:10.192
All right, this is like the Galaxy
mind version of it, you're ready?

131
00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:15.056
I will make three versions of it just
like I did in the initial example.

132
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.355
We'll add the shadow to this one.

133
00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:29.824
Maybe we'll actually make these
two white in the background, and

134
00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:32.181
keep that one as the kind of active.

135
00:09:33.518 --> 00:09:38.561
All right, so that's the button hovering
over it and clicking on it, okay?

136
00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:44.226
If I name these, state equals default,

137
00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:47.725
state equals hover, and

138
00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:53.905
state equals active,
and now I make my set.

139
00:09:59.026 --> 00:10:03.098
You can see that already it automatically
figured it all out for me, right?

140
00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:05.583
So especially if you find yourself like,
all right,

141
00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:08.840
I'm gonna make a whole bunch of
input fields, I'm gonna have focus,

142
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.513
I'm gonna have regular,
I'm gonna have with an error.

143
00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:14.373
I'm gonna have without an error,
I'm gonna have required,

144
00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:17.838
you could theoretically just change a few
words in the naming of each one and

145
00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:20.485
automatically create
the entire set on the fly.

146
00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:24.542
And now you have the ability to drag
in and again, we've named this like,

147
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:26.054
second secondary button.

148
00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:33.708
Danger button, okay,
you might be like, well, what if?

149
00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:35.078
What if?

150
00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:37.157
What if?

151
00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:41.872
Instead of having three sets of
components, I have one button and

152
00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:46.414
I have a whole bunch of variants,
and I'll have like primary,

153
00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:49.776
secondary, danger, danger and secondary.

154
00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:53.128
And then,
they're both set I all have everything,

155
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:57.713
just a series of different toggles,
you can do that, and it will work.

156
00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:01.537
You're like, there's a catch, isn't there?

157
00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:03.442
There is a catch, you can do that in work,

158
00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:06.470
but it does mean that there
only be one entry in here.

159
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.417
You will drag in that button, and you will
tweak all the different settings, for

160
00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:12.275
every single button that you drag in,

161
00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:15.720
you will not be able to drag in
the different kinds of buttons, right?

162
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.707
This one, you don't see the hover state,
or the active state in here, you just

163
00:11:20.707 --> 00:11:25.789
see the default state for each one of
those, how do I know that that's annoying?

164
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.120
Because I did it, and
it doesn't go well, right?

165
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.737
Versus, let's say I drag in a button, and

166
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:41.396
later you wanna drag in
a secondary button, right?

167
00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:45.331
But then later on I wanna make
this one a secondary one, to,

168
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.480
you can go ahead here and
say swap instance, and

169
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.954
just swap it with a different instance if
they're all in the same folder, right?

170
00:11:53.954 --> 00:11:58.072
And the same name, they're all in the same
frame, these are just kind of in this page

171
00:11:58.072 --> 00:12:00.810
overall, that's why that
organization is super key.

172
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.496
Because if you have them all in a similar
name, frame all started with button slash,

173
00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:12.021
whatever, they're all like siblings in
a family that you can just swap between,

174
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:14.687
and also you'll notice that I can say.

175
00:12:19.892 --> 00:12:23.083
The overrides will work,
so here I can say,

176
00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:27.610
as long as the properties
have the same original state.

177
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.173
So we'll swap this one over to a primary,
and

178
00:12:30.173 --> 00:12:34.084
so, this is why I would say that
the given states that a button might be

179
00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:38.486
in hovered or active those can be variants
for reasons that we'll see later.

180
00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:42.781
But actually related components should
actually just be organized together,

181
00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:44.700
could you do it all at variance?

182
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.033
You absolutely could, should you?

183
00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:52.255
Probably not, unless you have a compelling
use case you could do it, but

184
00:12:52.255 --> 00:12:57.575
I have learned the hard way that it is
not a happy place that it leaves me in.

185
00:12:57.575 --> 00:13:02.031
But instead, I end up just having
to tweak things all the time,

186
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:05.660
a few other things is you
can have a description.

187
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.676
The other really cool thing is
if you had a full design system,

188
00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:11.460
like if I was doing this for
my company's design system,

189
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.220
you can actually have
a link to the docs as well.

190
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.001
This, again, is especially if you're
both the developer and the designer, or

191
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:20.893
if you're a designer who's
thinking about developers, and

192
00:13:20.893 --> 00:13:24.530
you're handing this off to developer
the idea that you could link.

193
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.864
To the react props, or the view props
of the component, and have the docks in

194
00:13:28.864 --> 00:13:33.330
there as they're kinda navigating
through the UI is powerful as well.

195
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.047
You can also put words in
the description and search here, and

196
00:13:37.047 --> 00:13:42.054
I'll show up as well, so if you want to
have additional search functionality two,

197
00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:45.120
you can kind of build that in place.

198
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.503
All right, one other trick, and

199
00:13:47.503 --> 00:13:52.698
then I'm gonna give you a little
exercise to do, is, if you'd give them

200
00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:57.913
a name like you see this one I can just
swap between the different states.

201
00:13:57.913 --> 00:14:02.183
If the values of the properties
are true and false,

202
00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:06.171
you get a slightly different UI for
it, right?

203
00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:11.751
So just a little trick a little fun hack
if you will, so let's make a little,

204
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:20.336
I'll make this, and we'll give it

205
00:14:23.568 --> 00:14:28.035
So we'll just say,
checkbox or whatever, and

206
00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:35.080
we'll make a second variation,
here we're gonna say, checked is true.

207
00:14:37.372 --> 00:14:43.826
Checked is false, in the checkbox we'll
put a little rectangle in there for now.

208
00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:51.539
Just something simple, I have a better
looking one that we can use in a second,

209
00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:54.925
but I will start with this,
I will create the variance.

210
00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:02.778
And we'll name it, checkbox,
we'll drag it in, and

211
00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:07.776
now, you can see that instead
of a drop-down with all

212
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:13.909
the different options if it's true and
false, you get a slider.

213
00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:18.340
Just, yeah, if it's gonna be a Boolean
anyway, you might as well treat yourself

214
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.087
to a slider instead of having to like
two clicks instead of one click.
