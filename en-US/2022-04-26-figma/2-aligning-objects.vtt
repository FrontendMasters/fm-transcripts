1
00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:04.355
All right, so you're gonna flip
over to an exercise real quick.

2
00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:07.749
And basically,
cuz listening to me talk about how to

3
00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:12.390
move around the Figma UI is great and
wonderful, highly recommended.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.880
Everyone should listen to me talk.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.103
But probably,

6
00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:21.853
a more useful kind of part of your time
here is to just try a few things out.

7
00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:26.022
We're gonna get all the way into
building drop down menus and

8
00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.775
buttons that hover and have all
the states that we're used to in a UI.

9
00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.939
But if we are still struggling
to get stuff where we need it,

10
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.201
it's going to be a not fun time.

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.432
So this is an initial kind of setup.

12
00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:42.090
The goal is to get a something like this.

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.010
You don't need to get it exactly in
the same position, I don't care.

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.967
But ideally,

15
00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:52.084
we want to figure out how to kind of use
some of these alignment tools as well.

16
00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:56.867
One of the things I would recommend
that you do is press the Cmd or

17
00:00:56.867 --> 00:01:00.666
Ctrl key and go ahead and
get that frame selected.

18
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.756
And what you can do,
you can work in this one if you want.

19
00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.131
You can also hold Option.

20
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.879
You'll notice that when I hold Option or
Alt,

21
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:12.680
I can make a duplicate of any given layer
and have a second version to work with it.

22
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.147
We'll see some tricks that you
can do with that in a second.

23
00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:16.952
But first,

24
00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:22.031
why don't you get comfortable with
the tool that we're gonna use all day?

25
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:26.879
And then we'll kind of do a whole bunch
of these little extensions down here in

26
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:31.817
a second, and we will learn a whole bunch
of other little tricks as we go along.

27
00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:36.093
&gt;&gt; How do I zoom in with hotkeys and
not snap to 50% or 100%?

28
00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:37.032
&gt;&gt; With hotkeys.

29
00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:37.722
&gt;&gt; Is there a way?

30
00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:42.481
&gt;&gt; I think that we all learn together
is on a Mac pinching and zooming works.

31
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.176
The same way works in the browser,
you can do plus and minus, but

32
00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:47.419
it's got a big jump.

33
00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:51.086
The thing that we just learned together
is if I hold Cmd + click on a frame and

34
00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:54.245
hit Shift to, it will zoom in to
just that frame I'm looking at.

35
00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:56.681
Something that we all learn together.

36
00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:01.857
All right, so our mission here was
basically to take the red rectangles and

37
00:02:01.857 --> 00:02:06.311
get them along the same vertical axis and
distributed equally.

38
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:08.547
And the blue rectangles as well.

39
00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:13.407
And then there were a whole bunch of
little extension exercises hanging

40
00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:18.105
out down below that will kind of
mostly complete our understanding of

41
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.923
kind of moving around and
moving stuff around in Figma.

42
00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:24.660
All right, so
here's my kinda cloned version.

43
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.068
Watch this, I'm gonna Cmd +
click on there, I hit Shift+2,

44
00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:30.351
and it's going to zoom in just perfectly.

45
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.571
Most of the time,
I almost always want the sidebars.

46
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.987
But if for some reason you do not,
you can hit Cmd or I assume, Ctrl + ., and

47
00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:42.552
you can hide both sidebars if you need
a little bit more viewing space, right?

48
00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:46.450
As we stream, I'm a little more
zoomed in than I would normally be.

49
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.913
So all that stuff kind of takes up
a little bit more space than when I'm

50
00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:53.807
working on a 27 inch monitor at home,
but both of those are options as well.

51
00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:55.826
Okay, so we have a few options here.

52
00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.325
We can click and drag, I can hit Select,
we'll go see there's a whole bunch

53
00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:04.420
of other ways to go about selecting
multiple things at the same time.

54
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.590
But that's its own section, so
I'm not going to talk about it right now.

55
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.886
So for the distributing part, you can
see that Figma has mostly figured out,

56
00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:21.014
it's kind of clippie, looks like you're
trying to distribute things evenly, right?

57
00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.204
And it's like, yes, I am, right?

58
00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:26.088
So that one's pretty easy for us, and
it gets those most of the way there.

59
00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:30.032
And you can see that when that happens, I
get these fun little, I can change it and

60
00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:32.469
move it to get everything
just the way that I want.

61
00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.169
So if you hold Shift,
it'll go by increments of 10 as well.

62
00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.769
That's sometimes helpful depending
on what you're trying to do,

63
00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.103
but I have that in place.

64
00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:44.631
Then the other part is getting
them along the same axis.

65
00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:45.849
So I could go ahead and

66
00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.313
pick any one of these really
that makes me happiest, right?

67
00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:53.196
That'll work, I can undo,
I can do the center alignment as well.

68
00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.301
Depends on what I'm trying to do.

69
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.010
The trick is usually to
get either the center one

70
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.932
in the right place on
the axis that you're trying.

71
00:04:00.932 --> 00:04:05.363
Or if you're trying to distribute them,
get the top and the bottom one,

72
00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.177
where you want them to go, and

73
00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:10.971
then you can kind of use the tools
to do the rest for you, Mark?

74
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.587
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to find out
the distance between two objects?

75
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:17.164
&gt;&gt; Yes, so the way to find
the distance between two objects is

76
00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:21.617
you grab the starting position, and
you hold down either Option or Alt.

77
00:04:21.617 --> 00:04:25.026
And then you can kind of
move your mouse around, and

78
00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:28.208
you can kind of figure
out what the distance is.

79
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:32.002
Obviously, if it's just towards the edges,
you'll see that.

80
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:36.840
If it's kind of make a right turn
main street, you'll see kind of both

81
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.770
directions on your way there,
I guess the fastest route, not really.

82
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.789
But kind of both the x and
the y axis to where the other one is.

83
00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.708
Again, these are the things that are not
only helpful for getting your designs,

84
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:51.222
right?

85
00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:55.272
But also when you are on
the receiving end of these designs,

86
00:04:55.272 --> 00:05:00.303
very useful figuring out how far is
that icon from the text in that button?

87
00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.053
All right, cuz previously, I would
just like hit Refresh consistently.

88
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:08.334
One dangerous thing that we will learn
is the option key has two things.

89
00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:13.237
When we get to extension, I'll show you
this again, which is holding the Option

90
00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:16.931
key and moving mouse around will
show you all the distances.

91
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.084
As we saw when we copied the frame,

92
00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:23.467
holding it while dragging will
accidentally make you lots of copies,

93
00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:27.348
which I accidentally do more
times than I would like to admit.

94
00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:30.365
So that's a thing that can happen as well.

95
00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.965
But if you find yourself accidentally
making a copy, take your hand off

96
00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:37.392
the Option key, and you'll go back
to just moving things, right?

97
00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:41.523
So just hands off and you can kind go
back and figure stuff out as well.

98
00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:45.693
And you can also see as you're moving
stuff around, it will show you the guides.

99
00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:50.092
If you are holding the Alt key, this is
where I make the mistake all the time, it

100
00:05:50.092 --> 00:05:54.706
both duplicates and will also show you the
kind of distance from when you started.

101
00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:59.921
So you just have to either, a, be careful
to let go of the Alt key before you let

102
00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:05.402
go of holding down the mouse, or B,
just be comfortable deleting the original.

103
00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:10.626
This isn't ink on paper, you can see
the computer, you just change stuff.

104
00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:13.622
So both of those kinds of
work in that sense as well.

105
00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:16.015
So here, I can align them by hand,

106
00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:19.166
distributing them is
a little bit trickier.

107
00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:24.864
You'll see that it will snap as well,
but I can also kind of select them all,

108
00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:29.138
get them mostly where I need them to be,
not that one, and

109
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:34.152
then distribute them or kind of
change any of those pieces as well.

110
00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:38.970
So I can then distribute horizontally,
and now they'll be even there as well.

111
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.590
Let's go ahead and look at some of these
extensions cuz some of these are useful

112
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.050
and helpful, and we'll use them later.

113
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.765
We did this one already,

114
00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:52.515
this is when you have things that
are already kind of mostly aligned.

115
00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:57.332
You can grab the pink handle here and
kind of evenly move them all around, so

116
00:06:57.332 --> 00:06:59.250
you're not doing one by one.

117
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.369
And so we did that, cool.

118
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:04.075
All right, this one's pretty neat.

119
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:09.424
So you can also duplicate a layer
by hitting Cmd or Ctrl + D, right?

120
00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:12.787
And that will duplicate one
exactly where it is presently,

121
00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:17.629
which if you're not thinking it's the end
of the day, it means you're forgetting,

122
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.821
leave one on top of the other one,
and then be, why didn't it duplicate?

123
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:24.373
It did, just in the same position.

124
00:07:24.373 --> 00:07:26.907
That's never happened to me this week.

125
00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:30.123
The other thing you can
do is if you hold Alt and

126
00:07:30.123 --> 00:07:35.216
you make that copy as we saw before,
okay, cool, this is 24 pixels.

127
00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:37.229
That seems like a multiple of eight,
I like 24.

128
00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.923
That's a good number, and let's say I
needed to make a bunch of these red boxes.

129
00:07:40.923 --> 00:07:44.620
I could hold Alt again,
try to get to another 24 pixels, or

130
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.752
I could just do it and I can use
those tools to distribute evenly, and

131
00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:53.199
then hope that they're all 24, and
then adjust with the pink handle.

132
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:57.892
Once I've dragged one with Alt,
I can hit Cmd + D, and

133
00:07:57.892 --> 00:08:02.892
I'll make more of them of
the same distance between the two

134
00:08:02.892 --> 00:08:07.704
layers of the last time I held Alt or
Option and dragged.

135
00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:10.557
So that works as well,
we got that one done.

136
00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:13.823
All right,
we saw the ability to switch objects.

137
00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:18.956
So if I kind of put these in place here,
let's grab some red and some blue.

138
00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:25.795
We'll go ahead and
we'll distribute them, tidy up.

139
00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:29.479
You see these little dots in here,
I can hold Cmd and

140
00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:32.230
effectively swap two items, right?

141
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.484
So it'll just swap the position
of both of them, and

142
00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:42.390
I don't have to move one and then try
to remember where the other one was.

143
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.176
Because when I was first
learning this tool,

144
00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:49.811
did I write down the x and y positions
in either a text editor or on a notepad?

145
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:53.398
Maybe, do I ever want to do that again?

146
00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:54.328
I don't, right?

147
00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:55.033
And again,

148
00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:59.341
some of these things are the things
that will get you from a frustrating.

149
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:01.297
Cuz normally, this is all fine and

150
00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:04.471
good to do things the hard way
until you have a deadline.

151
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.454
So we've got that in place.

152
00:09:07.454 --> 00:09:09.588
We said before, if you hold Shift,

153
00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:14.439
it'll mostly stay along the axis unless
it is fully snapping to something else.

154
00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:18.561
But if you're worried about just kind
of going off a pixel, holding Shift and

155
00:09:18.561 --> 00:09:21.362
moving around will take care of that for
you as well.

156
00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:25.793
And as we saw with a question earlier,
if I hold Alt and move my mouse around,

157
00:09:25.793 --> 00:09:28.232
I can see the distance between two lines.

158
00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:33.125
We have one other trick for getting
stuff aligned appropriately that is

159
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.071
super useful, which is not on by default.

160
00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:39.095
But if I hit Shift + R,
I get these rulers,

161
00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:43.800
which will kind of show me where
stuff is in relationship to the x and

162
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.095
y axis of the entire
page that I'm looking at.

163
00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:52.154
But I can also drag from a ruler,
either from the left side or from the top.

164
00:09:52.154 --> 00:09:58.290
I can drag the ruler out, leave a ruler
in place, so I can leave it right here,

165
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.653
and then I can go and
just snap stuff over there as well.

166
00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:06.199
So yeah, that is kind of basically how
you can kind of get stuff aligned,

167
00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:10.270
move stuff around, a bunch of the kind of
tricks for duplicating, measuring, and

168
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.570
stuff along those lines.
