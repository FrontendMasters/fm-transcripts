1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.878
Is there a way to create a version
of styling typography in figma?

2
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:08.696
&gt;&gt; For example?

3
00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.141
&gt;&gt; For example, let's say our in
house UI component libraries on

4
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.262
the latest version with the new
styling and typography,

5
00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:18.332
but our old products use
the old version of the library.

6
00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:22.062
For some reason, we're not able
to bump the version I don't know.

7
00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:23.818
Seems like a very specific question.

8
00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:27.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that
you can't do that just may or

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.689
may not answer the question
I wish you could do in

10
00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.720
figma is like cool we have
a team library or whatever.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.006
But then also like, I wish I could
override it for this design,

12
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.726
like sometimes it's like, cool,
the design system has moved on, but

13
00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:42.776
everyone's got that legacy
app that can't get updated.

14
00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.776
It's like cool new
design systems in react.

15
00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:46.719
We got a backbone app over there.

16
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.322
Did what I mean I wish you could
like override versions of it.

17
00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:53.490
But it's like the overall
design system has moved on, and

18
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.918
they're using the library other
than having two libraries and

19
00:00:56.918 --> 00:00:59.957
like having the like,
effectively, we had to do this,

20
00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:03.017
which is like we had the old version and
the new version.

21
00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:05.962
And different themes that we
had to use in both places.

22
00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:10.014
For things we couldn't update I don't
know if that answers the question.

23
00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:15.782
So another question is it recommend to
start components from scratch or use

24
00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:21.929
some predefined material design components
and just you use it depends right.

25
00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.796
I think that generally speaking,
if it's like, hey,

26
00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:28.274
we're a brand new project, yeah.

27
00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:33.059
Go grab material, UI,
chakra, UI, whatever, right?

28
00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:36.986
And start with that versus, I'm now
gonna build basic functionality and

29
00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:41.245
get a proof of concept in place and also
develop a design system at the same time.

30
00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:47.179
Now at Temporal, for instance, we were
working on for a brand identity as well,

31
00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.091
right and so like the UI needs to
match the overall brand aesthetic.

32
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:56.165
We were also using smell instead of
react where there were less pre existing

33
00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:57.919
libraries to begin with right.

34
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.217
We did use tailwind that got
us like most of the way there,

35
00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.502
right that had all the different kinds
of like Tokens that one might need.

36
00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:08.578
And our design language is also
built on top of tail and so

37
00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:10.682
do we grab a full set of components no.

38
00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:15.007
But also that was part about using hipster
frameworks is that there wasn't as much

39
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.574
out there and
think it was a lot of times easier for

40
00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:21.857
us to just style the button with tailwind,
which was like again, super simple.

41
00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.780
You just string a bunch of
classes are mostly ready to go.

42
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.360
You can theme it that said if like you
don't have that whole idea of like we have

43
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.446
a brand identity yet we're just trying to
get something work again, grab material.

44
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:37.454
And like there are if you go into the
community section in figma there is like

45
00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:38.092
a material UI.

46
00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:41.513
A set of components that you can
just bring in and use, right?

47
00:02:41.513 --> 00:02:44.389
Absolutely we're working
on 2.0 of our app.

48
00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.089
So like the original one was,

49
00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.907
I wasn't even to say that it was
a component library was generous.

50
00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:51.244
It's just a thing, right?

51
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.533
But like,
this was the kind of like refresh and

52
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.124
stuff along those lines for us.

53
00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:55.655
But yeah,

54
00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:59.566
I think there's nothing wrong with
pulling in a component library all right.

55
00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:02.329
Yeah, there was a question
about recommended plugins.

56
00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.639
I left a link to a bunch.

57
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.963
This is my favorite named one, but

58
00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:10.582
you can just try like content
released by Microsoft.

59
00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:15.326
I have a few installed,there is iconified,
which is just like every icon library, and

60
00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:19.188
you can just drag them in, so
you don't have to like download them all.

61
00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:23.286
With that said, like,
if you're gonna do that component trick,

62
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:28.418
just downloading the like Git repo of like
all the SVGs, dragging them into figma.

63
00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:31.761
And making the component is way
easier than adding zahlen one by one.

64
00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:34.828
But if you're just kind of like
proof of concept and something and

65
00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:37.680
you need a house or whatever,
just like go grab it.

66
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.297
Content real is real cool.

67
00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:42.792
Let's take a look at one real quick.

68
00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:46.968
It basically gives you
the ability to like, let's see,

69
00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:49.231
did I have a cool picture here?

70
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:53.609
Like preload, like dummy data, like
fake avatars and stuff along those lines

71
00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.877
in the UI and kind of just have
some of that kind of in place.

72
00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.055
So you'd not like dragging in a whole
bunch of pictures of users for

73
00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:01.247
like a comment section or

74
00:04:01.247 --> 00:04:04.505
something along those lines helps
you like load in some dummy data.

75
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:09.353
But yeah I put in a bunch of kind
of little ones in here like as well

76
00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:11.912
that you can kind of try try out and

77
00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:17.241
use to unsplashed just gives you
stock photography stuff like that.

78
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:20.269
But generally speaking I think I
said either during the break or

79
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.922
maybe we said it in part of the recording
when I feel like I need something like

80
00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:27.429
accessibility to color contrasting
I will go to the community section.

81
00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:31.482
I will hit plugins I will search
I will then sort by installs.

82
00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:35.067
[LAUGH] and I will usually grab whatever
the most popular one is first and

83
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:38.554
then if it doesn't appeal to me then
I'll grab the next one as well.

84
00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:43.268
But you can see like look it's on slash
and I kind of phi and content real and

85
00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:46.450
a few other ones as well and
that is kind of like our.

86
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.447
I like high level kind of view of using
figma to both implement designs kind of

87
00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:54.640
work with our designers to like organize
things in a way that makes sense for us.

88
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.656
But then also for

89
00:04:55.656 --> 00:05:00.604
ourselves to begin to figure stuff out
because like I said in the very beginning.

90
00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:04.679
This workshop, there's been plenty of
times where I've tried to build a feature

91
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.460
either when I didn't in the early days
in my current company where we didn't

92
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.739
have a designer yet, which is like, okay,
I know that we need to build these things.

93
00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:14.680
And a lot of times it was about
getting the data abstractions, right?

94
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.135
But it's kinda out take lucky guesses,
right?

95
00:05:18.135 --> 00:05:22.865
There's a term of art something around and
find out.

96
00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:27.628
But like to figure out how to work versus
like actually being able to conceptualize

97
00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:31.631
it I think it works really well kind
of put it in front of customers also

98
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.859
like being able to work with the tool.

99
00:05:33.859 --> 00:05:38.210
And understand like how how to play or
how that helps you.

100
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.727
Figuring out the alignment,
what CSS you might need also bring order.

101
00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.286
So if you just expect the designer
on your team to know how to

102
00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:48.595
organize everything and
how to lay everything out.

103
00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:50.232
So that it works for engineers,

104
00:05:50.232 --> 00:05:53.699
that's kind of just putting the on
us on one-half of the equation.

105
00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.996
Engineering and
design should be a partnership.

106
00:05:55.996 --> 00:06:00.348
So this gives you the ability to kind of
be an equal player in there as well and

107
00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:04.443
collaborate or build some designs
yourself right both are possible.

108
00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:09.107
But I think like we think a lot about
the term like full stack developer

109
00:06:09.107 --> 00:06:12.659
right which is there are jokes
to be made about that.

110
00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.911
Whereas like cool back end and
front end, but

111
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:17.172
like, that's not all of a product, right?

112
00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:19.468
And do you need to be an expert?

113
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:20.546
Maybe not right.

114
00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:23.715
And but like, should you have
familiarity with the old the,

115
00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:27.890
kind of like entire pipeline of
building products for your customers?

116
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.151
My argument is yes,right.

117
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.329
And so this helps you get to kind of round
yourself out whether it's kind of just

118
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:34.165
one more tool.

119
00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:38.983
Do you have at your disposal or thing
that you're using to kinda decide what

120
00:06:38.983 --> 00:06:42.806
you're building I think both
become a lot more possible and

121
00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:45.957
I think that figma is
incredibly powerful tool.

122
00:06:45.957 --> 00:06:49.645
And something that like just be being
more comfortable to tool has been a great

123
00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:53.102
advantage for me as I kind of build and
implement do my just day to day job,

124
00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:55.278
above and
beyond just side products as well.

125
00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.395
Awesome, thank you so much.

126
00:06:57.395 --> 00:06:59.494
[APPLAUSE]
