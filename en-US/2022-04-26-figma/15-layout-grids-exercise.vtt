00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.475
What I want you to try to
do is just get comfortable.

2
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:06.401
You have two jobs.

3
00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:10.874
One is, this is a small little frame here,

4
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:18.228
make a two column grid with 36
pixel margins and 16 pixel gutters.

5
00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:22.342
But then use two grids, right?

6
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.963
And this might seem silly at first.

7
00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:25.401
We'll see why you might
wanna do it in a second.

8
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:29.090
We wanna make a one column grid.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.301
You're like,
why would I want a one column grid?

10
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:32.404
Bear with me.

11
00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:36.587
A one column grid that has one row,
one column, and

12
00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:40.490
let's give it 20 pixel
margins on each side.
