00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
So I'm gonna unhide just like
one possible solution here.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.868
As you can see,
it does the things I centered one,

3
00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:09.454
I have the other one stretch.

4
00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:13.244
And I think that in this case they
vertically don't stretch, they

5
00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.914
horizontally stretch, as if I had this one
kind of centered with either Flexbox or

6
00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:22.581
margin auto, up here and then this one is
like a width of maybe 100 inside of a div

7
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:24.977
that's got its own margins or whatever.

8
00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:29.205
But they don't grow in height
just like they wouldn't in

9
00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:32.478
the browser unless I
did other crazy stuff.

10
00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:37.193
I'm not going to go on a rant
about how height 100% and

11
00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:40.290
CSS does not mean anything.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.610
Does not do it with 100% dozen CSS, that's
not a talk that I'm gonna have right now.

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150
But how would we implement this?

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.950
Okay, so let's put out everything the way
it was and go up to this top bar.

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.830
And we're gonna say that for left and
right, yeah, bound to that left and

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.660
right do the same for the bottom.

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.851
And I can also you can see I can,
click on stuff in here, but

18
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.980
like I don't have the skills to do that.

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.740
So let's see.

20
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.860
For here we'll say center, and for this
one, again, I kept it bound to the top.

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.880
This one is just for funsies.

22
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.330
I'm going to constrain it to the bottom,
and we'll have it scale.

23
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.457
I don't know what's gonna happen.

24
00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:29.744
This one should grow left and right as I
go, but it should stick to the bottom.

25
00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:33.600
Let's see, let's grab the frame by
holding command, getting in there.

26
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.670
Cool, so that works as expected.

27
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.544
The navbar was not constrained to
the bottom now, in this case so

28
00:01:40.544 --> 00:01:42.927
let's go ahead and we'll say bottom.

29
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:50.020
So now it follows along the bottom like a
footer or something along those lines, but

30
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.011
it should stretch.

31
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.330
So yeah, if I made this.

32
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.490
If grabbed it and
I kind of placed it here and here,

33
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.843
it might be like the please accept
all cookies before continuing

34
00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:07.598
banner that we all greatly enjoy
as we use the web as well,

35
00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:11.700
but yeah, so those are constraints.

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.026
Again like a relatively simple concept
that if you didn't take the time to

37
00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:18.748
explore can be maddening
cause you're like,

38
00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:22.024
why is stuff not moving the way
that it would on the web and

39
00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:26.070
the way that I want it to just
gotta tweak a few little things.

40
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.659
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So

41
00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.769
once you've gone through the trouble
setting up constraints, is there a quick,

42
00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.420
easy way to say you wanna duplicate
the iPhone 1 and make like an iPad 1?

43
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.102
Do you just usually duplicate and
then drag it up big or

44
00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:39.350
is there a quicker way to do that?

45
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.200
&gt;&gt; Yes-ish, right?

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.630
So you have stuff like components,
but usually the constraints- so

47
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.020
components which we'll get to in a second.

48
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.982
The great way think about is
like classes and instances.

49
00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.415
You can have a nav bar and
then many instances of that nav bar and

50
00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:54.811
then when you change it.

51
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:58.646
However, for
most things the constraints don't stick so

52
00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:02.018
you still eventually have to for
each given setup.

53
00:03:02.018 --> 00:03:05.690
Cause you might not always
want the same thing, right?

54
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.967
Like how you want it to behave
like an iPhone might be

55
00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:13.700
different than on Chrome, right?

56
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.349
So generally speaking there is a way to
writ large do what you're asking him but

57
00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.150
like with constraints, not all not
always today, like Transfer over, right?

58
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.310
So for a few cases you'll have
to kinda set it up yourself.

59
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.672
There will be some tricks that will
kind of show you how to do that and

60
00:03:30.672 --> 00:03:34.338
it depends on very much a use case
specific thing cause, never doing it,

61
00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:36.120
it's slightly annoying.

62
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.110
Always doing it would be really annoying,
right?

63
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.043
So it's a trade off.
