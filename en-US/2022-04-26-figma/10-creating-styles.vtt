00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.737
What you're going to do for
a quick second is try that out,

2
00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:04.322
I have some typography down here.

3
00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:08.536
You're gonna grab the textiles generator,
these are in the your case already named,

4
00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:09.987
if you don't like the names.

5
00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:11.686
If you don't like the fonts, if you,

6
00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:14.771
I don't wanna look at these font is
I implemented my own components,

7
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.612
go ahead tweak some of the line
spacing tweak some of the fonts.

8
00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.837
If you wanna change the colors go
ahead you can do that as well and

9
00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:26.557
kind of get yourself a set of styles
that you're gonna use for the day.

10
00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:31.207
Ready to rock and roll as we begin to
implement some kinda reusable buttons and

11
00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:34.927
input fields and drop down menus and
stuff along those lines,

12
00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:39.787
put together a color scheme that pleases
you and then you can use that one I'll use

13
00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:43.040
mine and we'll figure stuff
out together as we go on.

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.300
So now we can use basically the same
technique for generating the typography.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.102
As we saw it's just a different, plugin in
this case, does basically the same thing.

16
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:59.539
I did make a second one whether or
not named specifically and

17
00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.000
that's going to, sure should work.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.540
So let's grab all these and
I'm just gonna select them all.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.270
And then if you have
the textiles generator plugin,

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.336
you can just go and
generate those as well.

21
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:19.876
It does like rearrange stuff
it's basically applying whatever

22
00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:22.489
the name of the style was to the text.

23
00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:27.431
In this case and you can see now that
I've got a bunch of headings and

24
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.000
paragraphs that I can use as well.

25
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.424
All right, so let's actually look at
like how to reverse engineer this,

26
00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:38.120
from this page that we saw before.

27
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.343
Now, I have some color swatches here,

28
00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:47.560
that I mostly just kind of ,what I did
was I selected this entire section.

29
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.553
What I did was I basically I looked at all
of this and I tried to figure out okay,

30
00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.333
what are all the colors here and
as you can kind of see.

31
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.519
If you need to unlink a style any
point you just hit detach and

32
00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.789
you go back to the hex code, if you wanna
break from your system went through like

33
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.960
what are all the general colors here and
laid them out.

34
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.892
There were nine shades
of gray in this case.

35
00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:11.718
At temporarily use tailwind as
the kind of the basis and so

36
00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:16.663
that's kind of where I started with
the whole numbering system that we use

37
00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:22.020
in the previous example someone asked
like, what are the numbers mean?

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.940
Usually, I kind of took them from
the ones that the color palette comes

39
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.000
with tailwind, we go 50 for
a very light color all the way up to 900.

40
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.090
So we've got nine
different shades of gray.

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.060
There's one here it's just roughly the
same as the background of the page itself.

42
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.350
You can see it there.

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.190
Also you can change the background,
the page if you want.

44
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.872
And so I've got these colors, so
I took the other colors that existed and

45
00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:53.370
just tried to roughly I like lining
them up in this case, right?

46
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.193
And you don't have to in this
in this particular case like you

47
00:02:58.193 --> 00:03:03.111
don't need this color palette,
but if I wanted to go ahead and

48
00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:08.520
turn this into a color themes,
I can change different pieces here.

49
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.750
I could do that pretty easily.

50
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.600
So I'm gonna grab these,
I'm just gonna ungroup this.

51
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.520
Am not gonna mess around with the colors.

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.250
The gray is too much.

53
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.735
I'm just gonna grab these colors, which
again I have named and I will probably end

54
00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:25.102
up deleting this at some point so you
don't have to follow along particularly.

55
00:03:25.102 --> 00:03:27.523
But this is how to like reverse engineer.

56
00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:31.382
If you have a bunch of designs,
and you want to figure out, hey,

57
00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:34.270
cool, they use text values everywhere.

58
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.640
And I want to do the thing that I learned
about in that course that I watched.

59
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.040
How do I get us there?

60
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.160
This is kinda how you would reverse
engineer that a little bit.

61
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.100
So in this case,
I did go ahead I named them all.

62
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.921
I called it just like primary,
secondary, and then tertiary.

63
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:54.356
I don't know Mark probably knows
better what the actual like names of

64
00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:56.340
the color in the CSS are.

65
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.920
But I was reverse engineering this and
not going through the source code.

66
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.130
So I took a screenshot,,
that's all I had to work with in my case.

67
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.860
So you can see I have
all these colors here.

68
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.646
I could use that plugin that we
saw before and I go ahead and

69
00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:16.957
this case I'm just going to do the,
which one styler hit generate styles.

70
00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:21.612
And now I have these new primary,
secondary and tertiary.

71
00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:26.984
Now there's a little bit of like
bespoke pieces here where I kind

72
00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:32.470
of need to go ahead and
turn any given one of these colors, right?

73
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.881
So this is selecting the entire frame
if given me everything that is that

74
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:44.030
shade of blue, which looks to be, this one
is I think that dark blue right there.

75
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.220
So I can go ahead and just pick this one
And I have those colors I just made, cool.

76
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.153
Now, if I go into this right here,

77
00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:55.437
you can see this now that we've
linked it up to that style.

78
00:04:55.437 --> 00:05:00.267
There was one thing of that color, but the
cool thing about this is I can select all,

79
00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.730
I can be, all right, neat.

80
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.740
What I would like you to
do now is go ahead and

81
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.930
let's grab me say this one's easy, right?

82
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.849
That's going to be get everything
on the page that that's color and

83
00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.061
make it the secondary color, right?

84
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:16.287
Grab the darker one,

85
00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:20.180
we'll make it the slightly darker
version of the secondary color.

86
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.575
This looks like.

87
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.718
That one.

88
00:05:32.146 --> 00:05:35.046
And I could read the hex
codes too as well.

89
00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:38.720
Go ahead and let's see,
that looks like the medium one.

90
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.378
See I got yep,
that one looks slightly wrong.

91
00:05:41.378 --> 00:05:45.347
You can see a change on the page
because they're all that color now.

92
00:05:46.523 --> 00:05:51.666
So maybe it's the slightly darker one,
there we go.

93
00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:54.582
This should be the medium one.

94
00:05:54.582 --> 00:05:58.812
I think that was most of the colors
the rest of them all grays.

95
00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:00.162
So now see?

96
00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:03.137
Yep, so now if I wanted to,
I could go ahead, and

97
00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:07.222
like rebrand the front end
masters colors really easily.

98
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:09.242
Or the masthead I missed, too.

99
00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:11.700
So let's grab that it
was just a darker color.

100
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.370
So we'll go ahead and We'll go ahead,
and we'll say that that is now.

101
00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:25.370
This color.

102
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.380
So now if I wanted to quickly
rebrand this entire site,

103
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.089
I could cuz that's that's what
Mark brought me here for right so

104
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.640
we could say like let's grab
this color and let's adjust it.

105
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.843
What's this we'll get that
I can hear the groaning.

106
00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:53.354
I can kinda say multiple things as I
change all the buttons all at once and

107
00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:55.309
kind of re theme and restyle this page and

108
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.609
my styles will update everything
across the entire applications.

109
00:06:58.609 --> 00:07:00.439
This works for one frame.

110
00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.920
But imagine you have like
multiple pages of every flow.

111
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.569
Going into the front end master site,
you can basically change all the colors

112
00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.939
incredibly easily, reverse engineering
it from just a few pages, and

113
00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.520
then applying it all the way through,
right?

114
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.050
Yeah.

115
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.913
&gt;&gt; So
once you've made all the color styles,

116
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:19.140
how can you quickly figure out what
the expo was if you'd like forgotten?

117
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, It's a great question.

118
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.340
So if you need to kind of figure out cool,

119
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.420
I've now made this code now I
see primary 500 everywhere.

120
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.940
I just go ahead and
first of all, I go into inspect.

121
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.480
It's still there in this case.

122
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.190
So I will always have
the hex code somewhere.

123
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.460
I even get the RGBA or
whatever style you prefer.

124
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.023
And then you can also go
to edit the style and

125
00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:43.790
you can change the hex code there as well.

126
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.580
So it could work the other way.

127
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.899
I want to get the hex code or someone came
in with, here's the new hex codes for

128
00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:51.440
our new branding, right?

129
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.170
You could also go to edit style and
paste in the hex codes as well, right?

130
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.511
Or make a bunch of layers the same
way I generated styles to begin with,

131
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.749
you could also just adjust
those watches again, and

132
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:06.120
then regenerate styles a second time,
right?

133
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.332
One of things we also
referenced is in some cases,

134
00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:12.470
there's a whole big color theme, right?

135
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.507
If you wanna get is you can see I just
grabbed just the shades that were on

136
00:08:16.507 --> 00:08:18.100
this page, right?

137
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.810
And so let's say hypothetically well.

138
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.383
Let's go back to the normal colors.

139
00:08:23.383 --> 00:08:28.518
I was, all right let's grab at least
these kind of middle colors here.

140
00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:34.749
If I wanted to there's another plugin that
I'll drop a link to which there's a whole

141
00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:40.656
bunch of these honestly called UI color
palette which will take a set of colors.

142
00:08:40.656 --> 00:08:43.988
And then generate the entire pallet for
you.

143
00:08:43.988 --> 00:08:49.173
So you can hit create color palette and
then from here, you can say update

144
00:08:49.173 --> 00:08:55.309
local styles and it will push up all 50
through 900 of those color styles for you.

145
00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:58.366
All right, so if you only have
a few colors to work with and

146
00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:02.701
you're again like in my case of reverse
engineering that one page, I'm cool but

147
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:04.250
now I do need a lighter blue.

148
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.777
I'm not good enough for color theory
myself to figure it out I can at least

149
00:09:09.777 --> 00:09:15.502
have some help and generate a full
palette of all the basic colors, right?

150
00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:19.417
And that'll kind of get you can then
update the local styles you'll get.

151
00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:20.840
Let's just hit the button,
see what happens.

152
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.810
Create local styles.

153
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.125
And now not only do I but
I also have a full, so

154
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:34.492
it has some slight little issue there,
but I have a full

155
00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:42.450
set of colors that I can also use as
well generated from those other ones.

156
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.850
But I'm gonna delete all those in a second
anyway cuz now I have way too many colors

157
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.350
and I will just get confused later.

158
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.630
But we've got those ones.

159
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.990
So you can just generate a full
color palette with a few colors.

160
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.548
If you have one, wherever you work, you
can kind of turn it into a set of Figma

161
00:09:56.548 --> 00:10:01.335
styles, you have a bunch of options that
you can use for getting stuff in place.

162
00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:03.442
And that's kind of the basics of styles.

163
00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:06.523
We'll revisit styles a few more times
as we look at the components and layout

164
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.220
grids and all the other stuff that styles
can do that we just haven't covered yet.

165
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.120
But now we have the basis of at least
some amount of a typography system.

166
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.192
We've got some amount of a color
scheme that we can use for

167
00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:20.788
all these things and we're not
hand selecting colors every time.

168
00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:23.843
They have a roughly a semantic
meaning that we can use and

169
00:10:23.843 --> 00:10:26.380
we've got most of the kind
of pieces in place.
