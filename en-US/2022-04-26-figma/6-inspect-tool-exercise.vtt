00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.915
Just try it out for

2
00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:04.165
a little bit cuz you will be on
the receiving end of design at one point,

3
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:08.044
whether it's your own or somebody else's,
is we've got a template of a code pen.

4
00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:10.948
And you can cheat and look at the answer.

5
00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:14.854
But take a second and see, okay, let's
get comfortable just playing around and

6
00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:18.080
inspecting some of the different
pieces like, what font is this?

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.953
And what font weight and
stuff along those lines.

8
00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.608
It might be otherwise kind of
tedious to play around with.

9
00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:26.247
The Inspect tool is super useful for
you as an engineer,

10
00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:27.889
as you go to implement the design.

11
00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:31.880
So take a few minutes,
fire up the code pen, try to implement it.

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.213
We'll just look at the completed example
at the very end to see what we ended up

13
00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:38.430
with so you can compare notes or
you can just look at it, as well.

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.191
But take a little bit, play around with
the Inspect tool, get a sense of it,

15
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:41.850
get a feel for it.
