00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:07.929
what I did with the card component,
all right?

3
00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:15.312
Your job, is basically input fields and
not dissimilar from buttons.

4
00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:18.303
Go ahead and
create yourself an input field,

5
00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:23.667
the auto layout is a little bit different,
but create the idea of an input field.

6
00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:27.568
And then let's make a component out of it,
and now we can drag in more,

7
00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:31.420
we can change the text in any given
input field and all that fun stuff.
