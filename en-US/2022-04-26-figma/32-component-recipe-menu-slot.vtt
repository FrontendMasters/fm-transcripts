1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.280
What about a drop down menu, right?

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.840
Do I have to make bespoke
drop down menus every time?

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.920
We know that I might use a variant for,
is it open or is it closed, right?

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.820
But do I want to reimplement
this component for

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.831
every drop down menu in my library?

6
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.040
Probably not.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.244
The trick that we're gonna use here is,
effectively,

8
00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:30.190
the opened menu is gonna have
this bad boy right here.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.037
This is basically,
it's a placeholder component

10
00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:39.517
that I can then swap out with
anything else that I want, right?

11
00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:42.277
And so what I'll have is a menu
where I can change the text.

12
00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:45.130
It'll have the variants of open and
closed, right?

13
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.776
But then for the instances,
it'll have this invisible menu that

14
00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:52.340
I could swap with any menu that I want,
in this case, right?

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.932
So let's actually go and
grab both of these.

16
00:00:56.977 --> 00:00:59.870
And we'll paste them in here.

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.060
Nope, I always paste in there,
it's in the exact same spot.

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.530
We'll drag them out here for a second.

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.949
All right, so
it's just an open and closed.

20
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:11.350
It's very much like the input
fields that we designed earlier.

21
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.110
We've done this trick enough times.

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.710
It's just using auto layout.

23
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.080
It's nothing that we haven't seen before.

24
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.042
And then we have this idea.

25
00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:22.276
Well, this is SVG cuz I
couldn't get the visual.

26
00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:24.714
It's really hard to take a picture
of an invisible component,

27
00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:25.825
let's just put it that way.

28
00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:33.613
And so what we'll do is we'll also
create this frame that is going to be,

29
00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:46.844
What's the width of this?

30
00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:51.430
This is 240, this one is 240 by 1 pixel.

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.992
Again, it is somewhat hard to
get my hands on this thing.

32
00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:03.936
Okay, so we'll call this one Menu Slot.

33
00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:10.016
And I think someone in the chat also asked
about, are we gonna do slot components?

34
00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:11.926
So this is that technique right here.

35
00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:15.758
And what I'll do is,
I will turn this into a component.

36
00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:19.277
All right so
we've got this Menu Slot component.

37
00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:22.020
And then we can also take a menu, right?

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.910
You might have for
the different menus that you might use.

39
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.120
And again, you could theoretically use the
trick from above where it's super long and

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.700
you shorten it.

41
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.308
In this case, if the menu is just text,
you actually don't need to do the trick

42
00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:38.320
where you slot in child components again,
because you can override text.

43
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.708
If you wanna do craziness,
whether it's in Mac OS,

44
00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:45.407
whether it's this menu, and
then a child menu, right?

45
00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:49.360
You can combine these tricks
in all sorts of gnarly ways.

46
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.575
But we can have the second component here,
which we'll say is,

47
00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:02.055
Let's call it Menu Items,
in this case, right?

48
00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:05.141
And that will be a component,

49
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.826
as well, Right?

50
00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:14.011
And now we'll drag in an instance
of my invisible component.

51
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:28.373
I'm gonna put it up against,
let me just move it

52
00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:33.410
manually where I'll just add,
I don't know, 8.

53
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.195
8 seems good?

54
00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:40.530
Right, so you've got one with and
one without.

55
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.877
Now, I do need to make this a frame.

56
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.198
And so this will be, Open is true,

57
00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:53.211
this one will be open=false.

58
00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:01.638
And now what we can do is,
create the components set.

59
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.370
And we can drag it in,
and you see the variation.

60
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.830
Nothing really happens, right?

61
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.300
You can see it growing cuz
it's got that invisible one.

62
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.586
But, as we saw before,
we can swap component instances.

63
00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:26.059
We can't do anything else with components
in terms of changing their layout.

64
00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:31.061
But if it has an instance in it,
you can get your hands on.

65
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.112
I should make the field clear for
the empty one, but for

66
00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:36.978
right now it's serving me [LAUGH],
it's visible.

67
00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:42.840
Yeah, we can also go to the sidebar here,
where it's probably easier to find.

68
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.503
We go to the Menu Slot, and
here we can swap it out for Menu Items.

69
00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:54.504
That one that I had was just an example,
that walk through, it was a vector.

70
00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:56.337
My own trick backfired on me.

71
00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:59.328
Don't laugh at me, [LAUGH].

72
00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:02.616
So here we've got this is
an auto layout container,

73
00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:05.690
hugging the contents with
a bunch of stuff in it.

74
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.360
So now I swapped out the empty slot, I'll
actually show this again cuz, why not?

75
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.490
You're all worth it.

76
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.853
We can bring in a menu and I can have a
whole bunch of these menu contents, right?

77
00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:20.090
I can organize them in a way that
makes sense, so on and so forth.

78
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.726
So here we can toggle it open.

79
00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:26.073
Now, because it's an invisible slot,
it is way easier to go here,

80
00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:31.438
select the invisible thing, and then I can
swap it out for this Menu Items, right?

81
00:05:31.438 --> 00:05:34.900
Now you notice that that is
not in the closed variant.

82
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.560
So now when I go here, open,
closed, open, closed, open, closed.

83
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.600
And this is a reusable component.

84
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.720
I can change the name of
this to anything I want.

85
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.035
And then I can have, for
the various drop down menus, which, yeah,

86
00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.930
do deserve their own component.

87
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.479
But I can use that trick that
I saw before where, yeah,

88
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.500
this is hugging the components.

89
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.589
But I could also have it a fixed width,
and

90
00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.016
I should be able to drag it to
the different size, so on and so forth.

91
00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:03.055
Again, if you wanna do nested menus,

92
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:06.641
the same trick of being able to
swap out components works, right?

93
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:11.235
And so, it's a way to kind of compose
some of these more sophisticated things.

94
00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:14.930
And you can have all those states, instead
of the alternative to not doing this.

95
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.920
You'd be like,
this is a little much for me.

96
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.579
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:22.307
The alternative to not doing like this,
is you basically have a frame that had

98
00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:27.129
the entire UI with the menu open, and
then another frame with the menu closed.

99
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.510
So you get to choose, right?

100
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.491
And the big question you always
need to ask yourself too is,

101
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.366
do you want to be a completionist, right?

102
00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:42.265
If the goal is to get a prototype
in front of your customers, right?

103
00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:45.822
Or even just to kind of make sense of
stuff yourself, to see if anyone wants you

104
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.910
to build the thing, does every
single menu need to open and close?

105
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.380
Probably not, right?

106
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.941
You need to make the parts interactive
that need to be interactive, right?

107
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.986
The idea is enough to validate whether or

108
00:06:57.986 --> 00:07:01.245
not the thing that you're building
is worth building, right?

109
00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:05.188
And as much as you need, and probably
as little as you can get away with.

110
00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:08.479
Now having a full design system, right?

111
00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.294
Having stuff like hover states cuz,
again, as engineers I have been on

112
00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:16.236
the receiving end where I get to design
and I got a button and I have to go back

113
00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:21.230
to the designer and be like, but what's
it look like when the mouse is over it?

114
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.379
How about active?

115
00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.239
What's it look like disabled, right?

116
00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:25.612
And all those kinds of things, right?

117
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.369
So it's definitely an art form,

118
00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:32.704
as much that is helpful for
you getting the job done.

119
00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:38.909
And not always about being a completionist
and never shipping, right?

120
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:43.187
The same way that refactoring your
code forever, until it's flawless,

121
00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:46.019
is a great way to put
the company out of business.

122
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.727
So it's always a trade off, in a sense.

123
00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:50.925
But for the places where
you need to do that, right?

124
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:53.300
This does, in fact, work in this case.
