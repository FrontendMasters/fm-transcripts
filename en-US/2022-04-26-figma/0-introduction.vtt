00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.196
My name is Dave and I am the front
end architect at Tim portal.

2
00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:06.561
We are a company that
does workflows use for

3
00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:10.317
distributed systems to make sure
that everything runs as planned.

4
00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:14.519
Basically taking all of the hard
parts out of distributed systems,

5
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.774
asynchronous processes and
all that kind of stuff.

6
00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.080
We're gonna talk a little
bit about Figma today.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.892
This is Figma for developers.

8
00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:29.984
What that basically means is kind of from
the perspective of a developer, right?

9
00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:33.907
A lot of times if you're trying to learn
Figma, and you're an engineer, by default,

10
00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:36.993
there's a lot of, it's designers
talking to designers, right?

11
00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:40.809
This is a safe space where we can make
jokes about prototypal inheritance in

12
00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.575
JavaScript and related to Figma.

13
00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.714
And it's gonna be great.

14
00:00:44.714 --> 00:00:46.674
So what are we gonna do in this course?

15
00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:52.411
We're gonna learn a lot about creating
prototypes and user interfaces in Figma.

16
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.859
There's a lot of reasons why
you might do this, right?

17
00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.230
There is the fact that matter is side
projects and that you might wanna build.

18
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.653
It's a lot easier if you have
some of the principles of design.

19
00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:08.529
Sometimes if you work at a startup
like I did 10 months ago before we had

20
00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:10.165
a designer on the team.

21
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:13.646
You need to do a certain amount of
the design yourself because nobody else is

22
00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:14.704
going to do it for you.

23
00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:18.677
And wouldn't it be nice if you
knew what you're doing, right?

24
00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:23.399
And then the kind of final piece
that I kind of wanna kind of poke on

25
00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.993
a little bit here is knowing
how to use the tools.

26
00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:30.010
Not only helps them make your life easier
as you're implementing the designs.

27
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.182
If you have an amazing designer on your
team, they're going to hand you a figment.

28
00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:36.313
One point they're gonna do everything they
can for that developer handoff right.

29
00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:40.109
But then it'd be nice if you were
on the receiving end ready and

30
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.084
familiar with the tool as well.

31
00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:46.903
And the other thing is that we're gonna
see is knowing how to use Figma not

32
00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:49.444
only for yourself to build your eyes.

33
00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:52.977
But also if you're working with a designer
who's using Figma helps you become

34
00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:54.486
an equal partner there, right?

35
00:01:54.486 --> 00:01:58.567
Where it's, hey, actually I know
what I need to do in this codebase,

36
00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.012
whether it's reactive, svelte, or
view, or angular, or what have you.

37
00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:04.991
Here are some ways that
we can work together and

38
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.287
maybe, you can even show
your designer a few things.

39
00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:09.517
We're going to touch a lot
of design concepts, right?

40
00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:14.367
And there's definitely a in that kind of
relationship with the designer piece,

41
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.664
this idea of a design system, right?

42
00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:20.527
Maybe you're using something,
using tailwind or chakra or Mattel UI.

43
00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:23.124
Or maybe at your company you're
kinda building your own.

44
00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:26.643
A lot of those are kind of a joint
venture, between design and engineering.

45
00:02:26.643 --> 00:02:30.205
We're kind of being on the same page,
both the how they're designed in Figma.

46
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:33.177
And then also how you go about
implementing those designs is incredibly

47
00:02:33.177 --> 00:02:34.174
helpful and powerful.

48
00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.313
Basically, makes everyone's life easier.

49
00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:39.465
We're gonna touch a lot of
design concepts, but for

50
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.553
a full on just design principles.

51
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:44.243
There are two other front end masters
courses that you should check out.

52
00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:48.214
Because I will say this right now, yes,
I've been a front end engineer for

53
00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:49.737
longer than I care to admit.

54
00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:53.244
I have a certain amount of experience
working with some really great designers.

55
00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:56.944
That said having worked with a lot of
really great designers I understand

56
00:02:56.944 --> 00:03:00.948
there's a difference between my specialty
as a engineering architect versus

57
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:01.993
a designer as well.

58
00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:05.965
So just kinda keeping that in mind
this is kind of for developers,

59
00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:07.926
by developers as well, right.

60
00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.255
So we talked a little bit
about who is this for?

61
00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:13.666
I would also, definitely developers.

62
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.678
And then also designers
who work with developers,

63
00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:21.309
I think getting that other perspective
of how to put together a design system.

64
00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.911
How to structure a UI prototype,
how to have reusable components that

65
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:29.659
are easy to kind of work your
way around for the engineer.

66
00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.606
I think as a designer that's
super helpful as well.

67
00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:38.199
All right, so what do you need?

68
00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.006
Basically all you need is a Figma
account and ideally a web browser.

69
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:44.709
Whether it's one you downloaded or

70
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.728
the one that came with your
computer either one should be fine.

71
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.830
There's some kind of Internet Explorer
joke hiding in there somewhere that I

72
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.409
can't find.

73
00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.830
But the major point there is
a Figma desktop application it's

74
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.516
an electron app it's wrapping
the web app it's mostly the same.

75
00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:01.853
Do you need it?

76
00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:03.083
You do not need it.

77
00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:04.050
Do you want it?

78
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.845
You are free to download it.

79
00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.794
I will be using it today, as well.

80
00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:11.200
Sometimes it's nice just to be able to
Command Tab in between two different apps.

81
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.389
One being your browser and the other one
being the Figma desktop application.

82
00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.639
But there's nothing that we're gonna do
today that you need the desktop app for

83
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.568
that you could not use the web
application for as well.

84
00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:24.479
There is a template file you
can kinda take a look at and

85
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.234
I'll show it to you right here.

86
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:28.319
Let's bring it over.

87
00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.931
You can go basically go ahead
to this link and hit duplicate.

88
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.952
And then you will get your own
copy that you can work in.

89
00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:37.817
Has all the course materials,
everything we go through today, and

90
00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:40.243
some stuff that I'm not gonna
get through today as well.

91
00:04:40.243 --> 00:04:43.782
Just kind of extra material there as
well you can kinda play around and

92
00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.072
do the exercises there.

93
00:04:45.072 --> 00:04:49.121
&gt;&gt; How easy is it to go from
Photoshop to something like Figma?

94
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:50.629
&gt;&gt; That depends right.

95
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.909
Figma will import sketch and

96
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.757
a lot of things like that all
depends if it is a flat JPEG file.

97
00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:01.585
It's doable, right, one of the things
we'll look at today is I took

98
00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:04.572
the screenshot of the front
end masters course page.

99
00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:10.468
Which when I had this great idea I did
not realize that I was on the page.

100
00:05:10.468 --> 00:05:14.122
But I also wasn't gonna take the time
to remove myself from the page,

101
00:05:14.122 --> 00:05:15.636
because I'm an egomaniac.

102
00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:19.571
So, I took this screenshot and
re implemented it by hand.

103
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:24.077
It took me two or
three hours, it wasn't fun.

104
00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:27.519
But it didn't take it wasn't
a Herculean effort either, right?

105
00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:31.621
It was something I did kind of while I was
doing other stuff during the course of

106
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:32.512
the day as well.

107
00:05:32.512 --> 00:05:34.824
Mark any other question?

108
00:05:34.824 --> 00:05:39.607
&gt;&gt; My designer is struggling to shift she
won't use storybook but loves Photoshop.

109
00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:43.173
So do you can you make a case for Figma?

110
00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:44.247
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, so

111
00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:48.857
one of the things we're gonna see as we
start to use Figma is that by default.

112
00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:52.865
And we'll kinda go into this more in
depth as we work through the material.

113
00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:55.947
We'll see that there's a lot
of stuff that kind of,

114
00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:59.391
it's kind of meant for
building web interfaces, right?

115
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:02.784
So for stuff about,
if you really if you grab anything and

116
00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:04.489
you hold down Option or Alt.

117
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.864
If you can see the distances
between anything you'd also go into

118
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:11.114
this inspect tab and
start to see at least some inspiration for

119
00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:12.693
the CSS that you might write.

120
00:06:12.693 --> 00:06:17.378
Now as we go through we look
at this we'll see that I use

121
00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:21.869
the word inspiration very
deliberatively right.

122
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.249
Should you just will generate all
the CSS that you need perfect that you

123
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.401
can maintain forever?

124
00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:28.039
It will not, right?

125
00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.256
If that was the case,
we would all be unemployed.

126
00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:35.907
So, but it will at least kind of give
you some here I'll set up the general

127
00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:37.063
Flexbox pieces.

128
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:41.698
You don't have to go that same CSS tricks,
blog posts that I've been going to for

129
00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:42.933
almost a decade now.

130
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:46.545
To remember the difference between
justify content and align items.

131
00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:50.858
All right, so you get some of that
kind of starter pieces as well.

132
00:06:50.858 --> 00:06:55.530
So it's definitely, I think there's a few
pieces right the idea that it is live and

133
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.547
collaborative.

134
00:06:56.547 --> 00:07:02.467
Which means, as you can kinda see as your,
as your designers making changes.

135
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:05.059
You can see it as well versus,
do I have the most recent version of

136
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.038
the Photoshop file and
stuff along those lines.

137
00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:09.362
So we're gonna cover you
know how to use Figma.

138
00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.948
That seems important.

139
00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:16.030
We're going to kind of think about
exactly how what the implications are for

140
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.626
us actually having implement some
of these designs as we go along.

141
00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:23.154
And we're going to talk about the
foundation of building a design system one

142
00:07:23.154 --> 00:07:24.985
does not build a design system in a day.

143
00:07:24.985 --> 00:07:27.795
One does not build a design system
while also learning a tool for

144
00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:29.822
building a design system all encompassing.

145
00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:32.560
But we will kind of touch that topic and

146
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.108
kind of use it as an exemplar as
we learn our way around the tool.
