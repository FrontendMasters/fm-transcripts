WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:03.970
So we kinda saw that with,
we made the icon set,

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.731
we put in our notification as well,
we got a few more tricks.

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.936
So that is good for
swapping out one icon, right?

4
00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:19.482
But let's say you have a world
where there's a table, right?

5
00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:24.299
And if various points,
maybe it's like tweets, right?

6
00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:26.590
Especially if it's the same
data that you're just showing,

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.493
a different lengths for
different views, right?

8
00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:33.797
You might wanna say, okay, on mobile,
we only wanna show this many on desktop,

9
00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:37.244
we wanna show this many,
so on and so forth, right?

10
00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:41.583
Do you have to create it,
cuz you can't remove

11
00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:46.498
components, Or
layers inside of a component.

12
00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:51.915
So what do you do if you wanna have
a version of this that can be a really

13
00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:57.348
long version, a really short version,
so on and so forth, right?

14
00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.423
How do you handle that?

15
00:00:58.423 --> 00:01:02.142
Do you have to make tables of all
different sizes and just swap instances?

16
00:01:02.142 --> 00:01:04.299
Is that the way we wanna live?

17
00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.905
I'm gonna argue no, there's another
kinda trick, cuz even menus, right?

18
00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:11.885
If you have a different number of items,
so on and so forth.

19
00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:16.491
We do know that we can change the height,
I was changing the height of stickies and

20
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:18.198
also stuff this entire time.

21
00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:21.118
And so there is a trick
here that we can kinda do,

22
00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:25.498
which is, so we could take a version
of our card component from before,

23
00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:28.931
and I'll do this kinda by hand,
pull this out, right?

24
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:32.801
This is, I've changed offers,
I have some pagination here, right?

25
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.165
And so on and so forth.

26
00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:40.730
And what we could do is we can
also take something like this and

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.271
pop it in, Make it the full width.

28
00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:54.818
And we can make another one And,
Let me put that in the right place.

29
00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:00.399
Snap it in.

30
00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.273
All right, sweet, and
we'll do one more just so

31
00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:04.626
I can do that command D trick
cause I messed up the first time.

32
00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:10.038
Boom, and then, I'm basically put in
way more than we could ever want.

33
00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:13.212
And you can see we've got clip content,
right?

34
00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:21.795
And so the default one, we grab it
We'll kinda snap to the component.

35
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:25.200
And so now what we could do is,

36
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:32.205
Bring this in and like if we wanna have
a bunch of these, we can bring one in.

37
00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.508
And we could say, all right,
what I want you to do,

38
00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.093
you gonna be allowed to do
these need to fill the content.

39
00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:44.582
We.

40
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:57.711
All right, so
now the table will kinda stretch this way.

41
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:03.080
And then we can also grab it, and
we can have whatever size that we need for

42
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.648
our UI, and just have it in place.

43
00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:10.025
Now, a bonus trick that we could do is,
these are fixed.

44
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:11.754
As you can see,
I can't really do much to them.

45
00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.959
I can change the text in them, but
the overall structure is kinda in place.

46
00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.582
I can't even do that auto layout trick and
move them around, all right?

47
00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:21.210
It just moves the whole thing.

48
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.908
But theoretically, and
you'd have to be really be

49
00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:27.371
dedicating this point because you
have to switch a bunch of them.

50
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.341
If this was a component, you could swap
it out with all the different tables and

51
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.601
rows that you might see, right?

52
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:36.136
So you could have this idea of a top bar
that is a component, a bottom bar that's

53
00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:40.566
a component and all these rows, you
would have to swap them all out, right?

54
00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:44.457
But you could theoretically
have a customizable and

55
00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:48.445
reusable table that you could
have in your UI as well.

56
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:52.232
And we're gonna use this for
another trick in a little bit but yeah,

57
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.888
one more way that you can have more
flexible components instead of

58
00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:59.697
having to create all sorts of
different things over and over again.
