00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.641
Okay speaking of checkboxes,
your exercise is to

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:09.495
create either a radio button or
a checkbox component.

3
00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.191
If it's a radio button a chef selected
if the checkboxes should have checked

4
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.919
I'm mapping those mostly to
what they would be in HTML.

5
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.622
Theoretically, if you do the checkbox,

6
00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:24.050
there is that one with a line through it,
right, which is like some chill.

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.550
You can choose to do that or not do that.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.361
My point is that you don't learn anything
new about figma for having three states or

9
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:29.970
two states.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.910
We start with the button,
if you want to be a completionist.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.011
You'd have that third state in there, but
all I'm gonna ask is that you implement

12
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:40.175
one with either checked or
unchecked selected or unselected.

13
00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:41.605
For either radio button or

14
00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:45.895
checkbox one's a circle one's a square
whichever one makes you happier go for

15
00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.210
it and then we will kinda look
at it together in a few minutes.
