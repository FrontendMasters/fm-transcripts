00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.043
So your job is to kind of pick one of
these that you're kind of interested in

2
00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:06.230
doing if you're tired of input fields.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.820
We can also do with notifications
in the various colors as well.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.580
Let's do notifications.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.240
Let's break for an exercise.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.389
You can even start with this base
component here that has like a little

7
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.650
layout grid.

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.472
And what we wanna do is,
this is our base version,

9
00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:22.847
you can even give it an obnoxious
color if you want, right?

10
00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:25.376
Turn this into a base component,
go ahead and

11
00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.637
make the four kind of instance
that we can swap between, so

12
00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:33.232
we can drag in all the different kinds of
notifications, swap it to a different one

13
00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:37.090
and we'll do some extra stuff
with it in a little bit as well.

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.765
Like I said, as kind of extensions,

15
00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.300
there are a whole bunch of other
things that you can do here as well.

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.126
Like a lot of it is just playing
on the same theme as well like,

17
00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:50.640
instead of hover and focus,
we have the ability to input fields.

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.393
And you can see that I started out with
an input field that has required an error

19
00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:55.490
message and a label and

20
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.680
you can actually just make more and more
instances we delete more and more pieces.

21
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.067
So it's like you're gonna
have not every variation for

22
00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:05.700
an input fail because like there's more
than you ever think there should be.

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.370
But like you can begin to build up
a robust components that using the same

24
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.941
strategy just kind of like
doing it repeatedly and

25
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:16.162
kind of building up on top of itself more
that we won't learn additional things and

26
00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.900
doing it that many times but
the strategy works.

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.458
So it's kind of an exercise outside of
today if you wanna kind of just Just take

28
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:23.510
a little bit further.

29
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.630
There are a whole bunch of extensions that
you can follow along and do as well, but

30
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.691
why don't we do the notification because
we'll build on it in a little bit, and

31
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.520
we'll see the strategy in action.
