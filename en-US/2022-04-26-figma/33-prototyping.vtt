00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.750
One last thing to talk about, and
that is this idea of speaking of

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.700
putting things in front of customers,
prototyping, right?

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.190
Used to be in the days of Sketch, you'd
build all your fancy UI in Sketch, and

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.010
then you'd go to Zeppelin or something
else to build a prototype out of it.

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.801
In Figma, you can actually make
an interactive prototype in the same

6
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.360
tool that you're designing everything,
right?

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.817
And there's a bunch of different
ways that you can do this.

8
00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:34.840
Let me go find one of my
old buttons from earlier.

9
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.450
Do we think this one has all the states?

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.694
Yeah, it does.

11
00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:45.600
Okay, so let's go to the main
component in this case.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.684
So you have two ways of doing this.

13
00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:49.892
You can wire up the moving
between frame and frame, but

14
00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:53.290
you can also make
the components interactive.

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.129
But the caveat is that you can basically
only swap between the variations,

16
00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.866
right, of a given component,
the variant states, right?

17
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.480
You can't swap instances on the fly, but

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.702
you can toggle between
the different variations.

19
00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.600
So if I go back to this button,
where is it?

20
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.862
It's over here.

21
00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:20.597
If I click on it, you can see that I
can style it, all that kinda fun stuff.

22
00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:27.163
But if I switch over to this Prototype
tab, you can see that actually,

23
00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:32.058
what I can do is I got this
little fun thing over here,

24
00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.980
and I can click it, all right?

25
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.047
Go to that one.

26
00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:41.440
And I can say on hover, this is one of
the questions from earlier, on hover,

27
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.560
change it to the hover state, right?

28
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.344
And then once they're hovering,
on click change to the active state.

29
00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:54.890
So now you can kinda simulate, and you can
do an animation as well, like dissolve.

30
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.699
Smart animate will, if you have a toggle,
it'll try to figure

31
00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:01.170
out what it should do with the toggle,
and stuff along those lines.

32
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.624
And it might not be perfect,
but you know what?

33
00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.425
It's still pretty impressive.

34
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:09.298
And then we can dissolve as well.

35
00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:12.402
And so now if you had this button in
a prototype, as they click on it,

36
00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:14.430
you'll see all of these different states.

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.238
You would also consider doing that to your
base component as well, cuz then all of

38
00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.720
them will inherit it, and if you
change any of these properties, right?

39
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.701
So if I made this into a bunch of
variations as well, then theoretically,

40
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:29.163
I can do it in one place,
cuz I have the problem that I had before,

41
00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:32.849
which is, yeah, this button now does that,
this button does not.

42
00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.153
So can you reverse engineer
some of this stuff, sure.

43
00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:42.577
Is part of the process of spending our
time together figuring out what you do at

44
00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:43.816
the very beginning?

45
00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:45.850
It's like, can you refactor your code?

46
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.071
Sure, of course you can.

47
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:52.060
Can you also do things in the beginning
that make you happier later?

48
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.105
Absolutely, right?

49
00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:57.405
So having a base component that has
some of these basic kinds of states,

50
00:02:57.405 --> 00:02:59.114
having it in your checkbox on click.

51
00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:03.290
And then having all the different
instances that you can swap between

52
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.191
derived from that base component becomes
a very powerful concept here, right?

53
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:12.266
And combining a lot of these strategies
that we kinda learned in isolation into

54
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:16.466
larger pieces that you can pose out of
these strategies is incredibly powerful,

55
00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:17.310
as I said.

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.724
So we can do that.

57
00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:23.729
And let's go back to this Prototypes page,

58
00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:31.053
and we'll kinda just toss it in there for
a second just to see it.

59
00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:33.413
We'll kind of just put in here for
a second, and

60
00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:37.770
we'll find out some other problems
with this prototype as we do that.

61
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.714
Now, this one, I'll probably have some of
the other frames in here that I have to

62
00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:42.826
deal with in a second.

63
00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:44.995
You'll see Enable interactive components.

64
00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:46.682
So that's what we did.

65
00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:48.630
I might end up with starting
from one of these other frames.

66
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.714
We'll handle that in a second.

67
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.737
So Figma's building a prototype for me.

68
00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.978
As you can see as I hover,
somewhat subtle.

69
00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:01.805
I get a little shadow.

70
00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.850
And as I click on it, it becomes active.

71
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.179
And there's also as I'm pressing it down,
and stuff along those lines, and

72
00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.908
I can create a state that when my
mouse leaves, it goes back up.

73
00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:14.287
You can kinda create all
the interactions and wire it up.

74
00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:19.422
But while we're looking at this, there are
some other problems with this UI, right?

75
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.062
It's a prototype, sure.

76
00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:24.876
But what if we wanted this bar to
be sticky at the bottom, right, or

77
00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:26.594
this one be sticky at the top?

78
00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:29.964
But normally, these little help things
that just kinda float there forever,

79
00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:33.231
right, there's some other problems that
we need to solve on top of wiring up

80
00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.141
all the additional states for this button.

81
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.291
So let's kind of just
look at that real quick.

82
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:42.176
This has its own tab, so you can always
just go back to your designs as well.

83
00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:47.380
You can see its got a little play symbol,
which is awesome.

84
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.841
So let's just remove that button for
a second.

85
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.790
There's a bunch of different
strategies that we can use.

86
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.076
You can see we have
another problem over here,

87
00:04:57.076 --> 00:05:00.760
which is where we're gonna wanna
do the back and forth scrolling.

88
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.965
Or if we had our data table, and you know
how sometimes it's not always great on

89
00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.209
mobile, and so I didn't put one in here.

90
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.884
But you might have a table
that has some rows, and

91
00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:13.878
you can scroll just the table itself,
an infinite scroll table as well.

92
00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:18.099
We have one of those in the temporal UI,
where it's kind of like, yeah, it's bound

93
00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.923
to a box, but if you need to scroll in
that little viewport, you can as well.

94
00:05:21.923 --> 00:05:25.245
And the same strategy will kinda work for
multiple pieces.

95
00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:30.108
So what we'll do real quick
together is kind of look at some

96
00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:32.800
of the strategies here as well.

97
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.640
One of the things I will also point out
is that if you would like to see it in

98
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.801
various different devices, that's also
a thing that you can do as well, and

99
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.270
I'll put a nice little
phone frame around it too.

100
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.201
So we've got two strategies here, and
these are also how to do the data table,

101
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.110
which we'll kinda see in a second,
just for the funsies.

102
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.555
The interactive component is all
documented down here as well.

103
00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.780
But let's also look at how to wire
up some of the other pieces of this.

104
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.946
So for instance, if we wanna move between
frames, so let's say we wanna move from,

105
00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.720
if they click this one,
I wanna move to this frame here.

106
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.546
You'll notice that when I
am in the Prototype tab,

107
00:06:09.546 --> 00:06:11.462
I have this fun little thing here.

108
00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:14.031
Now, if you are in design,
you won't see it, so

109
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.815
you're wondering where's
my arrow draggy thing?

110
00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:18.091
That's super fun.

111
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.245
You have to be in the prototype view.

112
00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:23.963
But I could say well, okay,
when they click on this first one,

113
00:06:23.963 --> 00:06:26.360
I wanna move them to this frame, right?

114
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.520
Cool, and
we can do what the animation looks like.

115
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.126
So we can do the iPhone
kinda slide-in thing.

116
00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:35.416
We'll put that in place.

117
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.565
And when they hit the Buy Now button,

118
00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:45.981
We wanna move them to the cart, right?

119
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.346
And the slide is once
you've picked an animation,

120
00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:53.260
we'll usually just choose
to kinda keep doing it.

121
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.148
And we'll figure out a better
way to do this in a second,

122
00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:04.390
which is to have maybe the cart do that,
but let's not do that just yet.

123
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.850
And we'll wire that up in a second.

124
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.151
The other thing we wanna do is have
those sticky headers and footers.

125
00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:14.740
That's also relatively easy to do.

126
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.853
Go find the thing you wanna make state.

127
00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:22.590
Under Constraints,
fix position when scrolling.

128
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.674
This only does anything in
the prototype view, but

129
00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:27.309
you can do fix position when scrolling.

130
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:29.730
Let's do this for all of these.

131
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.865
Fix position when scrolling.

132
00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:38.186
All right, so let's see.

133
00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:40.077
Let's also do it for that Help button too.

134
00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:42.052
We talked about that as from earlier.

135
00:07:42.052 --> 00:07:43.440
So we can do that.

136
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.152
And now you can see that the header and
footer perform like

137
00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:54.800
they should,
as if you did position sticky in CSS.

138
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.269
If I click this,
we kinda go into the view.

139
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:05.056
I can scroll down, hit Buy It Now,
we go into the cart, right?

140
00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:10.278
Could I wire up each of these
buttons in every frame?

141
00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:11.344
I could.

142
00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:14.385
I don't want to, but I could.

143
00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:21.026
The other option here is to grab this,
Make it a component.

144
00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:32.551
And let's say in Prototype, We're
gonna say home, goes to the homepage.

145
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:35.724
I don't actually have anything for
the heart.

146
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:39.952
We could say that the cart
goes to the cart page.

147
00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.804
All right, and
then what I'll do is I will remove these,

148
00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:53.451
And I will bring in my new version.

149
00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:02.538
Again, this is what happens when
you don't organize your components.

150
00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:07.311
So let's see where it is,
let's go for footer, sweet.

151
00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:21.056
And you can see this one is
technically wired up the same way,

152
00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:23.992
that its main component was as well.

153
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.965
And the nice part is if you ever changed
what that main component is doing,

154
00:09:30.965 --> 00:09:33.578
it'll change all of the instances as well.

155
00:09:35.555 --> 00:09:36.875
So now we can put them all in there.

156
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.467
I'm pretty sure I have to reset
that fix position scrolling.

157
00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:41.866
Also, let's zoom in a little bit and
get these straightened up.

158
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.889
Let's see,
make sure that was actually in the frame.

159
00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:01.142
All right, sweet.

160
00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.318
And so now, theoretically,

161
00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:08.683
cuz they all inherit from that one
that has the interactions wired up.

162
00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:09.475
That one's up.

163
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.370
I didn't make them sticky again,
but let's see.

164
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.413
Let's see what I missed with that cart.

165
00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:21.636
I mighta,

166
00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:29.464
Think I missed one of those arrows there,
so put this one in place.

167
00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:46.125
Cool, navigate to that one as well,
number three.

168
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:50.158
So you can always change these as well,
just with that menu.

169
00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:52.084
But if we start from this one,
for instance,

170
00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:06.074
Scroll down, Whoop,
figure that out in a second.

171
00:11:10.082 --> 00:11:13.069
My touch targets are a little off here,
but I can have the carts, and

172
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:15.649
they'll all kinda wire up
where they're supposed to be.

173
00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:18.629
And I can move through the UI like that,
and so you can begin to, again,

174
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:19.786
create these prototypes.

175
00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:23.919
What we do is, we have basically
before we build the UI temporal,

176
00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:28.731
Canvas basically makes mock-ups that,
honestly, by the time we're done

177
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:33.034
with them, look shockingly like
what I'm about to build, right?

178
00:11:33.034 --> 00:11:35.754
In this case right now,
I've built the UI, but

179
00:11:35.754 --> 00:11:38.965
she's got some new features
that she's also showing.

180
00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.577
So we're using the Figma mock-ups.

181
00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:44.001
And in a lot of cases, sometimes
the people we're interviewing don't know

182
00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:46.515
that this is the mock-up and
not the UI that we currently

183
00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:49.267
have in beta right now that you
can pull down and use, right?

184
00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:53.427
So we meet up with the customers of
various companies that I can't name, and

185
00:11:53.427 --> 00:11:57.014
we show them these mock-ups, and
we kinda talk them through it.

186
00:11:57.014 --> 00:11:59.356
We let them like,
what happens if I navigate there?

187
00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:00.637
And we've got a lot of this worked out.

188
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.908
And then for some of these new features,
after we're done interviewing

189
00:12:04.908 --> 00:12:09.249
the customers, then we go ahead, and
I'll go ahead and have my team build

190
00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:13.258
the actual UI, making sure that it
kinda behaves the way they want.

191
00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:17.588
Rather than ship something into
production, and then wait for

192
00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:22.488
people to either complain, or
file bugs, cuz as frontend engineers,

193
00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:24.704
bugs are an interesting thing.

194
00:12:24.704 --> 00:12:28.759
If something doesn't go into the database
in the back end, that's a bug.

195
00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:34.317
If somebody doesn't know where
the pagination is, is that a bug?

196
00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:37.740
If the pagination doesn't work, I need
to put a ticket on my team's backlog.

197
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.245
If it's like, we've moved something
around, and it's confusing for our users,

198
00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:43.882
right, cuz it made sense to us,
cuz we were intentional about it.

199
00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:46.112
For them, we sprung it on them, right?

200
00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:47.540
It's super tricky, right?

201
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.478
And that's not necessarily a bug, per se.

202
00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:52.378
It might still result in work for
my team, but that is different,

203
00:12:52.378 --> 00:12:54.986
and we need to kinda figure out
how to triage those things.

204
00:12:54.986 --> 00:12:57.639
So finding those things
out before we ship, right,

205
00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:01.333
even though we're still in beta,
is super, super useful in this case.

206
00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:03.594
And so Figma allows you to kind
of put together these screens.

207
00:13:03.594 --> 00:13:08.310
And again, yeah, it's like,
don't make fun of my son's artwork.

208
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:14.099
But generally speaking,
you can get to a pretty compelling

209
00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:20.714
high fidelity prototype fairly quickly,
right, as well, cool.

210
00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:24.280
And so like I said, we've got a little
piece on the interactive components.

211
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.510
I'll just kinda show you
the data table piece,

212
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.423
which is all I did was I took that
data table that we had before.

213
00:13:29.423 --> 00:13:33.090
And it's funny,
step two is there is no step two, right?

214
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.207
All I did was I took this initial
content in here that was overflowing.

215
00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:41.584
This is the one that has way too many
things in it as I expand it, and

216
00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:46.439
I just go to Prototype, and
I say Horizontal scrolling, or I'm sorry,

217
00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:48.220
Vertical scrolling.

218
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.065
And now they can scroll
through this table.

219
00:13:50.065 --> 00:13:53.907
Let's actually implement it in this
view right here real quick, and

220
00:13:53.907 --> 00:13:56.370
this will be kind of
our last little hurrah.

221
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.063
I wanna have it so
they can kind of flip through things,

222
00:13:59.063 --> 00:14:02.630
like you kinda see in a lot
of different interfaces.

223
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.587
So this component, as you can see,
it expands, right?

224
00:14:07.587 --> 00:14:12.728
What we can do in this case is we'll say
horizontal scrolling is now a thing.

225
00:14:12.728 --> 00:14:17.086
Yeah, let's do this one,
horizontal scrolling.

226
00:14:17.086 --> 00:14:19.951
It had the larger parent component.

227
00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:23.211
So we can just say that okay, this
should be able to scroll horizontally,

228
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:26.063
even though it overflows the frame,
so it's clipped, right?

229
00:14:26.063 --> 00:14:28.137
And you can't see it, but
there is more content here.

230
00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:29.634
You can kinda see the hint.

231
00:14:29.634 --> 00:14:32.574
And then ideally,
as they kinda flip through it.

232
00:14:32.574 --> 00:14:36.365
And there is a Figma mobile app where you
can literally deploy this to your phone,

233
00:14:36.365 --> 00:14:40.156
thumb around on it, and trick your friends
saying I built this out this weekend,

234
00:14:40.156 --> 00:14:40.736
whatever.

235
00:14:40.736 --> 00:14:41.425
But ideally,

236
00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:45.167
you could also pass it around to figure
out does this interaction make sense?

237
00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:49.758
I think for side projects,
this is super useful too, right?

238
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:53.863
Cuz one of the things I did when I was in
education was we'd build these things for

239
00:14:53.863 --> 00:14:55.370
students and teachers.

240
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.642
We start with these prototypes before
we build a thing of put in a classroom,

241
00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:03.982
does this actually make sense is super
useful before you build a whole bunch of

242
00:15:03.982 --> 00:15:04.871
stuff, cool.

243
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:13.284
[LAUGH] One of the jokes in the chat
is just ship the prototype.

244
00:15:13.284 --> 00:15:17.287
I wish, and then I can go back and
just chill.

245
00:15:17.287 --> 00:15:20.384
So here we can scroll over.

246
00:15:20.384 --> 00:15:21.430
We'll hit this.

247
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.029
&gt;&gt; What I did was I
went to the frame four,

248
00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:33.098
added a horizontal scrolling to that.

249
00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:37.010
And then I resized the box, so
it has something that scroll,

250
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.790
the frame container.

251
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.243
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Cuz otherwise it's completely expanded.

252
00:15:42.243 --> 00:15:43.610
So when you go-
&gt;&gt; I had to do that.

253
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.916
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,
the container has to be smaller, but-

254
00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:50.587
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I shrunk the container down.

255
00:15:50.587 --> 00:15:55.956
&gt;&gt; Okay, and then you enabled
the scrolling on the container,

256
00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:58.802
and yeah, there you go.

257
00:15:58.802 --> 00:16:03.932
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That feels good.

258
00:16:03.932 --> 00:16:08.827
[LAUGH] I'm just gonna do this for
a few minutes.

259
00:16:08.827 --> 00:16:12.663
So the idea that we can have things
that we interact with and scroll.

260
00:16:12.663 --> 00:16:16.724
To make it more for a realistic prototype
experience beyond just moving between

261
00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:19.876
frames and having buttons that
we can change the state of, and

262
00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:21.527
doing all these interactions.

263
00:16:21.527 --> 00:16:26.379
We can see in the prototype anything that
has a certain amount of overflowing of

264
00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:29.908
its container,
we can actually go into that prototype,

265
00:16:29.908 --> 00:16:32.205
find the part that we want to scroll.

266
00:16:32.205 --> 00:16:33.953
It does need to overflow, right?

267
00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:38.058
And we basically can turn on either
vertical or horizontal scrolling.

268
00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:42.096
Or if you're gonna simulate a Google Maps
experience, you can do both, and

269
00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:43.497
they can like pan around.

270
00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:47.446
It will be limited by the bounds of
whatever the fictitious map that you have

271
00:16:47.446 --> 00:16:49.900
in there, but again,
this isn't a real app.

272
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.772
This is the thing you're putting in
front your customers if they're trying

273
00:16:54.772 --> 00:16:59.718
to go all the way from Minneapolis,
and continue scrolling to Paris, yeah,

274
00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.868
depends on how big your image is.

275
00:17:01.868 --> 00:17:03.159
But you go in there.

276
00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:06.816
In this case, we took the content of that
data table we made in a previous exercise.

277
00:17:06.816 --> 00:17:08.530
We turn on vertical scrolling.

278
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.425
And now you can see in the prototype
that I can kind of sit there and

279
00:17:11.425 --> 00:17:14.970
scroll through it as well, and we could
add in a whole bunch of interactivity.

280
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.341
Again, this is no replacement for
our real day jobs, but

281
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:22.628
the ability to add certain pieces of
interactivity to your component and

282
00:17:22.628 --> 00:17:25.240
be able to use them is
incredibly powerful.
