00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.713
So our mission was to kind of implement
some of this, I'm not gonna drive you

2
00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:09.192
through me kind of looking at CSS staring
at it and copying it, we can kind of

3
00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:13.271
see as we go through and I will look
at the completed example as well.

4
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:17.911
Again as we saw before, you go the Inspect
tab, you can get a sense of like, what

5
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.831
the font, what the weight is stuff along
those lines, my favorite the line height,

6
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:28.150
because I will forever struggle with that
and have to refresh the page all the time.

7
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.580
And again, like,
does your text field need, a Flexbox?

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.287
Probably not, but at least helps you with
some like helpful hints to figure out

9
00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.424
what you're trying to
implement as you go through,

10
00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:43.796
like what are the colors if
there were border radiuses.

11
00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:48.503
Right, I have two ways of acquiescing
like what the padding on a button element

12
00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:50.730
should be as I implement it, right?

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.040
I couldn't hold the Alt key or kinda
hover over some of the different pieces.

14
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.712
Right, or I can go ahead and look at
that in this case and say, okay, again,

15
00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:07.080
I would probably choose to use padding
rather than static positioning some text.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.098
This is not gonna get you
fully out of writing CSS, but

17
00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:13.250
it will at least help with some
of the tiny little details

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.090
that you might otherwise
kinda play around with.

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.991
So we can take a look at this, but

20
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.882
basically this is kind of an
implementation of it, that we can see as

21
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:28.286
well where I just kind of took all the
different pieces and styled it to look.

22
00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:32.609
The fonts look a little bit different
because I think the web fonts are slightly

23
00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.410
different in the browser versus in Figma,
but generally speaking,

24
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.200
we can kind of figure out.

25
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.605
Roughly what the font size is,
what the font weight should be,

26
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:43.160
how we want to align things.

27
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.581
So I had to get the buttons kind
of in the right position and

28
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.700
stuff along those lines.

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.532
So it is super helpful,
again I wouldn't rely on the CSS and

30
00:01:50.532 --> 00:01:53.982
just copy and
paste it in like mark the ticket is done,

31
00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:59.710
but at least like takes some of the
guesswork out, and gets you a head start.

32
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.830
Okay so let's talk about this
segue here into the next section,

33
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.930
so as we saw before, and I'll zoom back
in on that, we have all these boxes.

34
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.874
What would happen if I wanted
to make another yellow box or

35
00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:16.660
maybe a yellow circle, right?

36
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.814
There's a bunch of ways
that I could do it, and

37
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:27.100
none of them scale, I could duplicate
it and then that would work.

38
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.048
But if I needed something totally
different of the same color, now I want

39
00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:35.260
an icon or something else, or text that's
the same color, it's gonna get hard.

40
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.314
I could go in either Design or
Inspect and grab the values and

41
00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:44.015
just start using that all over my design,
but like the engineering,

42
00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.570
you should be like, I'm not doing that.

43
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.461
I'm not, because I don't have to go
ahead and change every hex code,

44
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.030
when we decide where you are with
a slightly different shade of yellow.

45
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.204
I'm not, I won't, you could select all and
change it but like,

46
00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:00.783
there should be some part of you,
which is like, when I'm writing code,

47
00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:03.240
I don't write the same value over and
over again.

48
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.771
In a store in a variable,
or make a CSS class,

49
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:15.167
something along those lines,
that same kind of sort of laziness really,

50
00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:21.130
that you have as an engineer,
works here as well.

51
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.765
So I guess the question is, and
I kind of already answered it, but

52
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:29.305
how would we go about doing,
right, again yeah,

53
00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:33.350
I could use the eyedropper tool here and
go the fill.

54
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.513
I can be like, okay, now I want this to
be orange, I could do that, but like that

55
00:03:37.513 --> 00:03:41.863
won't work, if it's on another page,
you can see how this doesn't really work,

56
00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:45.740
we're gonna need some additional tools
here in order to figure this out.
