1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.949
So this is, again, a variation on a theme
that we'll kinda take to its conclusion

2
00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.556
where we've got four components.

3
00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:07.811
These are all SVGs.

4
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.322
Good luck for anyone who tried.

5
00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:14.610
[LAUGH] But
we can kinda take this base component.

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.811
I know that everyone was gonna
cheat at some point [LAUGH].

7
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:19.445
So we can have this base component.

8
00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:23.060
And this is, again,
the one that we never plan on using.

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.927
So we'll call it .notification, or .base,
and we can put it in a notification frame

10
00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.211
at some point, or in a base frame,
whatever you wanna do.

11
00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:35.390
We can even call it .base/.notification.

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.949
And I'll probably go with that
button that I think I named in

13
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.885
the similar fashion,
assuming that I named it in that fashion.

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.170
Okey-dokies, so we've got that, and
now we're gonna turn it into an instance,

15
00:00:55.216 --> 00:01:01.171
Or into a main component, and
we can drag in our four varietals,

16
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:04.938
variable one, two, three, and four.

17
00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:09.606
And at this point,
it's an exercise in colorization, right?

18
00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:15.890
And so I can theoretically at
this point switch this to,

19
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.384
let's call this one
the success notification.

20
00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:27.191
We'll give the lighter color to that,
darker color, nope.

21
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.062
That was too easy.

22
00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:33.650
It was too close.

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.542
There, you can choose
different shades if you want.

24
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.720
It's fine with me.

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.769
We will make the danger one.

26
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.740
Maybe we need a lighter version there.

27
00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:52.730
Yeah, and
then we'll do the darker color as well.

28
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.790
This will be our info,

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.130
And the darker color here.

30
00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:13.140
Information, where are you?
I like this one.

31
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.062
And we'll go ahead over here.

32
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.297
This is the warning, the light color.

33
00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:29.807
And we'll give it that one.

34
00:02:29.807 --> 00:02:35.460
All right, so now what I will probably
do is put these all in a frame now.

35
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:42.009
We'll call this notifications, and

36
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:47.161
each of these basically
can become a component.

37
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.810
Right, the other way to do it if you wanna
do it by hand that many times is you can

38
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.824
actually just select them all,
even if you can select them like that.

39
00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:03.310
You can even arrange them.

40
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.670
And you can also go, hold on,
A lot of times, you can select.

41
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.049
It'll give you the option to
create multiple components, but

42
00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.970
it's not giving it to me right now.

43
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.870
Or did I already do it, that's why.

44
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.605
Yeah, two of them are already base 1,
so let's grab the two that are not.

45
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:26.230
I'll show you.

46
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.670
And I can create multiple
components at the same time.

47
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.144
And as you can see,
these all need to be renamed.

48
00:03:36.144 --> 00:03:39.482
We'll call it this one is warning.

49
00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:44.552
There was one interesting
thing that we need to

50
00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:50.662
talk about with using
the strategy of base components,

51
00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:54.957
and you can kinda see it in the sidebar.

52
00:03:54.957 --> 00:04:00.478
So take a look at that for a second,
and I will kinda explain in a second.

53
00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:02.917
Danger, that's warning.

54
00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:06.120
Which one was this?

55
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.886
That's success.
It's what happens when you talk and

56
00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:08.853
type at the same time.

57
00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:13.783
So one of the things that
you'll see is that these

58
00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:18.328
are effectively framed around
the base version, right?

59
00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:22.060
And so you will occasionally need
to do a little bit of tweaking.

60
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.860
I don't love this.

61
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.157
It's not my favorite part about Figma.

62
00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:27.660
This one tends to work.

63
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.490
There will be times where
the sizing doesn't work,

64
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.310
cuz it's a component nested
inside of another component.

65
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.609
And so in those cases, you have to just
make sure that your constraints, and

66
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:41.109
you're filling out the area as you should.

67
00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:44.081
I especially notice that when I was
working on the input fields, I would have

68
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:47.115
the base version, and then all the other
ones, they wouldn't stretch out.

69
00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:49.326
But if I went in there kinda
into the components that I made,

70
00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:50.755
just told them to fill the container.

71
00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.910
I just had to manually tweak it.

72
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.170
I think it's one of things I suspect
will get fixed in a future version.

73
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.071
I don't think that it's intentional,
or there's a particular reason why.

74
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:04.225
But if you find that your kinda child
components don't stretch the way that they

75
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:06.218
should, just realize that they are.

76
00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:10.730
I heard you like components, so
I put components in your components.

77
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.170
And just make sure that they're
filling out the container.

78
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.250
You might have to tweak it a little bit.

79
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.180
These seem to be totally fine, but
I've done this enough times, and

80
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.550
I'm not always completely sure about
when it happens in this case, cool.

81
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.390
I don't want that one size changed though,
so go back in there.

82
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.578
All right, so now, again, I have them all.

83
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:35.920
There they are.

84
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.522
And I can drag them in.

85
00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:41.000
I can swap between them, as we've seen.

86
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.219
Like I said before, there are other
examples that you can play around with.

87
00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:50.480
One of the questions is that can the base
component have variants as well?

88
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.800
Absolutely, and there's a lot of reasons
why you might choose to do that as well.

89
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.605
So you could theoretically have at
least the shadow and the darker color.

90
00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:01.728
You're probably gonna still have to do
some work on each one of the little

91
00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.470
instances beyond that.

92
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.069
But it will theoretically work as well.

93
00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:13.280
And we'll see one case where that
might be helpful in a little bit.

94
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.760
Okay, in the same way that
I made the primary and

95
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.136
the secondary buttons,
once you've got the first one,

96
00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:28.288
you can kind of make the different
states call on them,

97
00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:31.772
and you can kinda build out this set.

98
00:06:31.772 --> 00:06:35.340
It's just more of changing some colors,
as we've seen a bunch of times.
