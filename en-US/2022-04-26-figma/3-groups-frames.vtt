00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.320
Let's hop back over to frames and
groups, real quick.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.310
We talked about frames,
we didn't talk about groups.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.474
We talked about the fact that,
you can put a bunch of stuff in a frame.

4
00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:15.016
A frame can be a container, like a div or
anything along those lines,

5
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:18.242
even an array if you wanted
to use that metaphor.

6
00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:23.762
Group is another way, it kind of have
a bunch of stuff together as well,

7
00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.718
but it doesn't have any of
the features of a frame,

8
00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:31.957
it's not something you can
use kind of in a prototype.

9
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:34.696
It's just like, I wanna move a bunch
of stuff at once a bunch of times,

10
00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:37.027
maybe you want to duplicate
three objects at the same time.

11
00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:39.388
You can make a group real quick,
they'll stay together, so

12
00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:41.777
when you select one of them,
you'll get all three.

13
00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:44.667
So I can hit command J, or
right click and group them.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.109
But, usually what I use this for
is if I had mixed I can

15
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.046
subtract 100 pixels and
that works that's great.

16
00:00:56.046 --> 00:01:00.059
But what if I wanted it like okay, for

17
00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.590
the whole selection go to the 00 point,

18
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.768
because I think you can
kind of see in this case,

19
00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:14.707
my first thing here is at negative 1279.

20
00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.991
What if I wanted this page to start at 00?

21
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:22.516
I could grab it, and I could try
to guess and move it around and

22
00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.460
stuff along those lines.

23
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.140
I could do the math here,
that seems horrible.

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.600
What I'd rather do is just quickly make a
group say move that to zero on the y axis,

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.125
they'll all move and everything
will behave as I thought it should.

26
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:44.716
And then to ungroup you just hit
CMD+SHIFT+G, and it will ungroup those.

27
00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.930
So I'll use it if I need to
do a bunch of stuff at once.

28
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.660
Occasionally, you wanna group things
while you're making the design.

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.980
I would say like 5% of the time,
I'm permanently keeping a group.

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.009
Rest of time I'm probably using a frame,
but I'm just temporarily doing something

31
00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.370
I'll group it, do whatever I'm doing,
ungroup it really quickly.

32
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.865
Frames are what we use for
everything else,

33
00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:11.872
we saw that you can draw a frame, hit F,

34
00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:17.310
make box, put stuff in, right, make sense.

35
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.197
The other thing we might
wanna do is I have stuff.

36
00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:23.335
What I wanna do in this case
is if I hit command option G,

37
00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:26.766
cuz that's the letter we normal think for
frames, right?

38
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:30.409
Letter G,
it will make a frame out of that as well.

39
00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.675
And cuz this is a transparent one, so
if I try, well non of you can see cuz this

40
00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.765
Macbook is very fancy,
is am slamming on my trackpad.

41
00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:42.706
[SOUND] Am slamming so hard trying to
select this, I could hit the name, or

42
00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:47.242
I can hit command and I will actually
get it in this case as well, and

43
00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:48.708
we can have that too.

44
00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:52.244
So we can create frames by drawing them,
we can select stuff,

45
00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:55.380
we can make a frame around
it with command option JPEG.

46
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.902
The other option if you're like, I'll
never remember that is, grab two things,

47
00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:02.850
right click,
you have a bunch of options here.

48
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.930
And then eventually, you'll start
to memorize some of these things.

49
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.855
The one caveat is these two things
have different keystrokes for

50
00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:13.190
creating groups and frames.

51
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.370
But just to keep you on your toes,
they have the same keystroke for

52
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.947
ungrouping and unframing,
which is command option G.

53
00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:26.409
And that seems like you'll never remember
it, but over time you will, and if not,

54
00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.820
I've made you this fun little card that
you can print out and put somewhere.

55
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.400
Okay, one other thing that we
want to kind of see here as well.

56
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.750
Just some other features of frames.

57
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.700
So this is a frame.

58
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.593
And if I go to the design piece here,
there is this ability to clip content,

59
00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:50.648
right, cuz these circles
technically overflow the bounce.

60
00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:52.518
But if I'm trying to I'll create a box or

61
00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:55.215
something along those lines I
don't want it to overflow or

62
00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:58.311
maybe it's like a browser window or
something along those lines.

63
00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:01.151
We'll see some other use cases for
this in a little bit,

64
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:05.340
I can say anything outside the bounds of
this frame, hide, and put away forever.
