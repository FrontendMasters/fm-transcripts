00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.258
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One of my favorite sites,
Google Maps.

2
00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:07.603
So the next thing we're going to
talk about then is Google Maps and

3
00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:10.694
how we can embed a Google Map
into our web page.

4
00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.908
So as you I'm sure most of you
are familiar with Google Maps,

5
00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:15.368
you've used this before.

6
00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:18.160
This is maps.google.com.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.680
And so one of the things that is fairly
typical to add on a contact form,

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.678
contact directions,
sort of page like this.

9
00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:27.574
Maybe over here on the side,

10
00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:32.330
we'd like to add directions to
the Frontend Masters location, okay?

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.359
And this is their address here,
60 South 6th Street, in Minneapolis.

12
00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.102
So if we go ahead, and
drop that on into Google Maps.

13
00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:46.544
And you can use whatever address you want.

14
00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:53.906
This is going to go ahead and map exactly
where we are, 60 South 6th Street.

15
00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:59.200
Now, as you know,
in Google Maps we can zoom in on that.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.735
We can zoom out on that.

17
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.639
So you can play around, we can move it
around in space, clicking and dragging,

18
00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:06.763
we can move it around.

19
00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:12.342
So you can change this around and get it,
[COUGH] get a view that works for you.

20
00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:16.965
Get a view that works for you.

21
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:19.765
And once you have that,
then we can go ahead and share it.

22
00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.596
So there's a little share button over
here on the side in your Google Maps.

23
00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:27.705
Okay, Share and it's gonna give
you some options for sharing.

24
00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:31.787
You may have used this first option here,
which is to send a link, right?

25
00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:32.912
I'm sure we've all done this.

26
00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:36.486
Here's how you get somewhere,
email somebody a link, for

27
00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.641
example, or text somebody a link.

28
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:40.710
Put your link up on social media.

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.041
But you may not have noticed there's
a second option here called Embed a Map.

30
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.683
Okay, if you look at that,
this is going to go ahead and

31
00:01:48.683 --> 00:01:51.629
show you what this map
is going to look like.

32
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:57.337
The map is built for you, okay?

33
00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:58.860
There we go.

34
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.094
And so once again, you can zoom in on it,
you can zoom out on it,

35
00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:03.759
get it looking the way you want.

36
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.378
And then look up here at the top.

37
00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:10.912
We can pick a size,
we can make a small map.

38
00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:14.103
We could make a large map.

39
00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:17.932
We can do a custom size and type in
some sort of dimensions that we want.

40
00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:21.389
I'm going to go with a small map.

41
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.372
And notice how Google is being very nice
to us and writing us a lovely little piece

42
00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:28.536
of code up here on the top in a tag
you might not have seen before.

43
00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:33.777
Everybody see that,
this little clip of code up here.

44
00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.885
This is the iframe tag.

45
00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.161
What is the iframe tag?

46
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:41.665
Anyone have any ideas?

47
00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:45.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Basically inserts
another website into your own website.

48
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.364
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

49
00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:52.352
this is actually gonna cut a little hole
in your webpage and show Google instead.

50
00:02:52.352 --> 00:02:56.678
So the code here doesn't actually live
on your web page, we're just saying hey,

51
00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.560
go out to Google and
grab this thing off their server and

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.150
display it on my webpage in this
little hole that we're gonna make.

53
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.433
Makes sense, okay?

54
00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:08.427
So all we have to do is say, copy HTML.

55
00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:11.998
That's gonna go ahead and
copy that to our clipboard.

56
00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:16.236
And then in our form,
we just have to place it.

57
00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:20.511
So I'd like to put our location,
maybe I'd like to go ahead and

58
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:22.536
drop in the form right there.

59
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.318
So you can just copy and paste and

60
00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:28.355
then the Google Map will show up very
nicely right there on your website.
