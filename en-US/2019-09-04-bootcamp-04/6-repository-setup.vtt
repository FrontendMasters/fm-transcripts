1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So once you've got
your GitHub desktop downloaded or

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.600
if it's still downloading,
you can continue on with this step.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.220
So for step number three, we're gonna
create something called a repository.

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.430
And so, a repository is a place where
your files are going to be stored,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.260
kind of like a folder or
a directory, okay?

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.180
So first of all,
make sure you're signed into GitHub.

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.180
Okay, so your screen here
should look like this, okay.

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.980
The next thing you're gonna do is
you're gonna add a repository,

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.800
there's a bunch of ways to do that.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.683
One way to do it is down here,

11
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:38.475
there's a big green button that says
do repository, you can open that.

12
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.590
There's probably one
of the things up here.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.509
Yeah, the plus sign up here
will give you a new repository.

14
00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:45.860
They all go to the same place.

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.120
Choose one of those options.

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.496
And you should be at GitHub slash new,
okay?

17
00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:56.310
Your screens gonna look
a tiny bit different from

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.390
mine because mine says the owner
is Jennifer Web, that's me.

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.430
That's gonna have your
username there instead.

20
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.820
And so, the way you're gonna wanna
configure this is just like this.

21
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.900
We're gonna make a new repository.

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.310
We're gonna call it
yourusername.github.io.

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.200
So in my case,
mine is Jenforweb.github.io.

24
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.740
Emma, what's your username?

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.554
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Moy.

26
00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:25.436
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Moy.github.io,
Ryan, what's your username?

27
00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.019
&gt;&gt; Ryan: R6256.

28
00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:32.945
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: R6256.github.io, okay, that
is what you wanna type in right there.

29
00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:40.661
So, we're gonna go ahead and do that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

30
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:44.841
mine is gonna give me an error because
I already have this repository.

31
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:47.884
But you are gonna go ahead and
type this in and

32
00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:51.762
it's gonna not give you
an error cuz you don't, okay.

33
00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:54.600
You're gonna go ahead and
type in a description.

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.030
I've said this is Jen's website on GitHub,
because that's what it is.

35
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.638
You are welcome to write
your own description.

36
00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:05.341
You're gonna go ahead and
make this a public website.

37
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The private option costs
money, the public option is free.

38
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.030
You can uncheck initialize this repository
with a read me, you can go back and

39
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.420
add one later, don't worry about it for
the right now.

40
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.030
And then go ahead and
click on create repository.

41
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.493
So in other words, what we are doing in
this step is we're creating a space on

42
00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:36.414
GitHub for our website to go.

43
00:02:36.414 --> 00:02:41.444
Okay, we're just creating a space on
GitHub where our website is going to go,

44
00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.974
just go ahead and get that configured.

45
00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:47.644
So once you've gone ahead and
created that repository up on GitHub,

46
00:02:47.644 --> 00:02:51.140
we're gonna set up the repository
in GitHub Desktop.

47
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.420
So what we've done now is we've created
that repository somewhere out there.

48
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420
That's where the website is gonna go.

49
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.500
Now we're gonna create a repository on
the computer that's in front of you.

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.930
And then shockingly, we'll connect these
and make them talk to each other, okay?

51
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.990
So, we're gonna go ahead and set up
this repository in the following way.

52
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.120
There should be,
in the next screen right on GitHub,

53
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.010
after you've gone ahead and
created your repository.

54
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.510
You click the Create a repository button,
there is the screen here.

55
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.810
So you should be able to click on that
button that says, Setup in Desktop.

56
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.690
Just go ahead and click that button.

57
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.210
That will go ahead and
put you in GitHub Desktop.

58
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.339
And you should see an opening
configuration screen just like this.

59
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.580
So once you went ahead and
clicked on that setup and

60
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.370
desktop button, you'll get this screen.

61
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.560
Click on Sign into github.com.

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.416
Enter your username and password and
whatever else they asked for.

63
00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:10.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's where we
are in the notes, we're at step four.

64
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.520
Follow these three screenshots,
that's what you should be seeing, okay?

65
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.245
Okay, so once you got that done,
we're gonna go on here.

66
00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.454
Now that you're in GitHub Desktop,

67
00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:29.122
the screen should be filled out for
you on the URL tab.

68
00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:33.445
You're gonna choose a desktop, choose
the desktop for your local path, and

69
00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:36.340
it will create a new folder for
you on the desktop.

70
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.630
So in other words,
it's gonna ask you for your local path.

71
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.430
Go ahead and
click on your choose button here.

72
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.790
Navigate to your desktop of your computer,
select it, and

73
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.390
GitHub is gonna go ahead and
create a new folder for you.

74
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.809
In this case, my folder will be called
Jenforwebgithub.io, does that make sense?

75
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.330
Go on ahead and do that.

76
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.300
So you're basically creating a folder
on your desktop using this methodology.

77
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.153
It's kinda weird, but that's okay.

78
00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:13.831
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or as it says down at the
bottom, alternatively, you can drag and

79
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:15.930
drop a local repository here to add it.

80
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.220
That would be the other thing to do.

81
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.350
So step five is this, that folder that
GitHub just made for you on your desktop,

82
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.060
you need to make sure it has stuff in it
that you'd like to put up online, okay.

83
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.070
That only makes sense, right?

84
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.149
So, you have been coding a bunch
of stuff over the last few days.

85
00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:39.720
You wanna put some of that
stuff into that GitHub folder.

86
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.140
Now here's where things are gonna break,
okay.

87
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.953
So you created for
example, a form yesterday,

88
00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:51.541
that form has images,
it has JavaScript and it has HTML.

89
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:56.462
All of that together, all of those things,
the folder for your images,

90
00:05:56.462 --> 00:06:01.707
the folder for your JavaScript, the folder
for your CSS, and the HTML file,

91
00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:06.976
all of that has got to get copied into
your GitHub.io folder on your desktop.

92
00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:11.310
Go ahead and copy it wherever
you've kept it to this point.

93
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.730
Copy it,
paste it into the GitHub.io folder, okay?

94
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.816
If you don't get all the things,
you forget the images,

95
00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:23.809
you forget the JavaScript, you forget
the CSS, guess what will happen?

96
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.566
[SOUND] All right, it'll look weird,
cuz it lost all its formatting.

97
00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:31.070
It'll look weird,
cuz the images aren't there.

98
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.130
The form doesn't submit anywhere, because
you don't have the JavaScript, okay?

99
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:42.000
Make sure you have all the things, and you
copy them all into that GitHub.io folder.

100
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.260
So we're gonna go ahead and take a break,
while you go about doing that.

101
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.355
Deciding what it is you wanna go ahead and
post on stuff on GitHub.

102
00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:51.485
Just go ahead and
make copies of the stuff.

103
00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:53.485
Leave it wherever it is right now and
working.

104
00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:55.505
Make a copy into that GitHub folder.

105
00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:56.845
So, that's step five.

106
00:06:56.845 --> 00:07:00.235
You've gone ahead and you've gotten
everything into your GitHub.io folder,

107
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:04.359
whatever it is that you wanna
put up online first, okay?

108
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.780
And so now what you're gonna do
here in GitHub.io, I went ahead and

109
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.790
took some of my form files from yesterday.

110
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.290
And you'll notice that down here
at the bottom of these files,

111
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.850
there is this sort of area down here which
has it says, summary and description.

112
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.970
These are notes for what's called
a commit that you're about to make.

113
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.030
So, what you're going to be doing
is copying these files on up into

114
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.770
GitHub itself out there on the Internet.

115
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.592
And because GitHub is primarily used for
tracking code and

116
00:07:41.592 --> 00:07:44.249
tracking the changes to code over time.

117
00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.107
It's nice to make a note
about what you have done and

118
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:52.068
why you decided to send these
up to the server again.

119
00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:57.218
So usually in this case, cuz this is
the first time this stuff is going up,

120
00:07:57.218 --> 00:08:03.370
usually it's called something like
initial commit, something like that.

121
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.210
You can of course be more specific than
that, there's a box here for description.

122
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.400
You can write it all in, GitHub
training at front of masters boot camp.

123
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.360
This is my forum from day four,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

124
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.654
whatever it is you wanna say.

125
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.604
So once you're done though,
once you're done going ahead and

126
00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:32.125
writing that note,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then

127
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:36.271
you're gonna click on commit to master and

128
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:41.980
publish branch, two clicks,
two clicks, two clicks.

129
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.680
Very, very important, two clicks.

130
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.760
It should be one but it's not,
if you only do one click,

131
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.110
it won't work, ask me how I know.

132
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.380
Okay, so commit to master and
then publish branch.

133
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.733
So let's go ahead and do that now.

134
00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:04.735
Once you have your note in place,
you'll click on that commit and

135
00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:05.729
sync master button.

136
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.096
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then it might give you this,

137
00:09:12.096 --> 00:09:15.910
this little drop down here that
says published repository.

138
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.490
If not, there's a button up here in the
upper right hand corner that says publish,

139
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.260
going ahead and publish from that.

140
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.053
Okay, critical to go ahead and do both.

141
00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:28.580
Okay, try again.

142
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:36.266
Mind blew up, I have no idea why,
hopefully yours work, did yours work?

143
00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:39.572
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,

144
00:09:39.572 --> 00:09:42.850
it looks like everything just went away,
you see over there on the side,

145
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.340
it looks like all your files disappeared.

146
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:45.890
They didn't,

147
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:52.100
they should have been copied up to
wherever it is that you've sent them.

148
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.174
And so it will look like you have
nothing left over here on this side,

149
00:09:59.174 --> 00:10:01.796
it will look like you have
nothing left over here.

150
00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:05.738
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have
no idea why mine broke.

151
00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:12.376
If anybody has any ideas, that would
be great to know, but, yeah, okay.

152
00:10:16.744 --> 00:10:21.499
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so now, once you've
done that then you can go ahead and

153
00:10:21.499 --> 00:10:24.250
take a look at your browser window.

154
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.344
So we're gonna go to, in my case,

155
00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:32.735
Jenforwebgithub.io, all right?

156
00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:36.630
And if we just go there that much,
you may or may not see anything at all.

157
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.586
I actually have a file called index.html.

158
00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:48.840
Which just had still working on it,
really cuz this is me testing stuff, okay?

159
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.540
If you sent up an html page
called blitz says, forms.html,

160
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.649
it would be jenforweb.github.io/form or

161
00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:03.400
forms.html, whatever
the name of that file was.

162
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.620
I'm getting a 404 because I had
an error sending up my stuff.

163
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.750
Emma, I'm sure yours work,
what's your address here.

164
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.860
&gt;&gt; Emma: So mine is, emmay.github.io,

165
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:23.410
and then I put mine in
a folder called abduction.

166
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, slash abduction.

167
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.178
All right, uh-huh.

168
00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:29.417
&gt;&gt; Emma: And then that's it.

169
00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:34.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
this is Emma's page, and it works.

170
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.790
So you can see her address
here is emmay.github.io,

171
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.170
and she put everything into
a folder called abduction.

172
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.740
So that abduction folder has got the CSS
folder, it's got the JavaScript folder,

173
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.310
it's got our HTML in it.

174
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.440
It's got all of her images in it.

175
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.340
And she called her web page here,
she called it index.html.

176
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.977
And so, it will show up just like that
with just the folder name after GitHub.io.

177
00:12:02.977 --> 00:12:08.180
You can of course also put in index.html.

178
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.450
The web server is configured such that
it looks for a file called index.HTML.

179
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.844
If it finds one, it'll display it for
you without you having to type that in.

180
00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:18.164
&gt;&gt; Emma: Do you like the font
that I found, [INAUDIBLE]

181
00:12:18.164 --> 00:12:19.431
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I love the font that you

182
00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:21.510
found, that's very appropriate.

183
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.310
Your font looks fabulous.
