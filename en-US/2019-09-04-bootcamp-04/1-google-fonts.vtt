WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great, so let's go on
ahead and open up another tab here.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.541
We are going to fonts.google.com.

3
00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:13.590
There is a our website, fonts.google.com.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.394
And so as of today, there are 900 fonts
available here in Google Fonts, 900.

5
00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:26.860
If you can't find the font you want,
you might try getting less picky, okay?

6
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.450
It's in here somewhere.

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.330
So as you can see on this page,
these are all of the fonts.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.220
They're sort of listed here.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.490
The current listing is in trending.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.930
So if you look over here on the right-hand
side, it says we're sorted by trending.

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.001
So in other words Roboto is currently
very popular, Poor Story, Spicy Rice.

12
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.680
These are some of the very
popular fonts at the moment.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.921
You can sort these differently, so
we can just say what is popular.

14
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.360
Shockingly, Roboto is still popular.

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410
Actually, notice that a lot of
these fonts are very plain.

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.240
Because a lot of people
are using these just for

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.430
regular text on their websites, okay?

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.130
You can also sort these by the date added,
or

19
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.110
alphabetical order whatever
it is that you wanna do.

20
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.580
I'm just gonna go ahead and
sort mine by alphabetical order.

21
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.342
There are languages that are available,
so we as English speakers here in

22
00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:24.758
the classroom, these fonts typically
work very well with English.

23
00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:29.282
If you're speaking another language,
specially those that are not using

24
00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:33.660
this type of alphabet,
there are other choices for you here.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.880
So for example, if you are Vietnamese,
there is a Vietnamese option here.

26
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.570
And it'll go ahead and give you the whole
page here in Vietnamese with all

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.570
the various accents and so forth that are
important for that particular language.

28
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.400
So that's a very nice feature as well.

29
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.010
Okay, so what I'm going to do here is

30
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.810
I'm gonna show you that we have some
categories over here on the side.

31
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.880
Remember, we talked about serif and
sans serif.

32
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.050
Now display tends to be for larger type,

33
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.470
if you were making a billboard that
would be a reason to use display.

34
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.960
There's also handwriting fonts and
monospace.

35
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.990
I'm a big fan of the handwriting fonts,
I just find them fun.

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.169
So I'm gonna go ahead and just say,
show me all the handwriting fonts.

37
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.990
And you can pick whatever you wanna do.

38
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.050
And as you scroll on down here,
you can see all kinds of different

39
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.210
fonts that you could include
on your web page here.

40
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.890
I'm gonna go to this one
here that's at the top here,

41
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.560
it's called the Architect's Daughter,
okay?

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.570
So if we go ahead and we click on this,
you can type in anything you want here.

43
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.220
Frontend Masters Bootcamp, okay?

44
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.920
So I can see exactly the text
that I want to show.

45
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.248
I can see exactly what it's gonna look
like in that font, which is really nice.

46
00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Google will give you
sentences for example, or paragraphs, or

47
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.300
just the alphabet, so
you can choose those options.

48
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.030
You can also choose your font weight,
you can choose the size.

49
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.150
So this is just as you're looking at this,
and as you can see,

50
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.130
probably this is enormous time sink.

51
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.560
You can spend hours here looking for
the perfect font, okay?

52
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.810
So let's just say you found it.

53
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.780
Once you find it, whatever that font is,

54
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.340
up here in the upper right corner of
the font there is a little plus sign.

55
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.020
So you can go on ahead and add this, and

56
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.490
a little pop up will show
up down here at the bottom.

57
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.310
If we go on ahead and click that,
this is gonna tell us how

58
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.142
exactly we can include this
font in our web page, okay?

59
00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:51.410
And you might notice that under embed
font on standard, look at this.

60
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.550
Does that look familiar?.

61
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.980
Does that line of code look familiar?.

62
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.550
Yeah, that's a line of code
that links to a style sheet.

63
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.560
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go ahead and copy that line of code.

64
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.390
And then right on in your HTML,
you can go on ahead and include this.

65
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.740
Obviously, that should go in
the head of your document.

66
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.230
I'm putting mine in a code pen,

67
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.740
so I'm just gonna put it at
the top here on my code pen.

68
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.180
There may be a way I can
do this more properly,

69
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.160
but I'm just going to stick it right here
at the top of my HTML and my code pen.

70
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.130
If you're following along with your
actual files, you would definitely wanna

71
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.060
put that in the head of your document
along with your other style sheet.

72
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.100
And I would recommend putting
it before your style sheet.

73
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.880
So the first thing that's
gonna be listed in order

74
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.660
is going to be a link to this Google Font.

75
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.870
The second thing that's gonna be listed
is your style sheet you've been working

76
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.960
on so far.

77
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.060
Why are we going to put the Google Font
first, and your style sheets second?

78
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.002
Why would we list our our
CSS files that way, yeah?

79
00:04:58.002 --> 00:05:01.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In case we're overriding
it in the style sheet somewhere?

80
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, yeah,
in case we're overriding,

81
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.410
[CROSSTALK] Or
in case we're actually calling it, right?

82
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.830
Notice that nothing changed on this page.

83
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.035
I linked to the style sheet, but
nothing changed in my code pen, did it?

84
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:16.428
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what have I done so far?

85
00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:22.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I linked to the font,
that's all.

86
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.119
I haven't actually said display anything,
okay?

87
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.590
So this is a two part process.

88
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.710
So the second thing I need to do,
is down here,

89
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.030
just scroll down in that same
window a little further,

90
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.510
see here where it says use the following
CSS rules to specify these families.

91
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.785
And then it gives us more CSS that
should be familiar to you, right?

92
00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:46.839
Font-family Architects Daughter, cursive.

93
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.889
So if we go ahead and copy that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

94
00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.821
we jump into our form here,
I'm gonna scroll on down.

95
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.901
Well, I don't actually have a style for
my h2.

96
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.730
I'm gonna apply it to my h2.

97
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.680
So I'm gonna go ahead and
make a style for my h2, and

98
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.614
simply paste in my font-family there.

99
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.170
And this may not work at all in code pen.

100
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.162
So as I just said,

101
00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:19.213
you're not really supposed to put your
link to your style sheet up here.

102
00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.730
I have just been told this
is the way that you do it.

103
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.610
I'm gonna go ahead and take it out
of where it's not supposed to go and

104
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.440
it doesn't work.

105
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.629
And when I go up here to Settings.

106
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.210
And if you notice here under
HTML in the settings, look here,

107
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.170
here's the stuff for the head.

108
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.197
So we'll go ahead and

109
00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:43.665
paste in the link to my style sheet here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

110
00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:45.078
then say, Save and Close.

111
00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:49.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And is it gonna work now?

112
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.334
I do have an h2, right?

113
00:06:54.334 --> 00:06:56.898
I have an h1, that's the other problem.

114
00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:59.820
It doesn't work when
the tag doesn't exist.

115
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.990
I'm sure I surprised you by that,
there we go, now it works, okay?

116
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.623
Gotta make sure you have
the right selector for

117
00:07:07.623 --> 00:07:09.188
what it is you're trying to select.

118
00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:13.430
So there we go, there's the h1, and
now you can see it's here on the page.

119
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.980
And I could put this in other places.

120
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.330
Maybe I also want it to be on the legend,
on my form, that's kinda cool looking.

121
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.131
Maybe I want it over here on our location,
maybe that's the h3.

122
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:28.048
Is that an h3?

123
00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:30.235
I don't know what that is over there,
let me look and see.

124
00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:36.828
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is an h3-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just need the comma-

125
00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:39.531
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: ,legend, there we go.

126
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.340
So now I can apply that style and

127
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.400
that font pretty much anywhere
I want here on the web page.

128
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.140
Any questions on web fonts so far, yes?

129
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So because we are in
the head we're linking to, in this case,

130
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.500
Google Fonts-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

131
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That means that in order for

132
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.970
somebody to see our font
Google has to be up.

133
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And like, online,

134
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.680
the fonts still has to be there.

135
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.737
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So we're relying on

136
00:08:03.737 --> 00:08:06.320
both our code working and
Google's code working.

137
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct,
that's an excellent point.

138
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.230
So when we rely on these web fonts,
we're relying on the fact that Google

139
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.650
has a server with these fonts
on it that is currently up.

140
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.850
If Google goes down,
it happens every once in a while,

141
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.250
the Internet totally freaks out.

142
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.860
But if Google goes down then your
font is also going to be down.

143
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.595
And that is why in
the declaration here it says,

144
00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:32.910
font-family as architects comma cursive,
right?

145
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.810
So the generic cursive font
is going to display if

146
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.060
Google Fonts happens to be down in
Architects Daughter is unavailable.

147
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.000
Does that make sense?

148
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.138
If you wanna get picky about it,
you can also of course,

149
00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:45.590
you can add to this font stack.

150
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.736
You could also say,
Arial and Helvetica, right?

151
00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:54.135
Something like that.

152
00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.407
There is nothing wrong with
putting extra fonts on there.
