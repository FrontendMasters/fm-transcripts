00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.330
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.590
We are into week two of
the front end masters bootcamp.

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.960
I'm so glad that you all came back.

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.760
Greetings to those of
you who are joining us.

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.260
My name is Jen Kramer.

7
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.446
I have been here for this past week,
we've been working on HTML and CSS.

8
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.180
And we're gonna start today just
going over some of the work that

9
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.620
you might have done over the weekend.

10
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.530
So as you saw,
all of the videos are up and posted.

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.400
You can take a look at all of those,
you can work through all the exercises.

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.690
And one of the last assignments that I
gave you is to start building a portfolio.

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.510
And some of you who've done
some really fabulous work and

14
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.458
wanted to share a few of those with you.

15
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:40.850
Once we go through these portfolios,
and I'll be done here and

16
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.550
we'll be on to Brian Holt and JavaScript
and learning something entirely new.

17
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.040
So let's take a look at some of
these great portfolios here.

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.170
So this is our first one,

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.330
this is from Emma,
who's here in class with us in person.

20
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.340
Emma, do you wanna tell
us about your website?

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.280
&gt;&gt; Emma: Sure, yeah, so
this is my portfolio site.

22
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.680
I wanted to put up information
on the job search right now, so

23
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.470
I wanted to put up information about my
professional projects and achievements,

24
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.470
as well as my quilting which
is probably my favorite hobby.

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.070
So I used flexbox to
make these little like

26
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.000
Polaroid photos of my quilts
with little descriptions below.

27
00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:26.896
Eventually I wanna get
better photos of my quilts

28
00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:31.696
in uniform sizes so it looks even better.

29
00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:35.826
I learned a lot about flexbox doing this,

30
00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:39.838
I found the color scheme on Adobe Color.

31
00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:44.738
And I'm really proud of using emojis well,
[LAUGH] in my header,

32
00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.299
I found the font on Google fonts.

33
00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.130
So I'm pretty happy with that.

34
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.050
I embedded a YouTube video of me speaking.

35
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Excellent, very nice.

36
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.330
For those of you who wanna
take a look at this,

37
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.170
this is at emmay.github.io and you can
take a look at Emma's website from there.

38
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.180
And this looks absolutely fabulous.

39
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.867
Well done.

40
00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:09.228
&gt;&gt; Emma: Well, thank you.

41
00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:13.716
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

42
00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.500
let's take a look at another one here.

43
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.231
And this one is from Chrissy who's online
and she's been online the whole week.

44
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:25.760
This particular website here all
about her bootcamp projects.

45
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.250
As you can see,
she's already for JavaScript.

46
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.690
And if you take a look at her links here,
she's got an About Me page.

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.660
So here's a little bit about Chrissy.

48
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.800
You can see she's made
nice use of fonts here.

49
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.600
She's made use of some icons,
probably from Font Awesome.

50
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.890
I would imagine.

51
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.830
She's got a quote in here and so forth.

52
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.800
And she's posted her book excerpt.

53
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.300
So this is one of the exercises
we did last week.

54
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.775
This is that book chapter,
she went ahead and formatted.

55
00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.620
It looks really, really great.

56
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.910
She's done a nice job with her pull
quotes, a nice job with the photos.

57
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.250
She's got our rounded corners,
nice and consistent.

58
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.950
And if we take a look then, she's got a
contact form that's gone ahead and built.

59
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.550
I really like the use of
fonts on this one, too.

60
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.660
She's done a very nice job,
making a very clean sorta look here.

61
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.374
So I think these links
go to the same places.

62
00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:22.784
And so I'm really pleased with that.

63
00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.956
It's an extra level of challenge to follow
along online rather than here in class and

64
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.285
Chrissy, you did fabulous work, great job.

65
00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:35.280
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,

66
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.220
and then, Thomas Fitzgerald also online.

67
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.920
And he's done some interesting stuff here.

68
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.200
And I'm just gonna scroll
through his stuff first and

69
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.170
then I'll show you some of the extra
things that he's done here.

70
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.300
He's clearly been doing
a little research online.

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.550
So here's a picture of Thomas here.

72
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.550
And you can read all about his stuff.

73
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.520
This is a Fitzwebdevgithub.io.

74
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.470
Here's his projects.

75
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.400
You can click through on those.

76
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.870
And he's got his links to social
media down here in the bottom.

77
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.070
That's probably some
more fun awesome icons.

78
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.890
Now he's done some cool stuff
here with his navigation.

79
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.110
If you click on his links here,
he's jumping things down the page.

80
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.110
Just like that.

81
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.560
Very nice.

82
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.050
So he's doing some in page navigation,
jumping things around.

83
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.830
He's also done some cool, I thought I had
some animation in here but maybe not.

84
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.930
So here's an example of a code
pen that he put together.

85
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.320
That's something else he's doing here.

86
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.400
So that's certainly something that
you can do with your website,

87
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.604
you can drop in a couple
of codepen examples.

88
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.880
Here's the form that he built in class.

89
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.861
That probably looks
familiar to a lot of you.

90
00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:58.390
All right, so a very different kinda look
but very nice, very clean, very usable.

91
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.081
So well done, Thomas, great job.

92
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:04.740
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we have the last

93
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.500
one here, from somebody online, this is
Iris, and this is a completely different

94
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.040
theme than everybody else, who got kinda
comic book kinda thing going on here.

95
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.000
And what I really like about this
site is that she's got all of her

96
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.950
areas of expertise spelled right
out here on the home page.

97
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.300
We know everything about Iris immediately.

98
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.220
In a very short little bit of text,

99
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.290
that's actually pretty compelling to read
cuz its got a very fun formatting to it.

100
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.600
So she's a front end developer and
a technical writer and

101
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.990
a trainer, a coffee drinker,
[LAUGH] and a jigsaw puzzler.

102
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.050
So this is a really fun way of presenting
information maybe that's something and

103
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.600
idea that you could pick for
your own website.

104
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.710
As you can see down here on the bottom,
she's got her social media, and

105
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.906
she's got some other stuff going on here.

106
00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:56.970
She's got some comic sorta
stuff she's doing here.

107
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.230
She's got some projects that's she's done.

108
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.770
Once again,

109
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.150
repeating that same style from the home
page where she's listed her credentials.

110
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.200
Here, she's listed her projects
in that same sorta format.

111
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.670
It's really nice to repeat those
formats over and over again.

112
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.550
So that's really fun.

113
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.730
Iris, one little piece of feedback on
this, as you roll over, these are hover

114
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.070
states that you've done here, and
you put a border on the hover state, but

115
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.470
you probably don't have a border on this,
the regular display state and that's

116
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.190
causing this little bit of a twitch that
you see here as you roll over that link.

117
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.573
So if you actually put a border on all
of these, just color the border the same

118
00:06:35.573 --> 00:06:40.370
color as the background color that you're
using here, then when you roll over it,

119
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.577
you won't see this switch,
because you'll already have a border set.

120
00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:48.038
So border at the same width,
just the same color as the background so

121
00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:51.090
no one will see it, but
you'll avoid this twitch on Hover.

122
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.820
Looks fabulous though.

123
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.440
It's really amazing how far
you all have come in a week.

124
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.790
So, well done, Iris.

125
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.938
Great job.

126
00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:02.959
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Do you have one more?

127
00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:03.889
Sure.

128
00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's just
brileyah.github.io/portfolio.

129
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, slash portfolio.

130
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.969
[SOUND] Look at Briley.

131
00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.052
All right, Briley, tell us all about it.

132
00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:18.727
&gt;&gt; Briley: All right, well,

133
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:23.980
I built a modelling portfolio
because that's in my realm.

134
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.340
That's what I've got going on.

135
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.730
I found some cool parallax
scrolling that I really enjoy.

136
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.340
There's my dog, Munchie, on there.

137
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So hang on just a second,
so those of you who are wondering what

138
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.860
parallax scrolling is,
that's where the image stays in place.

139
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.800
You see how we scroll up and down, and
you can see the image gets covered slowly,

140
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.570
so that's parallax, P-A-R-A-L-L-A-X,
if you wanna put that in Google and

141
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.360
look that up, there's tons of places that
you can get the bit of code to do that.

142
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.270
So go ahead, Briley.

143
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.840
&gt;&gt; Briley: Yeah, it's still kinda I had
started on something totally different and

144
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.820
scratch this I still am in the making but
a little bit about me down there.

145
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.726
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [SOUND] Sorry,
all right, down here.

146
00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:09.460
Yeah.

147
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.263
&gt;&gt; Briley: And then you can find my social
media down at the bottom, underneath that,

148
00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:19.780
another scrolling,
then I have my actual portfolio for

149
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.730
my modeling work as a link
at the top up there.

150
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.864
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

151
00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:28.062
&gt;&gt; Briley: And I'll take you to that,
some more of the same.

152
00:08:28.062 --> 00:08:28.638
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nice.

153
00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:32.404
&gt;&gt; Briley: Some friend and
then down below is some video as well.

154
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.370
So that way I decide to do this.

155
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.970
I have control over my portfolio
as opposed to someone else.

156
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.755
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Briley: It's a good way to display.

157
00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Absolutely fabulous.

158
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.360
&gt;&gt; Briley: Not the best description,
but [LAUGH]

159
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's okay.

160
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.330
That's okay.

161
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.320
