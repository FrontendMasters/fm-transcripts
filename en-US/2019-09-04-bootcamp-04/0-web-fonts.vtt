WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:05.411
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So here on our form's page,

2
00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:10.840
we're gonna scroll all the way down
to the section here called web fonts.

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.307
[COUGH] Okay, so shockingly,
web fonts are fonts that are on the web.

4
00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:19.583
I know that comes as a big surprise.

5
00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.910
So far, we've been working on fonts
that have been on the computer that's in

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.535
front of you.

7
00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.209
Remember I said originally that fonts come
from that computer that's sitting right

8
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:28.197
there in front of you.

9
00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:31.742
The fonts that I have on my computer
are different than the fonts that you

10
00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:32.521
have on yours.

11
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.181
We may have some in common.

12
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.771
Typically that's things like Ariel,
Helvetica, Times,

13
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.567
Georgia, Trebuchet, Comic Sans.

14
00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.204
A real winner of a font.

15
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:48.583
B and Verdana, these are fonts that
are typically in common between us and

16
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:51.293
between all computers more or less.

17
00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:55.920
But sometimes, we'd like to use some fonts
in our design that are not on everybody's

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.438
computer and
that's where web fonts come in.

19
00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:03.840
And so two of the very popular options
that are out there are Google Fonts and

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.964
Font Awesome.

21
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.041
Let me just show you Font Awesome briefly.

22
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:11.334
I'm not gonna go through everything
here on Font Awesome, but

23
00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.604
I'll go ahead and show it to you.

24
00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.388
The website's at fontawesome.com.

25
00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:17.753
So here it is.

26
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:23.311
There are two forms of fun awesome notice
there is a free option down here, okay?

27
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.683
Free option and
they have a huge paid option.

28
00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:29.573
So if you're willing to pay for
it, you get a whole lot of stuff.

29
00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.892
But the free option,
if you just go ahead and

30
00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:37.852
click on the free link here,
this is gonna give you a ton of icons.

31
00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:41.347
So it's one of those fonts that actually
has all the little pictures in it.

32
00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:47.501
And if you scroll on down here,
you'll see that there are icons.

33
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:52.268
So some of you have been talking about
using icons like a Facebook icon or

34
00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:54.502
Twitter icon, or YouTube icon.

35
00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:57.886
If you go ahead and
click on this icons thing here,

36
00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:02.573
this is gonna show you all the icons
that come with Font Awesome free.

37
00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:06.823
So you'll see that you have Amazon and
Amazon Pay.

38
00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:08.982
You have all kinds of fun arrows.

39
00:02:08.982 --> 00:02:12.850
Here's some batteries, settings
that might be useful for some kind

40
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.260
of application that you're building and
we're only down to letter B, okay?

41
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.594
We have to load more.

42
00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:23.724
If you load more, you'll find, I mean,
there is just tons and tons of stuff.

43
00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:27.888
All the credit cards are in here,
if those are helpful to you.

44
00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:29.780
Now, we are down to C.

45
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.030
So we could be here all day looking
at all these little pictures that

46
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.141
are available to you.

47
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.929
So the techniques that I'm gonna
show you today with Google Fonts,

48
00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.118
you can use the same techniques
here with Font Awesome and

49
00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:43.725
that can add some great
stuff to your website.

50
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:44.420
Yes, Emma.

51
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.443
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a copyright issue I
like how all of these are kinda the same

52
00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:52.174
style, is there a copyright issue for
just using the logo for

53
00:02:52.174 --> 00:02:54.679
Facebook to link to a Facebook account?

54
00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.673
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If there
was we'd all be sued.

55
00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:01.556
[LAUGH] Okay, because pretty much
every website these days has got

56
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.962
those social media icons on it.

57
00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:07.318
I don't know exactly what the legal
ramifications are around that.

58
00:03:07.318 --> 00:03:11.314
But it's in Facebook's interest to have
their icon out, logo out there and

59
00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:12.506
let people link to it.

60
00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:13.061
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sure.

61
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm pretty sure they have
some rules about how that icon can be used

62
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.767
and what kind of color schemes that can
be used with, and all the rest of that.

63
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.390
I imagine that a lot of people
don't pay attention to those rules.

64
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.324
But if you're concerned about that,
look at the Facebook page and

65
00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:28.668
find the legal stuff.

66
00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:33.577
Yeah, other questions at this point?

67
00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:37.320
Okay, believe me,
Facebook knows about Font Awesome.
