1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we kind of
have our bare bones set up here.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.810
So let's actually start
writing some React cuz so

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.390
far we have,
this is not a very good intro to React.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.772
So here inside of my
complete intro to React,

5
00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:21.738
I'm going to create a new file and
it's going to be called Index.html.

6
00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.471
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I'm gonna put
the bare bones for our HTML document.

7
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:43.488
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: html:5, so
I'm using something called Emmet.

8
00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:47.780
Which is kind of outside the scope
of this class but it's super useful.

9
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.350
It used to be called Zen Coding.

10
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.420
It's just like a bunch of shortcuts for
writing HTML really fast.

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.210
Which is how I scaffolded that out.

12
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.170
Okay, we’re gonna create a file and
I’m gonna call it svideo.

13
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.389
That’s what I named my little app here.

14
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can call your video
app whatever you want to call it.

15
00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.114
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
here we’re going to put a div, and

16
00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.567
it's id is going to be called app.

17
00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.735
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then we're gonna do two things right here.

18
00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.750
We're gonna put two script tags.

19
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.850
One of them is going to be equal to,

20
00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:39.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt:
node_modules/react/dist/react.js.

21
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.622
So we're gonna be pulling in
the pre-bundled React file, so

22
00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:49.119
that we can play with it without
doing any sort of bundling.

23
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.924
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then the other
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna do

24
00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:54.807
another script tag.

25
00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:06.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt:
node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.js.

26
00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:12.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
here's a big key about React here.

27
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.746
So I imagine a lot of you have heard of
things like React Native, and React VR,

28
00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:24.530
iframe React, I'm missing,
there's a bunch of them, right?

29
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.770
So you can think of React being
kinda split into two parts.

30
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.990
Meaning if you're gonna use React,

31
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.100
you're always gonna have to
require two different libraries.

32
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.107
There's the top level React part, which is
the same across React Native, ReactDOM,

33
00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:38.890
React everything.

34
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.855
This is the library where we
actually create components.

35
00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.335
And it has, like, the life cycle methods,

36
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.600
it has all of these different things
that you, as a developer, interact with.

37
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.810
And then between React and
whatever you're rendering to,

38
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.230
there sits a glue layer, right?

39
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.123
That translates React
components to DOM nodes, or

40
00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:01.207
to native UI elements, right?

41
00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:04.151
So that's what React Native is,
that's what ReactDOM is, right?

42
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.231
It's these different glue layers,
the rendering layers, right?

43
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.742
So we're gonna actually be coding
with React but at the very end,

44
00:03:11.742 --> 00:03:14.560
we'll pulling ReactDOM to actually
render out to the DOM, right?

45
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.570
So that's why there are two
separate libraries.

46
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.120
It used to be the same thing
up until like React.12, maybe.

47
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.603
Don't quote me on that.

48
00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:33.160
Okay, so underneath that
we're gonna do a script tag.

49
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.820
So when we pull these in,
react and react-dom,

50
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.410
it's gonna make them available as
a global variable that we can refer to.

51
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.840
So now we have react and react-dom.

52
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.019
So the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna

53
00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:58.109
say const MyFirstComponent, and
it's gonna just be a function.

54
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:07.677
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna say return

55
00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:14.094
React.createElement ('div', null).

56
00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:20.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then I'm gonna
do some kind of funky spacing here.

57
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:23.770
But it'll make sense in
a moment why I did that.

58
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.990
Then here I'm gonna say,
React.createElement('h1',

59
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.446
null, 'this is my first component'), or

60
00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:37.634
whatever you wanna render out.

61
00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.471
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

62
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:50.835
down here at the bottom, I’m gonna say,

63
00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:59.597
ReactDOM.render,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna say,

64
00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:05.868
React.createElement,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: MyFirstComponent.

65
00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:07.475
And then we're gonna
tell it where to render.

66
00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:11.527
So in this case, we want it to
render up here in the app id.

67
00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:17.801
So we're gonna say
document.getElementById('app').

68
00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:25.359
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

69
00:05:27.963 --> 00:05:29.993
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'll explain it momentarily, but

70
00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:32.537
let's go and
make sure that it actually works.

71
00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:36.244
So I'm just gonna literally just
open the file with my browser.

72
00:05:36.244 --> 00:05:40.022
Eventually, we'll get to serving
with a server, whatever, but

73
00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:41.376
this will work for now.

74
00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:48.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
so I need to go to talks,

75
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.064
nope, FDM, there we go, Index.html.

76
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see here,
it says this is my first component, right?

77
00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:04.045
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is React
at its most base level.

78
00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:05.880
And that's all you're gonna
learn in this workshop.

79
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.890
So wrap it up, we're done.

80
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.525
Just kidding, well, I mean, sort of.

81
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.695
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, I'm kidding.

82
00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:16.871
[LAUGH] Okay, so
let's talk about what's going on here.

83
00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:22.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here we're
creating a React component, right?

84
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.180
This is MyFirstComponent, right?

85
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.864
What you can think of as like
a blueprint for creating new components.

86
00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:33.200
Or for those of you who like
the Java-y classy object orientedness,

87
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.782
this is a class, right?

88
00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.810
And we can create many
instances of this class.

89
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.186
So we have created a reusable component
here that every time that we render

90
00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:41.821
it out, so

91
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:47.567
if I inspect this element right here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

92
00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:52.629
can see here there's a div and
an h1, right?

93
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.573
So every time that I create a new
like stamp, a new instance of this

94
00:06:56.573 --> 00:07:02.560
MyFirstComponent, right, it's going to
render out this particular bit of markup.

95
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.940
Now this isn't really super
interesting right now, right?

96
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.130
Like it's really just a div and a h1.

97
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.880
It would been of way easier to just
me going in here and say, okay,

98
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.360
I'm gonna put a div right here, right?

99
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.190
But where's the fun in that?

100
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.507
I wanted to over engineer it.

101
00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:21.872
No, hopefully this is indicative to
you that at its most base layers,

102
00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:23.840
there's not really a lot to React.

103
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.860
The hello world of React is what?

104
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.215
This is gonna be ten lines of code.

105
00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:36.491
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go in and
talk about React.createElement then.

106
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:42.540
Okay, so this function right
here is a class, right?

107
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.761
It's the MyFirstComponent class.

108
00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:50.180
createElement is creating a particular
element of something, right?

109
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.880
So I'm creating one div instance.

110
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.240
I'm not creating a new type of div,
this is just rendering out a div, right?

111
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.669
Same thing here with this h1.

112
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.498
Then here, I call createElement,
same thing right here,

113
00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:05.219
I'm creating an instance
of MyFirstComponent, right?

114
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I could create
another component which renders out yet

115
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.732
more MyFirstComponents, right?

116
00:08:11.732 --> 00:08:15.186
So they can be, components can be
composed of other components as well.

117
00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.416
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
about this example so far?

118
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:24.755
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not super useful yet,
but we're getting to the useful part,

119
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:25.320
I promise.

120
00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:31.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so let's actually
go create another type of component.

121
00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:36.983
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna create
another one called MyTitle.

122
00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:41.591
So const MyTitle,
it's gonna be another function.

123
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.879
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what this is going to
do is this is going to return more markup.

124
00:08:55.461 --> 00:09:02.362
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna say,
react.createElement('div',

125
00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:08.019
null,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

126
00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:15.053
we're gonna say,
React.createElement('h1', 'h2').

127
00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:18.257
So something that you might be
noting here, if I pass it a string,

128
00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:21.480
it's actually going to render
out that sort of tag, right?

129
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.100
It's not even really gonna keep
track of what it is, right?

130
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.770
I could put x-my-component, and it would
render out an x-my-component tag, right?

131
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.390
So this also works with web components,
if you wanna go down that path.

132
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.959
If I pass it like a variable name like
this, right, MyFirstComponent, it's not

133
00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:44.596
a string it's MyFirstComponent, it's
actually going to render out that, it's

134
00:09:44.596 --> 00:09:48.861
going to assume that's a React component
and try and render it out that way.

135
00:09:56.098 --> 00:09:58.279
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is gonna be my second component.

136
00:10:01.755 --> 00:10:05.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then we're gonna modify this down here.

137
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:08.701
What's cool about this

138
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:14.051
is,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: createElement, so I'm gonna

139
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:18.798
put a MyTitle in here, right, but I can
actually put multiple MyTitles in here.

140
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:26.985
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for those of you that
like the computer science-y terms,

141
00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:29.953
createElement has variable-arity, right?

142
00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:32.430
So you can give it as many
parameters as you want.

143
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.502
That's all that that stupid term means.

144
00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:39.385
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

145
00:10:39.385 --> 00:10:41.720
we're gonna be creating
multiple instances of MyTitle.

146
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.489
The other thing that you can do with
this is you can give it an array.

147
00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:52.243
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can give it an array
of React instead of elements, right?

148
00:10:52.243 --> 00:10:54.070
Right now this isn't super important.

149
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.250
They kind of look the same.

150
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.940
But this will become important
later in the course.

151
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.076
So just keep in mind that you can
also pass it arrays of components.

152
00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:06.378
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go try and
make sure that that works.

153
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.912
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see here I
got a bunch of instances of my second

154
00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:11.530
component.
