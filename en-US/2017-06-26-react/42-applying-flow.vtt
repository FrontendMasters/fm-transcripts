00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.913
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go actually
start typing our project.

2
00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:05.592
The thing that you're gonna find with any
type system that you slowly introduce to

3
00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:09.181
your project is that up front it's a lot
more burden than it is helpful, right?

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.754
If you're only type-checking one file,

5
00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:16.112
it's basically accepting a bunch of
what we're gonna call anytypes and

6
00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:20.340
I'll explain to you momentarily
what that stands, what that means.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.637
But as we slowly expand and more files
are being typed, you're gonna find

8
00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:31.032
that once everything is typed then
it's a huge productivity boon for you.

9
00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:34.581
It's just up front you're gonna
have to pay a pretty steep cost,

10
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:35.815
to be totally honest.

11
00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:41.444
So let's go to search JSX and
actually do some typing.

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.553
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the way that you opt in

13
00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:54.753
a file to be checked with flow is //@flow.

14
00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:58.967
It has, you can see already,
my editor is already complains, hey,

15
00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.983
you told me to check flow,
now you got screwed up a bunch of stuff.

16
00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:05.514
Actually it's only one
thing which is nice.

17
00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:10.881
But you can see here it says,
hey, this isn't working

18
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:16.413
yet.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

19
00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:20.748
that's because flow wants to
have type annotations for

20
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:25.599
parameters,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is what we're

21
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.589
gonna do.

22
00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:28.689
And then the other thing is that, so

23
00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.055
we're gonna be doing more
invalid JavaScript, right?

24
00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.671
Adding type annotations to your code is
not valid JavaScript because there's no

25
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:37.221
type annotations in JavaScript.

26
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:41.690
So you would need a babble plugin
to transform your code from code

27
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.187
that has flow annotations
to normal JavaScript.

28
00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:49.450
Luckily for us, we're including
the React preset for babble.

29
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.559
And that includes the flow
annotation removing code.

30
00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:56.253
So if you're not including that,
you have to include that now but

31
00:01:56.253 --> 00:02:00.163
since we included that preset,
in fact, I'll show you real quick.

32
00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:05.035
Babel rc, this right here, this line makes
it so that our code is already able to

33
00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:12.438
remove those flow type annotations.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

34
00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:15.853
sorry, going back to Search.jsx.

35
00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:18.687
So now we wanna type this event, right?

36
00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:23.797
Because, otherwise,
if you go here to run flow,

37
00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:29.286
it's gonna say, hey,
you need an annotation here.

38
00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:31.075
I don't know what this is, right?

39
00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:36.078
The other thing to note is notice
this ran really fast, right?

40
00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.679
As opposed to last time,
it took a bit to start up.

41
00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:42.970
Before it was starting up that process.

42
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.248
But now it's just running
constantly in the background.

43
00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:46.290
So now it's really fast.

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.866
Okay, so
we need to add a type annotation to this.

45
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.827
What is this?

46
00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:57.711
And you're gonna find yourself asking
that question a lot when you're adding

47
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:59.051
types to something.

48
00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:03.523
But what this is it's a really positive
thing, not just for your future self and

49
00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:06.143
getting the flow type and
all stuff like that.

50
00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:10.857
But it's useful for you to think through
what your code actually does, right?

51
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:15.195
And you'll find here that you'll start
refactoring things to be more concise,

52
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:19.725
because you're more aware of what's going
in the functions that what's coming out

53
00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:20.262
of them.

54
00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.316
That becomes very important
when you're doing types.

55
00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:25.603
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

56
00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:33.909
So this is a keyboard event.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What's nice

57
00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.829
about specifically flow is it has all of
this browser stuff already typed for you.

58
00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.907
You don't have to do anything.

59
00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:43.148
Keyboard event already exists.

60
00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:47.747
And if you want to look at them,
go to flowtype.org.

61
00:03:47.747 --> 00:03:50.387
Another place that if you're
gonna do flow typing,

62
00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:53.028
you gotta spend a lot of
time in the documentations.

63
00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:59.011
And there's the type system, there's
library definitions, configurations,

64
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:04.038
all that kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

65
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:11.302
I would also recommend that you put
this into your editor, like I have.

66
00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:16.126
So again, I'm gonna show you for sublime,
we're gonna say install package,

67
00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:19.661
I'm gonna show you a list cuz
I already have it installed.

68
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.880
And then if you go down here,

69
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.233
remember that I installed
the sublime linter, right?

70
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.614
For the ESLinting, there's another
one called SublimeLinter-flow and

71
00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:34.244
I'm gonna get all those flow
errors directly into my editor.

72
00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:40.073
It already exists for Atom as well, I
can't remember the name of the package off

73
00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:45.738
the top of my head but I know this one
called Nuclide, that Facebook puts out.

74
00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:48.686
I'd have very little
experience with Nuclide but

75
00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:52.412
Nuclide was specifically built
by Facebook with flow in mind.

76
00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:57.682
Okay, so
this is a keyboard event that iss actually

77
00:04:57.682 --> 00:05:05.292
not even 100% true because this is
a React synthetic keyboard event.

78
00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:10.484
Again, luckily, since this is built by
Facebook, they already provided for

79
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:15.363
this, so this is actually a synthetic
KeyboardEvent, we'll stick with

80
00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:21.117
KeyboardEvent for just the second.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now

81
00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:25.804
what this is gonna complain about
is it's still saying right here

82
00:05:25.804 --> 00:05:30.081
that event.target.value is
not guaranteed to be there.

83
00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:32.983
That's because when you
have a keyboard event,

84
00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:37.319
it is possible for the browser to admit
to keyboard event with no target.

85
00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.461
Don't ask me how that happens but it is
possible, and so flow is gonna make you

86
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.667
say I want you to acknowledge
that this is going to be there.

87
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:48.800
So what you can say is and

88
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.452
target is going to be
an HTML input element.

89
00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:02.606
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now that's been typed.

90
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SyntheticKeyboardEvent.

91
00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.789
Why was that working for me before?

92
00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.007
All right, react or

93
00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:20.973
flow synthetic event.

94
00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:33.939
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SyntheticKeyboardEvent.

95
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:44.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's super weird to me.

96
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.664
I have no idea why it doesn't like that.

97
00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.402
Okay.

98
00:06:50.402 --> 00:06:54.532
Another problem I have
with sometimes with flow,

99
00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.984
sometimes it's just slow on the uptake.

100
00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:05.345
Cuz my yarn flow is not complaining, so
I'm sure it will eventually go away.

101
00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:10.188
Particularly with flow,
sometimes it takes awhile for

102
00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:14.939
it to kind of say,
you know what this is actually okay.

103
00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:21.696
Take your input from
the command line as gospel.

104
00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:24.992
Okay, so
we're gonna leave that alone for now.

105
00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:33.782
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's what it is.

106
00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:38.736
So we have to go make
ESLint play okay with

107
00:07:38.736 --> 00:07:44.047
Flow as well.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is running Yarn Flow output

108
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:50.698
put a list of files that
it processed as flow files.

109
00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:57.742
Or at least they count, or something.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's

110
00:07:57.742 --> 00:07:59.196
something you can do.

111
00:07:59.196 --> 00:08:04.734
And I would just look at the help.

112
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:08.898
That's what it is.

113
00:08:08.898 --> 00:08:13.600
I'm going to come here to my project.

114
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:21.833
We're going to look into the eslint.json.

115
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:24.820
This is what you need,
which I don't have in my notes.

116
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:31.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, that's the one.

117
00:08:31.972 --> 00:08:38.550
Come to your eslint.json.

118
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.842
We need to let eslint to know,

119
00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:45.075
hey we're going to be doing
a bunch of stuff with flow.

120
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:51.466
And that's okay so right there you're
gonna put plug in flow type recommended.

121
00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:59.224
Plug in flow and
down there as well, I do, okay?

122
00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:04.152
Aand then above prettier you're
gonna also have to have a flow

123
00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:09.078
type plug in This is just saying
I have this plugin flow type for

124
00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:14.696
the eslint, and I want you to bring
in all of their recommended rules.

125
00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:18.832
They have more rules as well, but
I found they're a little too strict, so

126
00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:22.115
I just bring in what they call
their recommended rule set.

127
00:09:24.588 --> 00:09:26.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay now, so yeah, again,

128
00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:31.809
we added two lines, line number 9 right
there, and line number 3 right there.

129
00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:35.757
And let's go take a look at Search

130
00:09:35.757 --> 00:09:42.182
again.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

131
00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:47.109
now it's going to recognize
a synthetic keyboard event is actually

132
00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:49.365
a flow thing and that's okay.

133
00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:54.495
Now the most beautiful part
about flow to me is it's

134
00:09:54.495 --> 00:09:59.757
pretty good at already
knowing what everything is.

135
00:09:59.757 --> 00:10:03.905
So the only reason that we had to annotate
event right here was that there was no way

136
00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:07.444
that flow type could figure out what
that was eventually going to be,

137
00:10:07.444 --> 00:10:09.597
how it was eventually going to be called.

138
00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:16.477
So we had to go in and say hey, this is
what this is but everything else, right?

139
00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:19.275
It knows that like search
now is a react component and

140
00:10:19.275 --> 00:10:22.909
I never have to tell it that because
it's already figured that out.

141
00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:27.857
So it does a ton of what's
called type inference for

142
00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:33.277
you, just out of the box for
free which is pretty great.

143
00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:36.983
It's even going to go as far to read
preload and into the json file and

144
00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:40.318
see what's coming out of there,
and everything like that.

145
00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:42.506
Which is awesome.

146
00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:47.295
So let's go and do some more typing,

147
00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:50.540
cuz that's always fun.

148
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.792
Let's go to show card.

149
00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:58.284
We're going to opt this
one into flow typing.

150
00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:03.637
As soon as you do that, it's going to say

151
00:11:03.637 --> 00:11:12.955
a bunch of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

152
00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:18.358
the first thing is going to say is
styled components required module

153
00:11:18.358 --> 00:11:23.785
not found that's a new one well
let's keep going with this anyway.

154
00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:27.534
The thing about flowType is you
don't need propTypes anymore, right?

155
00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.288
Because the type checking
that flow is gonna do for

156
00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:33.908
you is more robust that anything
propTypes would ever do for you.

157
00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:39.372
So we're actually just gonna
drop the propTypes here.

158
00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:44.274
And then down here where it says
ShowCard.propTypes We're actually

159
00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:49.020
just going to go up and type these
props right here, where they are.

160
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.085
I'm just going to copy this.

161
00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:58.367
And then here I'm going to
make these prop types up here.

162
00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:04.802
But you've got to get rid of all the,
is required stuff.

163
00:12:04.802 --> 00:12:07.537
So I'm gonna just do this.

164
00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:25.105
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is with yarn flow.

165
00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.827
What is with that.

166
00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:31.498
More is required down there, yeah and
drop the propTypes down there,

167
00:12:31.498 --> 00:12:40.162
you don't need those anymore.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yarn flow,

168
00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:44.562
required module not found

169
00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:53.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

170
00:12:56.823 --> 00:12:58.204
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is the issue.

171
00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:03.454
So the problem that we've done here is
that we ignore south components but

172
00:13:03.454 --> 00:13:07.009
we still have to acknowledge
that it's there, so

173
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.411
this is gonna be style-components,
I think.

174
00:13:11.753 --> 00:13:18.470
Styled-components,

175
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.169
there we go.

176
00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:22.984
So, do this came into the flow config
where it, we're trying to ignore this

177
00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:23.674
directory because it has
a bunch of flow inside of it.

178
00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:29.763
But we still have to acknowledge that it
exists otherwise it flow won't acknowledge

179
00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:35.077
it exist so libs is just gonna say this
is something that I have coming in and

180
00:13:35.077 --> 00:13:40.478
just don't type check this that's what
it does so come back to show card and

181
00:13:40.478 --> 00:13:45.392
now hopefully
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's resolved itself.

182
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:51.834
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why don't you love me, what

183
00:13:51.834 --> 00:14:01.561
is your problem with me?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,

184
00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:11.163
is what it is right now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Flow fix me,

185
00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:17.201
I think this is what it is
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We will come

186
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:20.743
back to this later, but for now if you
ever need to ignore a line which I do not

187
00:14:20.743 --> 00:14:24.510
suggest you do unless you give me a live
workshop in front of hundreds of people,

188
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.730
you can use FlowFixMe to say ignore me for
now.
