00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are going to fix our
tests cuz we broke them yet again.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.103
So I want you to go ahead and
open search.jsx.

3
00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:15.097
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have a big problem here,
in fact, I'm to show you just to prove

4
00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:19.206
that if I run yarn test here,
I think all of them fail.

5
00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.662
Yep, total failure.

6
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For various reasons,
you can see it's gonna give you the stack

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.480
trace up there, but
I'll explain to you why.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.490
The first thing that kind
of sucks with Redux and

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.930
integrating with connect is what
are we actually exporting here?

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.330
We're not actually exporting search,
right,

11
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.830
down here at the bottom,
we're exporting a connected search.

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.180
So let me demonstrate to you what I'm
talking about using the dev tools.

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.746
If I inspect here, I go into React,

14
00:00:55.746 --> 00:01:00.897
notice,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,

15
00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:03.674
here I have search, right?

16
00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.320
But what's the component above it?

17
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.880
It's a connected search, right?

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.700
It's a component that wraps Search,
and that's what Connect returns.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.030
It returns a connected search, right?

20
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.010
This component inside of search.spec.jsx
that we're importing right here

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.410
is connected search,
which means this search depends on Redux.

22
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.400
Which is kind of a problem for us to test.

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.640
Because, I don't wanna bring in Redux
every time I wanna test this component.

24
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.960
I wanna test Search.

25
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.290
I don't wanna test Redux.

26
00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:41.970
So there is a couple of
ways of mitigating this.

27
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.325
I'm gonna show you kind of
one of the easier ways.

28
00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:49.849
So come back to search .jxs really quick.

29
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:54.590
Down here we're gonna have export default
connect, and that's totally fine.

30
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.802
But what we're gonna do here,

31
00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:07.170
is we're going to say export
const Unwrapped = Search.

32
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.750
The only place that we're ever going
to use this is for testing purposes.

33
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.507
But we're just going to export
an unwrapped version of it, and

34
00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:15.972
that's gonna be called Search.

35
00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:23.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if we go back to Search.spec.jsx,

36
00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:29.236
we can come in here and
say, import Unwrapped.

37
00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:35.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if you wanna make
it like a little bit more succinct in

38
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.201
the name you can say as UnwrappedSearch.

39
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's how you do it,

40
00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:46.702
if I just said unwrapped right
here it would be called unwrapped.

41
00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:48.389
But I wanna make it a little
bit more accurate so

42
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.781
I'm gonna call it as UnwrappedSearch,
that's how you do that.

43
00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:55.094
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

44
00:02:57.898 --> 00:03:03.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now with UnwrappedSearch,
I can just call this UnwrappedSearch.

45
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.806
And we also are going to have
to give it a search term,

46
00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because it depends on that

47
00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:16.109
now
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

48
00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.570
let's comment these tests out first.

49
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.160
So I'm gonna say x test here, and not
comment them out but stop running them.

50
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.769
And I think,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think this

51
00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.490
should work now.

52
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.594
If you say yarn test,
I'm gonna stop my API server and close it.

53
00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:45.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
our snapshot got updated here, right?

54
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.490
Before we used to have header
actually embedded into search.

55
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.260
We changed that so now it's a different
component that's a connect header, right?

56
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.290
That's fine, that's what we expect.

57
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.231
So we're gonna run this
again as yarn test:update.

58
00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:04.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,
we have a passing test, right?

59
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.327
We fixed one of them, so
let's go fix another one.

60
00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:14.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same kinda story here,
we're gonna say UnwrappedSearch

61
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is going to be,

62
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.997
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Search term = blank,

63
00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.579
our searchTerm, rather.

64
00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:36.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
make that test again so it will run.

65
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.300
Let's go make sure that that one works.

66
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.463
So we're gonna say yarn test again.

67
00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:45.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Two passed.

68
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.732
Halfway there.

69
00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:53.488
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now we want to test this one and

70
00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:57.090
this one's a little bit tougher to test.

71
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.721
There's a couple things
that we could do here.

72
00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.251
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We could test this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

73
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:10.252
rather than kind of going
through the process and

74
00:05:10.252 --> 00:05:16.000
simulating the vent and
all that stuff, we could try that.

75
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.580
You can totally just do
unwrappedSearch here and

76
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.034
say searchTerm equals
this is our search word.

77
00:05:27.034 --> 00:05:30.616
Then we wouldn't have to do this,
stimulate business.

78
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that should for
the most part work.

79
00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's see if that works.

80
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.230
I did not, I did, okay?

81
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.180
And so this works, right?

82
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.890
If you're happy with that test and

83
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.790
you don't actually wanna test the user
interaction, you just wanna test if you

84
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.680
give it a search word, that it renders
the right amount of cards, cool.

85
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.800
This totally works.
