WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Should we add a link on
the showcard to go to the detail page?

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, how did I miss that?

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.693
Okay, let's go do that real quick.

4
00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:12.663
Showcard, I totally forgot this,

5
00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:17.020
we're supposed to bring in the link here,
import.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.421
Yeah because we wanna be able to get to
the details page from the search page.

7
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From react-router-dom.

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.507
So import link from react-router-dom.

9
00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:41.632
So what we're gonna do here is we're
going to wrap the wrapper in a link.

10
00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:46.616
To and this is gonna

11
00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:50.977
be a template tag

12
00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:59.084
/details/props.imdbID.

13
00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:04.739
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, how did I miss that?

14
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.513
Okay.

15
00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:14.521
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

16
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this is gonna complain
about this imdbID not being there.

17
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.860
Something that we can refactor this to be.

18
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730
So rather this than being props,
colon, and then

19
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.565
listing out every single thing possible,
we can just say this is a show, right?

20
00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:36.238
Because we defined that show type already,
and save that.

21
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:44.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, and now we have
this all being wrapped in a link.

22
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.811
So if we go back over here, go back.

23
00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's okay,
sorry, not quite.

24
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:05.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna actually change
link to be wrapper, and remove link here.

25
00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Misread my notes.

26
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.210
Okay, so now we're gonna have wrapper
which is eventually going to be

27
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.960
the link tag.

28
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.021
So rather than having this being wrapper =
styled.div, what we can actually do is we

29
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:28.129
can have styles components wrap link
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

30
00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.381
is gonna yell at us because,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

31
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.910
we'll talk about that in a second.

32
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.030
But you will be getting a flow
type error momentarily here.

33
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.825
So now if we save that.

34
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:45.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Getting closer.

35
00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:50.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

36
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.890
Now we have add just two
more lines of CSS here.

37
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.443
Gonna say color black to keep
that color of that link text, and

38
00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:02.040
then we're also gonna have
text-decoration is none.

39
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.360
And then save that.

40
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.970
Come back over here and now everything
looks like it's supposed to again.

41
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.057
And also, now you can click on things and
go to their detail pages.

42
00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:20.799
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And looks like
the Breaking Bad one got pulled down.

43
00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:26.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can go in and
you can click into each one of them.

44
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.350
I just took the link out of it,
and then I put Wrapper to, right?

45
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.747
Because that's the property that's
gonna be passed down into link.

46
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.213
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll talk about
the flow error here in just a second.

47
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.703
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any other
questions about that?

48
00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:54.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And, cool.

49
00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:04.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I just perpetually have
issues with styles, components, and flow.

50
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.890
So there's a couple ways
you can solve this.

51
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.477
One of them is you can just say link
is any, I think that would work.

52
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is a good way of doing it.

53
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.434
This is just saying like, when the
library's typings are not exactly how they

54
00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:42.634
should be I'm totally fine just
throwing out here and say,

55
00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:44.890
you know what, don't check this part.

56
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.175
Like I know this is fine,

57
00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:49.916
Like I know React router dom is giving
me something that's valid React.

58
00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:51.213
So Cool.

59
00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:53.360
Just call that an any.

60
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.850
This is called a casting, right?

61
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.820
So typically you don't have to worry
about typecasting in JavaScript.

62
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.020
It's all coerced for you.

63
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.620
But in this particular case we're just
gonna say, this link is an any thing.

64
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.580
I don't think you can actually
identify it as a React component.

65
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.330
I think it's gonna still yell about that.

66
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.303
It's gonna say,
I don't know what that is, right?

67
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.261
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
it's not gonna like that.

68
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:25.401
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe just don't.

69
00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:31.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope, so
we're just going to stick with any.

70
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.222
Some day they'll fix this and
you can come back and not typecast it.

71
00:05:37.898 --> 00:05:41.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But again, this is just
saying, for this particular instance,

72
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.590
assume link is an any type.

73
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.210
Which is then gonna say, cool,

74
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.840
I'm not gonna check this
particular typing right here.

75
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.070
The other one you can do, which I
showed you earlier, is just FlowFixMe.

76
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.930
It's just gonna ignore the next line.

77
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.098
Either one of those is fine.

78
00:05:57.098 --> 00:05:58.735
I'm gonna stick with the any for now.

79
00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:02.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
you're welcome to do it either way.

80
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How do you maintain
navigation state throughout the app?

81
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The best answer to that
question I think, where possible,

82
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.580
you wanna stick it in the URL, right?

83
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.597
So you have deep links to all
the different states of your app, right?

84
00:06:20.597 --> 00:06:24.513
So, one thing that we're not doing
here that you definitely could do is,

85
00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:28.639
when you're typing black right here,
you could store that in the URL state.

86
00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.102
So that someone could copy that link and
share it with their friend or

87
00:06:32.102 --> 00:06:34.615
they could bookmark it,
all that kind of stuff.

88
00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:37.126
It's all very possible
to do with React router.

89
00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:38.656
I do not remember how to do
it off the top of my head.

90
00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:43.546
But it's, you would just interact
with the history object and

91
00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:47.973
say, push this state onto the app or
replace this state,

92
00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:51.571
depending on if you wanted
to add a new entry for

93
00:06:51.571 --> 00:06:55.648
every [COUGH], BLA, and
then BLAC, and then BLACK.

94
00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:58.160
You probably wanna do what's
called a replace state there.

95
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.720
So that it would just be replacing
the state every single time.

96
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.140
So yeah, navigation state should
typically live in the URL,

97
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.010
which means you would be interacting
with React Router, to do that.

98
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.130
If you don't wanna do that, then you
just need to find a common ancestor.

99
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.090
Our common ancestor would be app,
and keeping it in there.

100
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.780
Yeah, we don't have any real navigation
state, besides the search term, so.

101
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But this person's saying,

102
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.927
what order do life cycle methods execute
when you have nesting components?

103
00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:37.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like what happens first,
the children or the parents' components?

104
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.963
The real answer to that question
is you don't have to care.

105
00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:47.426
[LAUGH] You can think of each
component more or less as an island.

106
00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:50.115
Because they really shouldn't be
interacting with each other in terms

107
00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:52.070
of their lifecycle methods.

108
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:59.940
That's kind of a dodgy answer, and it's
also something that's changing because

109
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.090
right now we're on a architecture of React
called Stack, the Stack architecture.

110
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.200
This is as of 15.5 and
previous, with React 16,

111
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.090
we're moving to something
called the Fiber architecture.

112
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.305
Which is going to change totally the way
that it is a complete rewrite of React.

113
00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:19.358
However, it is totally API compatible so

114
00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:22.359
there shouldn't be any
breakage between 15.5 to 16.

115
00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:25.620
They should just migrate
the architecture and nothing changes.

116
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.764
And with that they're gonna do all
sorts of different ways of when and

117
00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:31.712
how components are rendering.

118
00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:35.913
And so this is a way of me saying that,
it doesn't really matter and

119
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:39.076
I also don't know,
because it doesn't matter.
