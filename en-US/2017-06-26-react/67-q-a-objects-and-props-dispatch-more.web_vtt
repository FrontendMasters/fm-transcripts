00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

2
00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:08.109
What are the inputs and the outputs of
mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.087
What's sort of the overall
purpose of them?

4
00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.749
I mean, what are they doing sort of the?

5
00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.209
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They're returning objects,
right?

6
00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:20.126
Right, this is an object.

7
00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:20.845
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

8
00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:25.098
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you want to
make this a little bit more verbose,

9
00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:27.425
it's gonna look like this.

10
00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.874
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And.

11
00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.514
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, but
this is what it actually looks like.

12
00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:39.416
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

13
00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.879
who eventually uses that object?

14
00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is the object and
you remember how we did something like

15
00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:50.892
this right here ...show well
it's taking this object and

16
00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:53.450
spreading it over the component.

17
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.120
That's precisely what's
happening here to search.

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.916
It's taking this object and
spreading this object over search, right?

19
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.750
So everything that I put in here is
going to be passed as a prop to search.

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.980
So search term is now a prop
of search because of this.

21
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

22
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.616
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if I put, blah: 5, right.

23
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.849
Now it have inside of props I
could reference props.blah and

24
00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.514
I would get 5, right.

25
00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:25.231
It's just passing props into search.

26
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.903
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, great.

27
00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:30.026
And then the dispatch is?

28
00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:34.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a function
that Redux gives you to pass

29
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.352
actions into the reducers.

30
00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.044
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

31
00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:42.878
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

32
00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:48.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that have use beyond
wiring up event handlers usually?

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.284
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is it?

34
00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:54.674
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: MapDispatchToProps.

35
00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:58.053
Does it have use beyond?

36
00:01:58.053 --> 00:01:59.921
Wearing of event handlers, no.

37
00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.523
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, mapDispatchToProps.

38
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:04.495
Does it have more uses than that?

39
00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:09.001
I mean,
you can kick off a synchronous actions and

40
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.622
we'll talk about that tomorrow,
async actions.

41
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
it's gonna be kicking off action,

42
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:21.880
that's the point of map dispatch profits.

43
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.170
Translating events in the UI to
actions into the Redux store,

44
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.330
that's the whole purpose.

45
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.276
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Does the Redux state
object get too complicated over time?

46
00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:37.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going to show
you how to silo it tomorrow.

47
00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.682
So that despite the fact that that tree
can become quite large you're only gonna

48
00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:45.660
be working on very small slices at
a time so it keeps it pretty manageable.

49
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.905
It can get complicated but
with discipline and

50
00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:57.833
kind of enforcing some rules on yourself
it can be fine even with giant stores.
