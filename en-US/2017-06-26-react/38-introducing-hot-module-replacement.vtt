&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, we're gonna be talking
about Hot Module Replacement which is

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.070
a technology that is really awesome with
React due to the nature of how React

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.190
apps are constructed.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.285
It lends itself to this technology really
well whereas previously other technologies

5
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.357
like Angular and Ember, it was just
impossible to detangle them enough to

6
00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:21.280
be able to do something like this.

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.952
It was still kind of a evolving and
thrashing technology, but

8
00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:29.898
I feel finally comfortable now teaching
it, whereas previously for version 1 and

9
00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:34.580
version 2, it was still kinda new enough
that it wasn't worthy of teaching.

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.149
So let's talk about what it actually is.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.040
I imagine many of you have done
live reload before with CSS.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.075
The idea being that as soon as you change
your CSS, it'll compile your new CSS,

13
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.000
and then it will inject it into
your running browser, right?

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.705
This is a really tool technology, because
you can be working on a menu that you have

15
00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:59.140
to click once, twice, three times to get
into some particular state of your app.

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.530
And when you do live reload,
it'll inject the CSS, so

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.910
you don't have to refresh the page.

18
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.939
It'll just rewrite all the styles for
you, right?

19
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.911
This is really nice, because you
don't have to click, click, click,

20
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.188
to get back to that same state.

21
00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:13.834
It really cuts down on that feedback
loop of being able to iterate quickly

22
00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.120
on whatever user interface
is your writing.

23
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.740
Hot module replacement takes
this one step further.

24
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.940
Webpack is actually smart enough
to see the graph of everything,

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.430
what depends on what, right?

26
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.350
So an example of that would be if
I come into search.jsx, right,

27
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.940
it also depends on ShowCard, right?

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.770
But if I go into landing, landing has
no coordination with ShowCard at all.

29
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.590
So if I modify, for example, ShowCard
Search is going to have to be replaced,

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.155
right, because it also depends on that.

31
00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.430
But landing can stay right where it is,
right?

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.778
So it's drawing this big dependency graph.

33
00:01:51.778 --> 00:02:00.395
In fact, I think I actually have
a little graph here in my notes, maybe.

34
00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.000
Right there, right?

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.080
So this is what I'm talking about.

36
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.050
So if I replace ShowCard I can
actually just change ShowCard and

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.360
leave everything else as in, right?

38
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.330
Well, Search and Search is gonna
have to be replaced as well, but

39
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.430
Landing can stay right where it is.

40
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.678
So, armed with this knowledge Webpack can
say cool, I'm gonna cut off this part of

41
00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:23.697
the graph, replace it and leave the other
parts of the graph in place, right?

42
00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:27.817
So it's able to this on the fly without
refreshing your browser at all.

43
00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.337
Hence, Hot Module replacement.

44
00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:34.941
It's really cool,
I'm excited to teach it to you.

45
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.924
And it's not so difficult to set up,
I'm not gonna say it's easy,

46
00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:42.208
but it's not horrible [LAUGH].

47
00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.837
Let's go with not horrible, that's
what I'm going with right now, okay?
