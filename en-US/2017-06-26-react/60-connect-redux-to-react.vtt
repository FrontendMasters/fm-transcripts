00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.878
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now basically everything
is completed on like the Redux side,but

2
00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:10.022
now we need to go in and make the UI
actually dispatch out to Redux, okay?

3
00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:14.933
So I want you to go to hap.jsx just real

4
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:20.119
quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first thing

5
00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.665
that we need to do is we need to basically
make a Redux available to react.

6
00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.395
So we're gonna import.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Provider,

7
00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.846
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From react-redux.

8
00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:41.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So react-redux is a package

9
00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:45.970
that all it does is it's just thin
little bindings between react and

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.774
redux that make it easier
to write redux with react.

11
00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:55.119
It's by no means a hard requirement
that you use React Redux, you definitely

12
00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.066
do not have to, but let me rephrase
that you're gonna want to for sure.

13
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:04.571
It just does a lot of the glue layer
stuff that's really un-fun to do.

14
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.767
And they do a good job at it.

15
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:11.740
So inside of BrowserRouter,
we're just gonna

16
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.588
put Provider, and then again, right there,

17
00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:22.866
Provider.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

18
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.210
yep, that's what I thought.

19
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.424
Flow is gonna yell at you.

20
00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:28.623
And this is another advantage
to using Flow here.

21
00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:33.334
It's gonna say, hey, I'm expecting
something here called store and

22
00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:34.992
you did not give it to me.

23
00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:39.126
So, like I just forgot momentarily that
you also have to provide it a store.

24
00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:42.230
So let's go ahead and do that real quick.

25
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.364
So we're gonna go import store from

26
00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:52.644
./store.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here

27
00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:58.188
you're just gonna say store equals store.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

28
00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:00.642
this is another reason that I like Flow.

29
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.965
I love that my tools remind
me to do stuff like this,

30
00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:05.628
cuz I totally would have forgotten and
moved on right now.

31
00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:11.439
But that all happens because we have
React Redux typings from Flow types.

32
00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.147
Something that people will point out to
me is that you could totally, it makes no

33
00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:20.735
difference if Provider is on the outside
or BrowserRouter is on the outside.

34
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.378
It'll work either way.

35
00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:25.124
I intentionally chose it this
way because we're gonna do

36
00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:26.906
server-side rendering tomorrow.

37
00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:29.535
That makes it a lot easier if
it's organized this way, but

38
00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:33.146
if you weren't doing server-side
rendering it wouldn't make a difference.

39
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:35.759
Again this is what's called
a higher order component.

40
00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.239
It self displays nothing, but
it does some stuff for you that it's gonna

41
00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.655
put Redux on context, which is what
we were talking about previously.

42
00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:48.260
So that we can refer to it in
another places inside of our app.

43
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.800
So, that is what's happening there.
