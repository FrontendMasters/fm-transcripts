WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What I want you to do here,

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.310
you're gonna leave your
API server running.

3
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.480
And for now I'm gonna shut off Webpack.

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.140
And I'm gonna change that
to be yarn watch because

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.280
we still need to compile our Webpack code.

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.980
But we're not going to be reading
from the dev server anymore.

7
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.140
We're going got be requesting it from
our Expressor that we just wrote.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.661
And now, we're going to do

9
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:33.456
NODE_ENV=server node server.js.

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.957
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So now it says,
listening on 8080.

11
00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:42.561
So if I come onto here and

12
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.718
refresh 8080 on here.

13
00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:50.330
Notice we're still getting our website and
everything is kind of fine.

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.821
I don't think we're gonna
get any console errors.

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We screwed up hot reload.

16
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.730
I will show you how to
fix hot reload with this.

17
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.004
But that's why it's saying,
hey I'm trying to find hot reload,

18
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.105
that's because we're not talking
to the dev server anymore,

19
00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:09.930
we're talking to the node
server that we wrote, right?

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.250
But now what's more interesting about
this, this is what it was before, right?

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.816
Totally empty, if I refresh, look at how
much stuff now is coming down, right?

22
00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:24.523
This is a fully rendered experience.

23
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Which is pretty cool right?

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.010
Now something I wanna show you that's
perhaps even more impressive about this.

25
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.294
Oops, so I'm gonna come in here,
and I'm gonna click right there.

26
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:47.803
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I forgot how to
do this with Chrome dev tools.

27
00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:49.282
Settings.

28
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:55.867
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I am going
to disable JavaScript.

29
00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.540
Wherever disable JavaScript is.

30
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You passed it,
it was on the right under [INAUDIBLE].

31
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.039
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Disable JavaScript, right?

32
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.833
So now as long as the dev tools are open,
JavaScript is gonna be disabled.

33
00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.290
So now if I refresh the page.

34
00:02:15.186 --> 00:02:17.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH] you
know what's going on here?

35
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.550
It's styles components doesn't
work without JavaScript.

36
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.410
That's a problem.

37
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.980
So, that's something you accept
when you take on styles components.

38
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.630
But notice that everything is still
actually being rendered out okay.

39
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.500
I can actually click on to Game of Thrones
and it's gonna take me into the page.

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.970
I can go back.

41
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.370
I can click S video.

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.620
So I'm actually able to,

43
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.670
besides the styles component stuff,
I'm able to still navigate my site, right?

44
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.960
Because what's happening,

45
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.480
if you look at my server here,
it's just routing to each one of these.

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.456
It's making a full server request, right?

47
00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:53.550
The server side rendering that code, and

48
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.020
then just sending it back down to you,
right?

49
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.560
So we made our page work
without JavaScript.

50
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.460
Really, anymore,
that's not really much of a problem.

51
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.833
Almost every client that's going to
be accessing your page is gonna have

52
00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:06.893
JavaScript enabled.

53
00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:09.393
But let's say you have a JavaScript error,
right?

54
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:13.470
You're still going to be able to work,
right?

55
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.433
It's kind of this progressive enhancement
idea that's typically a pretty good idea,

56
00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:18.405
I would say, right?

57
00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So, I think that's really
cool, that's because it is really cool.

58
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.858
If you weren't using styled components,

59
00:03:29.858 --> 00:03:33.170
that would be a little bit more
impressive, but I digress.

60
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.728
Any questions about
service side rendering?

61
00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:43.394
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, the idea is just
that the first page that the client

62
00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:46.823
loads is pre-rendered and
once React takes over,

63
00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:51.141
it goes back to it's old single
page application and behavior?

64
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:52.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Exactly.

65
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.460
So, what this is gonna buy for you.

66
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.935
One it's gonna buy you a lot with Google,
right?

67
00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:59.330
Because you're gonna send that markup
faster which Google is then going to rank

68
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.480
higher and it's going to be more
controllable in a sense that, yes

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.900
the Google crawler does run JavaScript,
but it's imperfect for sure If you send

70
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.320
a predetermined markup, you get to control
what Google's scrolling over, right?

71
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.210
So it's a big SCO in for sure.

72
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.206
It's a big win for
perceived web performance, right?

73
00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:25.400
If you're on 2G connection in the middle
of nowhere, or just maybe you're stuck

74
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.100
on crappy wi-fi or something like that,
this is gonna load a whole lot faster.

75
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.000
And there's just tons and tons and
tons of data out there that says,

76
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.660
if you load faster,
users will give you more money, right?

77
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.120
In some capacity.

78
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.460
Whether that's more page clicks,
to get more ad revenue,

79
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.320
or your funnel's faster on your
e-commerce website, all of that, right?

80
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.790
So this is a win.

81
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.419
If you can service side render,
I recommend it.

82
00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:54.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Any other questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And

83
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.392
this is to get you ready to put
your site on to production?

84
00:04:59.392 --> 00:04:59.929
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Mm-hm.

85
00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:03.830
So you are typically are gonna do
the service side rendering I would say,

86
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.730
it doesn't always have to be just for
a production, but yeah.

87
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.750
But yeah, you definitely want
to be doing a production.

88
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.908
What I would do in this particular case,
my God, look at that.

89
00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:20.230
[LAUGH] That's the hot module
reload just losing its mind.

90
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.620
I would do the webpack dev server for
local development, because that's a really

91
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.070
nice developer experience, and you don't
care if it's server-side rendering or not.

92
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.459
And then when I send it off to production,

93
00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.574
I'll let server-side rendering
happen just in production.

94
00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:42.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And you said hopefully when
you click on the button, React is loaded.

95
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.935
What happens if React hasn't loaded yet?

96
00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:51.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What I just showed you here,
our site works without JavaScript, right?

97
00:05:51.174 --> 00:05:54.133
Because that's actually a real link,
it's an A tag that goes to that, so

98
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:57.069
it's gonna hit your server again,
make a full request, and come back.

99
00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.974
So, in that particular case,
everything's gonna work.

100
00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:03.647
However if it's something
that pops up a modal or

101
00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:08.050
something like that,
it's just not gonna work, right?

102
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.520
Nothing's gonna happen.

103
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.840
However.

104
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.227
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What about our dispatch?

105
00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:15.885
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: For sure.

106
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:16.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Events.

107
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, so what'll happen
then if I'm able to type in there

108
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.770
before React and Redux have bootstrapped?

109
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.225
It's gonna blow it away, right?

110
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:29.380
Because it's gonna bootstrap and
say my state is actually empty string.

111
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.590
However, that's usually not a problem.

112
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.200
We're talking like,
you're gonna load that first pay load, and

113
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.130
then within a 100 milliseconds you're
gonna get the JS and once the js is down,

114
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:49.870
that parsing and bootstrapping is
gonna be 5 to 15 milliseconds at most.

115
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.800
Users don't make decisions that fast,
right?

116
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.170
You would have to be like prepared
with your fast twitch muscles,

117
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.200
okay now click it, right?

118
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.930
Even on a slow connection ,right?

119
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.166
In other words it's not something I
find myself concerned a lot with.

120
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:11.875
I mean definitely instruments if that
is something you're worried about.

121
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:15.171
But it has yet to be a problem for me.

122
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:19.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It is good to keep in mind,
especially on a set like this where

123
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.180
downloading the JavaScript will
contend with all the posters, right?

124
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.908
If you have large images or something.

125
00:07:26.908 --> 00:07:31.653
And you can only download so
many of those in parallel, and, yeah.

126
00:07:31.653 --> 00:07:36.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Most definitely, I mean
this is loading large posters, right?

127
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.180
Because I'm super lazy and
I didn't wanna downscale them.

128
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.875
[LAUGH] But, you definitely should worry
about things like that like compressing

129
00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.187
your images, making sure that right,
like you have like thumbnails for

130
00:07:46.187 --> 00:07:48.544
the right pages and
full-size for the other ones.

131
00:07:48.544 --> 00:07:50.305
For sure.

132
00:07:55.377 --> 00:07:57.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, Mark.

133
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.218
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If you make
the API calls to node,

134
00:08:01.218 --> 00:08:05.631
how do you make sense or
is that rendering?

135
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:10.345
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So this is you are getting
into the questions about hydration and

136
00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:11.750
things like that.

137
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.519
So for example,
if I click on here, ideally,

138
00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:19.560
when I was service side rendering, I would
not come down and make a request, right?

139
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.149
Node.

140
00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:31.679
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Ideally,

141
00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.600
I would come to here and
I wouldn't be making this request, right?

142
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.700
I would already have that loaded because
I loaded it from the server, right?

143
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.870
This is a really touchy situation
to get this correct, right?

144
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.620
So a big key about server-side rendering
which I actually should address,

145
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.010
is if you come in here, and we're gonna
zoom in, and we're going to look for

146
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.395
this thing right here.

147
00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:56.430
Data-react-checksum.

148
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.680
So this is basically,

149
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.910
your app gets run through this hashing
algorithm they generate a hash.

150
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.610
Then when you get down to the client,
it's going to render for the first time,

151
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.160
run the hashing algorithm again, and
make sure that those hashes match.

152
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.850
So that you're generating the same markup
on the server as you are on the client.

153
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.250
If those mismatch,
in fact I'll show you how you can,

154
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.880
we'll just make a mismatch really quick.

155
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.541
If I put, I don't know,
like here, I'm just gonna put

156
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:27.613
an h1 that's going to
render out math.random.

157
00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:31.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So this will be
different on the client, right?

158
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.420
Because every time you're on math.random,
it's gonna give you a different output, so

159
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.250
it'll be different on the client
than it is on the server.

160
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.990
So if I load this again, it's gonna say,
what the hell are you doing?

161
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:50.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So.

162
00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:55.617
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Right there, that's what I'm
talking about it says, hey React tried to

163
00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:58.751
reuse the markup that you sent down
there but, hey you messed up, right?

164
00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:01.910
What I got on the client is different
than what I got on the server,

165
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.582
I'm gonna blow everything away.

166
00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:07.030
So all of those performance benefits
are actually now worse right?

167
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.800
Because you had to pay all the extra costs
to get all that server side rendering

168
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.010
done, it's gonna say, you messed up.

169
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.764
I'm just gonna blow it away and
then restart.

170
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.870
So, that's something you definitely
have to be careful about.

171
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.376
So, getting into the hydration
side of things, getting it to have

172
00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:28.456
the ability to have API requests
before they're made, is tough, right?

173
00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:30.331
Because when you first create your app,

174
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:34.830
you're doing with the thought in mind that
it's going to request it from the API.

175
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.290
So with Redux, it's actually not too bad,

176
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.560
you just have to make sure that you're
providing the same initial state.

177
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.090
So you have to have a kind
of variable initial state,

178
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.610
based on if the context's available or
not.

179
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.000
But the problem with that is,

180
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.230
you have to make sure the context is both
available on the server and on the client.

181
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.880
Plus it can still do it if you
navigate to that page without

182
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.250
that being hydrated, right?

183
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.670
So, what I'm trying to
paint a picture of here is,

184
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.130
it's a bit of a complicated mess to
kind of preempt those API requests, and

185
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.280
you have to weigh your answers of,
is this worth it to me to try and do?

186
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.659
It's possible for sure.

187
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.750
But it's tough.

188
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.180
And we're actually gonna deal with this
problem with even more in depths here in

189
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.680
just a second because we're gonna do code
splitting, which compounds this problem.
