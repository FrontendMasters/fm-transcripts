00:00:00.217 --> 00:00:04.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What I do wanna show you
though if you're interested in still

2
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.557
testing that user interaction,

3
00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:11.631
we don't really have a good way of
testing directly on that input anymore.

4
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:14.247
Because we don't have access to
header the way that we used to.

5
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We could try and figure
it out but that would be kinda tough so

6
00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:23.085
let's try this instead.

7
00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:29.553
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna show you how,

8
00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:33.543
what we can do is we can actually
dispatch an action to redux and see,

9
00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:37.823
based on dispatching an action to redux,
if we get the correct results.

10
00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:39.133
And let's go ahead and give that a shot.

11
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:45.925
So unfortunately we're gonna have to kind
of set up redux here in the process.

12
00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:50.043
So we're gonna have to import,

13
00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:55.534
actually this is gonna
have to go above it,

14
00:00:55.534 --> 00:01:01.033
here import Provider from react-redux.

15
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:06.808
And we're also going to have to import

16
00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:13.308
MemoryRouter from react-router-dom.

17
00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:17.253
So in order for our search component to
not just out and out fail, we're gonna

18
00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:20.787
have to give it a router because it
has a link component in the header.

19
00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:24.005
And we're going to have
to give it a provider so

20
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.489
that we can provide the store to it.

21
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:30.585
And we're also going to have
to import store from ./store.

22
00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:40.797
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I'm gonna get rid of this and

23
00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:46.917
what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do a shallow

24
00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:52.897
rendering with memory
router on the outside.

25
00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:54.114
No, provider on the outside.

26
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:58.682
Provider store equals store.

27
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then MemoryRouter inside of that.

28
00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:18.183
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

29
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:29.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's the other thing we need to do.

30
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.185
So we're gonna get rid of
this simulate change thing.

31
00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:36.740
I actually think we don't even need memory
router, now that I'm thinking about it.

32
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.748
But let's keep going.

33
00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:43.984
We're gonna do, store.dispatch up here.

34
00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:48.581
So we are actually going to dispatch
an action directly to the store.

35
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:50.282
We're gonna send as setSearchTerm.

36
00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:53.201
So we'd have to go and

37
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:57.913
input that as well, searchWord.

38
00:02:57.913 --> 00:03:00.370
So let's go up to the top and
inport that as well.

39
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.385
So we're gonna say import {SetSearchTerm
} from './actionCreators'.

40
00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then we're
gonna do the show countdown here and

41
00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:22.659
expect it's gonna work
exactly the same way.

42
00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.715
So now that I'm thinking about, let's
go make sure this actually works first.

43
00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:28.163
So we're gonna say yarn test.

44
00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:33.824
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cannot find module store.

45
00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:39.920
That's right, cuz we're gonna have to
do dot dot, and also dot dot there.

46
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.456
Cuz we're inside the test directory,
so we have to go up one.

47
00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.756
At this point shallow's actually
not going to be enough for

48
00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:49.600
us to kinda get everything
that we need out of here.

49
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.088
So we're gonna get rid of shallow and
we're gonna keep shallow as well, for

50
00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:58.102
the first two tests, but
we're gonna use render for the last test.

51
00:03:58.102 --> 00:04:01.006
Which is gonna be a deeper,
actually render out all of the markup.

52
00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:08.704
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then down here,
wanna change shallow to render.

53
00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:15.803
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now that we're actually
going to fully render out everything,

54
00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:20.111
we actually can't do this kind of find
anymore, cuz it's not gonna know what

55
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.838
a React component and what's not cuz it's
actually gonna render out all to markup.

56
00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:29.775
So we're gonna have to give it a CSS
selector and we're gonna do .show-cards,

57
00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.094
is what we called it.

58
00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:37.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And actually, we have to go
add that as well so we can hook into it.

59
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.765
So open your show-card really quick
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

60
00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:46.261
here where it says Wrapper to we're just

61
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:50.897
gonna say className='show-card'.

62
00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:58.169
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is in show-card.

63
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.381
Now if we go back to our
test search.spec.jsx,

64
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.268
search.spec.jsx, this one.

65
00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.413
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this should work.

66
00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:12.180
Coming back to yarn test.

67
00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.794
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go, now it passes.

68
00:05:17.794 --> 00:05:20.422
Now I hope you're looking at this as like,

69
00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:25.034
this is a lot of intimate knowledge to
have about this component to test it.

70
00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:25.914
It is.

71
00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:29.114
So I'm gonna go ahead and
assert while this is a valid test,

72
00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.812
it does test something,
I'm not a huge fan of it.

73
00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:35.379
I actually liked what we had better before
where we were just passing in the search

74
00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.060
term and seeing that it worked
given that particular props.

75
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.482
But if you wanna test integration there
between redux and passing in the store,

76
00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:46.115
and passing in the action, and
then getting something out of it.

77
00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:51.079
In that particular sense,
this is how you're going to do that.

78
00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:55.464
But the sum of my entire story here is,
once you introduce redux,

79
00:05:55.464 --> 00:06:01.238
your React components become a lot tougher
to test, significantly tougher to test.

80
00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:04.280
So that's something to be aware of.

81
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.732
The flip side of that is what I am
about to show you after this is

82
00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:09.424
that the Redux parts of it, so

83
00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:12.982
the actual state management part
becomes way easier to test.

84
00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:15.213
So you are kind of trading one for
the other.

85
00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:16.811
And, I am gonna go ahead and

86
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:21.409
assert that the state management part
is actually the important part to test.

87
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.338
Again we've been doing this for
three days and

88
00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:29.157
we've had to rewrite our tests already
twice, that kind of sucks, right?

89
00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:31.554
Rewriting tests is one of my
least favorite things to do.

90
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so
any questions about that?

91
00:06:41.753 --> 00:06:43.086
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's up to
you which one you prefer,

92
00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:44.942
which one you actually
are interested in testing.

93
00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:49.566
There's no reason that you
couldn't have both tests as well.

94
00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:51.086
So, and what that would look like.

95
00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:51.905
Let's just,

96
00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:57.225
what I can do here is I can just copy this
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

97
00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:58.537
let's go back to where it was before.

98
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:05.353
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Back when we were
doing shallow without provider.

99
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:29.469
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
I think this was fine right there.

100
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:32.703
So let's copy this test case.

101
00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:36.798
And after this, I'll push a branch,
so you can have both of them as well.

102
00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:42.692
And you can kind of compare them
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

103
00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:49.273
this is gonna be without Redux.

104
00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:57.504
And this one is going to be with Redux.

105
00:07:57.504 --> 00:07:59.707
And now we say yarn test.

106
00:07:59.707 --> 00:08:02.084
Make sure that both of those pass
the way we expect them to, and

107
00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:03.104
now we have an extra test.

108
00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:05.047
One to test with Redux and one without.

109
00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:10.087
So you're welcome to make, I probably
would not write both of these tests,

110
00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:14.420
but it's good to demonstrate to
you what's going on with various

111
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.284
strategies of testing these components.

112
00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:20.610
Something worth noting.

113
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.436
Search should render, based on
without Redux takes 1 millisecond,

114
00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:28.806
with Redux it's gonna
take 35 milliseconds.

115
00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:29.901
Why is that?

116
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:30.573
It's not Redux.

117
00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:33.741
Redux is plenty fast, it's the render.

118
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:38.201
This call right here render,
wherever it is, render, this is expensive,

119
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:42.173
cuz this is actually going to render
everything out to a string, and

120
00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:45.541
it has js dom built in,
it does all sorts of stuff for you.

121
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:49.410
So that's something to keep in mind,
the more you use render,

122
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.093
the slower it's gonna be.

123
00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:55.180
Render is still pretty fast, but
as soon as you start getting into static

124
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.075
rendering, it gets really
slow really fast, so.
