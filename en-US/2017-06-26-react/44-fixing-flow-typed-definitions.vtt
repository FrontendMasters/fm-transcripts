00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
while you were on lunch,

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.460
I figured out the styled components issue.

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.870
So let's go back and do that real quick.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.350
So when we did flow type, again this
is kind of nascent ecosystem here.

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.200
We're still kind of figuring out how to
get this to all play nicely together.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.859
When we did flow typed install.

7
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It was able to go out and
grab almost all the definitions,

8
00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:30.920
except one, which is the one
definition that we were ignoring.

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.850
So now, the flow had no concept of
this and it was also being ignored.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970
So it just assumed that
module didn't exist.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650
And the reason why is,
styled components was updated,

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.580
maybe two days before
we started this course.

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.830
And so, I updated it, cuz I wanted to
be using the latest and greatest tech.

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.690
Unfortunately, they haven't had time to
release the new types for version two.

15
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.654
They only had the types for version 1.4.

16
00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.489
However, the API that
we're going to be using,

17
00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.861
we're not using many of the new features
or any of the new features really.

18
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.832
So we can go ahead and use the old
type definitions and be mostly fine.

19
00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:12.610
So I want you to go
into your command line,

20
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.440
I want you to type flow-typed
install styled-components

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.824
@1.4, I think that should work.

22
00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Honestly,
you can probably just do 1.

23
00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:34.422
Nope, do 1.4.

24
00:01:34.422 --> 00:01:40.924
And that'll give you the types for
1.46, I think.

25
00:01:40.924 --> 00:01:42.328
Is that what it says?

26
00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:43.430
No, it just doesn't say.

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.190
Okay, so 1.4.

28
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.300
And that should be sufficient for
what we're using,

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.970
despite the fact that we're using two.

30
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.920
So, a little bit of a dangerous operation,
right?

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.561
But it's gonna work, so just rest
assured that I've been down this path.

32
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:03.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now if we say yarn flow, it should work.

33
00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:04.830
So we can get rid of this.

34
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.801
I had right here, dash,dash,

35
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:13.315
flow fix me which it says like
ignore the next line, right?

36
00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:17.076
We can get rid of that now and
everything should be working.

37
00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:22.127
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It should be saying,
no errors.

38
00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:29.964
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
any questions about that?

39
00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:34.191
Any questions of types or
anything like that in general?

40
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.436
So I've only shown you like
a couple of ways of doing typing.

41
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:41.980
But we're gonna keep going and
doing more and more types as we go.

42
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.300
So we'll be learning little bits and

43
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.270
pieces about how to do specific type of
adaptation and some of the advantages that

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.980
you can get from the typing
system that we now have in place.

45
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.225
Again, none of this is required, right?

46
00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:59.272
There's no problem if you just decide to
remove @ flow from all of your documents

47
00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:01.070
and just keep going without types.

48
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.995
So I don't want for you to think that
this is a required part of React,

49
00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:08.937
because it's definitely not, nor
is it necessarily tied to React.

50
00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:11.083
You can write Angular
projects with flow as well.
