WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kind of robust to have
to repeat writings create element over and

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.650
over and over again.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.680
There's a couple of ways to do this so
first of all a bunch of people who write

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.540
react don't even know
what create element is.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.028
Reason being is that they never have to
write it because we're gonna get to write

6
00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:25.051
it in jsx in may be like an hour.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

7
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.048
so they don't ever have
to write createElement.

8
00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.443
JSX transpiles to createElement calls, but

9
00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:35.010
I do know some crazy people that
have chosen not to write JSX.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.230
And it is possible to write huge
apps without using any JSX.

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.720
So I'm gonna show you just a couple tricks
of how to do that a little bit easier.

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.688
So you can say con C E
equals reacts.create

13
00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:48.870
element,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.878
then now i can replace all
these create elements.

15
00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:53.628
So I'm just going to do, find,
react.create element and

16
00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:57.313
replace that with CE and we'll just say
replace all, and I gotta do that again,

17
00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:01.891
createElement.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it gets

18
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:07.593
a little bit easier to,

19
00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:12.726
or it's a little less

20
00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.730
dense, right?

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.450
You don't need all those
react.createElements every single time.

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.690
There's also a package
called create factory

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.980
that helps as well and
there's also react dom-helpers.

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.700
Which I'm not gonna show you how
to do today because it's kind of

25
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.980
the old way of doing it and once we
get to JSX it's not helpful anyway,

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.620
but you can do things like divm and h1.

27
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.750
So you can actually call them
by the name of the function.

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.730
Then you get rid of this.

29
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.680
It looks something like that.

30
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.870
Again, getting less and

31
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.710
less dense, but you have to go get
some helper libraries to do that.

32
00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.227
And we're not gonna do that today.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

33
00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.425
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that we've done

34
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:08.567
that, let's go ahead and
talk about props and attributes.

35
00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:12.855
So so far, not super useful, right?

36
00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.916
Because we're just rendering out my
second component a bunch of times,

37
00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:16.980
not entirely exciting.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
So let's go make this a little
bit more interesting.

39
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.160
We can actually pass properties from
MyFirstComponent into my titles,

40
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.741
so let's try doing that real quick.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

41
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:37.060
we're gonna pass, we call it the title.

42
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.100
We're gonna put some of our favorite T.V.

43
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.939
shows in here, so let's put Game
of Thrones, that's a good one.

44
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.510
Stranger things.

45
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.939
It's a good tv show.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Rick and

46
00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.754
Morty.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rick and Morty,

47
00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:02.917
that's a good one, and

48
00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:10.348
Silicon Valley.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

49
00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:12.473
so now inside of my tile,

50
00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:18.570
the first thing that's gonna be passed
into it is a thing called props.

51
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.809
And props is just going to be
whatever you passed in right here.

52
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.381
So instead of saying my
component right here,

53
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:34.243
I can say props.title.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

54
00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:39.620
now if we save this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And come back over here.

55
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.175
Notice that now we have multiple
different kinds of titles,

56
00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:49.282
which is pretty cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

57
00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:51.864
we're getting more reusable,
right, more flexible.

58
00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:56.490
We can pass different properties into
components and kind of mold them.

59
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.430
Right now we're just changing the textbook
into all sorts of things, right, but

60
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.550
sometimes I could be, like,
show this particular theme for

61
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.230
this widget or I don't know.

62
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.650
If a user logs in, show this.

63
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.470
If the user logout, show that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just to clarify,

64
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.820
props is just like a syntax
that most people use or

65
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.610
do people call the-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Would you call this

66
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.980
anything other than props?

67
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.480
Never.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

68
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You would never call it

69
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.380
anything other than props.

70
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.050
I've never seen it called
anything other than props.

71
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.220
So it is convention.

72
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.609
You could call it something else, don't.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Don't.

73
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH]

74
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.680
So let's take this even a step further.

75
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.761
And we wanna change the color
of whatever is being

76
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:47.548
passed in here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna pass

77
00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:56.249
something else into all of these.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

78
00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.690
one of my favorite interview
questions to ask people is always,

79
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.870
what's your favorite CSS named color.

80
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.060
I have a couple new ones.

81
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.230
So there's yellow green
which is my favorite.

82
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.400
My second favorite is green yellow and
lime green and

83
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.462
then just lime,
which are also different colors.

84
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:26.435
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

85
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.688
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually,

86
00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:30.760
still my favorite is Peru.

87
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.510
[LAUGH]
You really just can't beat Peru,

88
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.204
which is a color.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You know,

89
00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:41.780
Papaya Whip is pretty cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Papaya Whip's pretty good.

90
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.900
What else?

91
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.429
I don't know, medium aquamarine,
that's another really good one.

92
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.000
So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
pass that color to be the color of the h1,

93
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.900
right?

94
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.170
So instead of being null here,

95
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.680
we're gonna pass it an object, and
we're gonna give it a style attribute.

96
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.420
It's not a typical style string
that you'd put into the,

97
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.930
like, on to the actual dom, right?

98
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.586
It's actually gonna be an object,
which is a little bit easier to work with.

99
00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:16.443
So we're gonna do color, and
it's gonna be props.color.

100
00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:25.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and

101
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.990
as long as this is called the same thing,
it can be anything, right?

102
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.210
So if I change this to be like,
I don't know,

103
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.160
the Canadian way, or British way, or both.

104
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.140
But anyway, so now if we save that and
come back over here,

105
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.200
notice that we have various
shades of green and Peru.

106
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.527
If you did not know,
that is the color of Peru.

107
00:06:58.237 --> 00:06:59.622
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, any questions so

108
00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:04.438
far?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So for

109
00:07:04.438 --> 00:07:07.750
the style, you could pass in a string,
but that's just cumbersome, so

110
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.811
we don't do that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't

111
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:10.100
think it actually works.

112
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.020
So, really what's happening underneath the
hood is this is actually interacting with

113
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.140
the JavaScript API for DOM elements, and
this is the way you actually interact with

114
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.830
the style API with the DOM API.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I

115
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.310
have a question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

116
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Do any authors ever avoid

117
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.050
using props and instead pass individual
arguments to the constructor for

118
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.510
a little bit better self
documenting components?

119
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.140
Cuz myTitle could accept a color and
a title as arguments, and

120
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.050
that would be a little bit more
obvious than just a property

121
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.610
bag coming in.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to that question

122
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.690
is no, you do have to do it this way,
because React is actually hooking in to

123
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.330
those, and it'll know when to re-render,
based on what you passed into it.

124
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.510
Now you can get around that by,
which I'll show you later today,

125
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.040
with Flow,
cuz then Flow will start warning you.

126
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.320
So typing your reaction components,
actually it helps a ton.

127
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.190
There's also something called prop types,
which again,

128
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.650
we will also talk about them, and
flow is gonna be a static type checker.

129
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.330
So it's gonna tell you at compile time,

130
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.479
whereas prop types is gonna tell you
at run time, like hey, this is missing.

131
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.940
So it is a problem, but
there's tooling to get around it.

132
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.920
That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Carrie's asking what

133
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.990
about attributes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like what kind of

134
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.553
attributes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it's the same thing,

135
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:42.610
props and attributes are synonymous.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah

136
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.980
like in this particular case for
React we call them profs but

137
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.600
they are like attributes as well.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah attributes in

138
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.541
HTML.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

139
00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:57.078
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is really it for

140
00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.010
React at its most basic level right?

141
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.040
Just passing props down
into other components.

142
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.660
We're gonna get here to state momentarily.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: One

143
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.780
other question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

144
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.360
sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just for

145
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.740
a little bit clarification on that
second argument which is null.

146
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.175
Those are HTML attributes?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for

147
00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:22.315
this particular one, for the H ones and
the div's, this is actually

148
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:25.825
going to be the attributes I'm
going to put onto the dom, right?

149
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:28.925
But for something like my title,
this isn't something that actually gets

150
00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:32.595
rendered directly to the dom, like,
there's not a my title tag, right?

151
00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:35.741
So this is what's passed
into the component here as

152
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:40.010
props.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay, so

153
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.950
is ID my first component?

154
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:47.710
Is ID recognized as the special
property that gets tagged on to

155
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.545
HTML or?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's React naively

156
00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:57.355
passes that just to the dom, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

157
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for example if this was

158
00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:02.265
React native, it would be a totally
different set of attributes right?

159
00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.605
Does that make sense?

160
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.965
Cool, so again if you have something
like Flow, Flow will check that for

161
00:10:08.965 --> 00:10:13.870
you to make sure it's like hey, you try
to pass IDD, and that's not a thing,

162
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.820
so that's a failure, right?

163
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.580
But we're not using
anything like that yet.

164
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.200
So don't mess it up.

165
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.950
That's the big key here,
is to just not mess up anything.

166
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.256
Good question.

167
00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:31.774
Other questions?

168
00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:34.810
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Just about the color and

169
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.050
the colors.

170
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.770
Where is that coming from?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These

171
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.430
particular colors?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah.

172
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These are all native

173
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.170
colors, right?

174
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.276
So I can totally call this,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah,

175
00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:52.492
okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,

176
00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:58.336
that will totally work.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

177
00:10:58.336 --> 00:11:02.010
this is it for writing React without JSX.

178
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.290
[COUGH] We're gonna start getting
a little bit more complicated,

179
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.550
and so, we're gonna start adopting some
tooling to kind of help us along here.
