00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kind of robust to have
to repeat writings create element over and

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.650
over and over again.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.680
There's a couple of ways to do this so
first of all a bunch of people who write

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.540
react don't even know
what create element is.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.028
Reason being is that they never have to
write it because we're gonna get to write

6
00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:20.634
it in jsx in may be like an hour.

7
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.048
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so they don't
ever have to write createElement.

8
00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.443
JSX transpiles to createElement calls, but

9
00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:35.010
I do know some crazy people that
have chosen not to write JSX.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.230
And it is possible to write huge
apps without using any JSX.

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.720
So I'm gonna show you just a couple tricks
of how to do that a little bit easier.

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.688
So you can say con C E
equals reacts.create

13
00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:48.870
element,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.878
then now i can replace all
these create elements.

15
00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:54.453
So I'm just going to do, find,
react.create element and replace that with

16
00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:58.145
CE and we'll just say replace all, and
I gotta do that again, createElement.

17
00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:07.593
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it gets a little bit easier to,

18
00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:12.726
or it's a little less

19
00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.730
dense, right?

20
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.450
You don't need all those
react.createElements every single time.

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.690
There's also a package
called create factory

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.980
that helps as well and
there's also react dom-helpers.

23
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.700
Which I'm not gonna show you how
to do today because it's kind of

24
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.980
the old way of doing it and once we
get to JSX it's not helpful anyway,

25
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.620
but you can do things like divm and h1.

26
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.750
So you can actually call them
by the name of the function.

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.730
Then you get rid of this.

28
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.680
It looks something like that.

29
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.870
Again, getting less and

30
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.710
less dense, but you have to go get
some helper libraries to do that.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.191
And we're not gonna do that today.

32
00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:01.227
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

33
00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:06.207
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that we've
done that, let's go ahead and

34
00:02:06.207 --> 00:02:08.567
talk about props and attributes.

35
00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:12.855
So so far, not super useful, right?

36
00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.916
Because we're just rendering out my
second component a bunch of times,

37
00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:16.980
not entirely exciting.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
So let's go make this a little
bit more interesting.

39
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.160
We can actually pass properties from
MyFirstComponent into my titles,

40
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.880
so let's try doing that real quick.

41
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna pass,
we call it the title.

42
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.100
We're gonna put some of our favorite T.V.

43
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.939
shows in here, so let's put Game
of Thrones, that's a good one.

44
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.510
Stranger things.

45
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.880
It's a good tv show.

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Rick and Morty.

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.443
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rick and
Morty, that's a good one,

48
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:05.298
and Silicon Valley.

49
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:12.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
now inside of my tile,

50
00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:18.570
the first thing that's gonna be passed
into it is a thing called props.

51
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.809
And props is just going to be
whatever you passed in right here.

52
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.264
So instead of saying my component
right here, I can say props.title.

53
00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:35.514
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if we save this.

54
00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:39.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And come back over here.

55
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.134
Notice that now we have multiple different
kinds of titles, which is pretty cool.

56
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're getting more
reusable, right, more flexible.

57
00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:56.490
We can pass different properties into
components and kind of mold them.

58
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.430
Right now we're just changing the textbook
into all sorts of things, right, but

59
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.550
sometimes I could be, like,
show this particular theme for

60
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.230
this widget or I don't know.

61
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.650
If a user logs in, show this.

62
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.070
If the user logout, show that.

63
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just to clarify, props is
just like a syntax that most people use or

64
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.610
do people call the-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Would you call this

65
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.980
anything other than props?

66
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.480
Never.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

67
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You would never
call it anything other than props.

68
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.050
I've never seen it called
anything other than props.

69
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.220
So it is convention.

70
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.026
You could call it something else, don't.

71
00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:34.609
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Don't.

72
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:39.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH]
So let's take this even a step further.

73
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.823
And we wanna change the color of
whatever is being passed in here.

74
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:50.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna pass
something else into all of these.

75
00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:59.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, one of my favorite
interview questions to ask people is

76
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.870
always, what's your
favorite CSS named color.

77
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.060
I have a couple new ones.

78
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.230
So there's yellow green
which is my favorite.

79
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.400
My second favorite is green yellow and
lime green and

80
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.462
then just lime,
which are also different colors.

81
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:28.688
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually,

82
00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:30.760
still my favorite is Peru.

83
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.510
[LAUGH]
You really just can't beat Peru,

84
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.610
which is a color.

85
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You know,
Papaya Whip is pretty cool.

86
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Papaya Whip's pretty good.

87
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.900
What else?

88
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.429
I don't know, medium aquamarine,
that's another really good one.

89
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.000
So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
pass that color to be the color of the h1,

90
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.900
right?

91
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.170
So instead of being null here,

92
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.680
we're gonna pass it an object, and
we're gonna give it a style attribute.

93
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.420
It's not a typical style string
that you'd put into the,

94
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.930
like, on to the actual dom, right?

95
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.586
It's actually gonna be an object,
which is a little bit easier to work with.

96
00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:16.443
So we're gonna do color, and
it's gonna be props.color.

97
00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:27.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and
as long as this is called the same thing,

98
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.990
it can be anything, right?

99
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.210
So if I change this to be like,
I don't know,

100
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.160
the Canadian way, or British way, or both.

101
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.140
But anyway, so now if we save that and
come back over here,

102
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.200
notice that we have various
shades of green and Peru.

103
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.527
If you did not know,
that is the color of Peru.

104
00:06:58.237 --> 00:06:59.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, any questions so far?

105
00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:06.392
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So for the style,
you could pass in a string, but

106
00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:08.635
that's just cumbersome,
so we don't do that?

107
00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:10.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't
think it actually works.

108
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.640
So, really what's happening
underneath the hood

109
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.760
is this is actually interacting with
the JavaScript API for DOM elements, and

110
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.770
this is the way you actually interact
with the style API with the DOM API.

111
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have a question.

112
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

113
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Do any authors
ever avoid using props and

114
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.050
instead pass individual
arguments to the constructor for

115
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.510
a little bit better self
documenting components?

116
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.140
Cuz myTitle could accept a color and
a title as arguments, and

117
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.680
that would be a little bit more obvious
than just a property bag coming in.

118
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer
to that question is no,

119
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.190
you do have to do it this way, because
React is actually hooking in to those,

120
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.330
and it'll know when to re-render,
based on what you passed into it.

121
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.510
Now you can get around that by,
which I'll show you later today,

122
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.040
with Flow,
cuz then Flow will start warning you.

123
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.320
So typing your reaction components,
actually it helps a ton.

124
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.190
There's also something called prop types,
which again,

125
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.650
we will also talk about them, and
flow is gonna be a static type checker.

126
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.330
So it's gonna tell you at compile time,

127
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.479
whereas prop types is gonna tell you
at run time, like hey, this is missing.

128
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.940
So it is a problem, but
there's tooling to get around it.

129
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.650
That's a good question.

130
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Carrie's asking
what about attributes.

131
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like what
kind of attributes?

132
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it's the same thing,
props and attributes are synonymous.

133
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah like
in this particular case for

134
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.630
React we call them profs but
they are like attributes as well.

135
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah attributes in HTML.

136
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

137
00:08:55.288 --> 00:09:00.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is really it for
React at its most basic level right?

138
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.040
Just passing props down
into other components.

139
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.450
We're gonna get here to state momentarily.

140
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: One other question.

141
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just for

142
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.740
a little bit clarification on that
second argument which is null.

143
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.070
Those are HTML attributes?

144
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for this particular one,
for the H ones and the div's, this is

145
00:09:21.965 --> 00:09:25.825
actually going to be the attributes
I'm going to put onto the dom, right?

146
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:28.925
But for something like my title,
this isn't something that actually gets

147
00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:32.595
rendered directly to the dom, like,
there's not a my title tag, right?

148
00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:36.259
So this is what's passed into
the component here as props.

149
00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:41.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay, so
is ID my first component?

150
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:49.635
Is ID recognized as the special property
that gets tagged on to HTML or?

151
00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:55.215
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's React naively
passes that just to the dom, right?

152
00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:57.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for

153
00:09:57.795 --> 00:09:59.735
example if this was React native,

154
00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:02.265
it would be a totally different
set of attributes right?

155
00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.605
Does that make sense?

156
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.965
Cool, so again if you have something
like Flow, Flow will check that for

157
00:10:08.965 --> 00:10:13.870
you to make sure it's like hey, you try
to pass IDD, and that's not a thing,

158
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.820
so that's a failure, right?

159
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.580
But we're not using
anything like that yet.

160
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.200
So don't mess it up.

161
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.950
That's the big key here,
is to just not mess up anything.

162
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.256
Good question.

163
00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:31.774
Other questions?

164
00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:32.745
Yes?

165
00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:36.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Just about the color and
the colors.

166
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.490
Where is that coming from?

167
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These particular colors?

168
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These are all native

169
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.170
colors, right?

170
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.751
So I can totally call this,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah, okay.

171
00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:53.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
that will totally work.

172
00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:02.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is it for
writing React without JSX.

173
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.290
[COUGH] We're gonna start getting
a little bit more complicated,

174
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.550
and so, we're gonna start adopting some
tooling to kind of help us along here.
