00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now what I want to show you
is some of the debugging tools, right?

2
00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:09.020
So far we've been doing
things like consul.log and

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.395
kind of that sort of
stuff to do debugging.

4
00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.179
There's actually react dev
tools which are super helpful.

5
00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.508
So I'm going to go and
open my consul here and

6
00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:23.954
yeah do I need to install it for this?

7
00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.767
So they're available for Firefox,
and they're available for Chrome.

8
00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.855
They're not available for Safari or Edge.

9
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:35.067
If you really want to get
creative you can probably make it

10
00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.389
work because Chrome dev tools
can target other browsers.

11
00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:41.469
I'll leave that to your discretion.

12
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.260
But we're gonna go pull up the React
dev tools and you can see here,

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.514
the React dev tools here
in the Chrome web store.

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.642
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna go ahead and
add that to Chrome.

15
00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:04.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now I'm gonna go back to my app here.

16
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.199
And refresh the page.

17
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:12.403
I might have to restart my application.

18
00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.681
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's one.

19
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:24.377
There it is.

20
00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:25.540
Okay, sorry.

21
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.681
So now we have a tap here in our browser.

22
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.745
It should appear relatively
similar in Firefox.

23
00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.160
It'll just be a tab in there.

24
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.891
We're going to open it.

25
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:38.732
And now if you check this out you can
actually see the component hierarchy

26
00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.282
that our React components look like.

27
00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:44.673
The one thing you might
notice here is that there is

28
00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:48.280
some stuff that you may
not expect to be there.

29
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.727
Like for example you have app right?

30
00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:52.276
That's the top level one,
you know what that one is.

31
00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:54.367
BrowserRouter, we also put that one there.

32
00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:59.640
But BrowserRouter itself is rendering its
own router component, so we see that here.

33
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.766
That's rendering out a div, which is
rendering out the switch which we did.

34
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.077
And then we have this lowercase component,
right?

35
00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:08.277
What is that?

36
00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:12.105
Well, remember in order to render
a search, we have that anonymous component

37
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.125
that renders search, so
let me show you what that looks like.

38
00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:20.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice how this
is a function here, right?

39
00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:27.871
That's the anonymous component,
that's this component right there, right?

40
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.636
Okay so that's the function that
renders search which is this, and

41
00:02:31.636 --> 00:02:35.479
then you can go down, you can see
all the various show cards, right?

42
00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.805
You can actually dive into them and
you can see here,

43
00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:42.519
you can see all the props,
you can see the key that it used.

44
00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.745
If I go up here to search and

45
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:50.629
I click on that I can actually see
the state that's interior to that.

46
00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.082
What's kind of fun is if it's state
I can actually just change it

47
00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:57.319
directly here in the dev tools.

48
00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.454
It's not super interesting 'cause
I can just do it up here as well,

49
00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:03.926
but sometimes you have state that's
a little bit more difficult to get at.

50
00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:07.542
So that's kind of useful.

51
00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:09.862
You can't rewrite props,
right, that makes sense,

52
00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:12.243
because this component
wouldn't have access to that.

53
00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can do
things like highlight update.

54
00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:22.307
So if you're kind of confused
about how things are changing,

55
00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:27.821
notice that my dev tools are flashing
yellow when I delete and update things.

56
00:03:30.872 --> 00:03:32.335
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's pretty cool.

57
00:03:35.747 --> 00:03:38.917
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can also
even see that it's updating.

58
00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.783
You can see it flashing
a little bit as I'm typing.

59
00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:49.085
So that's a neat little tool there.

60
00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:53.297
It works just like the browser
that if I highlight one of these,

61
00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.407
it's going to highlight
it on the DOM as well.

62
00:03:56.407 --> 00:03:58.330
And there's something that's
even nice as well, right?

63
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.883
So, let's say I'm really interested in
this Stranger Things title right here.

64
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:07.033
If I right-click on that and
say inspect element,

65
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.603
it's still gonna bring me here, right?

66
00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.208
But if I click React
immediately after that,

67
00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:16.330
it's gonna also deep link me into
there and the React dev tools as well.

68
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.342
So you can also do the right click
inspect element workflow to get what your

69
00:04:20.342 --> 00:04:21.129
looking for.

70
00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:27.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool something
else that I wanted to show you.

71
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.652
So let's say I'm really interested in this
house of cards component right here but

72
00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:35.402
I want to be able to
interact with it directly.

73
00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:39.213
I can click on it so now it's
highlighted in my React dev tools.

74
00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:42.585
I can go into the console and
I can say $r and

75
00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:48.420
that's going to refer to the component
that I have highlighted, right?

76
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.558
So this is a stateless component and

77
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.750
I can open it and
say props and things like that.

78
00:04:58.076 --> 00:05:00.805
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do it with
search because that's a little bit more

79
00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:01.851
interesting as well.

80
00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:08.798
So if I go back to React and I click
here on Search, so now I have $r again.

81
00:05:08.798 --> 00:05:10.411
That's gonna be set to Search.

82
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:16.121
So I can say $r.setstate
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

83
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:23.391
I wanna set it so search term is,
let's say valley.

84
00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:31.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then it's gonna call
set state for me on that component,

85
00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:35.794
and in this particular case that means
it's gonna search for Silicone Valley.

86
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:40.107
Just as like a side, if you go into
the elements and I click on this,

87
00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:45.440
that's gonna be available as $0,
that's always worked for Chrome dev tools.

88
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.749
So there's kind of
mimicking that behavior.

89
00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.481
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is just a really
really useful way of debugging React.

90
00:05:57.481 --> 00:06:01.094
Let's say I have a huge application and
I need to find all the show cards.

91
00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:06.911
You can actually use the search up
here to search for various components.

92
00:06:06.911 --> 00:06:09.036
That's also useful to have.

93
00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:13.928
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's new.

94
00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:14.864
I've never seen that before.

95
00:06:14.864 --> 00:06:17.518
So you can click this little
target right there, and

96
00:06:17.518 --> 00:06:20.604
then you can kind of find
the thing that you're looking for.

97
00:06:20.604 --> 00:06:24.578
So, I'm looking for this, right,
and that's gonna take me to that.

98
00:06:24.578 --> 00:06:26.927
That's pretty cool.

99
00:06:26.927 --> 00:06:29.478
So definitely don't leave home without it.

100
00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:30.742
[LAUGH]
