00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
I want you to go to header.jsx, and

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.370
now we're gonna say import.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.210
Connect at the top, from react-redux.

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.384
And we're going to import {setSearchTerm}

5
00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:26.505
from' ./actionCreators.

6
00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.382
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We come down here for
default props,

7
00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:41.253
get rid of handleSearchTermChange.

8
00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:46.505
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Get rid of searchTerm.

9
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.478
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz these
are no longer optional types.

10
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.111
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

11
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:03.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You also are gonna
get rid of the maybe types here.

12
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.510
So get rid of the question marks.

13
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.748
Cuz now, it's just always going
to be reading from redux, and

14
00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:09.321
it's only gonna occasionally be using it.

15
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then down
here at the bottom.

16
00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:21.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're still gonna
have a default prop show search.

17
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.765
You're gonna say const mapStateToProps

18
00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:31.610
= state which is going to return

19
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.712
an object of ({searchTerm:
state.searchTerm}).

20
00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:45.271
And you're gonna have
a const mapDispatchToProps

21
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.154
which is gonna be = (dispatch).

22
00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:54.197
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is a function.

23
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:00.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,

24
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.929
you're gonna be returning an object
with a handleSearchTermChange.

25
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.660
And all that's going to do is take
an event which is going to be a,

26
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.873
well actually I don't think you
even need to type this one.

27
00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:25.230
You're gonna dispatch a setSearchTerm,

28
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.200
from (event.target.value).

29
00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:39.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I import this up there?

30
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.390
No, I guess I didn't.

31
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.075
Sorry, this should be setSearchTerm.

32
00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:48.924
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

33
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:54.461
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then down here we're just gonna connect.

34
00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:05.054
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: (mapStateToProps,
mapDispatchToProps).

35
00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:10.918
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that is it.

36
00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:17.986
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, cool.

37
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, the nice thing is we
have this HandleSearchTermChange that was

38
00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:27.690
coming in as a prop before.

39
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.350
The nice thing is,
we don't have to re-factor that,

40
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.960
because that's already
the contract that we have there.

41
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.210
So it's totally fine to leave that as is.

42
00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now HandleSearchTermChange and

43
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.440
SearchTerm are both gonna be required.

44
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.340
showSearchTerm is still a media
type because it might be coming,

45
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.000
it might not be.

46
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.700
And then yeah,
we're gonna have this input that may or

47
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.850
may not be reading from Redux,
depending on which context it's called in.

48
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.396
So let's save that, and refresh.

49
00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:06.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, still getting
some errors, which doesn't matter.

50
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.045
So now if I say, I'm gonna search for
black, and I hit Enter,

51
00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:16.117
I'm going to go to the landing page
with that filled in from Redux, right?

52
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:21.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I can modify it up here and

53
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.580
it's still giving me reading from Redux.

54
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.435
Another cool thing as
a nice byproduct of this.

55
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:31.015
If I click into Atlanta, and
then I click Back, it's still

56
00:04:31.015 --> 00:04:34.875
gonna have the same search term, because
that's being perpetuated in Redux, right?

57
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.622
Nothing's modifying Redux when I go there.

58
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else
that actually is a problem,

59
00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:45.835
if I back to svideo, well, I mean,
it's still reading Atlanta, that's fine.

60
00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:49.460
But if I say or Browse All, I actually
technically haven't fixed that yet,

61
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.450
but the only thing you'd have
to do is if they clicked it,

62
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.460
dispatch an action to Redux to clear
out the search term, and that's fine.

63
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.430
Not gonna do it here because I literally
just explained to you how to do it,

64
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.270
I have all faith that you can go and
do it.

65
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.414
Any questions?

66
00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:10.952
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It only took us two hours,
but

67
00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:15.009
we've at least completed the first
bit of migrating to Redux.

68
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:22.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is pretty cool,
I mean the tradeoff here is that like for

69
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:27.360
example if you look at Search,
Search got a lot more simple right?

70
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.570
Search you used to have
to worry about state, and

71
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.470
passing props into the right header and
all that kinda stuff.

72
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.700
It no longer has to care about
that because Search in and

73
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.140
of itself really, all it wants to do is
read Search term and do searching, and

74
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.730
it doesn't actually wanna read and
write to Redux, right?

75
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.970
It can lead that problem to header.

76
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.510
So by virtue of that,
it doesn't have to care anymore,

77
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.900
because it only matters where
you're actually doing the writing.

78
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.365
And the writing isn't actually
happening in Header, and

79
00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:54.729
it's not happening in Search.

80
00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.207
So that is a nicety.

81
00:05:56.207 --> 00:06:00.814
It's gonna externalize the reading and
writing to your data store into separate

82
00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:06.350
files and separate functions, and
it's gonna simplify your React components.

83
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.470
That's a net positive in my opinion.

84
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.150
However, we greatly complicated the
process of reading-writing to our state.

85
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.963
It's deliberate, it's very deliberate,
which is a good thing in general.

86
00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:23.530
But it's a pain, yeah,
it's just more code.

87
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.347
It's more code, and more things to
think about, which is always hard.

88
00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:30.739
What we'll talk about tomorrow is,
we'll talk about testing Redux.

89
00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:35.143
Cuz you can see, as you may imagine,
a lot of the stuff that we just did,

90
00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:39.344
like the action creators and
the reducers are extremely testable.

91
00:06:39.344 --> 00:06:43.590
So that's gonna be really positive for us.

92
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.927
And I'm gonna show you how to actually
have Redux generate test for itself,

93
00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.225
which is pretty cool.

94
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about Redux?

95
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.880
I've shown you the happy path for
Redux, this is most of what Redux is.

96
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.610
It's just dispatching actions
into the reducers, and

97
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.160
letting the reducers take care of things,
which then update the store or

98
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.360
which then gets fed back in the UI, right?

99
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.750
That's most of Redux,
everything else is an advanced use case.

100
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I would also say,
you cannot actually write Redux,

101
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:23.458
only ever doing stuff like this.

102
00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:26.148
I will show you tomorrow how
to do asynchronous stuff.

103
00:07:26.148 --> 00:07:30.443
We can actually externalize
asynchronous stuff and Redux, but

104
00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:32.678
you wouldn't do that, I guess.
