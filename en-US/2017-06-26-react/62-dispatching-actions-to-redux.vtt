00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now we have search
term which is going to be injected as

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.690
props in the landing, right.

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.530
So now landing has the ability
to read from its props and

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.100
it's gonna be reading search
term which is a string, right.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.340
Cuz now we're back inཏོ་flow land.

6
00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:23.011
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then what we're
gonna do here in the input Is we're

7
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.974
gonna say value={props.searchTerm}.

8
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:38.555
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
just to prove to you this works,

9
00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:42.340
I'm just gonna go into my
reducer just super quick.

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.170
Change this to something, and save.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.235
Now if I go back to landing here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice,

12
00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.890
whatever, ignore your console for
the moment.

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.950
Notice that something is inputted
in there into the box, right?

14
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.550
So that's being from read from Redux.

15
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.400
The problem that we have again is
what happens if I try and type in it.

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.900
Nothing happens because it's
continuing to read from Redux and

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
nothing is updating Redux, right?

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.260
We wrote all that set search term
stuff but nowhere is it being invoked.

19
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.070
So let's go close out loop and
make it invoke.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.790
Okay, so
we're gonna go back to landing.jsx.

21
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.690
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna
make another one of these called const

22
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.580
mapDispatchToProps.

23
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.315
That's gonna be equal to or
it's gonna take

24
00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:46.941
in dispatch, which is gonna be a function.

25
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that is going
to return an object, as well.

26
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.310
And this object is going to have a handle,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchTermChange,

27
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.160
which is gonna be a function.

28
00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:09.549
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It takes in an event.

29
00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:16.558
And then that event is going
to dispatch the results of

30
00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:22.648
SetSearchTerm with event.target.value.

31
00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:30.288
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we need to go
import our setSearchTerm function, so

32
00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:31.821
we're gonna do that real quick.

33
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:35.840
Import {set,

34
00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:42.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchTerm
} from './actionCreators'.

35
00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:52.091
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then last thing we
need to do is we need to take this map,

36
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:56.051
dispatch to props and pass that in
as the second parameter to connect.

37
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.919
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did a lot there, so

38
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.200
let's make sure that we
recount what happened, okay?

39
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.720
I wrote this, mapDispatchToProps, right?

40
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.260
This is going to create methods that
landing is going to be able to invoke,

41
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.780
to dispatch events to redux, okay?

42
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.260
That's the whole point
of mapDispatchToProps is

43
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.540
dispatching actions into redux.

44
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.579
It's gonna take care of all of that for
us.

45
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.014
We're going to write methods that
take care of that for us, okay?

46
00:03:29.014 --> 00:03:35.380
So mapDispatchToProps,
it's going to return an object and

47
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.470
everything on this object is going to be
injected as props into landing, okay?

48
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.410
So I have this handle search term event,
or handle search term change, right,

49
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.340
which takes in an event.

50
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.590
And based on that event, whatever that
event.target.value is for that event,

51
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.800
it's going to dispatch, or it's going to
pass that into set search term, right?

52
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.110
So if we go into,
you remember our action creators?

53
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.430
We created this set search
term action creator, right?

54
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.302
Where you pass in a search term, and
it gives you a well formatted action,

55
00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:14.122
right, cool?

56
00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:20.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So given a searchTerm,
which is coming from event.target.value,

57
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.892
it's going to create a new action
of type SET_SEARCH_TERM, and

58
00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:27.000
payload searchTerm, right?

59
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.280
So this just returns an action.

60
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.890
There's nothing magical here,
or I don't know.

61
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.510
It depends on what you define magical is.

62
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.010
So go back to landing.

63
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.353
That's what this does, this dispatch
function is to say, here redux,

64
00:04:40.353 --> 00:04:41.771
here's an action, right?

65
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:43.874
It's just going to pass it into your,

66
00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:46.649
it's going to end up being
in your route reducer.

67
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.660
That's where that action is going
to get routed eventually, okay?

68
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The event target
value is what they typed up.

69
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, in fact,
let's just go ahead and do that.

70
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.739
So onChange here Is gonna be

71
00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:03.880
props.HandleSearchTermChange.

72
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.000
We're also gonna have to
declare that in our prop types.

73
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.230
HandleSearchTermChange is
going to be a function.

74
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.695
Right, so
maybe that's a little more clear now.

75
00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:22.540
onChange is gonna call
props.handle.searchTermChange.

76
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.250
This got injected from here, right, from
this one that we wrote down here, okay?

77
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.080
And then this got injected into redux
right here via the connect method.

78
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.520
So all the connect method really is doing,
is it's taking stuff, these objects and

79
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.020
they're injecting them
into your components so

80
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.770
they can be used as props
inside of your component.

81
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.930
That's really all connect is,
there's not really a lot more to it.

82
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.636
It's just calling, it's like I got this
thing from the user, I'm gonna call this

83
00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:59.026
function and inject these objects as
props into this particular component.

84
00:06:03.024 --> 00:06:04.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that's what happens on the UI.
