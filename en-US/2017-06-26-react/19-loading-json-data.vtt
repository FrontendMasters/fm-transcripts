00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go start
making some cool stuff in search.

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:08.022
So search.jsx,
while this is a might fine component,

3
00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:11.331
we'll be expanding this a little bit.

4
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:19.348
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna import our preload data.

5
00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:27.836
So we're gonna say import
preload from './data', right?

6
00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:30.637
If you remember that's
beta data.json file.

7
00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:33.596
If you need a refresher of what it
looks like this is what it looks like.

8
00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.634
It's just a bunch of
metadata about TV shows,

9
00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:40.041
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

10
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.472
then we're gonna create a div.

11
00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:51.955
Its className= ' search'.

12
00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:03.729
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, if you want to,

13
00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.356
you can do something that's kind of useful
sometimes to do is you can use a pre in

14
00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:14.506
code,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To view JSON output.

15
00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:18.802
This is just a debugging
trick that I've used a bunch.

16
00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:23.728
And honestly, stole from Ryan Florence
the creator of React Router.

17
00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:26.385
And he also does
a Frontend Masters course.

18
00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:40.855
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So all this is gonna
do is it's going to preformat and

19
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:44.133
print out whatever is in preload.

20
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.245
So if we refresh here.

21
00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:47.608
Did I?
I probably shut that down.

22
00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:51.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Can't resolve ./data.

23
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:53.325
It's gonna be ../data.

24
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:05.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like the ESLint is
gonna require that we put .JSON on there,

25
00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:06.166
so put .JSON.

26
00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now, hopefully,
if you go refresh here,

27
00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.881
you can see this is what
our data looks like.

28
00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.119
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that trick that I
showed you with the JSON.stringify and

29
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.887
pre-encode.

30
00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:28.608
That's really useful if you are not
sure what prompts are coming in or

31
00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:30.737
how your state's changing over time.

32
00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:33.934
Its just a really useful way to dump
a bunch of data to the DOM really quick.

33
00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:41.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
now that we have that, let's go and

34
00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:45.861
do,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's actually go and

35
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:47.848
print out all of our shows.

36
00:02:47.848 --> 00:02:51.325
So first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna printout the title for

37
00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:52.734
every show individually.

38
00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.798
You wanna make it into H3.

39
00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:59.537
What we have is we have
an array of show data, right?

40
00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:03.474
And we wanna transform that into an array
of show components of some sort.

41
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.589
So for those of you that have any
functional programming background,

42
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.036
some bells should be going off in your
head of what you should do here, right?

43
00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:13.834
If we're transforming one array from array
of one thing to an array of another thing,

44
00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:14.901
that's a map, right?

45
00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:16.906
That's an all-day map.

46
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:20.087
So that's what we're gonna be using here.

47
00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:22.679
This is actually one of my
favorite points about React.

48
00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.469
Cuz most of React is just JavaScript.

49
00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.714
Now it seems kind of obvious to
say that out loud, but I mean

50
00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:32.972
that in the regard of I want to pick on
Angular just cuz that's the one I know.

51
00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:34.432
And I'm talking about old Angular, right?

52
00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:37.718
Angular 1 and before there was a lot of

53
00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:41.837
domain specific language in Angular,
right?

54
00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:47.073
You had to know how to do an NG4 and
those were very specific Angular skills.

55
00:03:47.073 --> 00:03:49.049
And then once you've
moved on from Angular,

56
00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.774
those skills no longer apply, right?

57
00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:54.191
You can't do NG4 with Ember,
it doesn't make any sense.

58
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:59.656
What I like about React is for
the most part it's just JavaScript, right?

59
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:04.711
There's very little domain
specific language for React soft.

60
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.352
There's some, I'm not denying
that there isn't some, right?

61
00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.338
Knowing to put class name in there,
it's annoying right?

62
00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:13.574
It's a very React specific thing to do.

63
00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:19.202
But I'm getting on to say that,
we're gonna be using array map here

64
00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:25.247
to do what NG4 does in Angular and
what pound each does in Ember, right?

65
00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:28.728
So let's take a look at what
that actually looks like.

66
00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:35.299
We're gonna do preload.shows.map,

67
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:40.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm gonna say show.

68
00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:50.418
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And for
now we're just gonna return an h3,

69
00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:59.102
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: With show.title.

70
00:05:04.587 --> 00:05:09.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So Prettier took it
away but what I had here was this.

71
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.672
So this right here in the map.

72
00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.766
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is just
a normal arrow function, right?

73
00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:18.283
We're taking a show, right?

74
00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:23.449
Well, let's go back and
talk about map for just a moment, right?

75
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.500
So preload.shows is an array, right?

76
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.215
We're gonna take that array and
we're gonna call map on it.

77
00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:34.750
And what that does is gonna
call this function right here,

78
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.610
once on every element.

79
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.163
Whenever this function returns, it's going
to be returned in a new array, right?

80
00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:47.724
So we're gonna take this array,
which is an array of objects, and

81
00:05:47.724 --> 00:05:52.760
we're going to transform it into
an array of React components, cool?

82
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.786
Are we cool so far with that idea?

83
00:05:57.247 --> 00:06:01.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now if you remember,
what I referenced very briefly earlier,

84
00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:05.290
React knows what to do with
array of elements, right?

85
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.037
So if we give it an array of elements,
it knows how to render those.

86
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.964
So that's precisely what we're doing,

87
00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:16.400
is we're giving it an array of elements,
okay?

88
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.969
So that's what's going on here.

89
00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.817
Now, particularly with arrow functions,

90
00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:29.601
if you have exactly one parameter,
no more, no less,

91
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.395
the parentheses around
the parameters are optional.

92
00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:38.023
So as soon as I save this,
it's gonna take away these parentheses.

93
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.424
That's where they're going.

94
00:06:39.424 --> 00:06:41.155
It's Prettier that takes them away.

95
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.817
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if I come back here,

96
00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:50.315
you'll notice that I have
a bunch of H3 on the page.

97
00:06:57.553 --> 00:06:59.044
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

98
00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:11.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it best practice
to pull out the preload.shows

99
00:07:11.322 --> 00:07:17.465
into another JSX variable and
then put it inside the div?

100
00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:22.152
Or is it still, I don't know,
would you consider doing

101
00:07:22.152 --> 00:07:26.558
the map function inside
the div to be best practice?

102
00:07:26.558 --> 00:07:31.083
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It definitely
depends on what you're doing.

103
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:35.685
Another beautiful point about React is
it's not really super specific about

104
00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:39.021
what it wants you to break
into components and what not.

105
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.498
I found that when I was first writing
React I had a tendency to break things

106
00:07:42.498 --> 00:07:44.778
down into just tiny,
tiny, tiny components,

107
00:07:44.778 --> 00:07:47.175
to the point that it was no longer useful,
right?

108
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.991
Cuz things were made up of
too many components and

109
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.790
just didn't make a lot of sense.

110
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.805
So now I try to break them
down into atomic objects.

111
00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:58.842
In fact, that's that we're, you're kind
of beating me to my punch here, jerk.

112
00:07:58.842 --> 00:08:00.936
No, I'm just kidding.

113
00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:04.704
That we're gonna build a component in
here, and then I'm gonna comment to you

114
00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:07.686
that this is to big and
that we should break it two components.

115
00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:11.360
So, let's go make it too big first, and
then we'll break it into two components.

116
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.630
But for now, this is a tiny component.

117
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.445
If this was all this was doing,
yeah, this is great,

118
00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:19.523
let's just leave it that way, right?

119
00:08:19.523 --> 00:08:22.992
There's no hard and fast rules like if
there's a map, then you must do this.

120
00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:23.631
I don't know.

121
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.973
Someone might make that rule, I don't.

122
00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.502
I try to do what's sane, right?

123
00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:31.580
I find those dogmatic rules typically
don't serve you in the long run.
