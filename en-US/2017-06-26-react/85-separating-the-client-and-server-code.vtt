00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's really great if
we can make React router handle both

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.866
server-side routing and
client-side routing.

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.051
And the answer is,
you can, that does work.

4
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.084
So let's go ahead and go do that.

5
00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:16.927
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a couple things
that we're gonna have to do first.

6
00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:21.095
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So open your app.jsx.

7
00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:29.832
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The thing that we have here
on the outside is browser router, right?

8
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:34.380
As you might imply by the name, browser
router depends on a browser, right?

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.898
And if we try to run browser router
in node, node doesn't have document,

10
00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:40.870
it doesn't have window,
it doesn't have all these things.

11
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.204
So if you try and run browser
router in node, it's gonna fail.

12
00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:47.333
So in other words, this is going
to be a client side concern, so

13
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.884
we're gonna have to move it to client app,
right?

14
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.955
So go ahead and take out BrowserRouter.

15
00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:58.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so provider is
the top component and that's fine.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.639
Redux works both in node and
in the browser.

17
00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.395
Get rid of BrowserRouter up here.

18
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:13.059
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then go up to clientapp.jsx and

19
00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:17.881
what you're going do here is you're

20
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:23.171
just going to import BrowserRouter from

21
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:27.851
'react-router-dom', okay?

22
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:30.760
And then you're just going to
surround app with BrowserRouter.

23
00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:34.732
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it.

24
00:01:40.293 --> 00:01:41.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can put
that on multiple lines if that

25
00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.885
makes you feel better.

26
00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:44.977
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

27
00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:51.952
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now BrowserRouter is
only going to be rendered on the client.

28
00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:55.801
That frees us up on the node side
to use a different kind of router.

29
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.969
Which is gonna be I think,
is it the static router?

30
00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:00.816
Something like that, we'll figure it out.

31
00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:10.596
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, the next thing I
want you to do is I want you to open your

32
00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:15.613
index.html, which we haven't edited for
a long time.

33
00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:21.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What we wanna do
here is we wanna edit this so

34
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:26.738
that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

35
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.526
is going to be used as
the template as well.

36
00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:31.369
And there is 10 billion ways
to do the template here, and

37
00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.386
I'm not actually super concerned of how
you choose to do the templating, right?

38
00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:39.121
We need to use this and we need to insert
mark up into this, right, in order for

39
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.580
this to work.

40
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.254
I'm going to use low dash templating
just because it's really simple.

41
00:02:44.254 --> 00:02:46.242
But again, you could use handle bars,

42
00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:48.780
you could just write
template strings yourself.

43
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.940
There's a million ways to do it and
it's really not important.

44
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.450
So low dash templates are really easy.

45
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.022
I'm just gonna say this,
which is gonna be &lt;%=.

46
00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:06.124
I'm gonna body here, and

47
00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:10.601
then I'm going to hit %&gt;.

48
00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:15.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just gonna say
whenever I go to render this template,

49
00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:17.867
this going to put body in there, right?

50
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can actually use
react itself to do templating here,

51
00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:25.240
that's fine as well.

52
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.450
It's just a little bit more work
than I care to do right now.
