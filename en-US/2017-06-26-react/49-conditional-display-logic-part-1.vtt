00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:03.496
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we need
to make this header account for

2
00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:08.306
what happens with,
let's actually do that, too, as well.

3
00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:11.726
So we're gonna turn this
into a component here.

4
00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:16.235
It'd be really nice on details pages if
there was a back button in the header that

5
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:18.538
you could go back to the search results.

6
00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:21.561
So let's go ahead and
make use of that, too.

7
00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:33.544
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna say if,

8
00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.535
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: (show) well,

9
00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:47.906
I wanna do that.

10
00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:49.945
We're gonna create something called util

11
00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.977
space
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

12
00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:56.537
we're gonna take in the props here.

13
00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:04.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna pass in
a property called showSearch, right?

14
00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:09.430
So if a user wants to show,
or let me rephrase that.

15
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.280
If you're on the search page, you're
gonna wanna show a search box, right?

16
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.873
If you're on the details page,

17
00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:19.420
you're gonna wanna show a Back button
to go back to the search results.

18
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.396
So if we pass in this boolean showSearch,
then we're gonna say utilSpace is gonna

19
00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:31.536
be equal to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll say for

20
00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:34.140
now just an h1, we'll come back to it.

21
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.095
else utilSpace is going to be equal
to this h2 that we're gonna create.

22
00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:51.092
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's gonna be another link which is going

23
00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:55.806
to go back to /search
which is gonna say back.

24
00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:59.180
And then close it, close that.

25
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.280
So we're gonna have this utilSpace right
here, and then that's just going to go

26
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.493
underneath the,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: h1 here.

27
00:02:15.863 --> 00:02:18.855
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we have this
props.search, so the first thing we're

28
00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.684
gonna have to identify is what
those props can look like.

29
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:25.176
So one of them is gonna be showSearch
which is going to be a bool.

30
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.312
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But the thing is,
is this is gonna be optional, right?

31
00:02:31.312 --> 00:02:35.060
It's gonna be an opt-in sort of thing,
so we're gonna make it a maybe type.

32
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.800
It might show up, it might not.

33
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.947
If it's there, then yes,
show them the search box, right?

34
00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:46.694
If it's not there, then we're just
gonna assume they want the back.

35
00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:48.629
However, if you remember,

36
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.072
you have to give it default props
if something like that happens.

37
00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:58.511
So we're gonna go down here at the bottom,

38
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:04.557
and say Header.defaultProps = showSearch,

39
00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:10.462
which we're gonna default to false, right?

40
00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:11.909
If they don't ask for search,

41
00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.592
then we're just gonna assume
that they didn't want it.

42
00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:22.331
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so
that's how you do this maybe type here.

43
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.052
So now if you save here and
come back and refresh here,

44
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:29.945
notice way over here in
the corner we have a Back button.

45
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:33.022
And if we hit Back it's gonna take
us back to the search results page.

46
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.414
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool?

47
00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:39.996
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
go back to the header?

48
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is the maybe type right here.

49
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:48.020
And then down here, you just have to
tell it what the default props are.
