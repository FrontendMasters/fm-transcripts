1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.535
So let's go and make details actually
look like a nice page, right?

2
00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:06.550
Cuz right now it's just
kinda outputting data.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.616
So we're gonna make this an actual method.

4
00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.452
Does anyone have any questions?

5
00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:20.814
It's good question to ask him,
a good time to ask.

6
00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:30.147
Okay, yeah, go ahead.

7
00:00:30.147 --> 00:00:33.210
&gt;&gt; How does types .JSX get imported again?

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.045
&gt;&gt; It's automatically imported because
it's in the flow type directory.

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.750
&gt;&gt; So when you add the comment on
the top it imports all of that?

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.260
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, it's kinda magical.

11
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.861
There are ways to do it that you don't
have to go through flow typed, but

12
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.937
that's just a established cow path so
I tend to follow that.

13
00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:06.528
Okay, so const { title, description,

14
00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:13.267
Year, poster,

15
00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:20.911
trailer} = props.shows.

16
00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:25.396
If you've never seen this before,

17
00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:30.440
this is called destructuring which
came with ES6 ES 2015 as well.

18
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.910
It's basically saying
inside of props that show

19
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.639
I know I have a variable called title,
pull it out and call it title.

20
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.470
If you wanted to write a long way, this
would be const title = props.show.title,

21
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.670
const description equals,
etc, etc, etc, right?

22
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.940
This is just shorthand for that.

23
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.770
Now it's gonna be yelling at me was like,
hey,

24
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.330
I don't have prop type validations for
this, b But pretty easy for us to do.

25
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.424
We can say props and you're gonna
be getting a show which is a Show.

26
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:20.460
Okay, now they look like
they're still errors.

27
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.870
That's because we haven't used them yet,
which ESLint doesn't like.

28
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.245
Sometimes it's kind of hard to
figure out who's yelling at you now.

29
00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.360
[LAUGH]
But I promise it is all worth it.

30
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.090
Okay, so what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna delete all of this cuz

31
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.830
we don't need it anymore.

32
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.546
And we're gonna make a header,

33
00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:45.940
which is gonna be an h1 with svideo so
we have a nice header again.

34
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.595
Then underneath that we're gonna put

35
00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:57.154
a section with a h1 with {title},

36
00:02:57.154 --> 00:03:00.830
h2 with {year} and again,

37
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.830
if you remember we wanted this literally

38
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.730
surrounded with parentheses
around the year.

39
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.906
So we're just gonna put
parentheses around that.

40
00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.885
We're gonna have an &lt;img

41
00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:28.068
src={'/public/img/posters/${poster}'} and

42
00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:33.257
then we're gonna give it an alt because

43
00:03:33.257 --> 00:03:38.458
we're good citizens of the internet.

44
00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:43.535
And then we're gonna say,

45
00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:48.843
{ Poster for ${title}.

46
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:56.747
Not only just putting in all tags like
that's already important for accessibility

47
00:03:56.747 --> 00:04:01.583
in fact, there's a grade for the Master's
Course, by John on accessibility that you

48
00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:06.043
all should definitely watch, because
we are all deficient at accessibility.

49
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:14.870
But also Airbnb, the ESLint rules will
enforce on you to write those alt texts.

50
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.691
So you have to, [LAUGH] Okay,

51
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:28.041
and then here we're gonna
do a description as well.

52
00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:38.431
Okay, underneath this
section we're gonna do a div.

53
00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:44.470
And then here,
we're gonna do something kinda fun.

54
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.185
We're gonna put an iframe,
cuz who doesn't love iframes,

55
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:56.470
But we're actually gonna embed the YouTube
trailer for each individual pay show.

56
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.500
So the first thing and

57
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.084
you're just gonna have to bear with
me because the URL is super long.

58
00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:11.084
https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/$/-
{trailer}

59
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:30.390
and then ?rel=0&amp;amp;

60
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:41.078
controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0

61
00:05:41.078 --> 00:05:44.874
that's it.

62
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.957
FrameBorder="0", allowFullScreen and

63
00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:57.989
then think this is a new one,
I think iframes in

64
00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:03.021
fact it says here,
requires a title, again,

65
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.300
which is for accessibility purposes.

66
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.577
You have to say title=,

67
00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:19.323
{Trailer}, For ${title}.

68
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.197
This is so a screen reader,
if they tap into it,

69
00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:26.735
it's gonna identify the iframe by
what the content is inside of it.

70
00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:28.219
And it's gonna do that by the title.

71
00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:37.076
If you haven't looked at your site with
the screen reader should definitely

72
00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:37.608
do that.

73
00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:48.988
Okay, so now hopefully come back to our
page and we're gonna go to details and

74
00:06:48.988 --> 00:06:55.255
then just one of the valid IMDb IDs,
you should be able to go in there and

75
00:06:55.255 --> 00:07:00.480
you should be able to see like
a nice looking details page.

76
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.200
Right, it's got the title.

77
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.010
It's got the year.

78
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.758
It's got the poster up there,
the little description.

79
00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:13.390
So it looks something more like that.

80
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.540
And then you can actually click it and
play the video and all that kind of stuff.

81
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.040
So,
