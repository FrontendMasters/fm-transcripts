WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.139
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
b3/31 that is the last one.

2
00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.082
So 30 is using react, 31 is using preact.

3
00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:11.926
You all can go to check those out
if you are feeling so inclined.

4
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:16.730
Go ahead and add inferno and substitute
inferno, that is what I was gonna try,

5
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.767
I was gonna try real quick
if could just switch out,

6
00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.532
I haven't tried this recently,
so it might or might not work.

7
00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:26.031
Let's just doing preact.

8
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.834
Preact doesn't have all of the APIs so
I don't know, like,

9
00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:34.607
react routers using, I don't know what,
like, the redact reduct stuff,

10
00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:39.548
like, all those bindings are using, so
this might not work, but let's try.

11
00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:48.181
Yarn build.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It'll probably build,

12
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:53.171
might not be super happy about it though.

13
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.770
Yeah, no, see we're stuck in loading hell.

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.660
So doesn't work, so for
now we have to use compact.

15
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.834
The way you would eventually fix that,
compat is a crutch.

16
00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.823
It's a good way to like get to using
preact, and then what you wanna do is

17
00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:09.700
you wanna go strip out the function
calls that preact doesn't have.

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.944
And then eventually you can go from
the 8 kilobyte library to the 3 kilobyte

19
00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:20.279
library, which is even better.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Greg is asking if you have

20
00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:24.948
used any JavaScript end testing libraries?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer is,

21
00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:29.942
I hope you can see like the sadness
in my eyes cuz yes, I have.

22
00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.431
[LAUGH] It's important, right?

23
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.038
Something like Selenium, Selenium test.

24
00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:38.277
You can kind of verify
the things that are working.

25
00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:41.200
It's important to have the happy path,
right?

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.229
Log in and sign up, and
all this different process that are key.

27
00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.125
They're just so flaky, right?

28
00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:52.023
How much time have I spent just messing
around with the flaky Selenium test.

29
00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:53.690
The answer is way too much.

30
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.198
There's nothing like Protractor.

31
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.052
Protractor's really cool for angular.

32
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.834
React doesn't have anything like that,

33
00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:05.213
unfortunately.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well actually in Kent Dodds'

34
00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:10.192
testing JavaScript applications course,
well it's not out yet,

35
00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:14.399
but it will be out on front of
masters slash courses soon.

36
00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.490
You can watch the replay, but

37
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.719
he uses the cypress.io
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I dont know anything about

38
00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.159
that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it's pretty new but

39
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.562
he shows how awesome it is and
how he loves it and

40
00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:28.125
stuff and its way better than solenium.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have a great amount

41
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:33.085
of fun just like messing around,
treading my bundles even smaller,

42
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.903
it's like a game to me.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I can see that.

43
00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:38.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Have you used rollup at all?

44
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.865
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rollup is also a really

45
00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:44.310
cool packager.

46
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.055
It really pushed webpack hard and that's
why webpack 2 is as cool as it is, is cuz

47
00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:51.819
Rollup like came in and says like no screw
you I'm gonna do tree shaking, right?

48
00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.633
That was kinda their thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

49
00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:00.896
actually so the way the tree shaking works
with webpack 2 is it doesn't actually

50
00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:02.222
remove the code itself.

51
00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:06.553
It basically outputs the code in
such a way that it's unreachable.

52
00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.984
And then uglify 2,
which is the new version of uglify,

53
00:03:09.984 --> 00:03:12.330
I guess uglify 3 is about to come out.

54
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.498
Uglify 2 is smart enough to say
this code is never reachable and

55
00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:18.473
it just pulls that stuff out.

56
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:21.272
So that's what Rollup
was really great for.

57
00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:24.072
Roll up is still really great and
important.

58
00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:26.173
It's great for libraries right?

59
00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:29.128
So you want to build your
libraries like react.

60
00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:33.089
React is built with Rollup and
it outputs it in such a way that

61
00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.146
it's consumable by Web Pack and
it's much better that way.

62
00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:42.717
So I typically recommend use Web Pack for
your applications and

63
00:03:42.717 --> 00:03:49.021
use Roll Up for your libraries.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

64
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:50.750
Roll Up is really cool.

65
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.718
It's a little bit more difficult
to wrangle in my opinion, but

66
00:03:55.718 --> 00:04:01.435
I think that might be just cuz I have
Stockholm syndrome from wrangling so

67
00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:03.233
much with webpack so.

68
00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:06.468
Any other questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do you fell about

69
00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:11.143
SASS versus style components and
how would you use it in this

70
00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:17.565
application?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SaaS

71
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:20.091
is too powerful in my opinion.

72
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:23.960
I don't need a touring complete
scripting language on top of my CSS,

73
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.106
personal opinion.

74
00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:27.317
I think SaaS script is too much.

75
00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:29.909
To the points that, I remember at Reddit,

76
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.949
we had this little bit of SaaS script that
generated a bunch of classes that we used,

77
00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.276
and it just ballooned our CSS files for
no good reason.

78
00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:41.464
Now, you rightfully can point out,
that's your fault.

79
00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:43.261
It is my fault, right, but

80
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:47.262
it gives me tools for
things that I don't need to do, right?

81
00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:49.960
So I appreciate some of the things.

82
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.884
Like, nesting can be nice.

83
00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:56.498
Hand selectors can be nice, but
if I have five layers deep and

84
00:04:56.498 --> 00:05:01.307
I'm using mix ins,
it's too much indirection for me for css.

85
00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:06.405
So, I like using post css and
including things like auto prefixer.

86
00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:11.305
Maybe a couple of extra plugins for
nesting and like, that's it.

87
00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:15.469
Like the least powerful styling
rules that I can have, and then,

88
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.675
I like to import it as css modules.

89
00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:23.603
So, that's my go to of
how to deal with css.

90
00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:24.775
Style components is really cool.

91
00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:28.999
As you can see we messed up our
navigating without javascript.

92
00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.196
Because it does have a run time associated
with it and that also kind of sucks,

93
00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:33.140
a little bit, right?

94
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.088
So I might be a little bit more on the
Glamour train right now, but I know Max.

95
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:42.444
And I know they're working on getting up
to the same speed that Glamour is, and

96
00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:43.567
so, it's coming.

97
00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:48.292
It's definitely coming.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And where in your config, or

98
00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:52.603
whatever, would you add Sass, or PostCSS?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a couple places to

99
00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.684
do it, but
it would be here inside of your modules.

100
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:59.783
So you'd do something like,
I'm making this up so

101
00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:03.103
go validate it, but it would be,

102
00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:08.794
you'd have a test that would say,
basically this here,

103
00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:13.359
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

104
00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:17.529
instead of being this,
it would be like .scss, right?

105
00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.459
Then you would say loader like
sass-loader I think is what it is.

106
00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:26.586
I'm assuming that's what it's called.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

107
00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:30.108
then you'd have to have one as
well on here called style-loader.

108
00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:31.425
I can't remember which one comes first.

109
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:37.030
It's important which one it is but
let's just assume it comes second.

110
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.073
What this is going to do is it's going
to be able to read your SaSS, and

111
00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.126
it's also going to be
injected into your app.

112
00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:46.584
And then I can go into my spinner,

113
00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:51.521
and then I can say import spinner, or

114
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:56.951
it would just be import spinner.scss.

115
00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:02.633
This equally applies to Sylus or
LESS just so you know, or just plain CSS.

116
00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:09.145
And I've come back to web pack config, and
then I'd have to have a plugin in here for

117
00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:13.323
style extraction, it's like web pack dot-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think if

118
00:07:13.323 --> 00:07:16.068
you just google SASS web pack-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, but

119
00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:20.083
you have to have something that
will pull out the SaaS file and

120
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:25.195
then it's gonna output it in a separate
CSS so you can load it separately, but

121
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:30.044
that's the general gist of how to do it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually I show

122
00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:33.404
you in version two so
if you're super interested it's in

123
00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:35.909
Version two.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well thus concludes Version

124
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.338
three of React.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, thank you so much for

125
00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:38.850
coming.

126
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.636
It was a real pleasure to talk to you
all about one of the things I'm pretty

127
00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:43.704
passionate about.

128
00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:45.746
I think React is a really
great library and

129
00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:49.489
I just think this is a really good way
to build large scalable architecture.

130
00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.389
So I hope you can at least take pieces and
parts of this out and

131
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.843
bring it in to your workflow.

132
00:07:53.843 --> 00:07:57.651
It's okay if there's parts that you
don't like, don't include those parts,

133
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.510
but it's a puzzle,
you get to put together your own puzzle.

134
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.075
So cool, yeah, thanks.

135
00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:10.289
&gt;&gt; Group: [APPLAUSE]

136
00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.837
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The last thing I had to

137
00:08:11.837 --> 00:08:16.234
ask is do you have any recommendations for
further reading.

138
00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:21.275
Further people to follow,
things to look at in the React community

139
00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:25.726
that you're Actually pretty excited about.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I get a lot of

140
00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:30.662
my information from twitter,
which is a great source of news.

141
00:08:30.662 --> 00:08:31.855
That's a joke.

142
00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:34.043
It can be daunting at times.

143
00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:39.130
So the react core team are all super nice,
approachable people.

144
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.118
So, that's definitely one thing I
would suggest is like add soprano.

145
00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:47.526
I think that's been out [INAUDIBLE].

146
00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.102
They're all super interesting.

147
00:08:49.102 --> 00:08:51.844
I think the graph ql relay story is
really interesting to follow as well.

148
00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:55.894
That fits nice, that's a nice
puzzle piece to fit with React and

149
00:08:55.894 --> 00:09:00.408
like Lee Byron and the team that
runs that, they're all really great.

150
00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:04.874
I think Jason Miller and Dominic Gannaway,
who do Preact and Inferno,

151
00:09:04.874 --> 00:09:09.132
respectively, are both amazing,
interesting people to follow.

152
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:12.213
The CSS and
JS story is really heating up, and

153
00:09:12.213 --> 00:09:17.418
I think we're going to see a lot of
innovation over the next year about that.

154
00:09:17.418 --> 00:09:21.293
So Watch Glamor, watch Glamorous,
watch Styled Components.

155
00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:26.243
Aphrodite is not going away any time soon,
and CSS modules in general.

156
00:09:26.243 --> 00:09:29.861
I think that story's going
to continue to evolve and

157
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.254
get better and more interesting.

158
00:09:32.254 --> 00:09:37.540
The webpack team was always pushing
the envelope as well as the babel team.

159
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.313
They're definitely two
projects that need help so

160
00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:47.275
if you can either contribute or give money
to I think that's worthy to do as well,

161
00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:53.910
same with the Preact Project.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The React

162
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.686
doc's really good, I think that's
a really good place to look as

163
00:09:56.686 --> 00:10:01.780
well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah

164
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.688
that's what I got off the top of my head.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Perfect all right thank you.

165
00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:11.552
Well until next time.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah until version four.

166
00:10:11.552 --> 00:10:12.736
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]

167
00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:13.934
