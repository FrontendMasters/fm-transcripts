&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congratulations
all of you that survived Flow,

2
00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:05.575
React and Redux for
the past couple of days.

3
00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:07.901
Really excited to be back here and

4
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:11.564
we'll gonna be chatting
about more on Redux today.

5
00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.587
And some more advanced news
cases like service rendering,

6
00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.743
code splitting and believe me we'll
talk about like a little bit of Preact.

7
00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:26.183
So cool, hopefully we're able
to pull down the latest branch.

8
00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:29.829
This branch is gonna be V3-21,

9
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.090
that's currently available at Get Hop!

10
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.173
So kinda recap where we were and I guess
before we exert is there any questions

11
00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:45.988
that they wanna ask?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There

12
00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:50.945
is a question before we broke last night,

13
00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:55.624
about the MobX versus Redux.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

14
00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:58.228
which is a great question.

15
00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.297
So there's a library called MobX, and

16
00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:06.792
inevitably when talking about Redux,
MobX usually gets brought up.

17
00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:12.381
It fulfills the same use cases Redux it
is a centralized state repository for

18
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:14.400
your entire application.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.101
And you would use MobX in the same
situation that you would use Redux.

20
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:24.065
Similar how you wouldn't use Redux and
MobX together just like you wouldn't use

21
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.355
Ember and Angular together,
same sort of idea here.

22
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:31.986
MobX is a really cool piece of
technology that relies on some more new

23
00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:36.062
types of technologies, and
it's really fun to play with.

24
00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.858
It's very powerful,
you can achieve some pretty cool patterns.

25
00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:44.106
They rely heavily on things
called computed properties,

26
00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:46.454
which end up being really cool.

27
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:50.731
But again, I kinda prefer my technologies
to be as simple as possible,

28
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:52.528
which is why I do enjoy Redux.

29
00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:59.946
It's pretty again, [COUGH] you just have
this reducer cycle and that's really it.

30
00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:05.392
So for me personally, while I've toyed
around with my MobX I've had a great time.

31
00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:10.267
I haven't had a situation where I needed
that much power from my repository or

32
00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:11.696
my state repository.

33
00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:15.577
So that's why I choose to
not use it typically, but

34
00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:18.839
that's purely a personal call on my part.

35
00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.945
You're welcome to disagree and
use it on your own as well, and

36
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:23.637
that's a totally valid choice.
