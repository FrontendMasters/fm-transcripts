00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna show you
something, I have it here in my notes.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
But ultimately,
I think this is an anti-pattern so

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.844
we're gonna leave it the way it is.

4
00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:11.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, up to you.

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.630
So if we go back to Search,

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.400
notice how we're passing in Show
as one entire object, right?

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.376
But if would be kind of nice
if we could do kind of passing

8
00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:29.218
all of the,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All

9
00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:32.199
the different properties
as top level items, right?

10
00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.774
And also the same props.show.title,
that we could just say props.title, right?

11
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:40.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a couple
of ways you could do that.

12
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.054
You could totally just say
title = [show.title] right, and

13
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:51.506
pass in each one of them individually,
it totally would work.

14
00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:56.635
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's another way to do
this, and it's kind of an anti-pattern but

15
00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:59.950
I'm gonna show you how to do it because
I'm sure you're gonna run into it.

16
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.600
You can say ...show, so
this is called the object spread,

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.810
which is not yet a part of JavaScript,
or at least, let me rephrase that.

18
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.850
This is specific to JSX, but
it's emulating this object

19
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.750
spread operator which is stage three,
I believe, now for JavaScript.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.619
The array spread is a part of JavaScript,
but object spread is forthcoming.

21
00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:33.183
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just saying,
rather than me saying, title = show.title,

22
00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:37.245
description = show.description, it's
just saying spread all that stuff out so

23
00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.709
it's all top-level items.

24
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.760
So if we do this, in fact,
we'll just do it for now so

25
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.520
you can just see how it's done.

26
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.442
Now we get to go back here and
everywhere it says show like that,

27
00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.778
we get to eliminate.

28
00:01:53.162 --> 00:01:57.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now it just says,
and yep, that one too.

29
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.640
And rather than show being a shape, we're
just gonna delete that and delete that,

30
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.884
and now they're all top level items.

31
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

32
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:20.533
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, a place where I would
be okay using the spread operator is

33
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:25.130
when I know what the shape of
every single item is, right?

34
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.680
I know everything that's in that item.

35
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.617
The place where you run into problems,
and let's say inside of this data.json.

36
00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:38.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,
it's kind of already happening, right?

37
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.580
So we have this imdbID, right, that's
being passed down into our ShowCard now.

38
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.200
I guess it kind of was before because
it was kind of a tag along with

39
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.330
the show item.

40
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.210
But that's being passed onto the ShowCard
and the ShowCard does not need it,

41
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.950
which is kind of a problem.

42
00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:58.433
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a problem in
a sense of you're moving around a bunch

43
00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:02.283
of data that you don't have to, and
it's just messy, it's messy coding,

44
00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:03.925
it's not being very explicit.

45
00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:13.043
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in this particular case,
it might make sense to you to just say,

46
00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:15.352
actually go out and list each one of them.

47
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.778
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If there's one thing
I've learned over the years of coding,

48
00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:23.625
it's that usually being explicit is worth
it, even at the cost of writing more code.

49
00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:28.398
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So up to you,
we'll leave it for now.

50
00:03:31.163 --> 00:03:32.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that's what that looks like.

51
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.172
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But it sounds like prop
types is okay with extra attributes or

52
00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.057
properties.

53
00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:39.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah it's
not gonna complain.

54
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.711
So, we have a new thing here
kind of showing up, yeah.

55
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:51.621
Now if you did it that,
go back to ShowCard and get rid of shape,

56
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:53.853
so we can shut up the linter.

57
00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:00.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So cuz now we don't need
shape anymore, we just need string.
