00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go ahead and
go create some test specs for

2
00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:07.793
Ð°ctionCreators, since those
are easy to test as well.

3
00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:13.250
actionCreators.spec.js, okay.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.550
The other thing is you
can go into reduce.spec.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.540
This should be a flow document as well.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.582
No reason that it can't be.

7
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.667
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That shouldn't
cause any errors, so good.

8
00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go add
flow into this document.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.042
This is the actionCreators.spec.js,

10
00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:45.103
here we're going to import our two action
creators setSearchTerm and add API data.

11
00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From ' ../ actionCreators'.

12
00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:06.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So first one we're gonna
test here is test('setSearchTerm'),

13
00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:09.275
which is gonna be a function.

14
00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:20.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're going to expect,
if we pass it a setSearchTerm.

15
00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:27.802
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then say we pass it a search,

16
00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:30.234
and we've been using black
this whole time, but

17
00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:33.878
here in my notes I have New York, so
we'll just say that, New York, so.

18
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go take a look
at the actionCreator itself.

19
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.870
If we pass in New York here,
what do we expect to get back from it?

20
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.390
We expect to get back a well-formed
object of type set, search term, and

21
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.700
payload of whatever that string
that we passed in is, right?

22
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.610
Now, remember that jest has that
ability to do snapshots, right?

23
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.830
The only thing that snapshot its
just a json structure, right?

24
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.410
So like, our snapshots that were
generating through React is just a json

25
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.990
representation of what our
components look like, right?

26
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.160
Well, if we go in here to
our actionCreators, or

27
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.050
actionCreators.spec,
actionCreator.spect.js,

28
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.210
setSearchTerm is just going to
return a json structure, right?

29
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.832
So we can actually just say,

30
00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:37.779
toMatchSnapShot here, and
leverage that same ability.

31
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.940
So now, this json structure really
shouldn't change over time, right?

32
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.230
And if it does change, we wanna be
well aware of that's what's happening.

33
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.580
So to test actionCreators,
it's really just snapshots.

34
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.179
I mean, I could come in here and
say, to equal,

35
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.025
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: type: 'SET_SEARCH_TERM' and

36
00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:12.642
then payload,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 'New York'.

37
00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:17.150
I mean, that's fine too, but
why not leverage that snapshot ability?

38
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.992
So that's what we're gonna do here.

39
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:24.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
again we're gonna say yarn test, so

40
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.669
the first time it's gonna
create our snapshot.

41
00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.089
You can go in here and
actually look at our snapshot,

42
00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:36.134
actionCreators.spec.snap, and
we expect the first one to

43
00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:40.665
equal that particular objects that
we created with actionCreator.

44
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:44.823
What I like about this is, say decide that
later I wanna a different test case or

45
00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:48.855
maybe, no this is even better,
let's actually go into actionCreators and

46
00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:52.072
let's say we start using
the error ability of this, right.

47
00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:58.195
And I say error; null,
or something like that.

48
00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:01.706
Now it's gonna fail, right, yarn test.

49
00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:08.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This fails because here I
started adding this error ability, right?

50
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.640
But now it's really easy to update
if that's what I anticipate, so

51
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.729
I can just say yarn test:update, right?

52
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.810
So that's why I like the snapshot tests

53
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.770
is that they're really easy to
update as your app evolves right?

54
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.210
Your tests evolve with you, and

55
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.850
you don't actually have to do a lot
of extra coding to get there.

56
00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:30.050
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Coming back here and

57
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.929
say yarn test, and it passes.

58
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.041
As you might imagine,
going back to our actionCreator.spec,

59
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:42.850
actionCreator.spec, testing addAPIData
is going to be just as easy.

60
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.874
addAPIData, here we're
just going to say expect,

61
00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.178
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Put this on multiple lines,

62
00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:56.860
addAPIData.

63
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.628
And we're just gonna give it some
sort of API data of like 0.8.

64
00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:09.420
title, in fact, we could just
really grab this from data.json.

65
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.005
So we'll just grab Stranger Things here.

66
00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:18.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go back
to actionCreators.spec.

67
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.710
Just going to paste that right there.

68
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.302
And we're gonna give it a rating, because
that's ultimately what's coming back from

69
00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:30.535
the API, so "rating":, I don't know,
"8.6", something like that.

70
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.162
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here we'll
say toMatchSnapshot, and voila.

71
00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna say yarn test here.

72
00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:51.841
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now we have an extra
snapshot, so we can detect if something

73
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:57.580
happens with an API data if it drifts
in one direction or the other.

74
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.830
So if you look at the snap,

75
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.670
just to make sure that everything
looks like what you want it to.

76
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.050
payload, that's gonna be this object here,
and type is going to be add API data,

77
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.370
that's exactly what we expect.

78
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.037
So cool, everything is good, it all works.

79
00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:19.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
testing actionCreators is really easy.

80
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.600
It's a snap?

81
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.712
No, okay.

82
00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:30.450
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That was horrible, okay.

83
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.619
Any questions about that?

84
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.540
So this is why, again, one of the reasons
I really, really like Redux is it makes

85
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:44.890
testing these kind of micropieces of
changing state pretty ironclad now.

86
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.130
I'm guaranteed now that set search
term is going to create these

87
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.290
objects the way I anticipate, and
this is well tested, and I trust it now.
