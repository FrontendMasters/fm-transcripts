00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:04.623
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are gonna be talking
about styled-components which is kind of

2
00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:05.533
a fun thing.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:10.853
So let's kind of go off on a little
bit of a tangent, tell a story.

4
00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:12.949
[LAUGH].

5
00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:21.244
So writing CSS can be all the way
from really great to really un-fun.

6
00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:27.087
Depending on what kind of CSS you're
writing and what you need to do with it.

7
00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:32.010
We've kind of come up with all
these different tools like SASS and

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.842
LESS and post CSS that have kind of
been helpers to us to kind of get

9
00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:40.797
this rather undecorated
rule decorated language.

10
00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:46.021
To be a little more problematic,
allows us to

11
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:52.488
do all these different kind
of cool features with them.

12
00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:57.391
Well, some smart people came along and
said, well it would be really nice

13
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.917
if we could use JavaScript like
a fully turning complete language.

14
00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:07.650
Not that actually CSS is technically
turning complete, let's not go there.

15
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.070
But we can use JavaScript, and

16
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.350
then we could manipulate all these
styles programmatically, right?

17
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.520
And then rather than having to do things
like add classes and subtract classes,

18
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.490
we could actually just be
directly manipulating the style.

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.435
All these different things, right?

20
00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:24.422
It's opening the door for a lot of new and
interesting paradigms and

21
00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:27.674
things that we're just barely exploring.

22
00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:30.990
So we ended up with things like Radium,

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.614
was one of the first
big ones that came out.

24
00:01:34.614 --> 00:01:40.984
Then Aphrodite was another big CSS and
JS library that came out.

25
00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:46.731
And sometime afterwards we landed on
this one called styled-components,

26
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.423
which I think it's really fun to use,
for sure.

27
00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:55.511
And then there's two that have kind of
come out that have also kind of captured

28
00:01:55.511 --> 00:02:00.537
the consciousness which are glamour and
glamorous which are both amazing.

29
00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.951
In fact I know the author of
all three of those, right?

30
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.837
One of them giving from a masters,
Kempsey Dodds.

31
00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:09.083
He was instrumental and glamorous.

32
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:13.535
In fact, I think he literally
wrote the first version of it, so

33
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.479
all really, really cool awesome ideas.

34
00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.612
And I'm a fan.

35
00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:20.487
However it's become quite controversial.

36
00:02:20.487 --> 00:02:23.618
The reason being is that we're
deviating from the way that the browser

37
00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:25.114
has previously worked, right?

38
00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:28.786
Previously, you put your link tag that had
a separate style sheet that was downloaded

39
00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:32.369
and then, all these things could be kind
of eventually running parallel, right.

40
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.050
We're very optimized for that path,

41
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.665
because the web has been doing that for
20 years.

42
00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:40.722
I don't know how long has CSS been around?

43
00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:43.095
Probably longer than that.

44
00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:47.362
So yeah, we ended up with this CSS and
JS thing,

45
00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:52.180
which definitely has its drawbacks right?

46
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.120
Its drawbacks, for example,
with styled-components is that

47
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.170
you have these long CSS strings which
I'll show you here momentarily.

48
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.056
They get parsed twice, right.

49
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.740
They get parsed in JavaScript.

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.510
They output the style tag which then gets
powered by the CSS parts, all right?

51
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.930
They're paying double parts cost
which is not trivial, right?

52
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.280
For sure, it's definitely not trivial.

53
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.526
We have deviated from the optimized path.

54
00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:25.002
So these are all the things to keep in
mind when selecting how you wanna do CSS.

55
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:27.238
However, what I'm really bullish on,

56
00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:30.212
why I think these are paths
that are worth exploring.

57
00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:35.678
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is the idea
of tying your styling to

58
00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:39.858
your components is very
very promising to me.

59
00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:44.120
My favorite thing in the entire
world is deleting code, literally.

60
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.449
I just adore deleting code.

61
00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.090
Cuz when you're deleting code that
means things are moving forward.

62
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.012
Now you went from having this many things
to think about to having this many things

63
00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:53.828
to think about.

64
00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:56.480
And that's just a huge win in my book.

65
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.610
We're getting pretty good
at deleting JavaScript, and

66
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.070
we're being able to detect, like,
this file's never included.

67
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.430
You might consider deleting this, right?

68
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.940
There are ways to statically analyze
through JavaScript that's possible.

69
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.299
However, how often fo you delete CSS?

70
00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.220
I mean most people look at me like yeah,

71
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.831
pretty much never right because it is
really difficult to untangle that,

72
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:20.052
like this is you somewhere but
this is not you somewhere, right?

73
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:23.340
And you have like this crazy style sheets
that just going to be huge, right?

74
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.576
I remember recently, LinkedIn's CSS,
I think was pushing megabytes, right?

75
00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:31.572
Which is crazy.

76
00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:34.600
But it's totally understandable
how you get there, right?

77
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.730
Because once you write a rule,

78
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.300
it's really difficult to know
when you can pull it out again.

79
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.960
We're getting some new tools from Chrome
dev tools which are kind of letting us

80
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.080
see like hey, you have this CSS rule and
I never saw it called.

81
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.700
What's still difficult about this is that
it might be called in another part of

82
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.850
the website, right?

83
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.140
Super difficult to tell where
things are coming from.

84
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.433
All this trade to say is that if you are
doing something like styled-components,

85
00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:04.152
what styles component is it's going
to bring that styling inside of

86
00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:05.080
the component.

87
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.695
So if you never include the component,
you never include the CSS, right?

88
00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:12.360
So if you delete the component,
you delete the CSS.

89
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.330
Amazing.

90
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.370
I'm so excited about this for that reason.

91
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.780
And this is not the only way to
achieve this for sure, right.

92
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.557
There's things like CSS modules, so

93
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:28.674
I talk a little bit about them in V2
if you're interested in that, but

94
00:05:28.674 --> 00:05:37.280
you could do something like import,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or

95
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.844
let's just assume it's in the same
directory, ./ShowCard.css.

96
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.440
Right, we don't have this set up right
now, you'd have to do some more stuff

97
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.530
with Webpack to get this to work, but
what would be really cool about this

98
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.860
is that anywhere you included this file,
you would also pull along the CSS with it.

99
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.190
And it's also cool because I know
as soon as I delete ShowCard.jsx,

100
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.830
I know I can also delete ShowCard.css.

101
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.275
So CSS modules definitely one path
forward and I would say, maybe for

102
00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:12.808
production use, right now,
at this very moment, a better way to go.

103
00:06:12.808 --> 00:06:19.318
That's a Brian Holt opinion, so
take that with all the grains of salt.

104
00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:22.740
But I wanna show you how
to do styledhcomponents.

105
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.261
We're not gonna do it all day because
we'd spend a lot of time writing CSS but

106
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.605
we're gonna do this much of it, okay.

107
00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:34.797
So, I want you to go up here and say,

108
00:06:34.797 --> 00:06:41.733
import styled from 'styled-components'.

109
00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:50.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna create
a couple kind of elements here.

110
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.066
The first we're gonna do
is called Wrapper = styled.

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.867
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this syntax is new for a lot of people.

112
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:09.353
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what this is right here,
I have styled and then I have a back tick,

113
00:07:09.353 --> 00:07:12.450
right, and
then I have another back tick back here.

114
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.310
This is called a tagged template literal.

115
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.970
It is valid JavaScript, this is not JSX,
this is not anything but

116
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.130
pure JavaScript right here.

117
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.019
In here I can start writing some CSS,
just like you normally would.

118
00:07:32.527 --> 00:07:35.464
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Border: 2px solid.

119
00:07:38.881 --> 00:07:42.119
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll do border-radius.

120
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:49.064
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 4 pixels.

121
00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:56.356
Margin-bottom: 25px.

122
00:07:56.356 --> 00:08:00.901
Padding-right: 10px.

123
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:03.011
Overflow: hidden.

124
00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:08.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you might be asking what is this, right?

125
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.280
Tags template literals are still
not something widely in use.

126
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.590
They came with EXS, right?

127
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.030
So this is already valid
standard JavaScript.

128
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.580
A bunch of browsers even still support it.

129
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.450
What is happening here is we have
this template literal, right?

130
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.335
We've seen these before, these are
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What we were

131
00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:26.049
just using before.

132
00:08:26.049 --> 00:08:31.222
So if I said const color =,
I could totally

133
00:08:31.222 --> 00:08:37.730
replace this with
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Color, right?

134
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.940
So that would totally work here.

135
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.832
Cuz it's just a normal template literal
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm not gonna do

136
00:08:44.832 --> 00:08:47.767
that right now but
that's what that would look like.

137
00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:52.610
But this style right here is a tag on this
temple literal which means it's going to

138
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.906
be run through a function that's
getting called here, right?

139
00:08:56.906 --> 00:09:00.940
Or from styled-components, so it's
gonna be fed into styled-components and

140
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.660
what this returns is a react components,
right?

141
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.315
Sorry, and it's style.div.

142
00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:10.227
That's important.

143
00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:14.605
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what this style.div is

144
00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:18.306
going to return to you is a div
that has been styled like this.

145
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:24.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is pretty cool.

146
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.983
So now I have this wrapper component,
so I'm gonna replace

147
00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:33.875
this right here with wrapper,
and down here at the bottom.

148
00:09:37.684 --> 00:09:40.539
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
instead of having that encapsulating div,

149
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:45.700
now I have this styled-component that
I've pulled in from styled-components.

150
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.636
Cuz I guess it probably bears mentioning
if what's actually happening,

151
00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:50.160
like where the style's coming from?

152
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.060
A lot of people just assume
it's in-line style, it is not.

153
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.005
Cuz that's less efficient, but
it's actually going to do is it's

154
00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:03.516
going to create a style tag
somewhere on the page and

155
00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:07.599
then it's going to output this
stuff into that style tag and

156
00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:13.263
then it's going to get this div right here
a class that matches that matches that.

157
00:10:13.263 --> 00:10:15.950
Make sense?

158
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.930
And we can look at how that works.

159
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.877
So we're gonna do one more cuz we
need some style around our image too.

160
00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:21.947
So we're gonna say.

161
00:10:21.947 --> 00:10:22.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

162
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

163
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
we replaced the div showcard.

164
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.740
What is I wanted to keep that
class name within the wrapper tag.

165
00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:39.327
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

166
00:10:39.327 --> 00:10:41.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I would just add it.

167
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:42.755
Yep.

168
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:46.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think later
we actually have to do that.

169
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.878
I don't remember why, but yeah.

170
00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:50.530
For now we'll leave it
off cuz I forgot why.

171
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
is it babble that's interpreting that and

172
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.360
putting it into the CSS style tag.

173
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.994
How is it?

174
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.674
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's magic.

175
00:11:02.674 --> 00:11:05.765
[LAUGH] No,
it's the styles components library.

176
00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.549
It has nothing to do with babble.

177
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.520
I don't know what actual mechanism
it's outputting into the dom.

178
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.950
I haven't looked that closely at it.

179
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.730
But it's taking that and outputting it
to a style tag somewhere on your page.

180
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.590
The nice thing slash gross thing
about CSS is it's universal, right?

181
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.870
If you put a style tag anywhere
on a page it's all global, so

182
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.490
as long as it's on there
somewhere it will work.

183
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So could you forsee almost
like a webpack tool in the future that

184
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.870
would go through and
find all the embeded styles and.

185
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's already happening.

186
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.800
Styled-components doesn't have one.

187
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.660
It's on their roadmap.

188
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.480
I actually met with the creator.

189
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.510
Like week and a half ago in Austria.

190
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.590
And yeah, they just released
Style Components 2 last week,

191
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.490
which is what we're using today.

192
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.750
And I think for V3 or something like that
they're actually gonna do something where

193
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.590
they can actually separate it out to a
separate style sheet which you can include

194
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.230
and kind of get into that
more optimized cow path.

195
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.540
I believe Glamorous already does it.

196
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.972
Glamorous or Glammer and or
both will allow you to extract that CSS,

197
00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:21.883
make a separate file and
include it, which is pretty cool.

198
00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:25.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
that replaces SASS or LESS than.

199
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, totally.

200
00:12:26.902 --> 00:12:30.708
What's cool about this too it
automatically gets run through an auto

201
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:31.503
pre-fixer.

202
00:12:33.783 --> 00:12:36.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is really nice, so
you can just do like display flex and

203
00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:37.783
then forget about it.

204
00:12:40.081 --> 00:12:42.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're gonna do one more for

205
00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:45.214
our image tag which is
gonna be styles.img.

206
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:54.273
As you may have guessed, style.tag is how
you create that particular type of tag,

207
00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:59.888
and they have everything that's valid CSS,
sorry, valid HTML.

208
00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:06.948
Width 46%, float: left, and

209
00:13:06.948 --> 00:13:13.000
margin-right, 10px.

210
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.327
If there are things that you
like in SAS like lighten and

211
00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:22.033
darken and some of those things,
there's a library called

212
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:27.039
Polish which is a partner that
goes with styled-components.

213
00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:30.435
That will do things like lighten and
darken and

214
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.756
some of those other
SASS specific features.

215
00:13:33.756 --> 00:13:35.070
So now we have image here.

216
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:41.330
So I'm just gonna change this image
right here from img to image.

217
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.100
Everything else can stay exactly the same.

218
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.359
So now if we save that.

219
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.225
We come back here.

220
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:53.645
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This looks
like it's mostly working.

221
00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:55.678
Well, this doesn't look as
nice as it was supposed to.

222
00:13:57.965 --> 00:14:02.195
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's nice,
that's what I was going for.

223
00:14:02.195 --> 00:14:07.230
[LAUGH] Well at the next break
call figure out why those

224
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.730
CSS went wrong but
this should be look a little bit nicer.

225
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So is there supposed to be
an extra directory under the search one?

226
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.496
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think I messed that
up last time I gave this as well.

227
00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.286
Yeah, there needs to be a div here.

228
00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:38.243
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, hey,
it looks all nice now.

229
00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:42.632
[LAUGH] So
you just need an extra div down here.

230
00:14:45.338 --> 00:14:47.038
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Thanks, friend.
