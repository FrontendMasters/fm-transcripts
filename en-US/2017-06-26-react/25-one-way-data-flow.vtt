00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.356
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's talk about state.

2
00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:06.532
So what we've talked about
before has been about props,

3
00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:11.146
right, child passing down data
from the parents to the child.

4
00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:16.092
And something interesting and
useful to talk about that, is the parents

5
00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:20.888
can pass down data to the child, but
vice versa does not work, right?

6
00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:26.657
So the child, has no concept of who its
parents are, which is sad, I suppose.

7
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:34.688
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But it can't interact
with its parent, it can't do anything.

8
00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:38.090
The only thing it can do is
accept data from its parents, and

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.075
then do something with that data.

10
00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.802
This is called one-way data flow.

11
00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:45.458
That's one of the things that,
I'm not gonna say React pioneered it, but

12
00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:48.548
it definitely made that popular
in the front-end landscape.

13
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.670
And now, definitely, Angular and Ember
have adopted that into their frameworks.

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.112
And it's been good for
everyone all around.

15
00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:57.854
The reason why this is a really,
really, really good thing,

16
00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:00.449
it kinda feels like it's tying
one hand behind your back.

17
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.765
So does it, but
ends up being a huge net positive.

18
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.685
If the most parent is
having issues you can limit

19
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.757
the children that's causing the issue,
right?

20
00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:13.596
Because the children have no way to
interact with the parents, right?

21
00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:19.880
So the problem has to live within the
parent, that's what I wanted to assert.

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.885
So in our particular case, right?

23
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:28.082
If I have search and
maybe search is having an issue here.

24
00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:32.936
I can already rest assured that ShowCard
isn't causing any issues because ShowCard

25
00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:35.341
has no way to meddle with search, right?

26
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:37.207
That's the power of one way data flow.

27
00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:42.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is a powerful
thing that I think, Facebook

28
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:46.791
does really well in particular with
React and some of their other libraries,

29
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:50.803
is they really optimize for
debugability and maintainability.

30
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:57.654
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so this idea that you
can see a problem and eliminate entire

31
00:01:57.654 --> 00:02:04.142
swaths of your code where that problem
could not be is really powerful.

32
00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:08.037
Cuz you can start having an issue and you
just get to eliminate two thirds of your

33
00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:12.183
app and you're just gonna instantly start
looking within that one third, right?

34
00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:13.756
It's really, really powerful.

35
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:19.635
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's props,
that's when my data flow.

36
00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:21.940
It's definitely a core tenet of react.
