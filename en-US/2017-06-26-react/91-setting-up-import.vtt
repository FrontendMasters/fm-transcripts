WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.438
&gt;&gt; Brian: So I'm gonna need you to
go back to you double RC real quick.

2
00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:07.940
We have react-hot-loader/babel.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.893
And then underneath that we are gonna
have to add two more plugins right here.

4
00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:20.667
One of them is going to be babel-plugin,
&gt;&gt; Brian: -dynamic,

5
00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:28.742
-import-webpack
&gt;&gt; Brian: What

6
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:32.283
this is going do is that it's just
going to allow webpack to understand.

7
00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.493
&gt;&gt; Brian: No, that's the second one, so

8
00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:44.646
this is the second one,
the first one is this

9
00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:52.882
one babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import,
yep, that's it.

10
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.930
So the first one,

11
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.680
this one right here, just lets babel
understand the import syntax, right.

12
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.440
Without this, it just throws in errors,

13
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.464
like I'm seeing imports somewhere
I don't expect it, right.

14
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.550
The second thing is actually going to
translate it to something that web pack

15
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.000
understands, which,
if you wanna know, is require.insure.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.145
So it's gonna translate our impact.

17
00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.523
Import, import statements
to require.insure,

18
00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:20.958
cuz WebPack already understands and

19
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:26.000
knows what to do with require.insure,
but that's the old way of doing it.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.520
And we're gonna do it with
the brand new way of doing it,

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.818
which is import functions.

22
00:01:31.943 --> 00:01:34.056
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is a pretty
new way of doing imports, but

23
00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.290
this is actually the standards
way of doing it.

24
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.880
I think it's stage three,
if I remember correctly.

25
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.030
And a lot of.

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.220
I know the latest version of Chrome has
already implemented dynamic import.

27
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.210
I think it might be behind a flag,
but it's there.

28
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.530
So that's cool.
