00:00:01.044 --> 00:00:05.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How would you use Redux
with something like local storage?

2
00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:07.076
Have you done that before?

3
00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.935
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can definitely
dump your state to local storage, and

4
00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:10.859
then load it back.

5
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.100
So you can hydrate and
rehydrate from any number of sources.

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.601
There are plug ins specifically,

7
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:20.120
like I think it's called Redux Offline
if I remember correctly.

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.998
That will do a bunch of that stuff for
you.

9
00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:25.008
I'm not gonna show you here
because I haven't done it and

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:26.962
I'm not gonna improvise on the fly.

11
00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:29.418
But there's a bunch of tooling and

12
00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:33.750
libraries around Redux that
will do that for you, for sure.

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.331
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then with Redux, so

14
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:42.479
essentially, instead of
setState you're using dispatch?

15
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:43.754
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, that's astute.

16
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The interesting thing with
React which I have not shown you, is you

17
00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:59.048
can actually do reducers and actions and
things like that with React directly.

18
00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:04.029
So you can kinda treat React State as
if it was like a mini-Redux store,

19
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.449
that's possible.

20
00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.303
Cuz you can actually give
instead of giving React objects

21
00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:13.638
to update the state with,
you can actually hand it functions and

22
00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:16.865
those functions can be like reducers,
right?

23
00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:20.260
So that's possible as well.

24
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.852
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I've got a couple
of questions regarding flow.

25
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:32.076
So are we going to end up creating
a type definition for our state?

26
00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:36.714
Cuz right now,
kind of just evaporated what our state is.

27
00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:41.459
There's nothing that tells us
the shape of our state tree, right?

28
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.382
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, yeah,
no, I think sort of,

29
00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:49.011
I think is the answer to your question.

30
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:52.816
So it's smart enough to say
that this is a string here.

31
00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:55.997
And by setting the default state to
string, it's going to be a string.

32
00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:59.965
And so if we ever modify it from being
a string, it knows, it's like, hey,

33
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:01.021
you messed this up.
