>> All right, so now we're gonna start getting into putting all this stuff together and starting with authentication. So before we can actually like make the authentication form and put it on the page and do all that stuff, we need the API routes. We need the functions that call the API routes.

[00:00:17]
So when we submit the form, we can actually log in. So we're gonna move away from components and get into some logic, and we're gonna start working on some API stuff. So Because it's a form, it's probably gonna be what a server component or a client component.
>> It's gonna be a client?

[00:00:36]

>> It's gonna be a client, exactly. So how do you fetch data on the client? How do you mutate data on the client?
>> Fetch.
>> Fetch, yeah. Nothing changes there. It's pretty much the same thing for now. So that's what we're gonna do. So inside of our lib/api, go to lib, make a file called api and I'm going to make a function just like my notes here called fetcher.

[00:01:02]
If you've ever used something like SWR or React query, you know this is not new to you just abstracting away the fetch function so you can reuse it. Many times because it's kind of redundant to have to do all this stuff all the damn time. So we're gonna make our own fetcher that way we can reuse it.

[00:01:21]
So, there's no wrong or right right way to do this, this is just how I felt like writing it this time. I change it all the time. So let's do that. So I'm gonna say fetcher and make it take an object here. [INAUDIBLE] async. And it's going to take in a URL a method.

[00:01:47]
What else do I have here? Body and whether is JSON or not. So it takes a body and if it's JSON or not, what defaults is true? And all this is gonna do is wait, Fetch with the URL here with the method that you passed like so it was like
