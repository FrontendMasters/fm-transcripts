00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:00.755
Alright.

2
00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:02.389
Now, let's do sidebar.

3
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:11.328
All right, so for the sidebar,
I think we have most the stuff here.

4
00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:15.007
We have a logo but although we're gonna
use the logo, I didn't even upload it.

5
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:15.849
It's really bad.

6
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.041
So we don't need a logo.

7
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:21.913
I like try to make a logo with AI and
I was like, yeah.

8
00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:24.568
This kinda works but then I was like,
no, I'm not doing this.

9
00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:27.361
So if you want a logo,
go put your logo there.

10
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.999
We're not, I'm not adding a logo.

11
00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.529
We're just gonna,
that's part of the brand.

12
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.774
We don't have a brand.

13
00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:35.645
That's what makes us cool.

14
00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:39.912
Alright, so we're going to
import our card that we made.

15
00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:45.543
We're going to import image component from
Next.js we'll talk about that in a minute.

16
00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:48.170
Actually, I don't think we're gonna need
this because we're not using a logo or

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.674
this I'm not.

18
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:53.992
So we probably won't need that,
so and then our sidebar link.

19
00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:06.633
First thing I'm gonna do is I'm
going to make some links here, so

20
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.063
I can iterate over them,
instead of making.

21
00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:12.741
So in this case, I have four links,
instead of making four entries down here

22
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.853
in the JSX, I'm just going to make
one entry by looping over it.

23
00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:18.093
Always do that even for static data.

24
00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:21.696
If there's going to be an instance where
I'm going to repeat over something,

25
00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.169
even if it's over static data,

26
00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:26.852
I'm always gonna put it in an array I just
don't want to write it more than once.

27
00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:30.874
Because as soon as I have to change it one
time, or more than one time, I'm done.

28
00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:32.469
I don't want to do it anymore.

29
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.832
So I'm just gonna put it in, right?

30
00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:36.762
If it's only two things,
I'm going to put it in, right?

31
00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.311
And I'm going to loop over it.

32
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.522
So that's just how I am.

33
00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.155
That's just my thing.

34
00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.091
So I got my links here.

35
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:44.002
And they're just objects.

36
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:48.277
These are the links that we're
passing as you can see, like I said,

37
00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:52.717
If the icon is a name is a string,
if this was a function or a component,

38
00:01:54.944 --> 00:02:00.401
And we tried to pass this,
to a client component when sidebar

39
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:05.645
is a server component disk
this can't cross the network.

40
00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:11.848
This is this is logic this is this is
something that needs to be executed.

41
00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:16.932
It's not static data like the word grid so

42
00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:20.133
that's all we have this.

43
00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:20.914
So here's our links.

44
00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:22.424
We have a home.

45
00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:23.798
It's got the grid icon,

46
00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:27.339
got a calendar, it's got a calendar
icon profile for the user.

47
00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:32.683
And settings for your workspace or

48
00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:38.395
whatever and then just our sidebar,

49
00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:41.903
so sidebar like that.

50
00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:46.647
That's where it's a default sidebar and

51
00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:50.853
it's really just a card component.

52
00:02:50.853 --> 00:02:53.381
There's really not much new to learn here.

53
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:57.846
So I'm just gonna put this in here and
I'm just gonna get rid of my logo.

54
00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:03.584
I don't really need it and
we're just gonna loop over these links.

55
00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:11.585
&gt;&gt; You got sider bar line 22 and line 30.

56
00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:12.299
&gt;&gt; Nice.

57
00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:19.648
Thank you.
