1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.061
All right, so we left off with
the AuthForm which is exactly

2
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:10.035
what it sounds like,
it's a form that we can use for auth.

3
00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:16.799
So what we're gonna do now is we're
just gonna put it on the auth layout.

4
00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.481
And then that way we can actually,
well, so

5
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:24.339
what we're gonna do is we're gonna have
the AuthForm be inside of the sign in and

6
00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.112
register, which are gonna
be on the layout.

7
00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:31.349
And that way we can actually try to
sign in and create an account and

8
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.358
go from there.

9
00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:35.433
And then what will be next is
just finishing out everything on

10
00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:36.531
the dashboard page.

11
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:38.432
So let's do that.

12
00:00:38.432 --> 00:00:43.940
So what we'll do is we'll
import the sign in,

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.022
or I'm sorry,
the AuthForm into the sign in page.

14
00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:54.127
So if you go to app &gt;
auth &gt; signin &gt; page,

15
00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:57.787
we wanna import the AuthForm in here.

16
00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:04.068
So let's say import AuthForm from here,
Like so.

17
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:17.920
Like that, and then for the mode,
this one is gonna be signin.

18
00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:24.068
So we got that, and then for register,

19
00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:28.503
it's mostly the same,
let's open an AuthForm.

20
00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:30.555
So I'm gonna say register.

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.574
I'm gonna change the name of
this to register as well.

22
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:45.310
Good there?

23
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.640
Okay, so let's go check it out.

24
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.323
So let's run this, Is this [INAUDIBLE]?

25
00:01:52.323 --> 00:01:52.925
No, it's not.

26
00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:56.923
run dev, check it out.

27
00:01:56.923 --> 00:02:03.386
Go to /register, like that.

28
00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.843
I forgot to import the link
in the AuthForm, so

29
00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:09.157
I'm gonna go back and do that.

30
00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:11.283
Thought I did,
I must have deleted it or something.

31
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.029
I got that back in there.

32
00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:22.445
Expects a string, got an object.

33
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:23.400
Let's check that out.

34
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.766
So where would that be?

35
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:32.098
That is in the, In here, let's see.

36
00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:42.193
Content.linkURL, linkText.

37
00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:44.093
&gt;&gt; Is it the casing?

38
00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:45.647
&gt;&gt; It might be the casing.

39
00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:49.300
Let's see, yeah,
it's definitely the casing.

40
00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:51.987
I'll change it up here.

41
00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:52.956
I'll be smart.

42
00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.973
It's like we need TypeScript or something.

43
00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:02.397
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, there we go.

44
00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:06.747
Now we have this form here
where you can register,

45
00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:11.520
create a user, and
if you click here, you can sign in.

46
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.599
So this is how you toggle,
you just click this thing here.

47
00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:23.412
So I can tell right now,
the font is just messed up,

48
00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.138
it's not even using the right font.

49
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.900
So right on the go, I'll fix the font
cuz this is not, I can't do this.

50
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.333
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can't do this.

51
00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.588
This is making,
like I wanna peel my skin off-

52
00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:37.299
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

53
00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.738
&gt;&gt; Looking at this font.

54
00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:42.041
So we need to fix this font in the layout,
but that's fine.

55
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.239
That's fine for now.

56
00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.634
Any questions on bringing
in the AuthForm here?

57
00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:53.749
Or on these pages?

58
00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:58.085
Does it make sense why I made it this way
because they're basically the same thing

59
00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:02.567
and now you get this nice one-liner in the
server component which just feels good.

60
00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:03.900
But if you think about it,

61
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.786
all we're really doing is wrapping this
client component on a server page.

62
00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:11.141
Actually pretty simple.

63
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:16.191
So if you were like, look at this
page to see how things are loading.

64
00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:21.457
This whole background here is loading
pretty much immediately on the server and

65
00:04:21.457 --> 00:04:26.104
then this client gets shipped through
JavaScript and then it pops up.

66
00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:33.988
We could probably even push it further
to the edge away from the form.

67
00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:34.767
I don't know, I'm getting crazy.

68
00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:36.450
I think the form is as low as you can go.

69
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.603
Maybe you can go lower than that,
cuz that's where the event is.

70
00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:40.687
But there might be a way.

71
00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:42.590
I'll figure it out, not right now, though.

72
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.094
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about prefetch at link?

73
00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:48.133
&gt;&gt; Yeah, prefetch.

74
00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:52.762
So let me find example of that somewhere,
AuthForm I guess.

75
00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:00.401
So you could do prefetch here, like this.

76
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:04.961
Basically what prefetch does,
I mean, if you hover over it,

77
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.117
it kinda tells you but, what it'll do is,

78
00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:13.380
if you know there's a link that
someone's for sure are gonna click on,

79
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.369
they're gonna click on it, why wait for
them to click on it to load up that route.

80
00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:24.168
You can just put a prefetch prop right on
the link component to tell, which will

81
00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:28.915
hint at the browser to go ahead and
kinda make that request in the background.

82
00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:33.841
Because if maybe that page that you're
linking to has data it has to fetch

83
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:38.120
on the server, maybe it has other
requirements that it needs,

84
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.399
authentication requirements.

85
00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.819
Go ahead and start doing that stuff
right now, so when they click on it,

86
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:44.563
it's faster.

87
00:05:44.563 --> 00:05:45.720
It just loads up faster.

88
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.775
So I think Rails had something like this
back in the day when it was turbo links or

89
00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:53.479
something like that, I don't remember,
it's still a long time ago.

90
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.861
But it's something like that, you're just
doing that request ahead of time cuz

91
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.028
you're so sure that the user
is gonna click on this thing.

92
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:04.916
Maybe it's because that's
the only thing they can click on,

93
00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:09.877
but they can't do it until they finish
something, so you could do a prefetch.

94
00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:11.304
Or it's just like, hey,
we got all these navigations,

95
00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.291
they're gonna click on them eventually,
let's prefetch the navigations.

96
00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:16.662
There's many reasons why you would do it,
but that's basically it.
