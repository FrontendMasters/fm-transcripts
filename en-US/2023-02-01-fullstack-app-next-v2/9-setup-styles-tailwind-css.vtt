1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.352
All right, so now let's go ahead and
actually configure our global CSS so

2
00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:06.558
we can actually get things looking
the way they're supposed to look.

3
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:11.776
So if we go to our notes here,
we're going to use

4
00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:16.744
Tailwind CSS, we talked about this before.

5
00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:21.289
So to install Tailwind CSS is actually
we already installed it with NPM so

6
00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.490
we don't have to.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.767
Really do anything.

8
00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:28.780
We just have to add a config and
we got some more global stuff here.

9
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.489
So what you want to do is
you just wanna take this

10
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.293
global CSS right here that we have, which
I could walk you through, but basically

11
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.206
React or Next.js's router.

12
00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:45.947
Adds extra divs around scroll containers.

13
00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:50.010
This is basically saying, give us back
control of those scroll containers so

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.580
we can do stuff without this.

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.839
You can't get like full screen stuff.

16
00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:53.533
It's kinda weird.

17
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:59.603
This is the number one thing
that'll kill all apps, box sizing.

18
00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:00.385
Border box.

19
00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.796
These are gradients that I
made to go in the background.

20
00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.626
Here's our glass thing
that we already made.

21
00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:07.807
So you can overwrite that.

22
00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:11.966
And then same thing like before next year,
yes, adding extra divs and

23
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.953
giving it back to control for us.

24
00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:16.503
So it's going to copy all of that.

25
00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:20.404
If this thing well it doesn't
wanna scroll for me, so

26
00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:23.275
I'm just gonna have to do it like this.

27
00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:27.419
Gonna go here, go to global, and

28
00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:32.901
I'm just gonna put that
in there like that.

29
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.202
Scroll down,

30
00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:41.153
do the same thing, so

31
00:01:41.153 --> 00:01:46.661
just some CSS in there.

32
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:50.382
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And they were saying the filter that you

33
00:01:50.382 --> 00:01:57.412
had just filter, instead if you scroll
down, you now have backdrop filter.

34
00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:00.952
Cuz before you had filter and
that was actually filtering out the text.

35
00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:01.774
&gt;&gt; That was filtering out the text.

36
00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:02.353
Yeah.

37
00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:05.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now using backdrop filter,
it's doing the thing that you-

38
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.853
&gt;&gt; It's doing the thing that I wanted to.

39
00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:08.884
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.593
Yeah, that makes sense.

41
00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:14.381
It looked weird when I was writing it but
I went with it.

42
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:18.315
[LAUGH] So
yeah backdrop filter it makes more sense.

43
00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:25.690
All right, and
then now we need to set up our

44
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.869
Tailwind config which I
kind of already have here.

45
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.102
You don't really need it because it kind
of already knows where everything is

46
00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:39.546
other than like this app directory so we
want to set that up for the app directory.

47
00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:43.678
So what you want to do is just on your
root of your project you want to do

48
00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:44.845
Tailwind config.

49
00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:49.399
I also think there's an NPM or a command
to do this with a CLI would tell me I

50
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:54.254
just never use it so can't recommend it
what it is but I think they do have one,

51
00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:58.843
I just always just do it from scratch
because it's really not that much.

52
00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:07.711
So what we're gonna do here is like
a Tailwind config Did I spell that right?

53
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:12.481
Till when I thought it was like
a different color if I did

54
00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.888
Or was it tailwind dot config?

55
00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.586
Yeah Tailwind dot config.

56
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.572
I know there's an icon for that,
so when you don't get those icons,

57
00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:25.795
you know you got the file names wrong.

58
00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:30.267
So go to module dot exports because
we're back in JavaScript land and

59
00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:32.734
we're TypeScript in this file and for

60
00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:37.819
the contents we just need to put the file
names like this and actually we can hint

61
00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.020
at this JavaScript file to give us some
TypeScript if we do something like this.

62
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.227
So we can add in these comments and
then we can just say like.

63
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:47.937
To add type,

64
00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:52.263
which is like a TypeScript directive to
hint to the JavaScript that like, hey,

65
00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:56.672
here's a type that's made for TypeScript,
but we want to use it in JavaScript.

66
00:03:56.672 --> 00:03:58.425
That way we can get some
auto completion here.

67
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.464
So you can say, type, and then it's just,

68
00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:02.901
it's just like,
kind of like an import statement.

69
00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:06.601
So you'll say imports in
the way that I have it here.

70
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.005
Let's see.

71
00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:11.524
I just have it here I was copied.

72
00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:18.714
This is saying this type is
Tailwind CSS config type.

73
00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:22.824
If we write this in TypeScript, we could
just import that type but we're not.

74
00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:27.523
So for the content then we just want
to go ahead and add the gloves for.

75
00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:30.416
The files that have the components
that we want apply these to,

76
00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.216
which in this case is just going
to be like the app directory.

77
00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:36.530
And I think the way you do this,
it's going to be like app and

78
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.460
then you can do the glob the catch all,
then probably the extensions.

79
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.043
So in our case, TSX.

80
00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:48.007
We're only using that but
just to be safe, might as well do that.

81
00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:54.772
Might as well do that and might as well
do that too I guess, just to be safe.

82
00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:59.226
And we'll do the same thing for pages,
which we probably won't be using, but hey,

83
00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.187
set yourself up.

84
00:05:00.187 --> 00:05:01.692
And then we definitely
are using components.

85
00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:05.122
Like that.

86
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.025
Cool.

87
00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:11.735
And then for

88
00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:16.361
theme, really the only thing we really
care about here is gonna be the fonts.

89
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.958
So we're gonna extend the theme which
I believe until when just exactly what

90
00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.833
sounds like allows you to extend the theme
and not override it with something other

91
00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:27.000
value, which is if you didn't
put extend that's what happened.

92
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.905
We learned that out the hard way and
we want to change the font family here and

93
00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:37.966
what we want to change it to is
this CSS variable that we're going

94
00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:43.240
to set inside of our layouts so
we're just gonna say Sans and then.

95
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.871
We're gonna use this font like this,
font enter.

96
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:50.986
So if you've never seen CSS variables or
properties,

97
00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:53.840
that's what it looks like
when you declare them.

98
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.110
And we're gonna set this in a layout so
it just works.

99
00:06:03.484 --> 00:06:08.783
Okay, and the last thing we need to do is
add these directives to our global CSS.

100
00:06:08.783 --> 00:06:10.081
So let's do that.

101
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:16.114
Go to our global CSS at the very top.

102
00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:25.175
We'll just add those things
If line five looks weird.

103
00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:29.863
What this is saying is, apply this

104
00:06:29.863 --> 00:06:34.557
style to the Tailwind base layer.

105
00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:38.841
These are all considered layers Let me
say we're applying this to the layer

106
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:39.663
called base.

107
00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:49.781
Okay, any questions on that?

108
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:51.064
OK.

109
00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:52.660
Let's go see.

110
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.625
No, not this one of the great,
it's not the full one.

111
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.461
OK.

112
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.086
All right.

113
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:03.370
So we still got to add some costs
here because the whole one's

114
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.967
obviously messed up.

115
00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:08.385
Let's go check out the other ones.

116
00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:14.319
No we didn't do register
we did sign it right.

117
00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.273
I think we did sign it.

118
00:07:15.273 --> 00:07:16.595
Here we go.

119
00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:21.616
So it's not quite but we got obviously
Tailwind has kicked in, the glass

120
00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:27.392
stuff seems to be somewhat blurry, there's
definitely a gradient going on here.

121
00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:30.637
We still got a lot more CSS to write
when we get to the pages but for

122
00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.486
the most part Tailwind has kicked in
