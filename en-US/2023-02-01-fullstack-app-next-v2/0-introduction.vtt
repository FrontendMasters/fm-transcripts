00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
How's it going everyone I'm Scott Moss and

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.000
welcome to building a full stack app
from scratch featuring Next.js v2.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.374
This is the second version
of this course and

4
00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:12.647
the previous version we walked
through how to use Next.js to

5
00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:16.708
build a full stack app from scratch and
the subject of that app was Spotify.

6
00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.384
It was like a Spotify clone kind of
walk through and build a music player.

7
00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:22.496
It definitely wasn't feature complete, but

8
00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:26.069
I think we covered enough to kind of give
you the gist of how to build something in

9
00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.578
Next.js using all the tools
that it provides for you.

10
00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:31.514
Now, we're back doing the same thing, but,

11
00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:36.562
because Next.js was updated to version 13,
which uses React version 18,

12
00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:40.780
there's honestly like a ton of
breaking changes, new features,

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.298
all types of exciting things that we
can take advantage of that I think,

14
00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:50.119
deserves its own course on how to build
something fullstack so here we are and

15
00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.543
we're gonna do that again so
I'm very excited to walk through that.

16
00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:57.784
This course is for
anyone who has the desire or

17
00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:02.648
the want to build things in Next.js
obviously cuz it's Next.js,

18
00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:06.080
React, or
any type of full stack application.

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.368
So if you have any experience using React
or JavaScript or even things on the back

20
00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:13.640
end, you can do more stuff on
the front end, this is for you.

21
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.926
We did, or
we do have an intro to Next.js v2,

22
00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:23.280
which covers all the main topics that
we'll be actually using in this course.

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.639
So some of the new features like
client components, server components,

24
00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.118
The intro course goes in depth with that.

25
00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:33.282
So we will stop and
talk about those things.

26
00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:35.347
But for more detailed explanation,

27
00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:39.817
check out that course if you want to do
a deep dive but no worries if you haven't.

28
00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:41.593
I'll guide you along the way.

29
00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:44.729
And we're going to build something cool.

30
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.332
So let's do it.

31
00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:47.612
So if you want you can follow along here.

32
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:52.526
You're on the website full stack v2
instructions dot Purcell dot app.

33
00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:56.266
You don't have to, well, actually, for
this one, I do have a lot of code in here

34
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.911
that you're going to be able to copy and
paste to keep up.

35
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.324
But for the most part,
it's mostly just for me to stay on track.

36
00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:05.134
Otherwise, I'll end up building
a completely different app than what I

37
00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:06.064
intended on building.

38
00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:06.624
Thanks.

39
00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:09.812
So let me actually show you
what we're gonna be building so

40
00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:11.121
you have some context.

41
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:16.462
So in the last v1 course, we did build
a Spotify clone, which was pretty cool,

42
00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:20.397
I think definitely rip the design
straight from Spotify.

43
00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:24.320
This one I definitely struggled a lot
trying to figure out what to build because

44
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.466
there's some really cool apps out there.

45
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.711
Some of the candidates were like.

46
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:30.176
Twitter, because Twitter's,
like, crazy right now.

47
00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:32.213
So it's like,
let's just have everyone rebuilt Twitter.

48
00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:36.403
But it it got really complicated to really
find the things that I wanted to get

49
00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:40.933
across and the things that I wanted to
teach and also build something meaningful.

50
00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.350
So that got scrapped.

51
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.554
And eventually I landed on creating
this personal project management app.

52
00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:51.792
Because something I struggle with as
a professional adult is just staying

53
00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:55.290
productive and organized and
all the tasks that I need to do.

54
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.426
And I've probably tried 20 of
those apps over the last year and

55
00:02:58.426 --> 00:02:59.833
none of them ever helped me.

56
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:03.395
Me so the engineering me is like,
I'll just make my own and

57
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.300
then I'll be more organized.

58
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.501
So I decided to extend that creativity
to this course where we're gonna to make

59
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.718
our own project, task management app so
we can stay organized as busy adults.

60
00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:15.480
So this is what it looks like.

61
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.911
Here is the sign and page and
you can sign in here so

62
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.600
once you sign in you have like your
projects, you have your tasks,

63
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.149
things like that, and
you'll be able to click on the projects.

64
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:32.543
Go to tasks, create new tasks, things like
that and just going to be focusing on

65
00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:37.335
using the latest Next.js so things like
server components, client components where

66
00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.699
we can like load things in
individually and stuff like that.

67
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.221
So it's gonna be fun and

68
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:47.250
it's not gonna be an app that's gonna
be a hundred percent feature complete,

69
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.593
that would take more than the time
that this course is allotted for so

70
00:03:51.593 --> 00:03:56.465
I like to leave room at the end for you to
extend that to do whatever you want for

71
00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.347
you can think of this app is going
to be like a reference app for

72
00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:04.001
you to look back on and
be like I remember how I did that or

73
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.340
a playground where you can add new
features and look at what you did on

74
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.505
previous routes to Try to compare so
that's what we're gonna be making today.

75
00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:18.684
And I designed it myself,
not that it matters, but I designed that.
