1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.788
We last left off,
creating that glass pane component, and

2
00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.956
we're quickly gonna move on to
making our all through layouts and

3
00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:13.285
we'll actually try to render some stuff on
the page and see what our app looks like.

4
00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:16.235
So let's do that.

5
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:19.755
First thing is let's go to our code and

6
00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:24.265
we'll go to the app slash
auth slash layout, and

7
00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:31.857
this is where we're gonna make our root
layout for the auth root, root grouping.

8
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:32.817
So, let's do that.

9
00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:38.144
So, we'll say exports
default function here, and

10
00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:45.297
I'm just gonna call it like auth
route layout, something like that.

11
00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:49.329
The layout just needs to have an HTML tag,
like that.

12
00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:58.663
And then for the head, we already have
a head so we can actually just do this.

13
00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:01.352
And what it'll do is use
the one at the root here

14
00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:12.672
Was like a partial, and
then we need our body.

15
00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.587
And then because it's a layout,
it's going to have children.

16
00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:20.655
So, got to put children here and
you can do that but

17
00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:27.290
we want the child, in this layout
to be wrapped in the glass pane,

18
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.464
so we're going to import the glass
pane and wrap it in there.

19
00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:34.320
So let's do that.

20
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.947
So gonna say glass pane like that,

21
00:01:40.947 --> 00:01:46.648
and just wrap that like so.

22
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:50.945
Wow, I did the autocomplete
with a shortcut.

23
00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:52.374
That's cool.

24
00:01:52.374 --> 00:01:54.993
I don't know how I knew that.

25
00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:56.079
I didn't know it did that.

26
00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.184
I thought I was going to do the dot dot,
dot dot dot stuff.

27
00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.131
Awesome.

28
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:03.949
Alright, so we got that.

29
00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:06.916
And then there's, you know,
some styles that we can add to it.

30
00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:10.290
That's, it's not going to look like
anything because we haven't installed

31
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.449
tailwind but when we do,
it's gonna look great.

32
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.312
So we can go ahead and add those styles.

33
00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:16.450
So I was gonna say class name here.

34
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.127
And height of screen,
I think is equivalent to like, view,

35
00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:27.569
view height 100 100 view height, so
I'll just make it as tall as the screen.

36
00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.584
Same thing as the width, make this
as wide as the screen, and then I'm

37
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:38.543
gonna add this other one called rainbow
mesh, we're gonna add that to our global.

38
00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:41.330
And then we have another one here
that's going to be just some padding

39
00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:53.184
For the glass plane, we're also
going to add some class names and

40
00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:55.378
we're just going to extend the width and
the height.

41
00:02:55.378 --> 00:03:01.948
So we'll say width is full,
height is full, flex this.

42
00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.020
We're going to center it, so item center.

43
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:07.989
And justify.

44
00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:14.378
Justify center.

45
00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:17.373
So if we go to,
if we want to see this layout in action,

46
00:03:17.373 --> 00:03:21.899
we have to go to a page that triggers this
layout which will be either be signed into

47
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.189
register so I'm gonna go to the sign in
page and just make an empty page here.

48
00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.634
Export default function sign in.

49
00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:41.532
Cool.

50
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.044
Just a component that returns to anything.

51
00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:50.556
So, we can actually trigger
the layout rendering,

52
00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:54.392
we can see it see how bad it looks because
we don't have tailwind installed yet.

53
00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:01.767
Okay, so now we can just do NPM run, dev,

54
00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:04.749
we're gonna start this.

55
00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.464
Mine is on 3001.

56
00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:09.572
So I have the other app running and

57
00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:14.465
then I'm gonna go to slash sign in,
and there we go.

58
00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.419
We're at sign in.

59
00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.210
And if we looked at the dom,
you can probably see,

60
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.105
yep, there's the layout right there.

61
00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:25.995
So it's working.

62
00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:29.215
It just doesn't log anything
cuz we haven't added any

63
00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:34.730
CSS All

64
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.542
right last thing we want to

65
00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:44.791
do is import our global CSS so

66
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:53.122
we'll say import from styles global.css.

67
00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:56.743
Alright and
I'm gonna do the same thing for

68
00:04:56.743 --> 00:05:01.580
the dashboard one which is
mostly the same but plus more.

69
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.021
The dashboard just has a lot more stuff
in it, but it's mostly the same base.

70
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:10.653
So we're going to the dashboard one,
we'll go to layout.

71
00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:15.167
I'm just gonna pretty much paste that
in there, change the name to dashboard,

72
00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:19.824
Layout, root layout.

73
00:05:19.824 --> 00:05:22.344
Like that.

74
00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:26.507
This unit dashboard is when we start
making the other components like

75
00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:30.525
the sidebar and all the other stuff
we're going to add them here but

76
00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:33.920
for now it's mostly the same
until we get to that point.

77
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.301
And we can trigger this
by doing the same thing.

78
00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:37.756
So I can go to home.

79
00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:39.499
We already have page here.

80
00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:40.670
Just make a blank component.

81
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.478
Just gonna copy the one from sign in,
go to home, paste that in,

82
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.539
call that home, say home.

83
00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.405
So now if I go to, that one's,

84
00:05:55.405 --> 00:06:00.712
I don't think we added that to
the TypeScript, so we'll have to add that.

85
00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:03.745
So now if I go to,
actually I guess we gotta do it now.

86
00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:07.313
Let's go to tsconfig.

87
00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:09.680
Yeah, I just gotta add a path for
the styles.

88
00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.813
So now if we go to slash
home once this thing's

89
00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:29.850
loaded up, let's load up something.

90
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.903
Let's see what's actually there.

91
00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:35.805
Something's there.

92
00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:39.848
Yeah, it's there.

93
00:06:39.848 --> 00:06:42.929
It's just I don't know, the text is
a different color or something, but

94
00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:43.535
it's there.

95
00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:48.175
So that's the CSS, but we just want to
make sure it's actually loading up,

96
00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:48.981
which it is.

97
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:50.171
So we're good there.
