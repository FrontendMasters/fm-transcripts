00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.117
Okay quick little card component isn't
super easy it's probably not even worth

2
00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:06.005
going through but we need to make it.

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:13.258
So make a new one card TSX and
we can just copy it.

4
00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:18.438
There's really nothing new to
learn from this card component but

5
00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:21.083
it is very necessary for our app.

6
00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.019
It's using CLSX here again,

7
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.821
which again just literally just puts
these two strings together because I

8
00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:31.942
don't want to do backticks and
I don't want to use a plus sign.

9
00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:33.442
So I use that instead.

10
00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:47.424
Okay?

11
00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:48.400
Any questions on that?

12
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:54.081
Input, very much the same,
we got the input,

13
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:59.518
I don't think there's really,
actually, inputs a little different.

14
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.763
Let's see if someone catches this.

15
00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.361
We'll make an input one here.

16
00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.220
There's so many ways you can do this.

17
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.958
Okay.

18
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.257
Let's think about this one.

19
00:01:18.257 --> 00:01:19.688
There's really no wrong
answer on this one.

20
00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:23.694
So we just had a conversation about
when do we use client components?

21
00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:28.788
Well, inputs are things that
require interaction, no?

22
00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:35.016
Would this be a good example for
a client component?

23
00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:41.211
Yes, yeah it could be I mean usually
if you have an input it's probably

24
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:48.152
a control component where you have state
a hook on change something like that.

25
00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:51.790
And you could do that here but if you
notice I don't have any of that here.

26
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.499
It's gone, right?

27
00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.061
I've practiced the art of,

28
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:05.612
the zen of like moving everything
far away from components and

29
00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:10.219
trying to squeeze them down
at the smallest level.

30
00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.480
So I can almost never have
to use client components.

31
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.529
That's what I've been practicing.

32
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:20.720
So this input, although could
be controlled and have a value.

33
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.916
It isn't defined here.

34
00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.976
It's only passing as a prop so
it can remain a server component and

35
00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:30.384
push that responsibility somewhere else.

36
00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:34.407
But yes, if you wanted to
define your state hooks and

37
00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:37.973
your use effects and
bind all that stuff here,

38
00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:42.649
you would absolutely have to go
up here and say, use client.

39
00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.730
But I think that's the responsibility
of the form, in my opinion.

40
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.147
I think the form should have the state and
all that stuff and

41
00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:52.298
pass it into the input and
not the inputs themselves.

42
00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:54.698
Because then if you do that,
you actually like run into so

43
00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:57.609
many problems when you start using
multiple versions of that input.

44
00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.829
So I think that's
the responsibility of the form.

45
00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.252
So like a form is probably a component
that's always going to be a client

46
00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:05.074
component.

47
00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:07.062
I don't think that's ever going
to be a server component.

48
00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:10.795
Because why do you have a form if
you're not gonna let people like,

49
00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:11.871
interact with it?

50
00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:16.632
So and you can't really interact with

51
00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:20.660
it if it's a server component.
