00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.906
We should think about how our page is
loading up right now we have a few things

2
00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:04.412
on here.

3
00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:10.114
So we have this it's taking forever
to load because of the delay.

4
00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.580
So that delay,
then we have this component coming in.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.923
We kind of want to handle this delay
because we're about to add this task card

6
00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:20.174
on here, and that's gonna have
another requirement for data fetching.

7
00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:24.950
Although it's not blocking the page like
Good projects is it's gonna be more how

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.476
the greeting card is it'll just
render when it gets there.

9
00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:33.205
But that delay right there that strong
delay while it's loading, right here,

10
00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:33.850
this one.

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.838
Yes, we see the projects here because it's
cached, but it won't always be there.

12
00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.911
It's just because it's cached.

13
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.768
I'm gonna localhost and And whatnot.

14
00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:48.759
So we should probably set up a loader for
this page.

15
00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:53.597
So what we'll do is we'll
go to App Dashboard and

16
00:00:53.597 --> 00:00:56.550
then home right next to page.

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.770
We can make a loader or.

18
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.698
Loading dot TSX what what was that

19
00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:08.978
Why did it do that it just made a new VS

20
00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:14.082
code okay there we go that was weird

21
00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:19.538
I've never seen before I got to start

22
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:24.132
this thing over again, okay.

23
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:32.196
So all this is going to be is just your
classic loader whatever you want to put

24
00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:33.860
a spinner the word loading.

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.285
It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:38.813
I did make one for us and
we could talk about it, but

27
00:01:38.813 --> 00:01:41.338
it's mostly just using tailwind.

28
00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:43.385
So I'm just gonna pace it in.

29
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.076
And it's just a loader.

30
00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:50.862
It's just using the animate spin on a
circle with a dashboard sitting in a card.

31
00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:52.108
That's all it is.

32
00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:56.490
It's nothing crazy So
we have that now and for free,

33
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.145
if we just load up our page,
We should see a loader like that now.

34
00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.735
Right?
That's because the Projects we're

35
00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:08.698
loading in.

36
00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:11.750
And the projects has like
a two second delay or

37
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.905
whatever delay I put on the projects I
forgot, but that's why you see that.

38
00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:20.761
And then when we get in,
we see the greetings take four or

39
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:24.553
five seconds to load in because
I put the delay on that.

40
00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:30.056
All right so you literally get granular
control over what's loading and

41
00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:33.239
how it's loading and what's blocking and
what's not blocking.

42
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:43.295
All right And then for the task page,
I guess, forgot to put a,

43
00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:49.093
a slide for it in here cuz we
could just add it to the project.

44
00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.089
It's nothing really special.

45
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:56.258
So what we'll do is just
go to the home page,

46
00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:59.990
scroll down to where it says task here.

47
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.470
Get rid of that.

48
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.049
And you can just bring in a task card.

49
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.874
Export mine, I forgot to export my.

50
00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:22.628
There we go.
It was bring that in,

51
00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:27.627
it's safe and see if anything broke.

52
00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:28.182
Boom.

53
00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:31.787
There we go, now we got a task card.

54
00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:37.831
And remember this one loads
very similar to this one,

55
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:42.396
so we would need a skeleton for
that one or

56
00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:48.457
a shimmer if we wanna handle
the loading state for it.
