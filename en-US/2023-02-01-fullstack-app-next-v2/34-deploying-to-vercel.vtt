1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
For the most part, we've got a pretty
decent functional full-stack app

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.503
that covers a lot of use cases, when it
comes to getting data on the server or

3
00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:15.233
the client mutating dynamic routes,
and even how to make meshes.

4
00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:16.882
It's a lot of stuff in here.

5
00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.398
But one thing that's really important is
like we need to deploy this otherwise

6
00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:21.367
it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.920
If you didn't ship it, it's not real.

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.916
If you can't send a link to somebody,
you didn't do it.

9
00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.981
That's why I should tell all my friends,
send me a link or you didn't do it.

10
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:35.118
And a GitHub link doesn't count.

11
00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:36.704
It's got to be a deployed link.

12
00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:39.865
So we're going to deploy this.

13
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:43.666
The easiest way to deploy this, in my
opinion, would probably be on Versailles.

14
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.654
Simply put they made the framework
it's got experimental features in it.

15
00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.831
If it's going to work
somewhere it's probably there.

16
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:53.175
So we're gonna deploy it there but
I would imagine

17
00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:57.970
this is gonna work in other places like,
if not now very very very soon.

18
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.659
And then the easiest way that I think
to do this is to put it on GitHub.

19
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.052
That's the easiest way
to deploy ourselves.

20
00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:07.589
Just make a GitHub repo and
you can import it ourselves.

21
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:10.597
So I haven a git repo already.

22
00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:13.077
I just need to put everything
on my main branch,

23
00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.622
your stuff might already
be on your main branch.

24
00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:18.535
So I'm gonna go do that right quick.

25
00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.318
It's gonna make a pull request on GitHub.

26
00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:21.549
So much easier to do it there.

27
00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:31.628
I forgot which app it is, on mine I got so
many apps, I think it's this one.

28
00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:32.412
Yep there it is.

29
00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:39.439
So I'm just going to do this merge it
into my main my main is up to date.

30
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.030
Cool.

31
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.205
Okay.

32
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:49.384
And then I recommend going over to
Versailles and making an account.

33
00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:50.092
It's free.

34
00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:56.077
You could do all this for
free once you're in Versailles.

35
00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:57.501
Your account might look
different than this.

36
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:02.184
This is a team account that I'm on and
not a personal account,

37
00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:06.157
but I think a personal
account looks kinda the same.

38
00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:06.834
I think so.

39
00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:08.722
Okay.

40
00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:13.997
So, once you're here,
you just click on add new,

41
00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:20.165
go to project, And
this is why I say add it to GitHub,

42
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:22.961
because they let you import
from GitHub and it's so easy.

43
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:31.323
So I'm gonna look for mine,
I think it's this one.

44
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:33.285
I'm gonna import it.

45
00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.713
I'm just gonna hit deploy.

46
00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:38.065
And it's not going to work.

47
00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:38.960
It's going to break.

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.201
Anybody know why?

49
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:40.851
&gt;&gt; Database.

50
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:41.406
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the database.

51
00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:44.493
Like the URL, it doesn't have any
of the environment variables.

52
00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:48.049
If the database wasn't going to break it,
the cookie name was going to break it,

53
00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.215
the JWT secret was definitely
going to break it.

54
00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.555
So we got to add our
environment variables.

55
00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:55.302
So let's walk through that
while this is breaking.

56
00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:57.467
I guess we can just have to wait.

57
00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:58.963
We can also just cancel it.

58
00:02:58.963 --> 00:03:03.965
But while I was breaking what I'm
gonna do just so I'm what I'm doing

59
00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:09.590
is fresh with everyone else, we're gonna
go make a new database on railway.

60
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.923
So I'm not using my development database
for this because if you use a new database

61
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:15.643
because maybe you're using local
now you're using a hosted one.

62
00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:19.705
If you are using local, you have to use
a hosted database now so everyone has to

63
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:24.019
make a database on railway at this point
we're going to deploy, you can't link to

64
00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.296
your local host Postgres while it's on for
sale, so you have to make a database.

65
00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:35.353
So I'm gonna go back to railway and make
like my thirtieth user database this week.

66
00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:40.647
Provision Postgres, no they actually
charge me five cents that's how many

67
00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:45.788
databases I've made I've actually
had to pay money, that they gave me.

68
00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.691
They gave me a $5 credit so.

69
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:51.246
I'm going to click on my database,
click connect.

70
00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm just going to click
on that copy there.

71
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.846
Going to go back to Versailles,
deployed as we thought it would,

72
00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:02.431
or I'm sorry, broke during
deployment as we thought it would.

73
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.645
But it actually broke for
TypeScript errors and

74
00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:07.417
we'll talk about that in a minute,
didn't even get to it.

75
00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:11.026
It didn't even deploy and
then error out because of the database,

76
00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:14.773
because it just straight up just
died because of TypeScript ES lint.

77
00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:17.266
We're not going to go fix all these so
don't worry about that.

78
00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:19.142
So we'll I'll show you
how to get past that.

79
00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:21.792
But for now, let's just even
though it broke the deployment,

80
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.246
it's still created the project.

81
00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.341
So the project is actually still here.

82
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:27.637
So we can go into the project.

83
00:04:27.637 --> 00:04:33.926
I can go into settings,
I can click on environment variables and

84
00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:38.014
I can add my environment variables here.

85
00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:43.384
So database URL, paste in my value there,
add another JWT secret

86
00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:49.062
paste in my value here, it oesn't matter,
and then my cookie name.

87
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.272
And this doesn't matter okay,

88
00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:02.057
let's do that.

89
00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:05.505
Hit save environment variables,
and they're good to go.

90
00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.770
The next thing is we need to, for now for

91
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.037
the sake of deployment is just rid
ourselves of these TypeScript errors.

92
00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:16.631
We know we have shamed ourselves by not
using TypeScript to its fullest abilities.

93
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:19.119
But we're going to turn
off that type checking.

94
00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.378
So the best way to do that is to is
in the Next config, so let me see.

95
00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:25.580
So you can just do this right here and
the next config file.

96
00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.696
You can just say, yeah, oops, right here.

97
00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:38.121
You can say TypeScript.

98
00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:39.176
Ignore build errors.

99
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.936
So it'll still do types and
stuff like that.

100
00:05:46.936 --> 00:05:50.082
It just won't send out a process.exit 1,

101
00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:54.174
which is what causes errors
when it sees a types of error.

102
00:05:54.174 --> 00:05:57.426
It'll still just let you know it's there,
though.

103
00:05:57.426 --> 00:05:58.856
OK, so we'll do this.

104
00:05:58.856 --> 00:05:59.797
Commit this back.

105
00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:00.636
I'm going to push it back.

106
00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:02.089
Whoops, let me get to me

107
00:06:17.137 --> 00:06:17.896
Still there?

108
00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:18.918
Nope.

109
00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:25.759
All right, it's hitting this.

110
00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:32.705
And I'm just gonna push this back up,
which is gonna trigger or

111
00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:33.940
rebuild on Versailles.

112
00:06:35.073 --> 00:06:35.741
Okay.

113
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:36.689
That got pushed up.

114
00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.736
If we go back to Versailles,
we click on deployments.

115
00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:46.293
You can see it's building right now and

116
00:06:46.293 --> 00:06:50.029
we'll see if this works or not.

117
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:55.167
So it should go through deployment and
I'm just gonna spoil it right now.

118
00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.475
It's still not gonna work.

119
00:06:56.475 --> 00:06:57.233
Anybody know why?

120
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:02.595
There's one thing that we forgot to do.

121
00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:05.605
Actually the build still failed.

122
00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:12.667
I don't know why.

123
00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:13.735
Is this ES lint now?

124
00:07:17.128 --> 00:07:23.726
Yeah, this is ES lint, I forgot,
how do we how do we ignore ES lint?

125
00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:26.251
Look, it's another one.

126
00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:27.894
Let's do that.

127
00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.697
But yeah, other than that
anyone know why this is it?

128
00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:34.492
This should fix the deployment but the app
will probably crashed anybody know why?

129
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.128
&gt;&gt; There's no index.

130
00:07:39.128 --> 00:07:41.379
&gt;&gt; There's no index what?

131
00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:42.455
Like index page?

132
00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:45.450
&gt;&gt; No route page.

133
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.850
&gt;&gt; No, because we have
the middleware there that redirects.

134
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.423
So should be good.

135
00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:50.720
Good thought though.

136
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:56.339
I'll give you a hint, it has nothing
to do with the database migration,

137
00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:58.834
how to migrate, the database
knows nothing about the schema.

138
00:07:58.834 --> 00:07:59.721
&gt;&gt; Blank schema.

139
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.801
&gt;&gt; It's just it's just
a brand new database.

140
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:04.664
&gt;&gt; So is there a command line?

141
00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:05.318
&gt;&gt; Yep.

142
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

143
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.313
&gt;&gt; So the way that I'm going
to show you how I do it.

144
00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:14.439
So I'm just going to do it right here, I'm
going to go to my env file here locally.

145
00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.718
It's going to just comment
that out right click.

146
00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:19.886
I'll make a new one.

147
00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:23.693
I'm going to get my connection
string from railway.

148
00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:27.685
We're going to add it here.

149
00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:35.167
And then right on my terminal I was
gonna say MPX Prisma migrate deploy and

150
00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:40.565
that's just going to deploy
this to the database and

151
00:08:40.565 --> 00:08:44.858
production it's going to run through all

152
00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:50.763
the migrations And there we go.

153
00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.719
Now, our database is in sync.

154
00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:56.109
So you're gonna tie this into
a workflow with your PR,

155
00:08:56.109 --> 00:08:59.795
you just don't wanna run this
on someone's computer, but

156
00:08:59.795 --> 00:09:05.613
this is the initial commit, so, then I'll
just go back to my development database.

157
00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:09.296
Okay so,
it looks like it deployed finally, so

158
00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:14.650
we got past those errors, and
looks like it's, yeah, there it is.

159
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.641
It got redirected to the sign-in page.

160
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:18.265
So, we're in the sign-in page.

161
00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:23.265
Sign in's not gonna work cuz there's no
seated database or no seated user, so

162
00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:26.543
we have to sign up, and
let's just see if this works

163
00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:38.783
Tried to do that and
it looks like it's working.

164
00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:42.994
They're just, we're just not gonna
have anything and I don't know if

165
00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:47.498
we handle any errors for any of this
stuff not being there, but there you go.

166
00:09:47.498 --> 00:09:49.831
There you go.

167
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:55.848
So if I try to create a new project,
I can say my new project, and create that.

168
00:09:55.848 --> 00:09:59.454
Remember, that's not going to show
up until we hit that refresh button.

169
00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:05.045
We should have a new project
five seconds later, there we go.

170
00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:05.692
So there you go.

171
00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:06.529
Now, it's deployed.
