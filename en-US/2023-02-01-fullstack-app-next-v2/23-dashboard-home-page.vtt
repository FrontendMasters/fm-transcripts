00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.755
Auth is cool, but like I said,
it's really hard, it's so hard.

2
00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.929
But I think Next.js makes
it easy in my opinion.

3
00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:08.967
It's still hard to think about,
but it does make it easy.

4
00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:16.075
Okay, so now, that 404 we got for
the home page, let's have it,

5
00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:20.444
so it's not a 404 anymore,
so let's finally fix it.

6
00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:25.383
Here I just have the code for the homepage
where it's pretty much just the layout,

7
00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:27.754
there really isn't anything in here.

8
00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:31.878
At this point,
it's just HTML with some tailwind CSS.

9
00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:35.434
And then we're gonna go and we're gonna
fill all the dynamic bits that go into it.

10
00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:40.198
So just to give you a reminder
what the homepage looks like,

11
00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.261
I'm gonna run the complete app here.

12
00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:50.305
So basically this is the homepage,
we have this dynamic greeting card.

13
00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:56.575
This thing loads in from the server and
it needs access to your name,

14
00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:01.209
right, because how else
would it know your name?

15
00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.426
So it has to figure out how to
get your name, it needs data.

16
00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.401
So this is probably gonna
be a server component.

17
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.882
All these projects here load up,
they're clickable.

18
00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:12.629
You can go to a project page and you can
also create a new project like this.

19
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.703
This is on the client side, so this is
probably a client component, right?

20
00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:19.305
And then we have this task list here
that just shows you all your tasks.

21
00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.167
And If you click on one of these projects,

22
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.425
it should take you to where you can see
all the tasks for that one project.

23
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.217
All this other stuff here,
we will not be doing,

24
00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:28.115
this is no way we're gonna
get all this stuff done.

25
00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:29.668
I don't even know what
these are gonna be for.

26
00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:31.492
I just put icons there and it's like,

27
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:34.004
you guys can go crazy on
whatever you want that to be.

28
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.872
This could be all your tasks
plotted on the calendar.

29
00:01:37.872 --> 00:01:39.782
This could be all the settings for
your accounts, and

30
00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.190
this could be the settings for the app.

31
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.223
I think that's what the intention was.

32
00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:45.598
But for the most part,
we're just gonna focus here.

33
00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:50.047
And the reason I kinda did it this way is
because each one of these has a different

34
00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:53.621
rendering mode and a different
technique for fetching data and

35
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:56.331
a different technique for
loading, each one.

36
00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.405
And they're all gonna be on the same page,
which I think is so powerful.

37
00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:03.858
So that's why we're gonna
walk you through like this.

38
00:02:05.982 --> 00:02:08.082
So if you go to the notes, like I said,

39
00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:12.506
you can just pretty much copy this,
there's literally nothing going on here.

40
00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:15.342
If you look at it,
there's no interpolation anywhere,

41
00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:17.007
there's no handlers anywhere.

42
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.015
It's basically just HTML and
CSS for this homepage here, so

43
00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:26.448
feel free to just copy this and paste it,
there's nothing special going on here.

44
00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:30.841
So that will be inside of app, dashboard,

45
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:35.730
home, page.tsx, that's what that's for.

46
00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:44.830
So this should be good.

47
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.381
I have this import up here for
a delay inside of a file called async.

48
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:50.824
We haven't made it, so we can make it now.

49
00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.435
But basically it's a file that I
made to just delay API calls so

50
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.909
we can overexaggerate how long
it would take to get data, so

51
00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.078
we can actually see a loading state.

52
00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:05.219
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
make that right quick

53
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.371
inside a lib, call it async,
export const delay,

54
00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:15.903
Takes in some time, returns a Promise,

55
00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:22.682
That has a callback and resolves, and

56
00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:27.548
it just does a setTimeout for
that set amount of time.

57
00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:35.202
And it just resolves literally anything,
we're never gonna use it.

58
00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:37.822
So that way, we can just
actually see the loading states,

59
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:41.568
because I think it's really cool to see
things pop in whenever they're ready while

60
00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:42.815
other stuff is rendering.

61
00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:46.535
So we'll have to slow things down to
be able to see that on local host, so

62
00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:47.849
that's why I have that.

63
00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:52.306
Okay, there we go.

64
00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:59.837
And why is this, yeah,
I guess it's just lagging behind.

65
00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:04.264
I don't know why I can't find it, but
I'll just comment it out until we use it.

66
00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:06.073
Okay, so now we have our page here.

67
00:04:06.073 --> 00:04:13.428
If you go here, you should see something,
so let's see, which am I on?

68
00:04:13.428 --> 00:04:17.208
I'm on here, so we gonna go to /home, and

69
00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:21.311
it should look like this,
with nothing on it.

70
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:24.231
I actually have a different
gradient color for the home.

71
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.427
If you want it, you can apply it.

72
00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:29.819
I think that one's called candy-mesh,

73
00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.716
cuz I was eating candy when I made it.

74
00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:40.028
[LAUGH] You could apply it
to the dashboard layout.

75
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:45.621
Instead of rainbow-mesh, you could
play candy-mesh, you can get that one.

76
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:50.612
And it looks like that,
if you just want it to be different.

77
00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:55.786
And these meshes are called,
yeah, they're called meshes,

78
00:04:55.786 --> 00:04:59.409
they're just a bunch of radial gradients.
