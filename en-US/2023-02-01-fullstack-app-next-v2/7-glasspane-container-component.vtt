WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Before we can start building out some
of those pages let's get warmed up and

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.767
build out some of these components
first that we can kind of get ready for

3
00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:08.603
all the things that we're going to do.

4
00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:13.183
So like I said in this course we're
not going to be writing CSS from

5
00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:15.695
scratch we'll be using Tailwind.

6
00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.858
Luckily for you,
I got all the Tailwind classes here, so

7
00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.758
you don't have to go look them up and
figure them out, they're right here.

8
00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:23.112
They're all in the right
order that they need to be.

9
00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:25.077
So we're just gonna use these.

10
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:30.210
So the first one that we are gonna make is
this glass pane, is what I'm calling it.

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.028
So if we go back and look at the app
one more time, is this the app?

12
00:00:36.028 --> 00:00:38.262
This is the app.

13
00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:42.097
If we go back here and look at the app,
it's like this frosted diffused thing.

14
00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:45.513
That's the glass pane.

15
00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:50.238
So we're gonna go make that a component so

16
00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:53.480
we can reuse it everywhere.

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.028
Obviously, it's essential to the app.

18
00:00:55.028 --> 00:00:58.379
It's everywhere, if I go to slash home,
it's here so we're gonna make that and

19
00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.008
kind of get our feet wet with
making a regular React component.

20
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.866
And then we can talk about whether or
not if that component should be clients or

21
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.473
server.

22
00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:07.316
I don't know.

23
00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:09.308
It's like it might be hard to answer.

24
00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:13.302
It might not be as easy as you think,
so let's do that.

25
00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:17.716
Where are we going to make that?

26
00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:18.637
&gt;&gt; The components?

27
00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:19.735
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're making the components.

28
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:24.599
What do you think would happen if
I tried to make it here in an app?

29
00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.358
&gt;&gt; It won't work because it needs a page?

30
00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:31.554
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
you would think it would work that way.

31
00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:33.556
[LAUGH] It actually would work,

32
00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:37.254
you could put you could put
anything in an App Directory.

33
00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:40.790
It's just if you want a page
that has to be called page but

34
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.868
you can put CSS in here,
you could put other components in here.

35
00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:48.752
In fact I think next.js is encouraging
people to do that, they're encouraging

36
00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:52.822
people to like, if you have stuff, just
throw it in here and group it together.

37
00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:55.100
So for instance, for the case of like,

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.176
if I had components that I needed for
this layout, I could make them and

39
00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:02.168
just put them in this off
folder next to the layout.

40
00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:04.463
I could put the CSS for
this layout in this off folder.

41
00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.550
And it's fine, it'll totally work.

42
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.368
As long as you don't use those
keyword file names like layout, error,

43
00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.758
loading, page, template, it'll still work.

44
00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:17.405
So, to me it looks messy.

45
00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:19.675
I don't like it, like just stuff
just floating out there and

46
00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.539
not unfold because then you start adding
folders of a mess up the route path.

47
00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.185
So I think it can get really messy people
like, well, let's organize all the CSS and

48
00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:31.820
in the off in a folder in here and
then now you made a route.

49
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.476
And you thought you were
just organizing CSS files.

50
00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:37.485
So I typically just get out of the app
directory for not making pages,

51
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.090
go do that somewhere else.

52
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.904
So, we'll do that and the components.

53
00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:42.908
So let's do that.

54
00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:48.381
New File, GlassPane.tsx like that.

55
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.558
It's gonna be some interesting
CSS stuff that I found out that

56
00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:54.093
thing is really cool.

57
00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:55.209
We'll see some of them here.

58
00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.024
But for the most part,
it's gonna be a traditional components so

59
00:02:58.024 --> 00:02:59.007
it's nothing crazy.

60
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.338
So the first thing we need to
do is just make a component.

61
00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:03.950
So I call this glass pane.

62
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.813
Set it to a handy dandy functional
component, nothing crazy.

63
00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:10.747
Return a div.

64
00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:12.844
Pretty simple.

65
00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:15.948
And then what we want to do is this
pane is a wrapper around stuff.

66
00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:17.760
It's almost a layout in itself.

67
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.132
So it needs to be able
to render its children.

68
00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:25.676
So we'll get access to those children like
that, so we'll put them in here, there we

69
00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:30.916
go, nothing crazy, and then the last thing
we need to do is just add some styles.

70
00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.866
So, we could do className, and

71
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.491
this is where we're gonna add
in all of our Tailwind stuff.

72
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:41.252
So if you look at the notes, I have all
the Tailwind styles there, but I also

73
00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:46.259
want to be able to extend this glass pane
so you can pass in your own class names.

74
00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:51.769
So I'm going to say this thing can take
in a class name as well like that.

75
00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.118
So this is where you can
write all your classes and

76
00:03:54.118 --> 00:03:56.305
then I don't know how
people would do it now.

77
00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.981
Do you guys just interpolate?

78
00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.697
Do you do back ticks?

79
00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.681
I hate writing class names.

80
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:06.955
So I use this package called CLSX.

81
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:11.223
Like this, you should have it installed
already if you did the package json

82
00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:13.877
earlier if you don't
feel free to install it.

83
00:04:13.877 --> 00:04:18.002
And I mean it doesn't really do anything
crazy other than like string manipulation.

84
00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:22.727
So it just helps you write compose
classes better in my opinion.

85
00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:25.505
So I'm gonna say clsx like that.

86
00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:32.129
And for the first argument,
I'm just gonna pass in all of my

87
00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.430
Tailwind classes which
are gonna be rounded and

88
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.601
then we have rounded2xl and
then we're gonna do border solid.

89
00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:47.651
I have what's this border to?

90
00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.379
And then we have border-gray 200.

91
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.854
Something like that.

92
00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:02.734
And then after this,
I'm gonna say className.

93
00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.606
And this thing's freaking out because it
really wants me to export something so

94
00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:07.952
let me go ahead and do that.

95
00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:09.550
Wait, wait.

96
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.295
I have an extra.

97
00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:13.087
There we go.

98
00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:15.578
One too many.

99
00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:20.583
Wait, where is this thing?

100
00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:23.219
Do I have one extra one here?

101
00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.188
Let me clean that up.

102
00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:27.268
There we go.

103
00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:30.016
Okay, there we go and then we export this.

104
00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:38.682
All right, and

105
00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:43.546
now we have a GlassPlane.

106
00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:48.188
The last thing we need to do is, there's
gonna be a global style that we need

107
00:05:48.188 --> 00:05:51.003
because Tailwind doesn't have like a blur.

108
00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:52.471
It doesn't have this effect.

109
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.054
I didn't see it anywhere.

110
00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:56.153
I don't really use Tailwind that much,
so I don't know if it does.

111
00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:57.346
So I just made it myself.

112
00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.753
And we're just gonna add
that to the global CSS and

113
00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:01.481
then we can just add the glass here.

114
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:05.701
So I'm just gonna call it glass,
like that.

115
00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:10.172
And then you can go into styles,

116
00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:16.138
make a new file called global, like that.

117
00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:17.341
And you can say glass.

118
00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:28.783
And then we're going to use filter and
then we can say blur.

119
00:06:28.783 --> 00:06:35.891
And I don't remember the exact number but
we can tweak it maybe blur like 16 pixels.

120
00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:37.609
And then we can say saturate,

121
00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:41.678
saturate just makes it more vibrant
when it's underneath the glass.

122
00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:45.820
So I don't know you wanna
go crazy you can do 200%.

123
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.879
Let's go crazy.

124
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:47.501
I don't know.

125
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.469
See what happens.

126
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:57.661
So that's glass and because it's global,
we can just add it there, right?

127
00:06:57.661 --> 00:07:00.474
So that's fine.

128
00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.051
Cool.

129
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:03.708
Regular React component.

130
00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:05.216
Nothing special about it.
