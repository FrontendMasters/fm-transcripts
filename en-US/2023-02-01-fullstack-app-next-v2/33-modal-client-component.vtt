WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.716
So then we need to kind of build a UI for
this thing and hook it up.

2
00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:06.881
So finally, a client component.

3
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:11.243
So we're gonna use a modal, we're gonna
make a modal pop up where you can type

4
00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:15.623
in the new project name, hit create,
it creates the project, it goes away.

5
00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:17.215
It's not gonna show up on the screen for

6
00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.780
the reasons we just talked about
until you do a refresh though.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.144
So remember that.

8
00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:22.873
So let's do that.

9
00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:25.721
We're gonna go and
make a client component.

10
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:30.991
And we can just call this I mean call it

11
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:36.772
whatever you want I'm just gonna call it

12
00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:43.249
new projects inside the components folder.

13
00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:50.815
And I think if we're going to need to
have to install something here I have so

14
00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:56.235
many things running go we
got to install react modal.

15
00:00:56.235 --> 00:01:01.378
So MPM install React Modal.

16
00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:06.145
And for our imports,

17
00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:11.264
we're just gonna bring these in I
think once the types I'm telling you

18
00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:16.553
it used to do this I don't know why
it's not I feel like it's early days of

19
00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:22.243
TypeScript again where they're making
me doubt these types all over again.

20
00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:26.131
So we got our create new
project that we just made,

21
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:29.657
usse state this React modal or
button input.

22
00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:33.707
First thing first is for React modal.

23
00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:40.115
We have to set a portal, basically,
if you don't know what a React portal is,

24
00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:47.124
it's basically by default, everything in
React renders underneath the same tree.

25
00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.267
A portal is like, I wanna render,
you can render anywhere.

26
00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:51.846
It doesn't have to be
part of your React app.

27
00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:54.028
You can render in any div anywhere.

28
00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:55.460
So that's basically what a portal is.

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.213
And it's great for modals because modals
are usually, you know, created and

30
00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:06.109
rendered somewhere down the tree,
but they need to be on the root.

31
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.086
So, we can create a portal for a model
that we created nested in our app, but

32
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:14.799
have it render all the way out
here where the body tag is,

33
00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.863
which is exactly what we want.

34
00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:17.987
So, we'll do that.

35
00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:21.409
But in order to do that, we need to go
to our layout file and our dashboard.

36
00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:27.190
So, dashboard layout, and
we need to add a div in here somewhere so

37
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.148
I'm going to add a div underneath
the glass pane with an ID

38
00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:35.890
of modal like that and
just leave it empty.

39
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.790
We need that target there for,
this is where a modal is gonna render.

40
00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:48.849
Okay, so we're going to do that.

41
00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.440
Oops, I thought I had that copied.

42
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.525
There we go.

43
00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.358
So modal that set element, id of modal.

44
00:02:56.358 --> 00:03:01.908
And then we could just make our
new project component here,

45
00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:05.682
which is your classic React component so

46
00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:09.568
let's make sure I get those names right.

47
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:15.405
This is gonna do all types of form stuff
all the stuff that you're used to.

48
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:18.938
Alright so we got the new projects here.

49
00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:22.727
We need to get some state that's going
to keep track of the modal opening and

50
00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:25.144
closing and
make some helper functions for it.

51
00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:26.461
And then we need to make some state for

52
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:28.982
the form that's going to keep track
of the name that we need to submit.

53
00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:29.707
So let's do that.

54
00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:36.212
So we'll say const isModalOpen and
then setIsOpen.

55
00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.223
Because you states, default to false.

56
00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.887
Make some helper functions here.

57
00:03:45.887 --> 00:03:49.315
Close modal.

58
00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:55.894
Equals set Is open to false.

59
00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:57.744
openModal is the opposite.

60
00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:02.126
There we go.

61
00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:06.792
And then name, set,

62
00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:10.169
name, state.

63
00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.250
String.

64
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.854
All right, got those.

65
00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:13.724
I'm gonna move that up there.

66
00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.300
And then from there, we need to make a
function to handle the submit of our form.

67
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.951
So we'll do that.

68
00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:25.342
And it's just gonna call our new
project and close the modal.

69
00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:26.389
So nothing crazy.

70
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.299
So handle.

71
00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:35.916
Submit.

72
00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:37.348
And prevent that default.

73
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:39.713
Otherwise, our screen will reload.

74
00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:45.556
Wait.

75
00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:49.119
Create new project with our name.

76
00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:50.548
And then close the model.

77
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:05.411
And then lastly, we can put our JSX in
here, which really isn't a lot going on.

78
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.187
So I'm mostly just gonna copy this and

79
00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:14.381
we can talk about it like always so
much style stuff.

80
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:19.682
Okay So
one thing is I need to rename this,

81
00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:24.672
at least mine is isModalOpen some rename
mine because that's what I called it

82
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:28.763
up here there's my be different
if you copied it from the code.

83
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.032
Let's follow what's going on here.

84
00:05:30.032 --> 00:05:33.083
So first we have a button that you can
click on it opens the model when you

85
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:33.978
click New Project.

86
00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:40.583
Once the model is open, it's going to
show a form that has an input for a name.

87
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.573
You can submit with this create button.

88
00:05:42.573 --> 00:05:47.334
Once you submit, it's going to call our
it's going to use that function we call it

89
00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:48.585
Create New Project.

90
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:53.314
And then close the modal and the Create
New Project goes to API project.

91
00:05:53.314 --> 00:05:56.992
And then API project checks to see if
it's the user, creates a project for

92
00:05:56.992 --> 00:05:59.496
that user with a name,
and it just responds okay.

93
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:09.343
So all we got to do now is put this new

94
00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:13.364
project into the home page.

95
00:06:13.364 --> 00:06:15.524
So home we got a page if you scroll down,

96
00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:18.346
there's a block right that
says new project here.

97
00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:21.377
We've got put the new project card here.

98
00:06:23.308 --> 00:06:24.164
That we can use it.

99
00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:27.228
So let's try that.

100
00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:28.448
New project.

101
00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:42.202
This thing says, I forgot to put
client one at the top, didn;'t I?

102
00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:45.092
Rookie mistake.

103
00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:48.003
Use client.

104
00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:52.209
There we go.

105
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:55.639
All right, there's our new project.

106
00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.976
We can click it,
it brings up a new project model.

107
00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:01.049
You can give it a name.

108
00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.848
This is my project.

109
00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:06.467
You can click create.

110
00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.616
It'll close.

111
00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.283
It will not show for
the reasons we talked about.

112
00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:15.943
But if I refresh this is my new project.

113
00:07:15.943 --> 00:07:18.211
And then this just keeps
getting pushed down.

114
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:24.735
It's always the last thing
