1
00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:01.919
Now we should start
filling this stuff out.

2
00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.787
So first thing we wanna do is,
let's do this greeting card here.

3
00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:06.080
So we're just gonna go top to bottom.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.006
Greeting card first.

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.913
Actually we we have a sidebar,
we should put our sidebar on.

6
00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:13.899
Let's try that if we didn't already.

7
00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:19.522
We'll just go ahead and do that,
which is gonna be in the layout.

8
00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:21.859
So we can just, let's see.

9
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.240
It's the best place to put that.

10
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.585
We can just do it here
next to the children.

11
00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:32.439
So let's bring our sidebar
into the dashboard layout.

12
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.125
You can say, sidebar, like this, and

13
00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:41.385
we'll probably have to adjust it,

14
00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:49.890
things like that,
I gotta put a return on mines, I forgot.

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.113
I would have broke if I didn't do that.

16
00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:54.011
There we go.

17
00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:06.103
Bring this over here, there we go.

18
00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.266
So we got a sidebar.

19
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.485
Obviously the CSS for
the flex needs to be fixed.

20
00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:14.081
I think this needs to be like
a flex row whatever, but

21
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:16.384
we're not gonna worry
about design too much.

22
00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:19.924
It's in the middle because we don't
have anything else on the page, so

23
00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.934
we'll have to add some more stuff to it.

24
00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:28.846
So we got our sidebar there,
and here's our children for

25
00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:34.755
the page which is basically
literally nothing.

26
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:41.279
Okay, so now what we wanna do is
start working on this greeting card,

27
00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.713
which we gonna put here where it says,
greetings here.

28
00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:48.933
In the notes,
I have pretty much all of that.

29
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.536
So let's go to the next one.

30
00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:54.544
And basically the greatest component
sits at the top of the homepage.

31
00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:57.632
And we gonna create that in
the components, greetings TSX.

32
00:01:57.632 --> 00:01:59.434
So let's make that file.

33
00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:07.085
Opponents will say, greeting GSX.

34
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.524
And this is gonna be a server component,
cuz, like I said,

35
00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:17.883
it's going to need access to the user
to get that information here.

36
00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:19.674
And it's not doing a mutation,

37
00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.998
it's not doing anything dynamic cuz
it doesn't have interactions itself.

38
00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:28.677
This button can have interactions but
not the entire component.

39
00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.376
So we don't need it to
be a client component.

40
00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:35.060
It could be a server component where
we just tried to get the user.

41
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.825
So let's do that.

42
00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:43.152
So the strategy for that is gonna be,
we just need to make a function.

43
00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:47.164
One, in order to get the user,
we gotta verify that you're signed in.

44
00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:51.497
So we're gonna use that user from cookie
function that we created inside of

45
00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:55.435
our oath file that returns this
cookie function from next.

46
00:02:55.435 --> 00:03:01.092
And that's gonna give us the user.

47
00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:05.195
And then this user is gonna have an email,
first name, last name that we can use.

48
00:03:05.195 --> 00:03:08.240
So then we'll just call that inside
of our greetings component, and

49
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.772
we should have access to the user.

50
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.553
And we can just async it with that.

51
00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:14.884
So let's do just that.

52
00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:17.466
I was gonna bring in my imports here.

53
00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:20.275
In this file.

54
00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:28.396
And I'm gonna say cons get data.

55
00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:29.796
You don't have to call this, get data.

56
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.571
I know I said this before earlier, but

57
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.965
it's just the convention
that people are making.

58
00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.135
Good data's gonna be async function.

59
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:44.272
And it's gonna get a user
from getuser from cookie,

60
00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:48.959
and it's gonna take
cookies from next header.

61
00:03:54.793 --> 00:03:58.208
If you don't remember, get us from
cookie as we made this already.

62
00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.075
It's here, it takes in our cookies.

63
00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:06.783
It grabs the cookie with our cookie name,
it validates the JSON Web Token,

64
00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:12.608
and then it returns that as a user,
and then it returns that user.

65
00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:18.585
Okay, so we got a user, we'll return them,
then we can make our component.

66
00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:25.518
Or I'm just gonna say constant.

67
00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:28.716
Greeting equals async function.

68
00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:36.857
And then NS return or
exports default greeting.

69
00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:40.891
And then the first thing
we wanna do on here is,

70
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:45.352
we wanna get the user so
we have to await it get data.

71
00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:54.451
All right, so now that we got our user,
we can go ahead and

72
00:04:54.451 --> 00:05:01.068
bind this to some of the JSX that we have,
which is nothing really special.

73
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:03.381
Actually, I'm gonna put a delay
up cuz it is gonna be fast.

74
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:06.503
Let's delay this,
I wanna wait this a little bit.

75
00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:09.305
And let's just super
exaggerate this coming back.

76
00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:14.416
So I'll say, let's delay this for, I don't
know, four seconds, you pick a number.

77
00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:16.619
But I wanna just be super exaggerated.

78
00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:33.570
Okay, and then for the JSX,
nothing special is bringing in here.

79
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.932
These are car component that we created.

80
00:05:42.488 --> 00:05:46.419
Oops, stop doing that.

81
00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:53.457
And it's just going to take this
user by his first name here,

82
00:05:53.457 --> 00:06:00.929
everything else is just hard coded text,
it's nothing crazy.

83
00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:10.640
Give me suggestions on how to do
proper parentheses and quotes.

84
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.082
That's fine.

85
00:06:13.082 --> 00:06:14.395
Okay, any questions on this?

86
00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:20.071
All right, so we got that.

87
00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:25.711
So we can bring that into our page.

88
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:28.356
Just go to page, right,
where it says, greetings here.

89
00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:32.603
You can take that out and you can just use

90
00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:37.247
the greeting like that and
you can save it.

91
00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:48.954
And if we go back, this thing is,

92
00:06:48.954 --> 00:06:52.035
where is this off?

93
00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:56.581
Looks like I might have not
did the dot value thing,

94
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:59.767
again, somewhere I'm guessing.

95
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.573
Let's go fix that.

96
00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:06.219
I wanna say it's in auth, and
it's probably gonna be here,

97
00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.146
line 34 for me where I validate JWT.

98
00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:17.881
That's gonna be dot value cuz I believe
this is an object from the cookie.

99
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.856
Yeah, it was.

100
00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:25.895
Okay, so we got that.

101
00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:35.654
So we get rid of the centering on
our Flexbox cuz it's bothering me,

102
00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:39.900
which will be this one, Justify Center.

103
00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:48.722
There we go, okay.

104
00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:49.475
So we have it.

105
00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:51.888
When I refresh,
you see how long it takes to refresh?

106
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.301
Did you notice that at
the start of refreshing?

107
00:07:54.301 --> 00:07:55.645
It's still refreshing, wow.

108
00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:59.667
You see that?

109
00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.365
Page still, I mean, you can't visually
see anything on the page changing.

110
00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:06.446
But the page took that long to refresh
because that delay that I have for

111
00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:09.362
four seconds,
that's why it took four seconds.

112
00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:10.604
Now, this is cached.

113
00:08:10.604 --> 00:08:14.481
So it's showing me that
if this wasn't cached,

114
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:19.032
we wouldn't see anything here,
it would take a minute.

115
00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:23.567
So what we wanna do is instead is,
cuz we wanna show a loading state for

116
00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:25.852
when that greeting is loading in.

117
00:08:25.852 --> 00:08:30.312
But because the greeting is a component
and not a page, we can't use a dot loading

118
00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:34.523
file that only works inside the app
directory, so we won't get it for free.

119
00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:39.017
So we have to manually use our own loader.

120
00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:44.741
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
make a component that we wanna show for

121
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.083
when a greeting is loading, and

122
00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:51.789
then we'll manually tie that into
the loader using a suspense.
