1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So the idea that we've
just ignored or allowed to accrete over

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.290
time, we've ignored or allowed to
accrete over time this complexity

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.685
of the way caching technology works and
not really worried about it.

4
00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:21.870
We've essentially allowed browsers to
worry about that problem instead of us.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.770
And we just say well, if I throw out some
expires headers, that's good enough.

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.870
And the truth is it isn't good enough.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.599
The truth is that it is our responsibility
as the builder of a web experience,

8
00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:38.328
I think, this is my opinion, that it's
our responsibility as the builder of

9
00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:43.204
a web experience to ensure that the person
gets to continue to experience as much

10
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:47.469
of that as possible regardless of
the conditions that they may be in.

11
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.086
If their Wi-Fi goes out, if there's
a storm and the cell towers are knocked

12
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:56.450
down, they should not be completely
lost in that web experience.

13
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.010
Now, it's entirely true that your
web experience may be very dynamic.

14
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.192
There may be things that
they won't be able to get.

15
00:01:03.192 --> 00:01:07.828
A while just recently I was tweeting
about this because Twitter has

16
00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:09.494
a progressive web app.

17
00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:16.460
And this happens to me all the time,
that I'm scrolling through my timeline.

18
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.990
And by the way, I use the latest tweets
timeline because whatever Twitter keeps

19
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.550
trying to do with the most
relevant is complete nonsense.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.365
But I'm scrolling through my latest tweets
timelines, so I'm kinda going back,

21
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.608
seeing what have I missed
in the last hour or two.

22
00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:34.407
And then, I go get on a plane and my wi-fi
is turned off and I open up Twitter, and

23
00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:37.919
I get a Twitter app,
their progressive web app is there and

24
00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:40.020
my timeline's completely gone.

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.260
And I was tweeting about this, and

26
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.190
I was saying why is it that we call this
a progressive web app, but it's nothing

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.950
useful whatsoever to me if it's a blank
screen that I can't see any content.

28
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.005
And I tweeted about this.

29
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:58.950
Obviously, ironically, I'm tweeting
about my frustrations with Twitter.

30
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.850
But I tweeted about this because
there's more than just the Twitter

31
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550
progressive web app that does this.

32
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.116
I tweeted about it, and

33
00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:10.435
I said wouldn't it be great [LAUGH]
if my timeline was still there?

34
00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:14.110
And what I got was all these myopic
responses from people like well,

35
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.564
there's no possible way that Twitter could
cache the entire stream of billions of

36
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:19.939
tweets in your website.

37
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:22.880
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And
that's not what I was asking for, is it?

38
00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:28.025
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And actually,
when I say that in that sarcastic way,

39
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.238
that's actually
the prevailing mindset that

40
00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.958
drives product managers to
design shitty products.

41
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.346
Pardon my French, but it's what causes
them to design that, is because they're

42
00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:43.800
not thinking from the perspective of
what would I want in that position?

43
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.610
They're not using their
basic human empathy to say

44
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.370
if I got on the plane
what would I want to see.

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.810
I don't need to see
the entirety of all Twitter.

46
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.990
I don't need them to somehow break
the laws of quantum mechanics and

47
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.820
download information to my phone
when I have no Internet connection.

48
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.114
You know what I want?

49
00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:02.619
The same timeline that I
was already looking at.

50
00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.318
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: How about
the hundred tweets before and

51
00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:09.920
the hundred tweets after the current
tweet that I'm looking at?

52
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.930
Is that too much to ask?

53
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.410
And yet, we don't build stuff like this,
cuz we don't think and we don't care.

54
00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:18.340
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: This is
what I'm talking about.

55
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.003
This is why I say that every single
website on the Internet needs to change

56
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:27.589
the way they think about the information
that is presented to people and

57
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:28.826
the experiences.

58
00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.663
And they're not always gonna be perfect,
but

59
00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:32.650
they oughtta not just be
blank unusable screens.

60
00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.722
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
when we get into the stuff today,

61
00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.735
what we're gonna be doing is
we have this very simple site,

62
00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:42.720
it's kind of like a very primitive
sort of a blogging site, right?

63
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.450
And the idea is if I'm on a blog,

64
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.380
I wanna be able to navigate
the blogs that I've seen.

65
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.070
I don't necessarily,
I definitely don't need to see

66
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.200
brand new blogs that you've posted
since the last time I was online.

67
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.389
But I need to be able to see all
the stuff that I saw while I was online.

68
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.470
And that is just a website.

69
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.082
Now, we're gonna do a little bit
of handling of dynamicism, and

70
00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:10.645
we'll talk about variety of
strategies around dynamic stuff.

71
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:14.200
Because every single product and
every single experience is gonna

72
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.840
have a slightly different
nuanced answer to that question.

73
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.250
When you click a button
to Tweet something and

74
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.260
you're not online, Twitter has to
decide what do I do with that?

75
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.780
Do I pretend as if it tweeted and then
later synchronize that and send it out?

76
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.830
Do I tell you, nope,
it didn't tweet cuz you're not online?

77
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.230
Do I do somewhere in the middle?

78
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.070
Do I save it and tell you I didn't tweet
it but it's saved, when you come back

79
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.320
online, here's gonna be your tweet and
then you can click the button to tweet it?

80
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.661
Or any gray area in between.

81
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:47.588
And I can't tell Twitter
what the right answer is.

82
00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:52.140
I can certainly complain about it, but
I can't tell what the right answer is.

83
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.170
But what I can tell them is,

84
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.450
it is clear that somebody's
not thinking about this stuff.

85
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.421
And they're not thinking about it at
your site or your site or your site.

86
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:03.158
And I'm not trying to pick on you.

87
00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:05.581
But I experienced this
really terrible web, and

88
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:08.840
I can tell you where almost
nobody's thinking about this stuff.

89
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.170
How do we gracefully fall back, not only
when the Internet is completely down, but

90
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.420
let's even think about what would you do
if somebody had an Internet connection and

91
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.600
they clicked the tweet button, but
it's so slow that it takes minutes and

92
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.510
it hasn't actually responded
that the tweet came out.

93
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.524
They have Internet connection,
they're not offline.

94
00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:36.383
It's just they're on such terrible 2g that
we don't even know whether the information

95
00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:38.100
got to the server.

96
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.610
So it's not relevant to me what the server
does, that's a totally separate concern.

97
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.220
What's relevant to me in this question
is how are you gonna handle that

98
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.320
for the user?

99
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.680
What are you gonna tell them?

100
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.050
Are you gonna tell them sorry,
you've lost your tweet?

101
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.620
That's what happens to me on Twitter.

102
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.530
When I click a tweet button to send off
a tweet, and I happen to have been online

103
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.880
when I started, but I'm offline at that
moment to go send a tweet, it goes away.

104
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.840
Poof!

105
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.430
It's just gone.

106
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.400
So I can tell you they're
not thinking about it.

107
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.320
Or if they're thinking about it,

108
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.080
they're not implementing it, or
they're not testing it, or something.

109
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.620
Because that is not what a user wants,
to just have, poof, it's gone.

110
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.970
I thought it went out and it didn't
go out, and then I go back later and

111
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.680
nobody ever saw that tweet.

112
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.010
I didn't get all my likes.

113
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.640
I mean, this is a critical crisis.

114
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.270
Okay?

115
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.600
So hopefully that sets up for
you what I'm talking about why this is so

116
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.050
important for
us to think about this differently.

117
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.780
And I'm not gonna try to convince you that
you should make every single experience

118
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.199
that you've ever created into an
installable app on somebody's home screen.

119
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.410
We're not gonna talk about that stuff.

120
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.160
But what we are gonna talk
about is using this technology

121
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.420
to try to improve the experiences for
users, specifically on websites.

122
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.820
Whether your website is completely static,
or totally dynamic, or somewhere in

123
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.400
between, there is some strategy that you
can use this technology to implement.
