&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: As we
dive into serviceworkers,

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.000
I wanna highlight one of the links
that I provided in the Readme.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.948
This is serviceworkers,
or serviceworke.rs,

4
00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:11.540
depending on how you wanna pronounce that.

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.330
But it's a really fantastic website.

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.125
They have a bunch of different recipes,
basically, for different things you might

7
00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:22.446
wanna do listed over here, and
you basically click on one of these.

8
00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:26.010
And then, and this took me
a really long time to figure out,

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.480
it's one of the strangest UI designs.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.790
I was like, okay, I see the description.

11
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.820
Where's the code?

12
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.250
You can click on the demo.

13
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.019
You can click on this Readme.

14
00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.518
I'm like, where's the code?

15
00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:38.271
The code is over here in the lightest,

16
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:42.700
totally inaccessible gray
color that you can imagine.

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.960
But if you wanna see their code,

18
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.410
it's really cool cuz they
actually have the code annotated.

19
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.320
They have side by side the annotations
of what the code is doing and

20
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.570
the code over here.

21
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.074
So it's a really great resource.

22
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.700
And probably,

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.120
half of what I know about serviceworkers
I got from somewhere in this website.

24
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.420
So it's cool.

25
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.920
Check that out.
