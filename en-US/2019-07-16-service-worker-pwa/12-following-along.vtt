00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.810
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Your Solution folder will
actually have the full solution in it, so

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.970
the end solution that we get to
at the end of this workshop.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.950
But in addition,
I've included the Git Repo

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.830
that I used with each of
the snapshots that we're getting to.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.175
So if you're familiar with Git, you'll
note that in the SW Solution folder,

6
00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:28.092
you'll see that there's
a set of git commits here.

7
00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:33.230
So initial commits where we started, and
then we added the offline events icon.

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.850
And then we added our service workers.

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.950
So this commit is the one
that we just got to.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.086
And then we're going to do this one next.

11
00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:47.320
So, if you, for some reason your
stuff is not working and you want

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.220
to mess around with the git history here,
you can check out one of these commits.

13
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.110
And if you check out a commit and
then wanna get back,

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.710
you just say git checkout master.

15
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.820
So, say that you are having
a problem with your code and

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.370
you wanted to get the solution file code
that was correct, you can take that hash,

17
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.690
and then add a command line, you can
say git checkout and use that hash.

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.038
And then you'll be at
the version of this code now

19
00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:20.863
that's in the web directory and all that.

20
00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:24.660
The version of this code
is that code at that point.

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.319
And if you do a git log, you'll see
that now that one's the top commit,

22
00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.747
is the one where we added
the service worker, okay?

23
00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:36.297
So if you wanted then to compare
your files to the solution or

24
00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:41.054
literally just copy that current state of
that over into your exercise folder as

25
00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:45.900
a starting point because it's not working,
you can do that, okay?

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.916
If you are on a non, not the final commit,
you're in this detached head state.

27
00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.980
And you wanna get back to the whole list
of all the commits because you'll need to

28
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.410
do that to go forward.

29
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.020
You just say get checkout master.

30
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.860
And now you're back to
the whole history of the Repo.

31
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.910
So then, to go to the next one
after the adding service worker,

32
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.670
this is what we're about to do,
then you'll just grab that hash and

33
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.190
you can check that out to that solution.

34
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.790
Again, remember you do git checkout as
the command you're going to be using.

35
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.550
And you either use a hash to go to that
specific version of it, or if you've

36
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.809
already done that, to get back to what you
had before, you do get check out master.

37
00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:31.599
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Just a word of caution
that it's really easy to forget what state

38
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.143
a tree is in when you're
messing around with this stuff,

39
00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:35.990
so pay very close attention.

40
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.030
I've checked it out, I'm back to master.

41
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.175
I've checked another one out,
I'm back to master.

42
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:44.495
When you're copying files or leaving
files open in your editor or whatever,

43
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.654
it can get real confusing real quick.

44
00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:51.010
So just pay close attention to what
version of what files you're looking at in

45
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.950
this directory.

46
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.520
It's also useful for
those of you that know about git stuff.

47
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920
I'll show you this.

48
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.979
For those of you that
know about git stuff.

49
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.520
It's useful if, for some reason you wanna
know and this is literally what I'm doing

50
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.160
to make sure I'm not forgetting code here,
to do git diffs between two commits.

51
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.470
So here I'm literally looking up right
before I walk you through this exercise.

52
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.670
I'm looking up the difference between
are our adding service worker commit and

53
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.460
the status updates,
which is what we're about to do.

54
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.810
I just do those two hashes
from the older to the newer.

55
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.120
That's the order, and then, oops.

56
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You just have one
extra character on the second?

57
00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:39.895
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's not 354, it's-
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so

58
00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:45.950
now I literally can just see what I'm
needing to update and your git diff.

59
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.721
So that might be helpful as
your managing your stuff.
