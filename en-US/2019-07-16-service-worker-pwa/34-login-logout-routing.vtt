00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.234
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's finally
talk about my strategy for

2
00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:08.157
handling those special URLs,
because there's definitely some nuance

3
00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:12.367
there that we should look at,
let's talk about the /login.

4
00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:17.507
As I mentioned,
/login redirects itself to the add-post

5
00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:21.718
page if you are logged in,
so if you're online,

6
00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:27.890
I want to do something where I try
to let the server do that redirect.

7
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.222
So, I want the server to revalidate
that you are either logged in and

8
00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:37.390
it does a redirect or you need to login,
so I'm gonna defer to the server if we're

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.117
online, but if we're not online,
then I wanna do something different.

10
00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:46.561
If I can tell that we're not online but I
still think you're logged in, then I wanna

11
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:50.942
go ahead and just show you the /add-post
page, cuz my assumption is you probably

12
00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:55.640
still are logged in, I don't know for
sure, but you're probably logged in.

13
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.819
Why not go ahead and
show you the /add-post page?

14
00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.764
If you're not online and
you're not logged in, then I would do

15
00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:06.320
exactly what the server would do,
which is I'd give you the login page.

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.404
And if all of that failed and for
some reason I didn't have the login page,

17
00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.598
my final fallback is give
you the offline page.

18
00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:18.020
Do you see the way that I
thought through that flow?

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.581
I'm basically turning my service worker
into a proxy that mimics the logic

20
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:29.316
that I have on my server, and the reason
for that, and this is a big take away,

21
00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:35.404
the reason for that is I want for the user
to have as close of an experience offline,

22
00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:39.056
or server broken,
as when the server is online.

23
00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:43.262
And so I'm deliberately thinking
about how my server behaves, and

24
00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm mimicking that logic even in
the offline cases, in my service worker.

25
00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:54.959
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, let's skip
over logout, we'll come back to that one,

26
00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.260
add post it's similar, but
kind of the inverse of the login.

27
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.780
This one, definitely,
we have to already have been logged in, so

28
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.655
if I'm online, I'm gonna go ahead and
make a request and

29
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:11.959
then if I'm logged in, so
I make a request if that works great.

30
00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.151
If not, I want to pick one of these two
pages to try to pull from the cache,

31
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:19.705
if I think that you're logged in and

32
00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:25.190
you're accessing add posts then I
wanna pull out posts from the cash.

33
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.706
But if I don't think you're logged in,

34
00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:32.083
then I just gonna assume that you
probably want the login page, okay?

35
00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:37.006
If that works great and otherwise,
basically I've got nothing else to

36
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.206
do other than to redirect
you to the homepage,

37
00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:45.622
because it doesn't make sense to show you
the offline page in this case because

38
00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:50.956
I do know that if you're not logged in,
and we don't have any of that cached,

39
00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:55.450
there's no more fruitful thing for
you to do in this route.

40
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.625
So let's go ahead and
take you back to the home page.

41
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.219
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If I'm not online, but
I'm logged in, just try to show you

42
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.520
the add-post page and if that fails,
then show you the offline page.

43
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.665
And if I'm not online and I'm not logged
in, then show you the login page,

44
00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.780
and otherwise fall back
to the offline page.

45
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:25.831
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Finally,
let's look at the logout,

46
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.680
cuz this one is a little bit more
interesting than the other two.

47
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.021
In the case of a /logout
where we're online,

48
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:35.655
definitely let the server handle it.

49
00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:40.179
So if we're online, make the call
to the server, if the server tells

50
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:44.910
us that we're redirecting,
just go ahead and do the redirect.

51
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.940
We could just return res here, but
I'm just gonna go ahead and forcibly say,

52
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.790
let's redirect to the homepage,
cuz that's where I know we're going.

53
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.439
So it's a judgement call whether you
should return res here or not, but

54
00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.161
anyway, if that fails,
meaning it wasn't a redirect,

55
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:05.501
then I should check to see if I am
logged in meaning I tried to contact

56
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.650
the server cuz I think we're online,
but that failed.

57
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.575
So what do I wanna do?

58
00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:13.590
I wanna pretend as if we logged off.

59
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.427
So the way that I'm gonna
pretend as if we logged off,

60
00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:22.840
is I'm going to send a message to
the page, here's my send message.

61
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.590
I'm gonna send a message to the page and
tell the page, delete the cookie.

62
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.541
So the page is gonna delete the cookie,
I'm gonna wait 100 milliseconds to make

63
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.910
sure that that cookie has actually been
deleted, and then I'm gonna redirect you

64
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.972
to the home page as if you'd
actually done a full logout.

65
00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:42.547
So even if you're offline and

66
00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:45.915
you click the logout link it looks
like it allows you to log out.

67
00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:51.192
It's deleted the cookie so even though
the session might still be on the server,

68
00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:56.560
you're effectively logged out cuz you
don't have that session cookie anymore.

69
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.015
If I am not online but I am logged in,
I'm gonna do the same thing,

70
00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:06.283
I'm gonna force you to log out,
delay by 100, redirect to the homepage.

71
00:05:06.283 --> 00:05:10.171
And if I'm neither logged in nor
online this is a no op, so

72
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:12.358
let's just go to the homepage.
