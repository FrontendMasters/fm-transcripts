00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.793
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,
let's take a look at that.

2
00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:08.710
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Message that can
come from the Service Worker.

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.720
Remember the Service Worker
can send force log out.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.100
So here I am receiving that in blog JS.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.650
I'm receiving the force logout message.

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220
I am unsettling the logged in cookie.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.514
I am setting my isLoggedIn status to
false, and then turning around, and

8
00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:28.586
making sure the Service Worker definitely
knows we are certainly logged out.

9
00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.796
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I don't need to do the
redirect here because the Service Worker's

10
00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:40.051
gonna take care of that
redirect in 100 milliseconds.

11
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:45.351
All right, so with those updates posted,

12
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:48.740
let's demo our page now.

13
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.110
A bunch of stuff that's changed so
I'm gonna clear everything out.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.031
Okay, now that we have that
Service Worker cleared out,

15
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.975
let's try to refresh our page.

16
00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:06.039
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And there we see
v6 of our Service Worker installed,

17
00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.200
everything looks good.

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.802
Our network looks good,
our cache has been properly

19
00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:16.888
filled in with all of
the pages that we expect.

20
00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:24.380
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's try to go,
click around our page.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.760
Let's click on the homepage.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.910
And you'll notice that we did do a get ID.

23
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.140
We did view an AJAX request
just then to get that post ID.

24
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.814
So now if I come back to my cache,

25
00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:42.382
we're gonna see that API
request has been cached now.

26
00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:46.370
So now if we go offline,
the homepage is still gonna load for us.

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.480
So let's try that.

28
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.200
Let's go offline.

29
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.870
And then refresh the homepage.

30
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.820
And it was still able to go and get that.

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.410
Now, we haven't loaded this blog post.

32
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.330
So when I click it,

33
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.190
it can't load that which is why
we get the friendly offline page.

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.870
But we're gonna take care of caching blog
post content here in just a moment, okay?

35
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.580
But at least the pages that we've
proactively cached, we can get.

36
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.810
Let's go back online for a moment.

37
00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:25.287
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And let's log in.

38
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:34.520
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And
then let's go offline.

39
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.550
And let's refresh to see that
we still have add post loading.

40
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.760
If we come back to our cache, we note
now that add-post is now been cached.

41
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.820
That wasn't being cached before
because this is a session aware thing.

42
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.610
But since we went there while we were
online, that's now been added to our

43
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.510
cache, and we can come back to
it even when we're offline.

44
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.510
So I could have been writing up a blog
post and then I got on a plane, and

45
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.780
now I no longer have Wi-Fi.

46
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.930
But I still have a page that
I can do something with.

47
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.720
Or if this was a comment on a blog,
a commenter can still do something useful.

48
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.160
They don't get the blank screen of death
because they can't connect to the server.

49
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.299
So if I were, if I'm offline and
I try to do something like,

50
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.310
actually send out a post.

51
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.520
Well, of course that
AJAX call is gonna fail.

52
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.660
We're gonna try to make an API post.

53
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.910
And that's gonna fail and
the page says posting failed.

54
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.060
Try again.

55
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.100
But, we can actually add
additional graceful handling here

56
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.010
which says if you try to click the Add
Post while you're in the offline state.

57
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.460
We could actually tell the user, hey,
it looks like you're offline right now.

58
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.790
But we'll try posting
when you're back online.

59
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.540
So, we can do all kinds of things to
help improve this user experience

60
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.840
with the service worker.

61
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.638
And then of course,
once we go back online,

62
00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:09.237
now when we click add post,
it just works, okay?

63
00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:15.583
And now that we've cached
both of those blog posts.

64
00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.770
If we come over here and
we look in our cache,

65
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.087
both of those have now been
cached because we visited them.

66
00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:27.953
Which means now if we go offline, and
we're clicking around on your page, and

67
00:04:27.953 --> 00:04:30.105
we're trying to read blog posts.

68
00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:32.720
Hey, the blog posts are still there.

69
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.580
So we solved my main used case.

70
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.483
I can still read your blog post
when I get on an airplane.

71
00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:42.530
That deserves some applause,
come on, that's a big step, right?

72
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.611
Come on.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]

73
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.178
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,

74
00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:47.020
that was a cheap ploy for applause.

75
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.386
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
