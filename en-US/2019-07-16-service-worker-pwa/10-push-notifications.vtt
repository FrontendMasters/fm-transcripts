00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.729
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: While we're on the topic
of what can we do with these APIs,

2
00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.215
these technologies,
there's a very commonly known and

3
00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:13.624
cited technology which is
called push notifications.

4
00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:16.857
And I debated whether or
not we were gonna integrate

5
00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.626
push notification into the app
that we were gonna do today.

6
00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:24.580
And I decided not to, and I'll explain
why we're not gonna do push notification.

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.610
But I do want to talk about what that is,

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.160
because there's a lot of
misconception about it.

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.051
Our misconception or our negative
perception of push notification is that

10
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:37.478
we think push notification
is a single technology.

11
00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:40.730
And it's actually two technologies
being used at the same time.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.570
And one of those technologies is really
super useful, and the other one can be

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.110
really super annoying, which is every time
you show up at a website that you've never

14
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.160
been to before, like 13 milliseconds
later, they pop up a thing that says,

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.750
hey, would you like to receive
notifications when we post new blogs?

16
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.400
And you're like, no, block.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.495
Right, and we're all in this
habit of just like block, block.

18
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.691
I don't even care, don't,
stop bothering me.

19
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.466
And browsers now have settings where you
can just have a blanket block across all

20
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.710
of them, which is tragic, because there
is actually some really good use for it.

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.450
But it's a terrible user
experience to like throw that

22
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.580
dialogue right in somebody's face when
they literally just landed on your site.

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.590
it should be more like they've engaged,
they've logged in.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.040
You have an optional button they click and
it says, yeah, this would be helpful,

25
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920
I'd like to know about it.

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.960
So they're all of those annoying,

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.560
spammy usages of notifications
are polluting the situation for

28
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.000
all for the few good uses where
some of us would like to have it.

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080
In my app, I'd love to be able to
prompt people to ask for that, but

30
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.890
I'm pretty sure everybody's
gonna already have it blocked.

31
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.090
So then I can't send them any kind of
notification at all about a new node or

32
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.610
something.

33
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.170
So we have to be careful how
we use these technologies.

34
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.170
But notification is a thing that
your service worker can send

35
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.790
to the operating system.

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.930
And it can literally do that
even if the page is not open.

37
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.580
There's a notification API where
the service worker can say,

38
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880
I wanna pop up a little
notification on somebody's screen.

39
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.640
You can only do that if the user has,

40
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.590
prior to that point,
granted access for that.

41
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.240
So you can't do that in a spammy way.

42
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.380
But if you've asked for permission and now
you have permission, the service worker

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.620
can pop up a little prompt and
you can have it say whatever you want.

44
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.280
It doesn't have to be anything.

45
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.790
So it could be a notification about a
Tweet or a notification about a new email,

46
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.690
or a calendar event, or anything.

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.570
Any kind of notification that
you've seen on your devices,

48
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.070
you can push those from a service worker.

49
00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:44.650
In addition, if your site was not
open at the time that this thing

50
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.100
was launched, you can chose that if they
click on a button in that notification,

51
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.020
that it launches your site
in a tab in a browser.

52
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.000
So if they don't have your site open, but

53
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.580
there's some new thing that you want them
to see, you show them a notification, and

54
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.592
then they say that's cool and they click
on it, and now they're at your website.

55
00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:06.121
If they're already on your website you can
focus them to a specific part in the app.

56
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:07.930
You can literally change the page or

57
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.750
change the location to something
that you want them to see.

58
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.716
That's notification, and
there are arguably some good use cases for

59
00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:21.187
it, but there's a ton of ways
that that's abused and spammy.

60
00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:24.020
I mean, some people have even talked
about taking it out of the web platform.

61
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.960
I hope that doesn't happen, but
it's definitely not being used well.

62
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.220
But the other part, the push part,
is actually, in my opinion,

63
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.500
much more interesting and exciting.

64
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.120
It's enabled by the same permission, and
that's why they're grouped together.

65
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.610
Push and notification
are basically the same prompt.

66
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.450
But push is a separate thing.

67
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.510
Push is how your service worker can be
notified of something from your server.

68
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.140
So it's how your server can
tell the service worker

69
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.210
that something needs to occur.

70
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.680
Often, that thing that you're telling it
is, show them a visible notification,

71
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.610
but it doesn't have to be that you
want to notify the service worker.

72
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.060
And, by the way, if you haven't thought
about this, this is kind of an amazing

73
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.550
technical feat that your browser,
the tab can be closed.

74
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.110
The user it could have been days or
weeks prior.

75
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.933
And somehow there's been an,
when the permission was granted,

76
00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:33.807
there was an exchange of encrypted keys
and information, where now your server

77
00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:39.786
knows how to talk to the browser even if
the browser isn't talking to the server.

78
00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:44.485
That's what a push message is, is the
server making an outbound network request

79
00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:47.455
routing it somewhere in
the world to your browser,

80
00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:50.770
even if you're on a different
WiFi at that point.

81
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.620
It finds your browser and
it says, hey, service worker,

82
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.550
wake up, I've got something for you, okay?

83
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.070
That's kind of mind-blowing
that it's able to do that, and

84
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.490
that's why it's one of my
favorite technologies.

85
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.280
It's a bit complex to set up, you gotta do
vapid key exchange and some other stuff

86
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.980
that we're not gonna get into, but there's
a bunch of tutorials if you get curious.

87
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.220
But the thing that's particularly
interesting about this is,

88
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.460
you could actually send push
messages to a service worker

89
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.230
that did nothing to alert the user
about what was happening.

90
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.850
But just for example update their cache,
like say you've posted a new blog and

91
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.270
you could push that to somebody's
device and it's already in their cache.

92
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.910
And the next time they come to your site,
it's an instant load.

93
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.940
That sort of thing, so
you could literally just sort of sync them

94
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.140
with any new information that you want,
prime their cache with information.

95
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.760
It's a really, really cool technology
usage and it's such a shame

96
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.460
that because of all this other bullshit
with notifications, that API is

97
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.440
almost certainly gonna be blocked by most
users cuz they're annoyed by that one.

98
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.510
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student: I was just going to say that

99
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.750
so that you can do like new versions.

100
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.690
Like if you have a new
version of your application.

101
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.156
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Student: You can pre-push.

102
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.840
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Pre-push and install and

103
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.940
the app's already
installed by the time you.

104
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.910
&gt;&gt; Student: That's incredible.

105
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.280
That's really cool.

106
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.790
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's really, really
cool that we have these capabilities.

107
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.370
So the point I'm making is there's a bunch
of these like auxiliary technologies

108
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.550
underneath this umbrella
of service workers.

109
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.020
And service workers is
our entry point to using

110
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.430
all of these things because the service
worker lives independent of an open tab.

111
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.830
We could do all of that stuff if the tab
was open because we've had web sockets for

112
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.980
a decade or more.

113
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.700
We could do all of this
stuff if the tab was open.

114
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.630
But now we have the potential
to do all this stuff

115
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.030
even if they've closed the page.

116
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.730
So there's some really exciting
stuff with service workers.

117
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.790
And that's why we've got a bunch
of exercise to work through.

118
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.290
So we're gonna dive in, now,
to this exercise on service workers.
