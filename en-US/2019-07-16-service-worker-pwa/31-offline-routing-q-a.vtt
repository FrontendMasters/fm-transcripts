00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.604
&gt;&gt; Student: If you reload the page,
I'll see.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.591
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Shift reload,
doesn't work.

3
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:12.110
&gt;&gt; Student: Not shift reload
cuz there's a hard reload.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.416
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So the shift reload,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Does work, I think I.

5
00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:21.830
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm doing a double click.

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
And I think that, there is a race
condition with the service worker that's

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.062
causing that cuz, I'm not doing
anything else and then it's reloading.

8
00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.050
So.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.121
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: But
if you just do a shift reload, it reloads.

10
00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.649
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Student2: A small question.

11
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.961
I see you went out of your
way to use the URL property

12
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:54.156
of the request object for the fetch.

13
00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.092
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yeap.
&gt;&gt; Student2: But then we just use the rec

14
00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:03.638
URL, variable in one of sorry,
in the cash put the cash matches.

15
00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:04.464
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yeah.

16
00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:09.403
&gt;&gt; Student2: That's because for
the fetch we needed, we just wanted to be.

17
00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.828
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: In our case,
it wouldn't matter.

18
00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:12.341
&gt;&gt; Student2: Okay.

19
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:16.080
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: But if your URL that
you're sending off to the server had some

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.110
query parameters on it, and
you needed those to go to the server,

21
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.962
then you want the full thing.

22
00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:26.270
But I don't wanna put all those
query parameters as my cache key,

23
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.613
because query parameters are so volatile
that I want to cache stuff at a main URL.

24
00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:36.074
So, there's some nuance there about
what your requests look like.

25
00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:38.798
Remember you're literally
programming a proxy.

26
00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:42.718
So you have 100% control that
also means a 100% responsibility,

27
00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:46.520
to think about these styles and
things you normally never think about.
