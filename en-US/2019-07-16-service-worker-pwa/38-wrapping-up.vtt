&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So taking a step back,
where we started was you

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.620
could load up a website but
it's a very fragile and brittle thing.

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.010
It's failing all over the place, it's
failing when there's a bad connection to

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.960
the server, it's failing when you have
spotty Wi-Fi, it's taking too long.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.895
We haven't even covered but we could have
been doing time outs on these requests.

6
00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.926
We could have been saying when we make in
our safe fetch we could've had a time out

7
00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:28.956
that says, we are going to try this server
but if it takes more than about three or

8
00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:32.023
four seconds let's substitute
in the cached version of it so

9
00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:36.020
that the user isn't having to wait extra
long for these requests to come back.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.760
The default behavior of the web
is just not that user friendly.

11
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.303
From this perspective of [INAUDIBLE] and

12
00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:49.500
from the perspective of
the robustness of connections.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
And what excites me so much about service
worker is this, yes they're great for

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
progressive web applications, but they
really are great for making all websites

15
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.050
behave better, have a more intuitive and
empathetic experience for the user.

16
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.850
So I hope I've sparked your curiosity,
hope I've given you some things to think

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.690
about and start turning to and
making, service workers for yourself.

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.850
Definitely remember the readme,

19
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.300
we've got a bunch of resources that I
used in the building of these exercises.

20
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.170
And you can check those out,
read through those, especially this one,

21
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.300
this is a great site that explains all of
those ins and outs of the strategies and

22
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.670
ways to approach it.

23
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.800
And, honestly the way that I did things is
not the only way to do it, I just wanted

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.170
to show you that we have the control in a
service worker to do whatever is best for

25
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.470
the user, whatever makes most sense for
our site, our product, our application.

26
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.630
I hope that you'll go and

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.360
install a service worker on your
own websites as soon as possible.

28
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.413
Thanks for being here.

29
00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:55.306
