WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:01.682
Cool.

2
00:00:01.682 --> 00:00:04.203
Let's start and stop that again.

3
00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:08.956
Let's try to walk through a whole
thing of getting a product and

4
00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:13.455
then doing a whole update thing,
and we'll go from there.

5
00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:17.342
I don't know if we'll have time to do the
update points, since it's mostly the same

6
00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:20.972
anyway, so I want to move on to some
more interesting things, but we'll see.

7
00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:22.393
Okay, so let's give it a try.

8
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.584
So we're gonna go over here.

9
00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:31.110
We are going to,
do I have product posts already?

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.386
I don't.

11
00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:34.758
Nope.

12
00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:36.011
Okay, yeah, we're gonna do it all here.

13
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.100
So I'll say posts to products.

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.555
Let's create a product here.

15
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:46.575
So for the body a product needs a name and
that's about it.

16
00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:51.331
So I'll just say, my car app.

17
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.942
We'll try to create that.

18
00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:59.768
Cool, so we got a product, created it.

19
00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.966
I need the ID for that.

20
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.472
Someone grabbed that idea that product.

21
00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:09.050
And then what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to create an update.

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.926
So I'm gonna say post to update.

23
00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.952
And I know update needs for

24
00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:28.580
to be created, A title,
a body, and a product ID.

25
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.706
So I had to pass all those
to create an update.

26
00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:31.395
So let's do that.

27
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:36.211
So I'm gonna go here.

28
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:43.541
I wanna say title, New Feature

29
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:48.828
this, And body.

30
00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:54.906
This is the best feature yet,

31
00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:59.810
and then product Id,
the thing I just copied.

32
00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:07.972
So we got that, pretty sure it's the same
JSON Web Token, this might fail.

33
00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:10.247
Let me just make sure it's the same one.

34
00:02:10.247 --> 00:02:11.177
Let's copy this it looks the same.

35
00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:13.100
I was gonna copy it.

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.292
Okay, we got that, we got that.

37
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.194
Let's see if this works.

38
00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:24.186
So hit send and
something just straight up died.

39
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.590
So let's see what happens.

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.458
So this one says Prisma
product find unique

41
00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:36.837
invocation needs at least one argument

42
00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:42.216
that I missed I might not what's that?

43
00:02:42.216 --> 00:02:45.967
I switched it to find unique,
and I didn't make it unique.

44
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:50.607
So let's go back and do that.

45
00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:56.606
And update which, I believe,

46
00:02:56.606 --> 00:03:00.767
is in create update.

47
00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:03.817
So yeah, we that unique key.

48
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:10.728
Index thing I guess, so I guess it's
just like yeah, I didn't find it.

49
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:18.913
So that's because this should
be product Id, not Id.

50
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.500
So let's try that.

51
00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:33.525
Go back to this one,
see if it works this time.

52
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:42.728
It looks like it failed again,
this one says unknown arc product Id.

53
00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:54.420
Data for Prisma update creates,
okay, let's see.

54
00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:04.485
Okay, and that's because I just put
the whole erectile body in there.

55
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:08.723
So we can't do that we'll have
to do it the old school way.

56
00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:13.722
So I'll say title actually we can do we
can do a little quick little trick we're

57
00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:15.251
going to structure it.

58
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:21.288
So we'll just say
productI.rest) = req.body,

59
00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:26.775
like that, and
then I can just come down here and

60
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.533
say this is product ID.

61
00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:32.958
And then, I can just say this
is the rest of the stuff.

62
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.648
All right, let's run that one more time.

63
00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:53.845
Send it, got another error.

64
00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:57.789
[LAUGH] Okay, this one says

65
00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.806
updateAdd is missing, interesting.

66
00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:06.989
Argument product, data.product is missing.

67
00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:10.759
That's interesting, okay.

68
00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.859
So in order to get past that,
I guess what you really want to do

69
00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:21.563
is actually just change the schema
to make updatedAt have default.

70
00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:25.649
I guess what I thought update, I thought
you didn't have to do that, maybe you do.

71
00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:29.127
But we can also write it in
ourselves if we wanted to, but that.

72
00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:31.714
&gt;&gt; I think they have an add updatedAt.

73
00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:32.532
&gt;&gt; That's what I thought.

74
00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.192
Yeah, yeah, there it is.

75
00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:35.356
There we go.

76
00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:36.244
Boom!

77
00:05:36.244 --> 00:05:39.183
I guess you just needed that.

78
00:05:39.183 --> 00:05:40.505
Now you got to run a migration.

79
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:43.588
[LAUGH] Whenever you change the schema,
you gotta run a migration.

80
00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:46.618
So let's run the migration.

81
00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:49.500
In practice, you'll end up running so
many migrations, so,

82
00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:01.818
From that, Run that

83
00:06:01.818 --> 00:06:07.200
migration there on an update and
then, yeah.

84
00:06:11.398 --> 00:06:15.883
Yeah, I don't know why he was
tripping about the product Id,

85
00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:20.642
I know I need a product Id here,
so not sure why that was tripping.

86
00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:23.737
Okay that looks fine, let's go back.

87
00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:29.536
I'm actually just gonna I don't know
why I didn't like the product Id,

88
00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:33.256
it needs a product Id, that's interesting.

89
00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:41.092
I'm actually gonna do
that req.body.productId,

90
00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:47.715
just put req.body back again, it needs it.

91
00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:49.495
So, yes, question.

92
00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:52.597
&gt;&gt; One thing I found in use
in my example is the connect.

93
00:06:52.597 --> 00:06:55.802
You can link the product, and then you can
link connect and pass in unique IDs, and

94
00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:58.147
then you don't have to do
a separate query for the product.

95
00:06:58.147 --> 00:06:58.975
&gt;&gt; There you go.

96
00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:01.840
That's actually the other syntax that
I was trying to figure out earlier.

97
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.547
I was like, there's another way
to LinkedIn, and it was connect.

98
00:07:05.547 --> 00:07:06.497
Yeah, connect.

99
00:07:06.497 --> 00:07:09.373
Maybe we should do that which
I'm just trying to be lazy and

100
00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:11.379
like do the whole thing but let's do it.

101
00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:16.545
So title, req.body.title, and

102
00:07:16.545 --> 00:07:22.227
then you have what is it body like that,

103
00:07:22.227 --> 00:07:25.165
body: rew.body.

104
00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:31.518
And then, what is other word,
it's less as the produtId,

105
00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:39.030
what is good to say product to say
connect to the actual products here.

106
00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:46.270
&gt;&gt; One limitation of this though,
at least from what I was trying out here,

107
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.328
seem to be that you have to
pass in a unique identifier or

108
00:07:49.328 --> 00:07:52.991
a unique identifier you can't do
like anything other than that?

109
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:55.725
&gt;&gt; So you're saying you
have a need product idea.

110
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:59.752
&gt;&gt; It needs an ID, but you can't like
also look up belonging to the user.

111
00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:03.451
&gt;&gt; Right.
Right, yeah, that's interesting.

112
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:05.057
Okay.

113
00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:06.295
Yeah, let's see what happens.

114
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.861
&gt;&gt; Unless, there's another
syntax I'm not aware of, but

115
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:12.422
it doesn't seem to be balance.

116
00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:17.965
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could very well be,
but I don't know.

117
00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:20.736
Let's see what happens with this one, so

118
00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:24.866
send that someone also doesn't
like anything we're doing.

119
00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:32.262
This one says unknown name and
forgot to change that back.

120
00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:36.838
So I think it's like Id.

121
00:08:39.903 --> 00:08:46.146
Product.id There we go.

122
00:08:50.838 --> 00:08:52.465
Run that again.

123
00:08:56.712 --> 00:09:01.224
Okay, we finally got it,
trials, multiple trials,

124
00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:04.959
multiple errors finally created an update.

125
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:09.846
I hope seeing you struggled through
that showed you some insight

126
00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:12.561
on how someone else debugs things,

127
00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:17.461
which for me was always super helpful,
and thanks for the help.

128
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:18.564
Cool, so yeah, we got that.

129
00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:22.872
So we created this update,
we can grab this update's ID and

130
00:09:22.872 --> 00:09:24.950
let's try to get an update.

131
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.293
So now, we can change this to update,

132
00:09:28.293 --> 00:09:33.217
change this to get,
through the body we don't need it.

133
00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:34.920
Now, let's see if we can get an update.

134
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.612
Yeah, so we got the update that works.

135
00:09:37.612 --> 00:09:41.556
Well that's getting all the updates
actually, which is only one,

136
00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:44.474
let's try to get one update,
which will be this.

137
00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:47.784
That worked, so get all get one works.

138
00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:52.037
I guess let's try to update one?

139
00:09:52.037 --> 00:09:56.919
And let's try to update the title which
used to be this to something else.

140
00:09:56.919 --> 00:10:00.835
So we can say title.

141
00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:07.193
New title, and see what happens here.

142
00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.744
That works title got updated to new title,
and

143
00:10:09.744 --> 00:10:13.418
then the last thing we wanna do is see,
if we can delete this thing.

144
00:10:13.418 --> 00:10:17.951
We don't need the body, and that works.

145
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.093
We deleted it.

146
00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:23.944
If we try to get it one more time,
it should be gone, and it is, okay?

147
00:10:23.944 --> 00:10:25.313
So we got the update.
