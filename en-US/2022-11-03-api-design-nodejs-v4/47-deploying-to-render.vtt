WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.935
All right, so yeah,
that builds, you see the dist,

2
00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:07.180
please make sure you .gitignore the dist.

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.460
Do not check that into GitHub.

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.868
That will be bad.

5
00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:14.220
That is a generated directory.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.620
But yeah, you can see,
let's go look at our index.js.

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.103
It's the same JavaScript
you would have wrote,

8
00:00:22.103 --> 00:00:27.250
just like this, but different,
[LAUGH] way different.

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.769
Okay, so, we got that, that looks good.

10
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.580
And now let's try to start it,
so let's say, npm start.

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.516
I'm starting the JavaScript version of
our server, and it works the same way,

12
00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.139
it's just the JavaScript version.

13
00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:45.477
Okay, so we confirmed that those work,
we're ready to deploy now.

14
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:54.178
So what you need to do is if you didn't
make that change that I made for

15
00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:58.515
the port,
you will need to make that change now.

16
00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:01.209
So I already changed my config.port,

17
00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.952
which is gonna be based off some
environment variable called stage.

18
00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:07.740
Which would be production, and
that's gonna change the port.

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.875
If your's just still have number,
this will not work when we deploy.

20
00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.028
You can not have a number
here when we deploy.

21
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.811
This has to be an environment
variable that says process.env.PORT.

22
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:25.423
Which for me is bound to a config file,
Which I can change,

23
00:01:25.423 --> 00:01:31.115
or actually I'm talking and
I haven't changed mine back, look at that.

24
00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:37.087
Which I can change based off of
an environment variable called stage,

25
00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:38.336
process.env.STAGE.

26
00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:48.277
Okay, so first thing first,
you need to push this on GitHub.

27
00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:52.137
If you haven't pushed this on
GitHub already, make a GitHub repo,

28
00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:53.366
push this to GitHub.

29
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.390
You're gonna have to put this
on GitHub to get this deployed.

30
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.822
If you don't have a GitHub, why?

31
00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:06.872
[LAUGH] Make it up, and
put this on GitHub, okay.

32
00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:11.134
So I already have three different
versions of this on GitHub.

33
00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:14.711
So I'm just gonna make another
version of this on GitHub.

34
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:17.080
Make a new repo.

35
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.345
I'm gonna call it api-design-v4-again.

36
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.422
And I'm gonna keep it public,
create my repo.

37
00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:34.724
Go down here, add all these things.

38
00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.182
Do I already have a remote thing here?

39
00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:44.030
I'm gonna just delete my remote thing,
get out of here, there we go.

40
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.488
Okay, got that.

41
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:52.007
Do that thing and

42
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:57.314
then let's commit our stuff.

43
00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:03.380
And then do that thing.

44
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.514
Okay, so I did the things.

45
00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:08.981
I pushed it to my GitHub.

46
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.745
And I can refresh my GitHub and
it should be there.

47
00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:16.398
So everything looks good here,
looking fine.

48
00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.855
Now you want to go to render.com.

49
00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.598
Make an account if you didn't.

50
00:03:23.442 --> 00:03:26.363
And yeah,
I got a lot of stuff going on here.

51
00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:27.505
It's actually quite simple.

52
00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:28.795
So you got a couple of options.

53
00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:32.667
If you already made a database on Render,
we can just reuse the database.

54
00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.449
Or you can make another one,
doesn't matter, but

55
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.240
we can just use the database
that you already have.

56
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.990
It's not a big deal.

57
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.709
But yeah, in production you don't wanna
use the same local database you use to

58
00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.942
develop as the same database
you used in production.

59
00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.148
Just make sure those are two
different databases.

60
00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:51.494
Typically, you want tol use the local
database on your computer for

61
00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:53.909
local development and
this one for production.

62
00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.380
So then you click New,
if you are gonna make a new database,

63
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.850
you can click Postgres.

64
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.120
If not, you just wanna click Web Service.

65
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.520
Web Service is basically just
like anything that needs a port.

66
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.570
So in our case, that's an API,
it needs a port.

67
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.650
So we're gonna do Web Service.

68
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.110
A static site does not need a port.

69
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.486
So if you're gonna deploy a React site
here, you can just go Static Site.

70
00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.560
That's just a file that I put on CDN,
but this needs a port.

71
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.921
So we're gonna Web Service.

72
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:23.910
They got other ones here like
Private Servers, which is basically,

73
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.642
it's kinda like localhost.

74
00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:30.183
It'll basically create a virtual network
that only you have access to through

75
00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:32.472
things firewalls and stuff like that.

76
00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.579
It's not connected to the external world.

77
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:41.134
A background worker is basically
something that doesn't have a URL.

78
00:04:41.134 --> 00:04:42.694
It's like a child process.

79
00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:44.790
It's like some work that you
can do in the background.

80
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.660
It doesn't need a port and
it doesn't have a URL to navigate to.

81
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.039
You can only access it through a process.

82
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:57.110
A cron job is some work that
you can do on some interval.

83
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.060
I have a script, I want the script to
happen every five minutes and then stop.

84
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.946
That's a cron job.

85
00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:04.710
And all this other stuff.

86
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.010
So Web Service, enough talking.

87
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.884
So this is why I said you
had to put this on GitHub,

88
00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:14.493
because it mostly just connects on GitHub.

89
00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:15.784
GitLab, too, if you like GitLab.

90
00:05:15.784 --> 00:05:17.680
GitLab's cool.

91
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.170
I'm gonna connect mine.

92
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.445
I think you have to give
it a globally unique name.

93
00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:28.596
So I'm gonna say api-design, or maybe it's
just unique to your account, not sure yet.

94
00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:33.047
api-design-v4, again.

95
00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:37.243
Root directory, I think you want
to just keep this the same,

96
00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:41.624
do not change the redirect,
I think you just wanna leave that.

97
00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:49.170
Cuz it's not the root directory in which
you're gonna be executing the code.

98
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.690
It's the root directory of
the project before we build it.

99
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.110
And if you change this,
the whole build command will be messed up.

100
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.390
So don't change this.

101
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.590
Environment is Node, we're good.

102
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.980
Region, doesn't really matter.

103
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.958
Branch, for me, is the main branch.

104
00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.604
You can check your branch by
going back to GitHub, but for

105
00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:07.881
me I was on the main branch.

106
00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:12.095
And then build command, so by default,

107
00:06:12.095 --> 00:06:14.154
Render is not going to
install anything for you.

108
00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:17.442
If we don't install our packages,
this won't build, so

109
00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:19.464
I'm going to install my packages.

110
00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:21.115
I'm gonna say, npm install.

111
00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:27.014
And I'm gonna do the double ampersand,
which basically just means wait for

112
00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:30.342
this to be done and
then do this next thing.

113
00:06:30.342 --> 00:06:31.980
So I'm gonna say, npm install.

114
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.832
And then I want to do, npm run build,

115
00:06:34.832 --> 00:06:40.905
which is the command that we just ran
that built fine, it worked on my machine.

116
00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:44.511
So we'll see how it works here.

117
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.951
And then the start command
is just npm start.

118
00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:55.574
Okay, and then make sure you pick the free
plan because you might not be able to

119
00:06:55.574 --> 00:06:56.598
downgrade later.

120
00:07:00.174 --> 00:07:02.380
And if we get this right the first time,
that'd be great.

121
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.174
But we'll probably have to add some
environment variables after it deploys.

122
00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:09.155
Cuz I don't think you get the option
to add the right variables

123
00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:10.480
until you try to deploy it.

124
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.094
And it won't work until we add a database
URL, so it'll probably break the first

125
00:07:14.094 --> 00:07:17.072
deployment until we can go back and
add the environment variable,

126
00:07:17.072 --> 00:07:19.435
since we don't have the option
to do that right now.

127
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.860
Okay, so
I'm gonna click Create Web Service.

128
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.440
And it's just gonna do
what we told it to do.

129
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.599
It's going to go clone our repo.

130
00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:37.524
And this is gonna go through and
try to do all the things we told it to do.

131
00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.922
It's gonna try to install,
it's gonna try to build,

132
00:07:39.922 --> 00:07:41.650
it's gonna try to do all these things.

133
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.552
It might get to the point where it
tries to actually run the server.

134
00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:46.126
Like I said, it's for sure gonna break.

135
00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:50.124
Because we didn't add the environment
variable here for the database.

136
00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:53.056
Because we didn't have the option to,
and we also didn't, for me at least,

137
00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.651
I didn't change my stage to production.

138
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:59.299
So it's probably gonna try to
connect to port 3001 or something.

139
00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.975
Which is obviously not gonna work, but

140
00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:05.309
I want you to see it trying
to deploy right quick.

141
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:08.390
So it installed the packages,
that was successful.

142
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.181
It's building with TypeScript.

143
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:16.019
Looks like that was successful.

144
00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.704
And now it determined
that the build was done.

145
00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:20.570
I have no more tasks for it.

146
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.810
So now it's creating a container image for
the build.

147
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.876
This has everything to do with
things like Docker and Kubernetes.

148
00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:30.482
Where it's just creating an image, a copy
of my build and putting it somewhere so

149
00:08:30.482 --> 00:08:31.442
it can reuse it.

150
00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:39.270
And once it's done with that,
it'll probably try to start it up actually

151
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.556
with the start command and
that's where it'll probably break.

152
00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:48.487
And this is no different
than most hosting providers.

153
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:53.365
They pretty much all do the same thing.

154
00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.762
Which is good, I think,

155
00:08:54.762 --> 00:08:58.230
cuz you can just switch from one
hosting provider to another.

156
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:04.670
Unless it's AWS, which is tough, which is
probably what everyone's using underneath.

157
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:12.010
But yeah, it's good right now if
a person needs to deploy APIs.

158
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.236
It's a good time.

159
00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:16.081
[LAUGH] Four years ago,
it was not a good time.

160
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.529
Five years ago, not a good time,
it was terrible.

161
00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:22.606
There was just a whole six page,
this is how you deploy to Beanstalk.

162
00:09:22.606 --> 00:09:24.970
And you're like, okay, all right.

163
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.786
Let's do it, that was tough.

164
00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:31.343
So, while that's happening, there it is.

165
00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:32.310
So it's uploading.

166
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.547
Yeah, we'll come back to this.

167
00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.270
Let's add our environment variables.

168
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:41.073
So I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna add STAGE,
and for me, my value's production.

169
00:09:41.073 --> 00:09:45.717
We'll add a new environment variable,
everyone needs this one, JWT_SECRET.

170
00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:48.599
If you don't have this
it's just not gonna work.

171
00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:53.682
Value is shh, stop looking at my secrets.

172
00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:57.593
And then I need database URL,

173
00:09:57.593 --> 00:10:05.114
which I actually have to go
get from over here, this one.

174
00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:09.369
And this time I want
the internal DATABASE_URL,

175
00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:12.923
cuz I'm using an internal app on Render.

176
00:10:12.923 --> 00:10:15.889
DATABASE_URL, there we go.

177
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:18.412
And then I can save those changes.

178
00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:22.727
When you add environment variables,
it's going to redeploy the app for you.

179
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:23.292
Which in my case,

180
00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:25.456
I don't know what's gonna happen
since it was already deploying.

181
00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:30.592
So, yeah, it looks like it started on 301,

182
00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:34.979
but that's probably gonna break, so
I'm gonna wait for this thing to redeploy.

183
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:37.269
Let's see what happens.

184
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.955
Here we go, so
it's trying to redeploy right here.

185
00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:42.865
Okay, there we go.

186
00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:45.459
It seems like it is now up.

187
00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:49.624
Let's see if it works.

188
00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:51.550
Yay, it works, there's my error message.

189
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.495
So we got it deployed and
we can see my error messages.

190
00:10:57.495 --> 00:11:00.092
So I don't know, let's see if we
can try to sign up right quick.

191
00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:05.052
So I'm gonna go to Thunder Client,
gonna make a,

192
00:11:05.052 --> 00:11:09.548
I know I have a POST for
a user here somewhere.

193
00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:15.889
There we go, so
I'm gonna change this out to that,

194
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:20.764
/user, change this to render.com.

195
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:24.406
And see if we can make a user,
there we go.

196
00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:27.737
API deployed, success.

197
00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:31.730
And it's so much easier now,

198
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.410
it's so great, I love it.

199
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.390
So many options.
