1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.799
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm going to give you
some challenges and then we'll do one or

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.960
two of them together depending on my mood.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.120
We go into these has challenges here.

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.280
The one you should definitely take on is
let's refactor that checkbox container.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.320
You can find the answer if you
look at the previous thing.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.720
But we can try some of these as well.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.320
We did a version of this.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.321
Yeah, and if anyone has some interesting
use cases, you wanna try to stump me,

9
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.910
cuz people who edit these
videos love when that happens.

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.070
Let's totally do that.

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.630
And if you come up with some ideas,
could you do this thing?

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.630
I'll take a run at it live, right?

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.447
And so if anything comes up,
we'll try it out.

14
00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:49.415
But let's definitely try this one because
we have all of the pieces from a previous

15
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.070
example.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.630
And I'll put what I had up on the screen
as well just so you can see it.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.720
But what I have right now has appeared.

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.640
So like we want to make the whole
thing turn green or whatever color.

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.960
Just some visual feedback for the parent
element based on the checkbox itself.

20
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.720
All right, so our mission is,
we want to have some styling.

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.510
Like we have that focus within
which I guess counts a little bit.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.030
But we would love to give some feedback
of if it's checked or whatever.

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.302
Have a actual style for
the parent itself in this case.

24
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:36.470
So this will involve a little bit of, and
we can mostly get a while with just has.

25
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.990
We can do some other interesting
things while we're at it too.

26
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.890
Cool.
So let's get

27
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.300
rid of some of the other stuff
that we're playing around with.

28
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.068
Mostly the focus

29
00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:59.425
within piece.

30
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.460
So then I've got a, yeah,
we don't even have a.

31
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.340
Just other fun stuff that we have.

32
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.580
It's got a border, it's got a background.

33
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.340
The peer checked works in this case.

34
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.180
We'll see if we can do it
both ways in a second.

35
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.359
So this one becomes somewhat easy
where we can simply say has and

36
00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.890
we can say has checked.

37
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.025
And we want to say bg green.

38
00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:31.001
I don't know, 100 seems good, right?

39
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.370
So now, if it has a checkbox
it changes like theory.

40
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.650
We can query for other stuff in there.

41
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.090
We'll find some other
places to do this as well.

42
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.014
And if we wanted to the peer works here,
but we could also do something

43
00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:52.570
like effectively this will get you
the same group has checked line through.

44
00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.610
I didn't put the group if you.

45
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.530
All right, we'll talk about this in
a second, this is actually good.

46
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.610
You don't have the group on there,
then it's not in the group.

47
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.485
And we can see, we can hover over this.

48
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:10.258
We see group.

49
00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:16.270
Where my intellisense go after I
got done complaining about i?.

50
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.230
We'll show back up in a second.

51
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.390
So, yeah, we have the group.

52
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.190
So now we have the same
effect we had up here.

53
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.915
The nice part about this one is I don't
know why you would move a label before

54
00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:28.830
a checkbox.

55
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.400
But the important part is that
nothing will break because

56
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.360
the logic is still the same, right?

57
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.241
If it isn't a parent that has
a checkbox that is checked,

58
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.928
you will still get the strikethrough
whether or not it's before, whether or

59
00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:47.160
not it's after,
both will work in this case.

60
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.560
All right, did anyone have some
ridiculous challenges for me to try?

61
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.920
Mike's thinking about it.

62
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.360
He's thinking about how devious he
wants to be at this moment, which I.

63
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.398
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Wonder if you
have a couple of checkboxes and

64
00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:04.230
the middle one is checked, then you show
two more questions lower in the page.

65
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay,
let's start with the.

66
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.870
Show two more questions if
there's one in the page, right?

67
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.212
And then we'll get to that.

68
00:04:10.212 --> 00:04:13.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I think the idea is
it's a specific one that needs more info.

69
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.870
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
Yeah, I like it.

70
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.510
Let's do it.

71
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.190
Cool.
So let's say, let me put that label.

72
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.390
We want the label after it.

73
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
And we'll say paragraph.

74
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.260
Or let's give it a div.

75
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.350
Let's change the label to.

76
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.780
The label's kind of.

77
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.620
We can change in storybook.

78
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was your dog's name?

79
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.220
And the question could be,
did you have a dog?

80
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or I was gonna say, yeah-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Whatever you want.

81
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
we'll leave the label, the checkbox.

82
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.020
We'll just show something like.

83
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.103
We'll show I'm real generic,

84
00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:56.120
so we don't care.

85
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.400
And then we'll do an input.

86
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.160
Sure, yes,
definitely take what we wrote before.

87
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.026
That seems great to me.

88
00:05:08.026 --> 00:05:09.800
So right now it shows everything.

89
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.400
So we could do something like.

90
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.690
So now it is completely hidden.

91
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.730
You can't see any of that.

92
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.190
What we can do is,
in this case, we can just say,

93
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.690
group has checked, turn it into a block.

94
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.967
Now, we can say,
if only the second one, at that point,

95
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:44.070
what I would probably do is just
have my div kind of be the, yeah,

96
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.330
I'd have my parent element
be the controller of it.

97
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.170
But you could do something
like has nth child 2 checked?

98
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.130
That will work.

99
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.210
You can do that, but you probably hate
yourself at that point, [LAUGH] yeah.

100
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.130
And yeah,
at that point I would maybe give this one.

101
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.745
Yeah, I would probably,
just on a layout level,

102
00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:08.810
cuz I think it's worth talking about
just to make it a little more realistic.

103
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.330
I would probably put the checkbox and
stuff in there.

104
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.980
And then I would maybe
give it like space-y-4.

105
00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:18.780
It's fun.

106
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.260
Accident, this is such a good segue too.

107
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.073
So this works or it doesn't work for
a very real reason, which is that space

108
00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:35.020
Y4 is problematic because it's saying
put a margin bottom on every element.

109
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.820
That's not the last element, right?

110
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.140
And it's working.

111
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.880
It's not what I want, but it's working.

112
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720
So in this place, it's definitely
a point where something like flex,

113
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.560
which we will talk about flexbox in
a second, but it's called a segue.

114
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.120
Flex call.

115
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.720
And we'll say gap of two.

116
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.000
Now when we check.

117
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.938
Shows up as well and

118
00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:08.298
we've got that in place,

119
00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:14.390
we could even probably like,

120
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.080
I'm gonna.

121
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.680
I'm gonna go.

122
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.760
I'm gonna regret this.

123
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.880
I'm going for a bon.

124
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.050
Pulling that primary button.

125
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.450
I think my primary button just always says
button no matter what, but that's fine.

126
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.370
Actually, we're gonna
do something similar.

127
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.504
There's a way to figure out if a input

128
00:07:57.504 --> 00:08:01.580
field is empty or not, right?

129
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.060
You could technically do required and
have the valid invalid state.

130
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.940
That's probably the right way to
do it now that I think about it.

131
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.580
But I'll show you both,
because I'll show you both.

132
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.840
So this flex call, now we're gonna
say if it's checked will be flex.

133
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.230
Okay, cool.

134
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.790
Give it a gap of 2.

135
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.364
So if we wanted to say like this button
should only be shown if they add a reason

136
00:08:36.364 --> 00:08:37.595
or something like that.

137
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:38.670
Let's not even do flex-col.

138
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:44.056
Let's do flex in this case.

139
00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.470
That's ugly, but we'll go with it.

140
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.694
Let's say we only want that button to
appear if there's something written in

141
00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:51.740
here as well, right?

142
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.740
We can kind of continue to be like.

143
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.420
Again, I don't know if I
can pass classes there.

144
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.420
Let me just put a button in here.

145
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.780
I don't know if I wrote
it like that at all.

146
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.340
Button.

147
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.420
We'll go with the unstyled
button at this moment.

148
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.950
So we say button like only shows up.

149
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.630
I don't know.

150
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.710
Group has.

151
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.990
You could always put in arbitrary.

152
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.480
Regretting this choice already,
but we're gonna do it.

153
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.840
We're going to do it,
it's going to be great.

154
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.859
Has an input group invalid and

155
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:58.433
then we'll hide it and

156
00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:03.248
we're going to say that

157
00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:08.080
this is then required.

158
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.337
So now the submit button in this case only
shows if they've got the details in there,

159
00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:20.840
right?

160
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So
you're really familiar with talent here.

161
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.200
So you know the magic incantation
of what to put in class.

162
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.108
Can you walk through like what you
would do if you were trying to assemble

163
00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:37.600
something like this,

164
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.400
doing the smallest steps you can with
a temporary element or something.

165
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.640
How do you kinda get confident that
all the little pieces of what you've

166
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.280
just done are working piece by piece?

167
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.717
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean I would
probably break this out into multiple

168
00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:54.800
components, right?

169
00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.140
So would you have one or would you have
like, is this really two components?

170
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.500
Is this really an input field?

171
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.460
And is showing or
hiding the submit button a little wonky?

172
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.540
Because you could.

173
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.292
I've got questions on the accessibility
implications thereof,

174
00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:18.910
but arguably you could say that
this should be two components and

175
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.740
you could pull it out and
then have each piece working in isolation.

176
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.940
That's where that
componentization comes in place.

177
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.938
Because you know what you, you know,

178
00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:33.320
it's really hard, you know,
you can't unit test css.

179
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.218
Right.

180
00:11:34.218 --> 00:11:39.240
So that by your testing it becomes real,
real tricky in this case, I guess.

181
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880
Could you component test it with jsdom?

182
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.280
Yes, you definitely could.

183
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.000
I'd probably just break it out and
then try to figure out like.

184
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.692
Cause again like this is just looking for
any invalid input and

185
00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:52.760
then the submit button goes away.

186
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.168
This is very like high level to
be begin with at this point, but

187
00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:58.151
figuring out what are the queries.

188
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.960
But I would probably break
it out into multiple pieces.

189
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.840
Does that make sense?

190
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yep.

191
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.019
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But yeah, you can
theoretically have all sorts of different

192
00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.400
states change based on what's
going on in the parent.

193
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.268
The other example would be if we did
want to show if it has an image,

194
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:19.427
I want it to lay it out differently,
so on and so forth and

195
00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:24.050
some of it is just kind of like
playing through it in that case.

196
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.698
But yeah, I would say breaking it apart
into small pieces that you then assemble

197
00:12:27.698 --> 00:12:28.650
together.

198
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.170
But the point is you can
do complicated flows.

199
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:38.170
What you can't do,
you can change the way things look.

200
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.610
What you can't do is change
the actual attributes on an element.

201
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.750
But what if I want to
disable the submit button?

202
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.430
Can't really do that, right?

203
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.950
Because that would be
changing the attribute.

204
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.312
Well, I'm just going to make it opacity
and give it pointer events none and

205
00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:01.390
hate everybody who uses a screen reader.

206
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:01.949
Right?

207
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:02.630
You know what I mean?

208
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.442
At that point you would
probably eventually,

209
00:13:04.442 --> 00:13:07.390
on a long enough period of time,
you will end up writing JavaScript.

210
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.855
If you pull on the thread,
there is a large set of things that you no

211
00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:14.070
longer need to do that probably
should never have been done.

212
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.576
If you're just changing way something
looks by applying and removing classes,

213
00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:20.110
we can just have better classes, right?

214
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.190
If we are changing the semantic meaning.

215
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.350
Welcome back to JavaScript.

216
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.150
Right.

217
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.430
But one would argue that's probably
what JavaScript was here for.
