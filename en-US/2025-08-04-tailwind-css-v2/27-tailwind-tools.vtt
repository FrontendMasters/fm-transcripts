00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.211
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There are a bunch
of tools out there for

2
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.240
at least generating the colors and
stuff along those lines.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.952
This one I really like and
this other design riff I played around for

4
00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:17.256
a little bit, it shows you where
you can use colors that are not

5
00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:23.680
necessarily bound to the same 200,
300, 400, 500 thing.

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.581
The other thing I will point out is there
are useful tools when it comes to just

7
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.440
working in larger component systems.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.426
So one, it's a very simple tool
which is this tailwind-merge,

9
00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:41.411
which is, let's say you had a button
that had all these classes,

10
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:44.400
but you let them pass in a class name.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.712
This will kind of then strategically
override the other tailwind classes so

12
00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:54.609
they're not stacked and you're not
at the mercy of how they render and

13
00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:55.860
stuff like that.

14
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.180
Could you write it by hand?

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
You totally could.

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.508
A simple little tool for
kind of de duping and

17
00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:08.460
figuring out what the source of
truth should be based on those.

18
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.220
The other one that is kind of
cool that you should check out.

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.620
And again, you don't have to use this one.

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.800
It's not for everyone, but
I will put it on your radar.

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.640
Also, it's called
the Class Variance Authority.

22
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.920
And who doesn't like a LOHI reference?

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.496
And it's basically a way if
you have variants like okay,

24
00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:36.443
my design system has a button and has
a primary, a secondary and a danger one,

25
00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:39.840
you can, just show me an easy example.

26
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.484
You can write it where it's like you
write out all of the variants and

27
00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:50.200
then it basically objects matches it and
then we'll apply the correct classes.

28
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.630
So if you say that hey primary it'll
make it a blue with white text and

29
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.160
a border transparent.

30
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.492
They don't know about outline
apparently in this example, so

31
00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.959
they're using a transparent border
to prevent the layout shift.

32
00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.320
We know better than that at this point.

33
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.800
If they put in secondary, it does object
matching to apply styles programmatically.

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.359
The thing that I do like about
this library is if you look,

35
00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.692
this is just a JavaScript object, I could
use the same object on a svelte project or

36
00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:26.770
a React project or
whatever and take it with me.

37
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.679
But yeah, there are some.tools.

38
00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.230
The thing I kind of said a little bit
earlier, if you find yourself in a world

39
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.565
where I'm doing something tedious and
it hurts and I hate everything,

40
00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:42.407
then either a there's something built
into the framework to make it easier, or

41
00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:47.250
there's probably a library for solving it,
or there's an opportunity to make

42
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.340
your own open source project,
but that's probably not the case.

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.811
Other people probably felt
this pain before you and

44
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.940
it's either built into Tailwind or
there's some tooling.

45
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.180
If it's outside of pure CSS, there's
probably some JavaScript tooling for it.

46
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.373
But I will say about Tailwind, I.

47
00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:10.216
I think I said this during one of the
breaks when I started the temporal UI four

48
00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:12.880
years ago, initial commit or whatever.

49
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.160
I don't remember exactly.

50
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.720
I just heard some hype about Tailwind.

51
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.253
I'm usually somewhat hype resistant and
have been using it every day for

52
00:03:22.253 --> 00:03:27.008
four years and quickly became one of
those tools where when I don't have it,

53
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.320
I get itchy.

54
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.570
Iinitially now if I have a template,
it's in the template, right?

55
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.112
Like, I know that I'm going to have
to set it up almost immediately every

56
00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:38.170
single time.

57
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.290
And there's not a lot of tools
that I can say that for.

58
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.825
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How would you recommend I
go about convincing others that are used

59
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.210
to older ways like, you know, using grid
CSS or whatever to switch to Tailwind?

60
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.877
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well, the nice
part is you can vary the story for

61
00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:57.500
the progressive iteration is easy.

62
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.180
It's not like kind of pulling in.

63
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.580
We made references today,
like bootstrap, right?

64
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.780
You pull in Bootstrap,
that's a bunch of global classes, right?

65
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.477
At the end of the day, and
especially because yes,

66
00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:11.630
there is that default theme of colors and
spacing, right.

67
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.580
You can override all of that, right?

68
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.717
As we saw before, you can just go into
that theme and take the colors and

69
00:04:17.717 --> 00:04:21.100
take all the pieces and
it all depends on how big of a team.

70
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.697
If it's like if, you know,
hey, I work in my little,

71
00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:27.028
my team works in this one little neck
of the woods in a larger code base,

72
00:04:27.028 --> 00:04:28.900
then you can probably just do it there.

73
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.580
But there's nothing like saying it
has to be all or nothing either.

74
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.380
Now granted, yes, a lot of teams.

75
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.900
There is.

76
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.710
Hesitation just adding new stuff,

77
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.660
every random person adding a new
library in there, you know, I get it.

78
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.454
But I think just showing, I think for
some of the trickier things like stacked

79
00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:50.438
media queries, where it's okay,
@media with greater than or

80
00:04:50.438 --> 00:04:54.599
equal to 768 pixels and
maybe there's a CSS variable in there.

81
00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.673
But you're writing that over and over and
over again and just lshowing cool,

82
00:04:59.673 --> 00:05:04.930
neat, that 60 lines of CSS you wrote
could have been four classes, right?

83
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.410
Especially when it comes to
container queries and all that.

84
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.450
It starts to Stack.

85
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.871
And I think there's a natural,
just emotional resistance,

86
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.730
which is unique to every team.

87
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.850
But I think on a example of.

88
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.170
Let's take a look at what this giant
thing you just wrote could have been.

89
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How do you feel about
the actual Tailwind UI suite?

90
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.010
That's a whole different thing,
right, not just the css.

91
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.892
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, so I think it's
like, Tailwind has a single tailwind UI.

92
00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:38.010
It's now called Tailwind Plus.

93
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.490
I think you pay, like, 200 bucks for it.

94
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.290
Yeah, you pay for it and, like, it is
effectively like a bunch of exemplars.

95
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.740
Right?

96
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.240
Which, I mean, if you got some learning
development budget, go for it, right,

97
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.100
like, I have, I did.

98
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.580
And it's nice to, like, see.

99
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.109
It's not like, I think they also have,
like, some new component library too, or

100
00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:03.892
whatever, but
it's like you download the file and

101
00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:06.820
then you just drag it into
your project kind of thing.

102
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.100
I think it's nice for
seeing a lot of exemplars for

103
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.440
how you would lay something out or
do something.

104
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What about, like,
packages, like, material or primeng?

105
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.680
Would they play just fine with Tailwind?

106
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.982
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, and
there are, like, you can even do a.

107
00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:28.360
I think there is a material theme for
Tailwind as well.

108
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.810
But yeah, the nice part is,
like, under the hood, like,

109
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.039
Tailwind has some defaults.

110
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.360
It has some default spacing.

111
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.400
It has some default colors, right?

112
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.760
Because yeah, why not?

113
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.712
But like, Tailwind, unlike things,
like, again, you know,

114
00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:43.130
I keep picking on Bootstrap because,
you know, it's.

115
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.630
That's fun.

116
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.000
It's only at the end of the day,
just becoming a regular style sheet,

117
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.530
just like anything else, right?

118
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.427
Yeah.
You might have to tweak the default

119
00:06:53.427 --> 00:06:54.650
theme to match your theme.

120
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.396
I had to explain this to designers
at Temporal, where it's like, well,

121
00:06:57.396 --> 00:06:59.290
I don't wanna use those colors.

122
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.811
I'm like, cool, just tell me what color
palette you wanna use, right, and

123
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:03.930
we can swap it out.

124
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.004
But to your question before,
there is still,

125
00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:11.560
a lot of times, emotional resistance.

126
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.369
Because I don't wanna be locked in,
same way as I got when Dustin just asked

127
00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.680
me about shad seeing,
is that how you say it?

128
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.520
I was just like, I don't know if I want to
be locked into all their decisions, right.

129
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.868
With Tailwind, you can change out the,

130
00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:25.920
I throw away all those colors immediately,
right?

131
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.920
And I choose instead of, like, blue and
red because I'm, you know, high strung.

132
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.896
Right.
I have error warning,

133
00:07:35.896 --> 00:07:40.745
success information that happened
to map to those colors, right,

134
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.500
and stuff like that that I
kind of use semantically.

135
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.940
But you just set those colors as CSS
variables and then you have them, right.

136
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.900
And so, yeah,
you're not locked into anything.

137
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.643
So you can fit almost in,
because at the end of the day,

138
00:07:54.643 --> 00:07:58.660
it is just an efficient way to make, and
if there's reason why I don't want to.

139
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.490
Can you handcraft a better
CSS style sheet on your own?

140
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
my organization has a very strict theme.

141
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.410
You have to have our blue.

142
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.250
You have to use this gray for sidebar.

143
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.290
You have to use this, you know,
theme color or whatever.

144
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.090
Very strict, very rigid.

145
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.410
So we should be able to set that.

146
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.041
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
I mean, effectively,

147
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:25.250
like kind of saw this a little bit before.

148
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:31.651
Or we can do something like, this is
just in that initial where I have the,

149
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:40.380
I can do @theme and I can do, I don't
know what color that is, let's see.

150
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.420
I don't have that.

151
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.060
But yeah, you can take the brand color and
you do like, color secondary.

152
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.380
Sure, whatever.

153
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.740
And what's cool about this
is why those are different.

154
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.420
Makes me think I typed
something wrong at some point.

155
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.890
But we'll deal with that in a moment.

156
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.468
What's cool is that hypothetically,

157
00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:06.730
I don't know if I have to do a refresh,
but you should be able to do bg.

158
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.330
Yeah, brand.

159
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.849
And now that's just a color like any
other going to that CSS variable.

160
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:17.695
And if you already have that CSS
variable throughout your code base,

161
00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:21.290
you can literally,
let's say somewhere else in the code base.

162
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.420
Where's that?

163
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.780
Call it index CSS.

164
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.792
Somewhere else in the code

165
00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:38.210
base there is like,

166
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.991
it's probably in

167
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.940
root, Right?

168
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.900
Let's be adults about this, right?

169
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.859
Somewhere in your code base that exists,
right, floating around.

170
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.206
You can literally,

171
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.817
Right, and now your tailwind utility class
is mapped to that existing brand color

172
00:10:06.817 --> 00:10:09.790
CSS variable that exists
somewhere else in there.

173
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.430
So you can adapt and
hook in to your existing style sheet.

174
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.070
You don't have to be like, and today I'm
going to sell it to the product managers.

175
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.620
Everything will look the same, but better.

176
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.060
Good luck, right.

177
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.745
So I think in an existing code base, but
the fact that you can set this up and

178
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:32.583
even map to your existing CSS variables
and have again, for some of the other

179
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:37.780
engineers in your team also,
the intellisense isn't hurting anyone.

180
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.819
And some of those ergonomics and
the sorting and stuff like that,

181
00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:44.353
some of the tooling around it is
another thing where I'm just like, but

182
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:47.380
then I would lose that, and
I'd have to remember everything.

183
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.110
And I'm not gonna write, and we all know
that I can write my own VS code plugin.

184
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.390
I know that I can.

185
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.590
I know that I'm not going to.

186
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.750
I know that I'm actually supposed
to do my real job sometimes.

187
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.830
If my job is writing a VS code plugin
like it was at my last job, great.

188
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.190
But right now it's not.

189
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.036
So I think some of the tooling and
the ergonomics around that,

190
00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:08.910
I think is also incredibly compelling.
