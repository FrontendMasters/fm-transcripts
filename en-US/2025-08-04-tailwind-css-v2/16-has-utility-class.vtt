00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.877
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's review for
a moment.

2
00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:08.039
With the group, we can say that
if the parent is hovered, right,

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.625
we can style the children based on that.

4
00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:12.800
With peer,
we can say the siblings afterwards.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.192
And like I said before, for
the longest time that was all that

6
00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:23.680
we had to work with as part of css,
thereby part of Tailwind.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.194
We have a few new contenders

8
00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:33.107
enter one of them is this has.

9
00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.190
Let's call it a utility, right?

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.710
And as you can see at this point it is
safely supported for the last few years.

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.550
Unless you are, I'm sorry, IE11, right?

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.994
But you know, across the,
across the major browsers,

13
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:55.590
you know,
I like to pick on Opera Mini as well.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.860
That is the.

15
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.949
I don't even know how much
usage it has anymore, but

16
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.260
that's when it would take
a screenshot of a web page.

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.220
So needless to say but at this point
support is pretty good for has.

18
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.593
And what HAS lets you do is basically
group was children based on

19
00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:13.580
the parent state, right?

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.100
Has is parent based on the child state.

21
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.064
And so it allows an element
to basically query itself and

22
00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:26.721
say if it has a given
selector that matches and

23
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.390
I will spoil the end of
this in the beginning.

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.237
Cause I think it's just important
to have the context which is if you

25
00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:38.892
have group where a child can
ask about the parent and

26
00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:42.803
you have has where a parent
can query its own children,

27
00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:47.590
you can combine these and
do some really powerful things, right?

28
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.670
So let's kind of work through that
as we can kind of see things again.

29
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.010
I'll say this one more time.

30
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.282
We pretty sure this is true,

31
00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:01.850
will not write a single line of
JavaScript in this entire workshop.

32
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.288
We definitely won't now because
I've said that enough times, but

33
00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:07.530
I'm pretty sure we were
never going to yet.

34
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.630
We'll do things that previously we
probably have written JavaScript before

35
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.210
in our lives.

36
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.450
This is definitely one of them.

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.161
The actual, you know, pseudo selector
itself is incredibly powerful and

38
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:26.980
almost all of it you can do in
a single line in Tailwind, which is.

39
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.082
Opens up a lot of stuff but it's really
where we'll get to where it becomes really

40
00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:34.401
interesting is when we can mix group and
has and sometimes peer and

41
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:38.060
there's one more called in and
another one called not.

42
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.018
Not is pretty self explanatory but
we'll look at it.

43
00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:45.832
But by combining all these, there are a
whole bunch of things that you used to

44
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.480
need to use a certain amount of JavaScript
for that you no longer need to.

45
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.850
So let's go kinda take a look.

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.370
So here we've got that simple version
of checkbox that we did together.

47
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.650
The more complicated version
slightly that we did together.

48
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.770
But here you can see one of the first
times that this shows up right?

49
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.598
And this is effectively
like just a query selector,

50
00:03:08.598 --> 00:03:13.035
like you would do with document
query selector before that,

51
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:18.081
jquery where you can say has and
then brackets are the arbitrary value

52
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:24.050
syntax in tailwind where you can just
plug in any valid CSS and it'll work.

53
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.897
So you can say, okay, if this parent
has an input in it that is checked,

54
00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:36.050
then give us a green border and as input
check, give it a background green.

55
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.690
50.

56
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.010
So now we saw this was focus within.

57
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.330
Focus within was built in.

58
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.310
It would only work for focus though.

59
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.831
Now we say has, if this parent
has a checkbox that's checked,

60
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:49.830
turn that parent element green, right?

61
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.092
Then unchecked it goes back to the state
it was no longer do you have to add or

62
00:03:57.092 --> 00:04:01.590
remove a class to the parent element based
on some value that you kept in state?

63
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.710
Literally, CSS will do all of
the heavy lifting for you.

64
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.520
You can imagine where this keeps going.

65
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.236
This means now let's say
a form has an invalid input of

66
00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:19.826
any of the inputs you could
theoretically disable or

67
00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:27.720
whatever the submit button with just
kind of pure css, so on and so forth.

68
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.902
So here's another one which is basically
like in this case, we can say for

69
00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:38.410
each one of these, all right,
if this thing has an invalid input and

70
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.522
this one's invalid, not user invalid,
show a border red and

71
00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:46.350
a background red and
if it's valid, turn it green.

72
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.310
So you can kind of see that automatically
again, 0 JavaScript being written, right?

73
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.579
I could say I don't make the rules on what

74
00:04:55.579 --> 00:05:01.890
the browser considers to
be a valid email address.

75
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.490
That's what the browser considers.

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.210
I don't know that you could just
do it solely a tld maybe you can.

77
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.570
I don't know.

78
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.661
So now you can say that even on focus
the state is true cuz it is again querying

79
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:12.050
itself, right?

80
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.370
No use state valid based on regex or
whatever.

81
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.410
This is a password field that has.

82
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.290
I believe I put a pattern
property on here.

83
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.958
Let's see.

84
00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.250
What did I do this one?

85
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.856
I did not put a pattern property, but
theoretically do a valid or invalid.

86
00:05:30.856 --> 00:05:35.471
So this one, the entire thing is going
to change if this one has focus,

87
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:38.380
you could do this with
focus within as well.

88
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.740
But so has basically gives you ability for
any given parent to run any query on.

89
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.500
Theoretically you can also do
peers as well with it, right?

90
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.765
Because you can do in css you can
do with the hashtag selector me and

91
00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:58.090
then the next element or
something like that as well.

92
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.930
But Pyrrho will do that for you as well.

93
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.984
But the important,

94
00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:04.332
I think the more powerful one for
our purposes is this ability for

95
00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:09.210
again the parent to style itself based
on the status of any of its children.

96
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.574
And so tons of different places
examples that you can do this and

97
00:06:12.574 --> 00:06:16.321
then a freebie because there are some
things that I don't think needed

98
00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:19.450
their own section, so
I just decided to sprinkle them in.

99
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.550
So yeah, you can do hasvalid or invalid or

100
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.860
has focus which is very
much like focus within.

101
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.390
In fact you could theoretically
do has input focus visible and

102
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.380
get that feature that we joked
about should exist later.

103
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.593
The other fun thing that you can do
in any given point is if you put

104
00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:40.685
transition colors,

105
00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:44.460
it'll automatically add a transition
property to fade between colors.

106
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.570
For all the different things
you can transition between css,

107
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.740
you can add one class and now your button
will transition from one blue to the other

108
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.840
as you hover in a nice smooth way as well.

109
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.999
Here's another example where we
want to say has input checked

110
00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.760
because radio buttons
also count as checked.

111
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.240
If they're selected,
we want to change the entire element.

112
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.400
Again, you could always
do this in JavaScript.

113
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.720
Who wants to?

114
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.450
Especially because effectively this is
really one line of tailwind at this point.

115
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.891
I mean, I guess we changed both
the border and a few other things and

116
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:27.250
we give it a shadow.

117
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.050
I was feeling feeling
saucy at that moment.

118
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.537
So now if I select any of these,
you can see that the entire para element

119
00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:42.490
changes based on whether or not it has
a radio button that is in fact checked.

120
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.685
Again, taking a whole bunch of JavaScript
you could have written previously

121
00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:47.220
because you're like,
I've seen this pattern before.

122
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.665
Yeah, but
there was JavaScript doing it and

123
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:57.460
now it is effectively like 20 characters
of a class name in tailwind as well.

124
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.940
So there are some other
interesting things you can do.

125
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.860
What did I try to do here?

126
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.141
So this is has the checkbox, or

127
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:12.191
has anyone that's checked they turn green,
or

128
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:17.380
I make it lighter if any
of the boxes are checked.

129
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.430
You can see I can change
stuff based on whether or

130
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.090
not anything selected.

131
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.702
In this case, I was just being silly
At a certain point, any given one,

132
00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:31.610
anything that's a selector
you can find in here as well.

133
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:38.806
So if has- a select that has focus,
turn the border pink, right?

134
00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:39.570
Why would you do that?

135
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.090
I don't know.

136
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.211
Just trying to show off the like that
you can basically do any selector that

137
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.210
you could possibly want doing here and
begin to build out stuff as well.

138
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:54.610
But where I think it becomes really kind
of powerful as this is kind of cool.

139
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.405
Like if it has detail summary,
has an open and close property so

140
00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:05.300
you can effectively change the styling
on it whether or not it's open or not.

141
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.700
There's some other ways to do
some stuff like that as well.

142
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.174
But what I keep trying to scroll
down to get to, but I kept writing

143
00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:20.450
more examples for reasons I don't
remember, is matching that with group.

144
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.860
There's one more I wanna show you.

145
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.900
This is also important.

146
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.057
This is why I take notes, right?

147
00:09:26.057 --> 00:09:27.300
So I don't forget stuff.

148
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.988
So you can do it based on whether
something's focused or checked,

149
00:09:29.988 --> 00:09:31.710
any pseudo selector, right?

150
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.430
But you can also change stuff based
on what other elements are in there.

151
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.000
Because if you can look for
an input that's checked,

152
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.950
you can also just look for an input.

153
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:47.470
Which means if you, let's say previously
you're like, hey, I have this card.

154
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.150
Sometimes it takes an image.

155
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.761
Maybe prior in whatever your client side
framework of choice is, you'd be like,

156
00:09:55.761 --> 00:10:00.780
okay, if image, then actually change
the padding and make it a Flexbox.

157
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.860
If no image, whatever, right here you
can say something like just simply,

158
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.420
hey, if it has an image in it,
make it a flexbox, right?

159
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.340
And so the act of it having a certain,
having a certain element in it will

160
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.540
actually change the layout
of the component.

161
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.340
No JavaScript required.

162
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.086
A place where I have used
this before is I had to

163
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:27.120
build a card where it's like
if it has a link in it,

164
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.920
we want to show a little arrow in the
upper right corner that it goes somewhere.

165
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.960
And if the card has no link in it,
it should be styled differently.

166
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.740
That was a feature that I had
to write in JavaScript and

167
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.106
now a single CSS selector
gets us there as well.

168
00:10:43.106 --> 00:10:46.520
So we saw the form validation as well.

169
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.930
And so you can say this label, we're using
the child version, so on and so forth.

170
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.678
Where I think it gets really interesting
is and this is what I was looking for,

171
00:10:57.678 --> 00:10:59.250
group has, right?

172
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.770
So like I said before, has lets
a parent query about his children.

173
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.690
Group lets children change their
styling based on the parent.

174
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.892
Adding those two together means
that you can do stuff where

175
00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:16.050
it's like remember up here we couldn't
do a previous element, right?

176
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.478
But we can say, hey parent,
if you have an invalid input in it,

177
00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:22.160
maybe we want to turn the label red.

178
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.120
It becomes a bunch of really powerful
stuff that we can do in this case.

179
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.400
Like I said, we can change the label or
something like that.

180
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.257
We can be able to go bidirectionally up
and down and figure out if the parent has

181
00:11:36.257 --> 00:11:40.240
anything in this, then I want to
be styled in a particular way.

182
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.615
Let's take a look at some ways
that we can build that and

183
00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:47.250
then we'll do an exercise and
try it on our own.

184
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.610
But let's see how we're feeling.
