00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.025
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here we've got like
a very suspiciously close to the button

2
00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:09.257
that I did, even though I was
live coding I had before,

3
00:00:09.257 --> 00:00:13.040
which is the border,
as you saw, shift things.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.680
So here's two borders together.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.120
They take up different space.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.320
Much more obvious.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.040
When I hover,
my whole layout is shifting with a border.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.480
That's no bueno.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.889
What I used to do before
when I was younger and

10
00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:33.510
dumber is just have a border of the same
color on the primary button too.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.430
And now I'm just changing
the color of the border.

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.270
There's a better way, which is like as we
saw just a second ago, to use outlines.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.470
Now I can hover over gets the outline,
but we don't shift the layout at all.

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.222
So if you find yourself with a border
on something and the layout shifting,

15
00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:53.190
you probably wanted
an outline in that case.

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.290
That said, they're all available to you.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.770
If it is something where everything
has a border, that's fine too.

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.850
But they do behave differently.

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.970
That's kind of the same thing.

20
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.850
Why do you have two?

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.090
Well, that's why there is a third as well.

22
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.252
We're gonna look at focus
states in a second, but

23
00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:17.890
a lot of times you will see these.

24
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.870
For focus is where you kind
of tab over to something,

25
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.480
which will be a little bit easier
when I get into the storybook.

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.720
But like that state,
I think if I click here and hit tab.

27
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.880
Yeah, there you can go.

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.423
You can do outlines also just for
like when you get to keyboard focus and

29
00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:36.240
stuff along those lines.

30
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.120
We're gonna look at that
in itself in a second.

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.170
Now, the reason why there is
a third exists, but not anymore.

32
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.130
Let me explain.

33
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.370
It used to be and is still true if
you are supporting older browsers.

34
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.863
That outline had one major drawback,
which is it didn't respect border radii,

35
00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:05.465
which means if you had a rounded
button and you tried to use outline,

36
00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:10.250
you would end up with a square
outline over a rounded button.

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.243
I cannot show you that because
the browsers support that now and

38
00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:19.080
they will round everything.

39
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.863
If you are targeting browsers,
I could tell you the exact numbers,

40
00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:25.720
I probably haven't written down somewhere.

41
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.143
But let's just go mid 2023 and

42
00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:34.689
later you can just use outline and
border all the time and

43
00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:40.250
you are good to go if you
are supporting older browsers.

44
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.822
And there's some other reasons
why you might use the other one.

45
00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:46.274
One of the ones that break a rule for most
of what we're gonna say with Tailwind,

46
00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:50.530
it's like it's just normal CSS
properties that you're mapping to.

47
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.153
Rings theoretically also work
the same way, but on older browsers,

48
00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.850
they will actually create
what we're all seeing.

49
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.790
In my modern version of Chrome,
they are a little bit of a hack, which is

50
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.130
it is just a very fancy box shadow that
looks like a solid ring around it.

51
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.650
Now, right now, if you're targeting
modern browsers, it doesn't matter.

52
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.250
Just use outline, you're fine.

53
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.183
But if you see code where you see ring or
you need to target older browsers,

54
00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:22.010
you're like,
I don't understand the difference.

55
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.614
The difference is one's technically a box
shadow because one didn't support rounding

56
00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:27.330
at one point or another, and now it does.

57
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.981
And there are some nice things you can do
with rings because there's a box shadow

58
00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:31.810
and you're not.

59
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.330
Like, outline and border are just
things that the browser provides.

60
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.346
The fact that it is a box shadow means
you can do like multiple rings and

61
00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:39.810
stuff along those lines as well.

62
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.926
So, yeah, I can do like,

63
00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:48.170
kind of like a ring that's got a green
ring and then a purple ring around it.

64
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.090
Again, none of these look good and
you shouldn't do any of them.

65
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.005
I was just trying to
demonstrate the purpose.

66
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:54.311
But you can kind of
stack some of the rings.

67
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.030
If you need to do something particularly
fancy, rings are still available.

68
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.579
We'll go look in the VS code in a second
and see what it turns into at some point.

69
00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.208
You can do all sorts of
fun stuff like that.

70
00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:09.204
These days, unless you need the fun stuff
specifically from a ring, outline and

71
00:04:09.204 --> 00:04:11.995
border usually do a trick,
but if you c ring,

72
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:16.340
there was a definite reason
why it existed at some point.

73
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.980
And there are a few nice
things that you can do.

74
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.900
I even made a little cheat sheet for you.

75
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.080
But I'll show you what a ring
looks like instead of an outline,

76
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.340
just to kind of drive the point home.

77
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.885
So if we said ring of one or
two, and we said ring,

78
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:37.835
and you can use both at the same time,

79
00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:42.010
we say ring-amber, 600.

80
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.470
You can see that in this case it is,
that's not super helpful.

81
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.950
But there we go, putting a box
shadow that looks like a ring.

82
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.270
Let's go look at what I accidentally did.

83
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.960
So now we've got both an outline and
we have a ring.

84
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.516
And I can do fun stuff because I can
stack them where I can say like,

85
00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.960
the other thing a ring
can do can be inset.

86
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.360
While an outline can only be on
the outside, a border is the border.

87
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.960
A ring can also be inset.

88
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.713
So I can do something like ring inset.

89
00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:18.878
Yeah, and like we have both,
so they're kind of stacking.

90
00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:21.334
I can also say then, outline.

91
00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:24.620
If you do need to do
something real fancy cause

92
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.860
your designers are having too much fun,
we can say that.

93
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.540
Here we go.

94
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.820
Now it's got a offset of 8.

95
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.940
Did I get rid of the outline
in general though?

96
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.580
Let's see.

97
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.020
Now it's got an outline
with an offset of 8.

98
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.100
It's also got a ring.

99
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100
I can go put a border on there for
fun too, if I really wanted to.

100
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.650
So if you needed to stack these things up,
you could.

101
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.770
This is a horrible button.

102
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.970
You shouldn't do this.

103
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.690
It's like one of those.

104
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.478
It's a Jurassic Park thing of like,
your scientists were so

105
00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:58.430
concerned asking whether they could, they
didnâ€™t stop to ask whether they should.

106
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.530
But you can stack them.

107
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.654
But the TL;DR is, for
most kinds of interactive things,

108
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.921
we don't want the layout to shift,
outline is your friend.

109
00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:08.837
Ring still exists if you need it for
something very particular,

110
00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:10.570
you can most of the time ignore it.

111
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.810
If you see it, it existed for a reason,
that reason is no longer true.
