00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.821
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's actually look at
a challenge that we're going to try out.

2
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:12.560
So I'm gonna toss it over to you first and
then we'll kind of do it together.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.840
Is if we go down here, we've got.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.280
Which one do we want to do?

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.480
Let's have you do the navigation, right.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.400
And so, navigation is a pretty
common pattern in this case.

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.734
So we can go down here and

8
00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:33.610
we've got what we would like to be
a navigation bar at some point.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.690
Right now, I don't think it fits the mark.

10
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.530
This does not look like a navigation bar
to me that I've seen on any site ever.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.461
And so what we want to do is see, can
we lay this out in a way with a certain

12
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:49.861
amount of flex and we'll go for a little
victory lap with some of the styling and

13
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:52.010
see what we can do in that case as well.

14
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.058
But can we begin to start applying
a flexbox where we'll immediately see

15
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.943
some of the pieces go into a horizontal
line and get looking at a little bit

16
00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:06.810
of dealer's choice on how
exactly far we want to take it.

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.570
But this is not a navigation
bar I've ever seen in my life.

18
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.010
So we want to begin to lay it out.

19
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.490
We'll give it a little bit of flex.

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.650
I'll come back and show you in about 10
minutes and then we'll take it for a spin.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.420
Our challenge is to make this
very simple nav look like a nav.

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.285
The only special thing here is we
just reuse the same linked item so

23
00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:37.500
I don't have to write
the same class 42 times.

24
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.088
Like I said before, Tailwind does work
under the assumption that you have some

25
00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:46.970
kind of component system that could be
anything, that could be server generated.

26
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.443
But the idea that if you were just editing
a vanilla HTML page, you will find

27
00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:56.558
yourself either getting very good at
multi cursor support in your editor or

28
00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.850
coming up with some kind of
repeatable way of doing things.

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.810
This starts out, we're allowed to
change anything as we go along.

30
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.234
We're going to probably switch back and
forth a little bit because this one's

31
00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.170
a little wide and
I need my screen real estate.

32
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.540
But we'll take a look.

33
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.696
So just to remind ourselves
of the starting position,

34
00:02:17.696 --> 00:02:19.900
that is not a navigation bar, right?

35
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.185
So the first thing we're gonna
do is exactly what we saw in

36
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:24.220
the previous section.

37
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.220
We'll say class is flex.

38
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300
And.
Okay, that gets me some of the way there.

39
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.710
Looks like the actual list also
needs to be a flex, right?

40
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.510
All right, slowly but surely, we're at
least headed in the right direction.

41
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.870
Now.

42
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.866
We probably want to put some
spacing between things so

43
00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:03.650
we can start even just on those
various menu items there.

44
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.570
We can give it a gap of
whatever feels right.

45
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.570
8.
I'm gonna start out with here.

46
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.210
Okay.

47
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.330
Like, those are good.

48
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.410
There is some space here, though.

49
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.538
Now what we probably want is,
like, the, like,

50
00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:23.170
company name over here on this side, and
maybe we'll push the rest of the stuff.

51
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.490
We can play around with some
different options in a second.

52
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.143
So that's where some of those justify and
alignments come in as well.

53
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:39.436
So what we could do here is we could say
flex, and we're gonna say justify-between,

54
00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:43.710
which is,
if you look over that space-between.

55
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.064
I don't listen to Dave Matthews, but
it always makes me think of that

56
00:03:49.064 --> 00:03:53.490
Dave Matthews song that I don't like,
which will then kind of take the elements

57
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.350
and kind of push them off to each side or
put space in between each one.

58
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.980
If you had three or four, it would kind
of equal spacing in between each one.

59
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.290
All right, now it looks like
we're kinda getting there,

60
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.340
so becoming more and
more like a navigation bar, right?

61
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.980
And on the flex level,
we basically have it.

62
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.768
But we can do a few more things here where
we can say that this has got a class of,

63
00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:20.833
I don't know, font bold.

64
00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:23.060
We've even used bold before, extra bold.

65
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.910
Cool, cool, cool.

66
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.750
And let's say we wanted to make
that a different size as well.

67
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.110
We can do something like that.

68
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.910
Let's say xl.

69
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.534
All right, so now we've got
kind of that in place as well.

70
00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:48.350
For these links, what we could do is say.

71
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.875
Now.
We know how to do a border, but

72
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:58.431
that's not gonna give us what we want,
that's gross.

73
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.580
What we might wanna do is say,
we only want a border on the bottom.

74
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.357
And we saw this before in the very
beginning of the workshop with stuff like

75
00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:09.762
padding and margin,
where we can do border bottom.

76
00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:11.820
And let's give it a border-bottom of 4.

77
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.063
So that works like that.

78
00:05:18.063 --> 00:05:20.540
I could put on the link too,
which I might choose to do as well.

79
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.814
And let's mix some other things in
there where we could say something like

80
00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:32.730
that each one of these is a group,
and should they hover at all.

81
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.850
Group hover.

82
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.130
We'll say that the background should be.

83
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.770
Wes, what's our company color?

84
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.060
Red.

85
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.560
Red.

86
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.580
I mean, I asked, so I gotta go with it.

87
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.700
Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Oracle red.

88
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oracle red.

89
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.220
Twilio red.

90
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.220
Right, so you could say,
if they're group-hover.

91
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.540
I might actually want to make the whole
thing background red, though.

92
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.470
Let's give these all
a little bit of padding too.

93
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.191
That's too much,
we'll give it x of 4, py of 2.

94
00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.732
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Only if they hover,
though,

95
00:06:34.732 --> 00:06:38.510
we can begin to lay some stuff out.

96
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.286
Now what you'll see here though is things
are a little wonky, especially if I either

97
00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:46.860
A, use the developer tools or
B, just make more backgrounds.

98
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.820
We can kind of see.

99
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.386
But the developer tools
are really handy here,

100
00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:56.913
which is if you look at Unicorn Corp,
right, it's kind of like up towards

101
00:06:56.913 --> 00:07:02.100
the top while everything else is,
you know, because these take up.

102
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.260
More height than the actual kind
of company logo in this case.

103
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.550
So we have a few options here.

104
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:17.830
We could center it, which is just
simply we can do item center.

105
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.230
And now you can see it's
kind of in the middle.

106
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.510
Or if you wanted it at the bottom,
you can do items end.

107
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.470
And now it will sit along the baseline.

108
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.940
Looking at this,
I think that I like in the center.

109
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.780
And we can even do like a.

110
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.658
Do a bottom border here too,
if we wanted to,

111
00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:52.580
just to make a point, say border.

112
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.350
I don't like those on there anymore.

113
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.950
Now we're getting to stylistic things.

114
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.790
But yeah,
we can tweak it as much as we want.

115
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.144
But yeah, we can lay stuff out incredibly
quickly without a lot of context

116
00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:12.830
switching.

117
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.390
And there is a lot more that
you could do with flexbox.

118
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.030
So let's also kinda take
a tour of some of that.

119
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.830
But if we look at it real quick,
very quickly, we got a.

120
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.360
We could argue we can tweak some of
the colors and style, I'm not a designer.

121
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.085
But the general layout with very little
typing just by having these utility

122
00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:32.440
classes ready to go.

123
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.130
So we hover any given one of these,

124
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.160
they're all kind of adding
the different pieces as we go.

125
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.752
And if these were in normal css,
we might make a class called Navigation.

126
00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:48.576
Or just on the nav, where we would
put a property flex or display flex,

127
00:08:48.576 --> 00:08:53.143
justify-content space-between,
item-center.

128
00:08:53.143 --> 00:08:56.803
And we, again, put another flex and
we'd have, again,

129
00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:59.430
repeating ourselves in the properties.

130
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.735
We can kind of take these utility classes,
pick and choose the pieces that we need,

131
00:09:03.735 --> 00:09:06.950
and assemble our own lightsaber
incredibly quickly as well.

132
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.297
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
I did SpaceX 4 versus GAT 4 and

133
00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:14.070
they basically kind of
look the same to me.

134
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:20.310
However, if I hover over them,
SpaceX 4 is a lot more complicated.

135
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's see,
where did you put the spaceX 4?

136
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You know how you have Gap 4?

137
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or you did have Gap 4.

138
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.090
I did SpaceX.

139
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.370
Yeah.
Yeah.

140
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.970
You have Gap 8.

141
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.370
Space X 8, maybe.

142
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, those are 8.

143
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.250
I mean, both work for
Flexbox since that is a Flex property.

144
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.650
Cuz if you look at this,
I mean it visually looks like.

145
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:51.943
But like where it might get
squirrely over time is right.

146
00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:55.223
They have these margins versus,
you can kinda see that they take up

147
00:09:55.223 --> 00:09:58.328
the full space and have these
margins versus if we got a gap 8 and

148
00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:02.618
we take a look at the developer tools-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What I did is I just hovered

149
00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:08.940
over that and in there it seems to
show me the CSS that gets generated.

150
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.220
Is that what you do too?

151
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

152
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.237
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, okay, yeah.

153
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.689
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I think since
this gap is a flexbox property,

154
00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:16.919
I would probably just stick
to all the flexbox or

155
00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.620
all the grid properties instead
of mixing and matching.

156
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.180
But there's probably a use case for both.

157
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.448
But I would probably,
if I'm already using Flex,

158
00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:28.568
I'll probably stick with
the Flex properties.

159
00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:30.617
Even this is a nested flexbox, and

160
00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:34.020
so kinda keeping that probably
makes sense in this case.

161
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.300
Let's go take a look at some of
the other kind of like flexboxy things.

162
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.190
So just a way to kind of see some
of the properties in this case.

163
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.163
So out of the box,
if we just say something,

164
00:10:50.163 --> 00:10:53.470
these are all the kind of flex defaults,
right?

165
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.648
And let's make the container
height a little smaller so

166
00:10:55.648 --> 00:10:56.910
I can fit everything on screen.

167
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:11.790
So this is what you get by default
out of a flexbox kind of situation.

168
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.130
So we had that flex direction
we saw before, we did row.

169
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:20.430
We can do column, which point they go
become a column like that Column reverse,

170
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.170
which point they go in the opposite order.

171
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.770
Row reverse.

172
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.290
You get 2, 1, 0, right?

173
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.442
So normally I think unless you have
a very special use case, a lot of

174
00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:40.250
the times what you will tend to see is
probably like Flex row or Flex column.

175
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.975
And again,

176
00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:45.770
these all map to CSS properties out of the
box by default you will get a Flex row.

177
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.242
If you define nothing, you'll see
that there is no difference between

178
00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:55.086
the Automatic default of OttawaFlexBoxes
and Flex Row because the automatic

179
00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:59.650
default is Flex row column being
the other very popular one in this case.

180
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.350
Cool.

181
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:09.680
Then that justify content at the beginning
it is usually the default is start.

182
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.640
So nothing changes.

183
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.240
If we want to start it at the end.

184
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.080
That works.

185
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.968
The normal ones we see a lot of times
is we saw center earlier and in

186
00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:25.120
the nav bar we did that between where it
Puts an even space in between all of them.

187
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.200
What's great is as stuff changes,
those will automatically be flexible.

188
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.560
And it will just keep flexible
space in between all of them.

189
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.472
There's also like justify
around which will also put

190
00:12:41.472 --> 00:12:47.038
some space start and
after what other fun ones evenly and

191
00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:52.031
some ones that I've never
used before in my life.

192
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:56.659
Then we have that kind of those
align-items where we can do all

193
00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:59.820
the items up towards the beginning.

194
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.853
You can see the default is to
kinda stretch them all the items

195
00:13:02.853 --> 00:13:03.770
towards the end.

196
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.370
The one that I use all the time
is center them for me, right?

197
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.330
And so if you did item center and you did.

198
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.447
We saw before justify center,
you get that nice vertically and

199
00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:18.019
horizontally centered piece as well.

200
00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:21.570
So you can kind of like mix and
match these as one does.

201
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.360
We can change that gap, you know, gap four
puts a little bit of space in between

202
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.370
them no matter what,
even if they are next to each other, 14.

203
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.562
It's just how many REMs you want
at a certain point, like built in,

204
00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:37.090
you can go all the way up to 96, which
is bigger than we need for this case.

205
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.450
Yeah, so you can begin to kind
of get a sense of all these.

206
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.690
Most of the time it's usually
item center for me, justify.

207
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.410
I'm either centering or space between.

208
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.330
Flex direction is either row or column.

209
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.930
That will get you.

210
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.420
It's an 80-20 principle.

211
00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.614
Like those like 3,
4 properties will get you 90% of the way

212
00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:06.700
there most of the time and give you a lot
of like power in that sense as well.

213
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.476
And again,
you can use these basically anywhere for

214
00:14:10.476 --> 00:14:14.213
like larger layout things or just
aligning like, hey, I want the label to

215
00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:18.220
be centered with a input field that got
a little bit bigger, so on and so forth.

216
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.005
Right.
Like,

217
00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:24.395
I'll kind of show you real quick in
that input we were playing with earlier,

218
00:14:24.395 --> 00:14:29.610
you know, we did that stacked look,
which I think is pretty good.

219
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:35.050
But if I wanted to have them like,
let's go take a look at it.

220
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.443
If I wanted this to be more like
to have the label to the right or

221
00:14:42.443 --> 00:14:47.669
label to the left and the input to
the right, I could do something like

222
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:52.740
that where I could just say Instead
of space Y1, we'll say flex.

223
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.700
And now you can see that
they are next to each other.

224
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.900
Now if I didn't want the words to break,
I can actually change that as well.

225
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.513
I can just say whitespace-nowrap,

226
00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:13.540
and now that won't wrap at all.

227
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.980
And I can give this
a little bit of a gap too.

228
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.530
Now, if you look, though,
at this, you can kind of see that

229
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:32.140
there is some interesting padding and
stuff like that.

230
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.731
So we could point this where I would play
around with that item center as well, and

231
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:37.820
so on and so forth.

232
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.400
But I did also a bunch of
other squirrely stuff here.

233
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.120
But usually item center will kind
of get it a little more aligned.

234
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.417
So you can kind of see that it's, like,

235
00:15:49.417 --> 00:15:54.560
centered along that axis that goes
across the Flexbox, just like that.
