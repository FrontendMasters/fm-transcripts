00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.454
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we've got this little
course website which is a repo that

2
00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:10.400
we're going to go grab
called Tailwind Skatepark.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.000
Too soon for some of us, we'll see.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.840
As well as some other fun
little tools as well as.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.553
When I say all of my notes,
I mean that on the most extreme level,

6
00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:25.280
more than we will ever get to today.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.600
But I wrote it, so
whatever, you can have it.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.330
So all my notes.

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.741
So that means that if you see something,
you're like, what was that?

10
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.897
Or you wanna dig in a little more,
you can kinda go to a given area and

11
00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:41.810
kinda see either the markup step by step
along the way with the given examples.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.130
That's all there for you.

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.335
Some of it we'll go through, some of it
is bonus material for the DVD later or

14
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:58.760
the re release or something along
those lines, or the Deluxe Edition.

15
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.960
We'll have all that.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.640
But the more important parts, if you don't
have repo clone, go ahead and clone it.

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.160
We'll take a tour of that in a moment.

18
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.920
I'm mostly saying that now so you can go
do that, but there's some other tooling.

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.809
Steve, to your question before,
there is this Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

20
00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:18.224
plugin which will basically
do a few things for you,

21
00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:22.570
as you can see from the photo and
as you will see in my editor all day,

22
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.010
will give you the ability
to autocomplete classes.

23
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.307
I think the plugin itself, I can't
remember if the plugin does this or

24
00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:34.380
the prettier thing that we'll
take a look at in a moment,

25
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.645
will also do class name sorting so
that you do not have to fight

26
00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:41.370
with your teammates about what
the correct order of classes is.

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.090
You can just outsource
that to somebody else.

28
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.551
So if you use VS code and you're
using Tailwind, which you are today,

29
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.510
you should install that
because life is good.

30
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.504
Towards the end of the day, we'll look
at some libraries that you might use

31
00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:03.184
in a React or Svelte or a Ember or
a Angular application that are unique to

32
00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:06.950
writing components and
stuff along those lines.

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.030
But generally speaking,
these two are probably the most helpful.

34
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.650
There are some other ones that I just
added which we'll get to later, but

35
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.310
I'll show you them now,
which is like one UI colorless.

36
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.827
For just creating Tailwind color palettes,
you can kinda pick a color,

37
00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:31.910
add a color palette, hit Export,
get the CSS variables.

38
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.088
There's a Figma plugin too that we talk
about in the Figma course that also then

39
00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.064
will you can theoretically
have the same CSS variable or

40
00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:42.950
the same figma variables and
CSS variables, and everyone can be happy.

41
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.517
And this other site that somebody made,
which will kind of like help

42
00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:53.470
you come up with a color
palette that is more semantic.

43
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.650
If you don't want to say blue or
red or stuff along those lines,

44
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.190
you want to say destructive error warning,
stuff along those lines.

45
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.186
This will create a color palette even
if you don't use either of these.

46
00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:06.999
I think it's kinda nice to see
what the themes look like.

47
00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.450
And we can kinda play around those
more when we talk about colors, but

48
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.830
point of those out as well.

49
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.794
And we'll also look at some JavaScript
libraries, because if the whole thing is

50
00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.757
like, you're using this with components,
right, On a long enough timeline,

51
00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:23.510
particularly if you're just using
Tailwind, you might not run into this.

52
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.932
But the moment you're
building a design system,

53
00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:29.911
whether officially building a design
system or that unofficial, which is like,

54
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:32.793
you have a design system,
whether you use a design system or

55
00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:36.670
not, you have that design system which
is just in your code base somewhere.

56
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.994
What happens if a button by
default has a blue background and

57
00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:42.690
someone passes in a pink background?

58
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.972
There's like, utilities for,
like, diffing and merging and

59
00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:49.330
stuff along those lines that we can
take a look at towards the end.

60
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.743
But with that, if you have the skatepark
installed, we'll take a tour of that and

61
00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:03.566
we're going to start writing some
tailwind and we'll see it in action.

62
00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.032
So here we've got a little skate park,

63
00:04:06.032 --> 00:04:09.730
which is effectively just
a story about a storybook.

64
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.443
It is using Svelte, mostly because
I know some people use React,

65
00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:15.340
some people use Angular.

66
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.088
I only chose Svelte because,
generally speaking,

67
00:04:18.088 --> 00:04:21.220
it just like it was the one I
could get out of the way the most.

68
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.974
So that we didn't have to think
about this, but, like, also so

69
00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:26.940
that I didn't have to, like,
write the same thing a million times.

70
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.380
So in some cases,
I'm trying to remember which one.

71
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.241
There are a few where it's like,
literally, as you can see,

72
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.300
this is technically a svelte file.

73
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.220
It just looks like mark up, right?

74
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.172
So do you need to know Svelte?

75
00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:41.424
You do not, right?

76
00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:44.865
You could probably squint at it and
apply everything you know about React or

77
00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:46.570
Angular or whatever, it'll work.

78
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.730
We're not touching any of that.

79
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.850
We're only touching the CSS parts.

80
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.570
Do not get worried.

81
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.730
I tried in a few of them.

82
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.250
This felt like the least egregious.

83
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.210
Of the bunch in this case, right?

84
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.530
Cause react makes you put
class name everywhere.

85
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.690
I was gonna do it in preact.

86
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.930
Nobody's got time for that.

87
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.770
So, yeah, here we've got a button.

88
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.610
And we could.

89
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.625
Even if this stressed us out at all, for

90
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:16.857
our initial purposes,
if we wanted to do something

91
00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:21.740
like this,
let's do it in the very beginning.

92
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.900
That is valid Svelte markup,
and it will do the thing.

93
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.332
Once we have everything downloaded,

94
00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:32.820
you can treat yourself to an NPM install,
which I did before the show.

95
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.340
It's like pulling
the turkey out of the oven.

96
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.740
I have NPM installed.

97
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.051
I can do it again, but
I feel like that one's.

98
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:45.900
And then we do this npm start, yeah.

99
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.180
And then we can open up this on.

100
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.105
We are very zoomed in and

101
00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:58.589
we can see our beautiful,
beautiful button.

102
00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.368
Make sure I'm on the one that I
was just looking at in the code,

103
00:06:02.368 --> 00:06:05.286
because right now they
all look kinda the same.

104
00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:09.017
So this is a button after
you install Tailwind.

105
00:06:09.017 --> 00:06:12.740
You're like, well, this is worse
than before I started, right?

106
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.340
That is technically true.

107
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.300
Tailwind has this thing called Preflight.

108
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.100
What Preflight does is it normalizes.

109
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.037
It's like stripping out all of the base
styles that the browser gives you across

110
00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:24.340
the different browsers.

111
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.459
A tried and true technique before
the time when almost every

112
00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.944
browser was just some Flash
flavor of Chrome or Safari.

113
00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:37.930
If we're on iOS,
we can rant about that later.

114
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.830
But this is technically a button.

115
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.320
Does not look much like a button, but it
is a button, right, one way or the other.

116
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.305
And it is just dying for
some Tailwind CSS to

117
00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:56.330
make it more button like, right?

118
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.570
And so here we'll get to
see some of this in action.
