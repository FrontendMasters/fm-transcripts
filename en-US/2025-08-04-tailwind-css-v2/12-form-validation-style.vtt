00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.800
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we've got some of
the basic styling of an input field.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.543
Now the interesting part is, and
we're gonna look at the list in a second,

3
00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.910
there are like, if a button has some
variants like hover and active,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.080
input fields have a lot.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.800
Right.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.079
Required.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.360
What type are they?

8
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.280
Are they valid or invalid?

9
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.834
Are they focused?

10
00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.343
We'll talk about focus and focus visible,
right, how those are different.

11
00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:29.200
Putting together the basic input field,
not that hard, right?

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.604
All of the things that we can do within
this input field, now that we have it,

13
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.560
I think become a little
bit more interesting.

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.360
So let's kind of explore some of those.

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.803
What we're gonna do is just kinda look
at the overall list of things that

16
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:49.920
we can do and kind of figure out
how to begin exploring that.

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.237
So we'll explore a bunch of these.

18
00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:57.421
But once we get our heads
around a few of these,

19
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:04.200
it becomes a little bit more obvious
what some of the other ones do, right?

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.478
Like if you understand invalid and valid,

21
00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:13.398
then like styling based on autofill
becomes a little bit more like obvious and

22
00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:17.240
stuff along those lines or
optional or whatever.

23
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.000
Like, I have never styled something
based only on it being optional.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.422
I've always gone based
on it being required.

25
00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:28.694
So some of these exist cuz these just
map to CSS pseudo classes, right?

26
00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:32.000
None of this is a Tailwind-specific thing,
it's CSS.

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.298
But then instead of having to do a whole
nother class name with that pseudo

28
00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:38.200
selector and override stuff and

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600
end up with a stack of CSS
things that becomes very long.

30
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.121
You can go horizontally and

31
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:47.200
end up with a class list on
an HTML tag that's very long.

32
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.660
But these are just on input fields.

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.380
Some of the ones that we have available
to us required valid invalid.

34
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.340
This is an interesting one.

35
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.722
If you've ever played around
with valid and invalid,

36
00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:07.723
they're kind of problematic because
let's say it's a required field and

37
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:12.690
the form loads and it's empty,
it's immediately invalid.

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.700
So you're like,
I'm gonna show a red ring of despair.

39
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.444
They haven't even typed into it yet
and you're already yelling at them.

40
00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:26.491
That's why we have user valid and
user invalid,

41
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:33.414
which checks of validity after the user's
interaction with the element, right?

42
00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:35.317
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So is that just a touch or

43
00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:37.110
is that like a key press?

44
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.910
Or is that like.

45
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.679
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think
if it gets focused and

46
00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.730
then unfocused is my understanding, right?

47
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.010
And a lot of these, like, I've styled for
invalid more Than I've styled for valid.

48
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.650
I've styled for
out of range more than I've.

49
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.361
You know, I tend to add the sadness for
the bad states, but I guess theoretically,

50
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:59.370
if you want to put a green ring of happy,
that's good too.

51
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.130
Cool.

52
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.410
So there are a bunch of these that we
can kind of begin to play around with.

53
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.450
We can even.

54
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.760
Let's look at a few of
them right now together.

55
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.160
So if we wanted to, we could.

56
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.784
Yay, I got my back the way I wanted it to.

57
00:03:13.784 --> 00:03:18.662
Like I said before, we could do
something like invalid, sure, love it,

58
00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:20.640
outline red 600, great.

59
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.880
It's not invalid yet because in this case,
this one is not required.

60
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960
We can either go to the required one or
change the markup.

61
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.920
This feels better.

62
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.535
Well, I'll make this one required for
a minute and you can see that in

63
00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.191
this case it's immediately
invalid because it's required and

64
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.846
there's nothing in it so
that we don't like.

65
00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:49.615
So instead we change
this one to user invalid.

66
00:03:54.023 --> 00:04:00.810
Now they click, they leave, or
not sure if it's acquired ones.

67
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.363
But we go to the email one,
we'll definitely see it.

68
00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:08.889
Let's do email input.

69
00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:13.038
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, they leave, but

70
00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:16.260
by default having no email address
in there was not problematic.

71
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.460
It was only if they have a.

72
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.660
It's not immediately invalid.

73
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.003
Because the other thing you'll see with
the email if we switch this to just

74
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.554
invalid that real quick.

75
00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:28.810
No, I don't need to save an HTML page.

76
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.450
We'll see.

77
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.890
Don't embarrass me.

78
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:45.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that markup for the email
using just like the type of control email?

79
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
that's all like I'm not doing.

80
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.570
There's no.

81
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.050
There's effectively no
JavaScript in here right now.

82
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.770
The fight that's happening right now
is I guess between invalid and focus.

83
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.763
Who wins?

84
00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.170
In this case, focus is winning.

85
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.370
So we'll get rid of that for
one second just to.

86
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.810
So it just said invalid.

87
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.370
Right.

88
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.090
I get that.

89
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.330
So let's put everything
back the way we had it.

90
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.570
So now we'll have.

91
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.370
But if they leave, I mean, that's.

92
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.825
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I mean, that's much better
than in Angular where you're typing huge

93
00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.255
NG if statements that are this long.

94
00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why you don't need to.

95
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.730
All you need is that class or.

96
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The number of
times before user invalid existed.

97
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.991
Yeah, Whether it's like some amount of
state in React where it's like, okay, if

98
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:37.019
it's not the default value, but it's also
not valid, then go add this other class.

99
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.370
I don't wanna do that anymore, right?

100
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.610
Like a shocking number of things.

101
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.195
Like, the other one is like accordions
that you probably in either

102
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:48.484
your favorite front end framework choice
used to open and close in JavaScript,

103
00:05:48.484 --> 00:05:50.354
you can just do in CSS now, right?

104
00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:55.329
And especially when we get to some of the
more advanced CSS properties like has or

105
00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:57.713
the helpers that come with Tailwind.

106
00:05:57.713 --> 00:06:01.099
You can do like, hey,
if they've hovered over the group,

107
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.650
they've hovered over the card.

108
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.170
I wanna change like a bunch of
stuff in the card as well, right?

109
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.130
I want the links to all of
a sudden get underlines.

110
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.213
You can do all that in Tailwind
with a few characters.

111
00:06:11.213 --> 00:06:12.387
We'll take a look at it, don't worry.
