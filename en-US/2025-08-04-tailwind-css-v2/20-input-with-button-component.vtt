00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's say again,
every app is really a to do list.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.902
But theoretically, this is for
if we wanted to have a,

3
00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:17.840
I like to call it,
sometimes just a single input form field.

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.200
Like again, submit message one input,
submit, so on and so forth.

5
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.493
And so that one really doesn't
like it when I get real small,

6
00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:29.680
and I get big again.

7
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.508
So this is kind of what we start out
with here, and we wanna kind of create

8
00:00:37.508 --> 00:00:41.800
the thing of an input field that
then has a button inside of it.

9
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.680
So it's like one unit.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.327
You might also see this as like,
it's like an input field and

11
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:49.440
then the button's kind
of attached on the end.

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.040
That also could work.

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.656
It's honestly a styling
thing at that point,

14
00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.380
maybe we'll try both of which you'll.

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.620
If I feel spicy and
still good on time, we'll see.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.460
Okay, so what we can do is point.

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.740
Now the fact that
the label has no styling.

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.288
And this is when I warned you in
the beginning of the workshop,

19
00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:08.983
it might be really tempting to open
up that base layer and be like,

20
00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:12.940
why aren't all my buttons on all my inputs
to have borders and all of these things?

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.540
And then you will regret it.

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.940
Ask me how I know.

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.437
Because I too, if you thought that in the
beginning, I too was you at one point, and

24
00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:22.670
now I am no longer you.

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.142
So in this case,
what we're going to go for

26
00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:32.990
is we're going to look at
a few different things, right?

27
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.190
You're like,
what if I don't want to show a label?

28
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.790
What if I just want an input field?

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.030
I wanna say what it is in the placeholder.

30
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.790
You can do that, but that's mean.

31
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.832
I mean, you can play around with some
aria labeledby things and so on and so

32
00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:50.257
forth, but generally speaking,

33
00:01:50.257 --> 00:01:53.230
the label is useful for
screen readers to announce what it is.

34
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.070
So let's say we don't want
to show the label at all.

35
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.838
I can use this tailwind
class called SRO only,

36
00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:03.758
which is screen reader only, right?

37
00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.566
You say, but it's still here.

38
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:11.150
Because I put in the for
field, not the class.

39
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.670
If you don't type it in the right place,
it doesn't work.

40
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.790
SR only.

41
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.840
So it's vanished, but it's not, right?

42
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.532
SR only basically keeps it
where it was on the page, but

43
00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:32.600
puts it off of the page effectively and
hides it.

44
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.021
A screen reader will still announce
the label of this as like,

45
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.774
we should really do this as new task,
we're being.

46
00:02:40.774 --> 00:02:44.259
So if they use a screen reader,
and they navigate over,

47
00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.750
there's still a label in DOM.

48
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.350
But visually, for anyone looking at the
page, they don't see it anymore, right?

49
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.750
So it's a way to kind of get
some accessibility, niceness.

50
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.350
And again,
could you write that class yourself?

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.070
Yes.

52
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.430
Do you want to?

53
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.950
No, so
it kind of just moves it out of the way.

54
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.875
So now what we wanna do is we're
gonna kind of style the form a little

55
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.390
bit to look like we had
with an input field before.

56
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.454
So we'll say class and

57
00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:19.452
we're going to say, I don't know,

58
00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:26.560
we'll give it a outline-outline-slate 600.

59
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.680
Okay, we're getting there.

60
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.330
So we give it some padding on the x
axis of 3, some padding on the y.

61
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.130
1.5.

62
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.490
All right, all right.

63
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.479
We're going to accidentally learn
a little bit more about flexbox in

64
00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.170
a second here because I
got excited to do this.

65
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.010
And we'll then talk a little bit
more of flexbox in a second.

66
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.490
Then we'll style the button.

67
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.774
Theoretically, we could have used any of
those other buttons we had before, but

68
00:03:58.774 --> 00:04:02.570
we'll just bring this in real quick and
we'll give it a bg.

69
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.810
We did blue buttons the whole time,
doing a purple button.

70
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.727
PX, I don't know, 3.

71
00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:16.736
Again, we decided we're team rounded,

72
00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:19.460
if I'm not mistaken.

73
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.540
Cool, and we'll give it a text of white.

74
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.500
Spell white correctly.

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.220
There we go.

76
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400
The next thing we do is we
will make this a flexbox.

77
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.480
We'll talk a little bit
more flexbox in a second.

78
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.988
We'll say flex and we'll say

79
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:45.216
that the input field gets to take up

80
00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:50.600
more space and we'll make this.

81
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.960
I forgot we're team rounded.

82
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.523
I just went through, like I said before,

83
00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:58.840
I went through the great unrounding
in the UI that I worked on.

84
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.720
And so now I have to remember
that we like rounded.

85
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.060
I like rounded too, to be clear.

86
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.020
Okay, it looks like it,
but like ew, right?

87
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.508
And would like to do all that.

88
00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:12.505
I would like basically to take the fact
that it looks like this is the input field

89
00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:14.460
overall and make it behave like that.

90
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.860
So what I could do in this case
is we do need to remove that.

91
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.260
I think I can just do outline.

92
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.380
None.
We'll find out together.

93
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.690
Okay.

94
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.610
But now there's still no visual feedback.

95
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.050
There's no focus, there's nothing.

96
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.657
So what we'll do here

97
00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:49.890
is we'll say outline.

98
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.450
And again, if you wanted to keep the
outline, but then put a ring around it.

99
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.410
That's where the fact that rings
still exist could be helpful.

100
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.530
So let's actually do that.

101
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.603
We'll say ring two and

102
00:06:05.603 --> 00:06:11.210
we'll say ring purple.

103
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.730
So now we get a little focus state there.

104
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.330
That's nice.

105
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.370
I guess I could have changed
the outline color too.

106
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.010
That would have worked but now I get both.

107
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.120
Cool, so now it looks but
it works for focus.

108
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.600
But what if we wanted to do that invalid
valid kind of thing as well, right?

109
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.955
That's where has becomes interesting
because it can then query about the input

110
00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:46.880
inside.

111
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.095
So we could do something

112
00:06:52.095 --> 00:07:00.180
like has invalid ring-red 600,

113
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.655
do has user invalid, and

114
00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:11.930
we'll make this required.

115
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.700
Let's just go to regular invalid for
a second.

116
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.860
Let's see what happens when I get fancy.

117
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.420
Let's try it with the outline for
a second.

118
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.500
Watch this as I pick too.

119
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.100
Darker red.

120
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.540
Not totally sure as I wing it on that one.

121
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.470
If you put the required on the label
it's not going to do anything.

122
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.270
Just FYI, in case you're wondering.

123
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.070
All right, there we go.

124
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.670
I'm not insane,
I'm just in a very zoomed in window.

125
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.470
Cool, cool, cool.

126
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.780
So we'll do the has user invalid.

127
00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:37.680
So now they go in, they leave.

128
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.205
Maybe it doesn't work on required,

129
00:08:48.205 --> 00:08:52.678
but yeah, we can start to

130
00:08:52.678 --> 00:08:58.440
especially make this an email.

131
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.014
We can see it super easily.

132
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.120
They go in, they leave,
they type in some bs, they leave.

133
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.720
Now it's red.

134
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.013
But now we have what looks like
an input field with a button

135
00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:15.280
inside just styled by
a mixture of has focus within.

136
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.707
All of these tools come together to
make some of those more polished and

137
00:09:19.707 --> 00:09:24.480
professional looking UI components
that might have taken a while.

138
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.860
Very quick and easy to the point where
someone can live code on a zoomed in

139
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.853
screen in front of friends
while also talking and

140
00:09:31.853 --> 00:09:34.500
whip one up fairly quickly and elegantly.
