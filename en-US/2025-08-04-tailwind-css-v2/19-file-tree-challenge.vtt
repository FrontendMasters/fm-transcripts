WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's say we're
building a file or folder picker.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.664
We've got like a checkbox that represents
a folder and checking that should

3
00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:14.880
make it look like we've selected
all the files in that folder too.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, all right.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can we have a folder
with a couple files in it?

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep.

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.036
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then a file that's
the sibling of the folder and

8
00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:25.200
see how close we can get to sort of.

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730
I'll leave you to
interpret what that means.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Modify a tree.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
I'm saying I want the visual appearance

12
00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:36.570
that children are selected
even though they.

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.234
Might not be.

14
00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:43.241
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hidden feature
of this repo is you can do

15
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:49.032
npm run create, let's call it filetree.

16
00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.141
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We're
making a new component.

17
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:52.392
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Rather than, yeah.

18
00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:57.432
So now I should have a FileTree
folder in here if you

19
00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:03.440
want to play around with other
stuff in a little safe space.

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360
I made that for you.

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.960
Cool.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.040
So we've got this Hello FileTree!

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.240
The challenge was we want to have some
kind of folder file hierarchy here.

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's just pull that up in here as well.

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.579
And I told Mark we're doing good on time.

26
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.680
No, this is good.

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.040
I love this bottom.

28
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.760
Do you see it?

29
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.088
It's on the bottom.

30
00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:37.080
Yeah.

31
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.240
Why is it on the bottom?

32
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.840
That's not how.

33
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.040
Whatever.
I don't make the rules around here.

34
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.280
Cool, cool, cool.

35
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.153
So we've got our file tree.

36
00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:52.256
So what I'm thinking is we make
a section and we'll have the,

37
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.176
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's just say that

38
00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:12.880
the label is whatever kind
of folder that we had.

39
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.690
Input type checkbox.

40
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.730
We'll give this an idea folder.

41
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.050
Just not be total id="folder".

42
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.917
And we'll say this is for.

43
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Save that, okay.

44
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.720
We want that other order.

45
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.320
And then we're going
to say that we've got.

46
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.520
These will be their children.

47
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.320
So we'll give it.

48
00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.560
You could argue it should
be unordered list.

49
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.280
Let's not work.

50
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.680
Yeah.
Okay, fine.

51
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.890
And we're going to say the thing is like,
we can't make them checked, right.

52
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.890
We can style them as if they are.

53
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's say that there's
some back-end that's gonna regard

54
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.869
the selection of that folder as-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep,

55
00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:26.465
that-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

56
00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:30.456
we just want the visual appearance that
the children are checked when you check

57
00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:31.850
the parent.

58
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, all right,
yeah, the big question is,

59
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.060
can we actually check the box?

60
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.732
We do something, right?

61
00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:42.879
And this is where you a lot of times,
in bigger apps,

62
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.500
you will see the questionable pattern.

63
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.980
Anytime you see that toggle switch, that's
a checkbox where the checkbox is hidden.

64
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.500
And an SVG moves some stuff around, right?

65
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.300
Like that's, you know,
that's where you see stuff like that.

66
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.430
But we'll get to something that
gets us most of the the way there.

67
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.688
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I would even take an example
that has like a hidden check checkbox or

68
00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:07.025
something that's conditionally presented.

69
00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:08.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm not having SVG.

70
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.874
But we'll figure out,
well spiritually versus we'll do

71
00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:15.590
the version that does not have me
live coding SVG in front of you.

72
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.150
That's, you know.

73
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.710
Let's start.

74
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
you can make all the files not selectable.

75
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.657
That'd be one.
And also gray and italics is a-

76
00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:22.461
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, well, yeah,

77
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:23.230
we'll figure out.

78
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.030
We'll figure out something.

79
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Even disabling them would
make sense regardless of their check

80
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.330
the state recently.

81
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
and I won't even do any.

82
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.850
I don't need stick up a lot of real
estate for something I'm not using.

83
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.850
And I could theoretically even
do a snippet and spelled.

84
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.512
I'm not gonna do any of that.

85
00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:49.072
So we'll grab this and we're gonna say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Again,

86
00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:53.410
in an actual component system that would
be its own component, so on and so forth.

87
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.850
But we're not doing that right now.

88
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.577
We'll say this is file, file, file and

89
00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:05.890
we'll give this just some
visual hierarchy here.

90
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.170
We'll say this has got
a margin left of that.

91
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.050
Nine's not number.

92
00:05:18.628 --> 00:05:20.728
No, [CROSSTALK].
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Maybe the UL element.

93
00:05:45.308 --> 00:05:47.044
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Are we not
refreshing what's going on or

94
00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:49.760
do I just don't understand how
anything works all of a sudden?

95
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.290
We'll cheat.

96
00:05:55.886 --> 00:05:58.456
Everyone should have a favorite
color that they use to figure out

97
00:05:58.456 --> 00:06:00.229
if anything's working.

98
00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If you don't make your
body background lime green to see

99
00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:04.470
if refreshes aren't working.

100
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.110
I don't know what kind
of CSS you're writing.

101
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.292
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give me
a second to figure out if

102
00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:10.619
I shut down the server accidentally or
something real dumb.

103
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.669
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do we want to inspect
the HTML to see if that class seems

104
00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:26.490
to be applied?

105
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.650
I don't know.

106
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.090
You're the tailwind expert, but.

107
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well, yeah, these four
errors here, are not giving me a lot of.

108
00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:37.579
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well.

109
00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:45.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [LAUGH] All right,
that makes sense.

110
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.173
We were so focused on so focus on

111
00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:56.620
the CSS we didn't stop to think about.

112
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.150
Didn't solve our issue, but
we did solve that problem.

113
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.190
Yeah, let's inspect.

114
00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:13.590
My God, all my controls are so big.

115
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well,
that's a recent change, file-1.

116
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.414
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have a theory.

118
00:07:32.414 --> 00:07:33.957
The oldest theory in the book.

119
00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:42.472
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Did adding brand new
files that vite was not aware of mes,

120
00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:49.397
literally, end up with the type-stripping
thing that we were talking about.

121
00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:53.360
[LAUGH] Adding a brand new file.

122
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.680
I had to turn the server off and
turn it back on.

123
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.060
Okay.

124
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.860
Today we learned.

125
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.560
Cool, well, we also fixed some ID stuff
because they would have all been checked

126
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.340
at the same time.

127
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.572
And it looked like I did magic that
wasn't really accurate or true.

128
00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.780
So that's good.

129
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.259
Now I shouldn't have
to restart the server.

130
00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:19.780
I think it was unaware to even
read those files as it went along.

131
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.361
Okay, cool, cool, cool, so,

132
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:31.230
All right, now we have something that
looks a little bit like a file tree.

133
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.510
Okay, so we wanna say.

134
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.790
So I might have to change some
of the structure here as well.

135
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.270
But let's think about it for a moment.

136
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.127
In fact, one would argue
do I need that extra div or

137
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.230
can I just do the UL in this case?

138
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.550
These could all be.

139
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.510
Yeah, that feels better.

140
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:02.990
Okay, so there are a bunch of things
you can do as I think through this.

141
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.993
So I want to say basically when
this first checkbox is checked,

142
00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.042
all of the rest of them, right?

143
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
these need to ask up to the parent.

144
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.481
But again, just going for

145
00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:25.720
a checkbox is not going to get
me all the way there, right?

146
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:39.249
Let's see, we'll make this.

147
00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:45.966
In fact, I don't even need
that div probably either.

148
00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:47.040
Put it back if I need it.

149
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.800
But just a less is more kind of thing.

150
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.915
Okay, so if the parent is checked or

151
00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:59.368
actually the first thing I would try,

152
00:09:59.368 --> 00:10:04.652
let's see if it works, is to say this

153
00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:09.610
is up here and to say peer checked.

154
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.770
Let's do something simple like opacity 50.

155
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.810
Now this is weird.

156
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:32.290
So what we might then do
is do pointer events.

157
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:32.790
None.

158
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
now you can't click these.

159
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.350
Yeah, we might have to do something
visual with the box at that point.

160
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.964
Cause you can't like make like
you can do like an icon or SVG or

161
00:10:49.964 --> 00:10:52.510
something like that, you know.

162
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:59.030
But like theoretically you can't
like check the actual box.

163
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.696
That's why a lot of times
you'll see those other things,

164
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:01.750
you get some programmatic control.

165
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.035
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But yeah,
this looks like magic to me.

166
00:11:06.035 --> 00:11:07.820
Piercing is really cool.

167
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.380
What if you have more than
one of these on a page?

168
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.209
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
I mean at that point what I would probably

169
00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:18.460
do is just kind of use a little
bit of hierarchy, right?

170
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.380
So if we did this,
I'm gonna get yelled out for the IDs.

171
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.820
Deal with that in a second.

172
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.247
Right, and we'll give this one.

173
00:11:31.247 --> 00:11:38.460
At Least let's give at
least the folders new IDs.

174
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.060
So then theoretically you could do that.

175
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.540
Right.

176
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.700
Just by using the divs to
kind of section it off.

177
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.723
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can you just explain
more about what does pure mean when we

178
00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:55.610
use this tailwind class?

179
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What are we saying?

180
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.690
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
effectively what's happening is this.

181
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.058
We're saying, hey,

182
00:12:07.058 --> 00:12:12.326
the squiggly, the tilde, is to say,

183
00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:18.432
I came after an element
with this selector.

184
00:12:18.432 --> 00:12:22.108
So if you are one where previously
there is a peer check and

185
00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.870
you are one after that,
then this applies to you, right?

186
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.630
It's hard to explain the squiggly and
the star.

187
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.322
The star is the current one and

188
00:12:29.322 --> 00:12:33.870
we're saying if this matches where before
me there was a peer that was checked.

189
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.750
Squiggly line me, I am disabled, right?

190
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.110
Or pointer events.

191
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.030
I'm the illusion of disabled.

192
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.776
There are some serious questions here that
we'd have to think through about Aria

193
00:12:46.776 --> 00:12:49.950
tags and actually the semantic meeting.

194
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.710
Not totally sure you'd get away without
JavaScript just simply for accessibility.

195
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.593
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

196
00:12:54.593 --> 00:12:56.950
visually you can totally do it.

197
00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.750
But in CSS we really only have
access to visually, right?

198
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.409
And so it's just a little bit trickier
when we think about accessibility and

199
00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.190
screen readers and stuff like that.

200
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.070
That point JavaScript
probably does show up.

201
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:09.762
But yeah.

202
00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:11.785
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thanks, this is great.

203
00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:12.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

204
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Further than I thought
we could get without JavaScript.

205
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.056
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
it's like one of the things, like I said,

206
00:13:19.056 --> 00:13:23.520
you will be going on a walk
a week from now and be like,

207
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.200
I could just not write all those little
use states or whatever to do this.

208
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.105
I can basically, especially if it is stuff
about like that is visual in this case, so

209
00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:33.880
on and so forth.

210
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.440
Cool.

211
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.769
There is kind of another tangentially
related one that I want to tackle

212
00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:46.570
that is a little tricky as well,
which, which is the pattern.

213
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:52.671
A lot of times you see this in messaging
apps where what looks like an input field,

214
00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:57.066
but the submit button is inside
the field where you can send

215
00:13:57.066 --> 00:14:00.835
the message inside something
along those lines,

216
00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:04.890
which can also take advantage
of a lot of this as well.
