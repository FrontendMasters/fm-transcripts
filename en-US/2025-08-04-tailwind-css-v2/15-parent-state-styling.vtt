00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're doing this
in chronological order, right?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.872
By chronological order I mean things
that existed into older versions

3
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.018
of Tailwind first and
then we will get to the new hotness and

4
00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.760
all of them interplay with
each other super nicely.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.729
But it feels logical to do it
when to do it in the order

6
00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:29.070
in which they were received
into CSS Tailwind.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.559
The first interesting one for us is, and

8
00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.470
this is some Tailwind doing some
CSS syntactic sugar on your behalf.

9
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.190
Can you do this all in regular css?

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.630
Of course you can.

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.990
When we hover over it, I will show
you that you probably don't want to.

12
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.730
So there is this tailwind
class called group.

13
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.970
You can put this on any parent element and
it does nothing good talk.

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.450
What it does do is it allows
you to then anywhere in there

15
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.050
have any of the other ones you
saw before hover active focus.

16
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.810
Why you use focus within on a group,
I don't know.

17
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.156
But any of those things, it will allow you
to say group any of those variants and

18
00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:27.640
to say okay,
when it is true for the parent.

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.920
This is what I want to happen.

20
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.240
Right?

21
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.877
And so
if you wanted to have a card where, hey,

22
00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:38.412
don't put any underlines on the link until
they hover anywhere over the card and

23
00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:43.240
then throw underlines on the entire thing,
we'll do it in a second, don't worry.

24
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So that lower group
hover will refer to the higher group.

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Exactly.

26
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.490
Yeah, exactly.

27
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you could have something
that's nested quite deep and say it for

28
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.210
whatever reason.

29
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.810
It's bold.

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450
I want everything bold.

31
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
it wouldn't be necessarily bold.

32
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.954
It would be like these variants of hover
active focus invalid valid the pseudo

33
00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:04.530
states.

34
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.665
So yeah, as you can see, a border and
a background would have done a lot of good

35
00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:13.570
in this example, but
it didn't occur to me at the moment.

36
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330
So as I can hover over the parent card.

37
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.599
We can also.
We have cards, we have checkboxes,

38
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.434
we have this stuff we can do in Storybook
in a second as I hover over the parent,

39
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:26.090
this thing that has group hover.

40
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.850
Anything that happens with a group
applies to this given one.

41
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.350
Right?

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.170
Well, so here's like, here's a card.

43
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.810
I did it.

44
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.050
I was like, I should have put
one with a border and stuff.

45
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.210
Look, next example.

46
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.010
I did do that.

47
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.730
Go past me.

48
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.450
Okay, so we look at this.

49
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.650
It's got group.

50
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.970
I'm not going to hover over it just yet.

51
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.850
I'm not going to run the surprise.

52
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.570
We've got group.

53
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.317
And here we say on the button Is that,
hey,

54
00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:56.810
we're learning about CSS
transitions right now.

55
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.770
It's fine if they hover over the group.

56
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.210
I want to make the Buy now
button a little bit bigger.

57
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.224
Now you can see as we hover
over anywhere in the card.

58
00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.200
You can also see the title changes color
because I was getting carried away.

59
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.360
And so
you can kind of get these cool effects.

60
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.560
And we'll look at that in a second.

61
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.960
We can do it to one of
our cards if we want to.

62
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.000
We can do it to the checkbox.

63
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.800
We're going to do it to a bunch of stuff
over time, but it works for anywhere.

64
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.920
Anything that you can basically,
on the state of the parent,

65
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.080
apply different classes to the children.

66
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.050
The other one is,
we haven't talked about has yet.

67
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.628
So the other one that we have is peer,

68
00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:46.370
which is simply the only nuance here.

69
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.410
And this is just a CSS thing, is peer is.

70
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.175
You can put peer on any given class and
it has all the elements,

71
00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:58.380
all of its sibling elements after it,
not before.

72
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.460
It's a limitation of css.

73
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.170
So you can say, okay, this label,

74
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.500
I don't think that one works.

75
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.266
Yeah.

76
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.620
So, yeah, so
we say that this input is peer.

77
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.250
And then you can see that this
error message says if any element

78
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.430
before this one is invalid,
make the text red, right?

79
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.030
And so this is the email address.

80
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.831
And so you can say automatically, I don't
have to like apply a bunch of classes and

81
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:33.510
look at the state and
regexit or anything like that.

82
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.843
I can simply say, hey, if this input
field is invalid, whichever one is marked

83
00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:44.190
peer in this case, as you can see,
it does not work beforehand though, right?

84
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.150
Because ideally, if this worked,
you would see the label.

85
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.430
It only works for once after.

86
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.830
And I will show you there are ways.

87
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.190
There are ways.

88
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.710
There are ways that only existed
not too long ago, though.

89
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.150
The last time we did this workshop,
there were not ways.

90
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.772
Last time we did this workshop,
I was playing fast and

91
00:05:03.772 --> 00:05:07.630
loose with the ordering and then like
Flex reversing them and a whole bunch of.

92
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.310
Yeah, that face is appropriate.

93
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.930
But like I said before, if there are
things that are terrible, eventually they

94
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.920
get added to the platform as additional
hacks on top of all the other hacks.

95
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.600
So we will see how to make both red.

96
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.000
If this was invalid, we will get there.

97
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.840
But right now, peer works for
anything subsequently afterwards, right?

98
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.104
Which means that, yeah,

99
00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:34.520
prior I would do terrible things like
swapping the order of the label.

100
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.480
Actually, this one would work, right?

101
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480
I could do something.

102
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.160
Let's do it right now.

103
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.040
We'll say Peer.

104
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.305
And then for the label, I'm going to say
class because it just happens to be in

105
00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:49.820
this one that the label
comes after the input.

106
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.700
If you think about our text inputs,
the labels came before.

107
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.620
This one just happens to work great.

108
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.900
So let's do it.

109
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.020
We'll say peerchecked.

110
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.620
Is this strikethrough?

111
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.021
Apparently, off the top of my head,

112
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.770
do not remember the class four
putting a line through through.

113
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.370
You know what,
we're just going to make it green.

114
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.090
It'll be great.

115
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.171
And I will show you my trick for
when you forget a class right afterwards,

116
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.610
because I'm going to
need to use my own trick.

117
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.810
So here we'll say we put the pure class
on this checkbox and then we'll say if.

118
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.171
If you have a older sibling in
line order that is checked,

119
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:49.890
then turn the text to Green500 and
let's pop over to our storybook.

120
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.890
You can now see that when the checkbox
is checked, it turns green.

121
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.410
But that's not what we want.

122
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.930
We want to figure out how
to do a strikethrough.

123
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.370
So let me show you my trick.

124
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.140
You go to tailwindcss.com you hit
Command K and you start typing.

125
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.180
No, that's for css.

126
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.300
There is a way to put a line
through stuff in css, right?

127
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.140
I definitely have it in
one of the examples.

128
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.740
I can go find it in a second,
but I've forgotten for a moment.

129
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.020
But anyway, this, the point stands.

130
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.940
Command K on the tailwind docs.

131
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.700
You wanna find out all the colors
to start taking colors.

132
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.420
Here you go.

133
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.660
But yeah, so peer will work for
any sibling.

134
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.660
Comes after group works for any child.

135
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.900
And for the longest time,
that was all that you had to work with.

136
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you
try line dash through?

137
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.350
For the strikethrough?

138
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Adding
a line through text.

139
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.750
Text decoration line through.

140
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.470
There it is.

141
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.510
Perfect.

142
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.270
I kept thinking strike through.

143
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.181
Right?
Because that's usually,

144
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:07.750
I think what it's doing.

145
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It says strike through
a text decoration line through.

146
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't know why.

147
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.070
Let's do it.

148
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.990
Text decoration line through.

149
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.670
This is why you live
code with your friends.

150
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.240
Hey, there it is.

151
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.160
Teamwork.

152
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.453
So like I said, prior to Tailwind 4 and
Modern, CSS Group and

153
00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:34.520
peer were all you had to work with.

154
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.240
Right?

155
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.915
But there are a few more that we'll
take a look at in a second that we

156
00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:42.040
can kind of play with as well.
