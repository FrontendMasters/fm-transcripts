&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we talked about that theme layer.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.160
Like I said,
we saw that bg-blue-600, right?

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.960
We can look at the default colors in
the docs later if we're interested.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.114
You can add additional
colors like we want brand.

5
00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.755
We see this pattern that's built into
the tailwind default colors of blue-600,

6
00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:21.520
blue-500, is a range of shades, right?

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.090
You could just say hey,
I only want three of every shade.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.370
Like blue, blue, light, blue, dark.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.610
You can change any of these you want.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.530
Or you can just say here's our brand color
and maybe the secondary color as well.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.930
Now you can do BG brand and
you will get that color.

12
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.890
You change the CSS variable,
it changes everywhere in your app.

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.090
Life is good.

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.663
And it's all as you can see,
other than having that theme layer,

15
00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:50.970
it is just CSS variables
the whole way through.

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.858
There's also a bunch of what
we're going to call depending on

17
00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.850
the use case variants in a lot of cases or

18
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.340
utilities to do what would otherwise
been verbose things in css.

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.934
So we've got these responsive
breakpoints like MD and

20
00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:14.020
LG which will basically do
the media queries for you.

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.494
So if you wanted something to be
full width in the beginning and

22
00:01:18.494 --> 00:01:23.138
then when we get to a medium sized
viewport, go to like columns or

23
00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:26.062
whatever, you can just prefix a class,

24
00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:30.900
any utility class with MD colon and
then it'll do the media query.

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660
It'll nest everything appropriately.

26
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.165
You don't have to write all of that stuff,
it happens for free and

27
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:37.260
you can stack them.

28
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.610
So like MD hover, which means only on
a tablet ish device only only when

29
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.858
they're hovering,
have this background color and

30
00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:48.178
instead of like the pseudo
selector of colon hover and

31
00:01:48.178 --> 00:01:52.500
then also the media query inside of that,
you get to skip all of that.

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.020
And you what seems like, this is super
verbose when I look at the markup.

33
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.567
If you do the math in your head
on a long enough timeline,

34
00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.460
you end up writing a lot less.
