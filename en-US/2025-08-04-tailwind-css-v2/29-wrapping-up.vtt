1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This is Tailwind four,
right?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.283
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And so

3
00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:04.544
we're going to build all this stuff up and

4
00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:09.760
it basically ends up building a static
site and then Tailwind five comes along.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.560
I know it doesn't exist per se,
but what's the impact?

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.138
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can't tell
you the 4 to 5 transition,

7
00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:22.400
I can tell you having lived through
the 3 to 4 transition, not that hard.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.154
All the classes stayed the same, the big
changes were because they were using

9
00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:32.320
post CSS for whatever, the configuration,
all the variables and settings.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.637
That was a JavaScript file originally and

11
00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:41.323
the new system is a CSS
configuration file and

12
00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:45.897
there was some tooling
to migrate you over.

13
00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:52.047
I think I actually have the list
on the site that I compiled,

14
00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:58.320
so there's the new features,
more stuff, that's great.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.912
The configuration,
there's like the default

16
00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:09.040
placeholder color changed,
do you know what I mean?

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.211
I think the default border color
might have changed like from

18
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:17.480
like one gray to a more different gray or
something like that.

19
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.781
But if you had any of those,
like now defaults to current color,

20
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:28.930
which is whatever the text
color is instead of gray.

21
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.495
And there was a tool,
if you're interpolating CSS variables,

22
00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.490
it's parentheses instead of brackets.

23
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.067
I will say that it was such a not thing
that it didn't hurt, so I'm not super

24
00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.730
worried about that, and like,
this isn't forcing you to upgrade either.

25
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.326
If you want the new CSS features,
great, I mean, it doesn't force you to

26
00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:58.320
update anything, But I will say that
insofar that, it wasn't like a major.

27
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.986
Even though this was a major
rethinking going from having it

28
00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:07.185
mostly done in JavaScript
through a post CSS plugin to

29
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:11.360
everything is CSS all the way down,
not that big.

30
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.960
I think I might even start
on Tailwind 2 if I'm not,

31
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.033
I think I don't remember what
the version was four years ago,

32
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.770
I'm not pulling out the release
notes in front of you.

33
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.573
So I think I have now been through two
major version bumps and if you notice,

34
00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:28.250
my answer includes almost no
war stories at this point.

35
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.130
I think I went from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4,
even in the large app that we work on.

36
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.566
I think it was like two
days on the large app and

37
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:47.047
it took 20 minutes on my own site and
like for our older projects,

38
00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:52.630
like conference websites,
I just didn't update them.

39
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.038
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just let them be.

40
00:02:55.038 --> 00:02:58.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But
even when I did, not that bad.

41
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.181
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you have any resources
for how developers can choose the right

42
00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:12.340
colors in UI design when they don't
have access to a UI or UX design?

43
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.878
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is my favorite,
this is one I use all the time and

44
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.574
like in the Figma course, I show you
that there's actually a Figma plugin so

45
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.740
that like designers can
have the same ones.

46
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.940
But check this out, you pick a color,
you can pick your happy favorite color.

47
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.684
I just picked different shades of blue and
it will go ahead,

48
00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:35.620
you can actually even do some edits to
this as well as like what you want.

49
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.860
Let's say you don't want this
many colors stresses you out,

50
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.927
you can just make it fewer or
whatever, where'd that go?

51
00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:48.831
I'm just changing
the saturation that went.

52
00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:54.358
Anyway, you can go ahead and
you can create the entire color palette,

53
00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:58.575
hit export and
get literally the thing you can copy and

54
00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:02.900
paste out of this and
be able to go ahead and use.

55
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.908
So I like that a lot, there's also things
that I'm not even sure how good they are,

56
00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:09.290
I've just used them forever.

57
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.410
Is it Color Scheme Designer?,
is that what it's called?

58
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.338
I'm also not a designer,
so don't trust me,

59
00:04:20.338 --> 00:04:24.330
this is why I let Candice do this work,
Candace is good at it.

60
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.863
We can kind of go and create color scheme
systems and then, I'm not gonna lie to

61
00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:33.540
you, I picked the color I like and
I asked ChatGPT to give me the rest of it.

62
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.345
Now tell me what the complimentary
success, warning, error,

63
00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.868
whatever color is,
hire a real designer, to be clear, but

64
00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:45.380
if you don't have a real designer,
that's probably good enough.

65
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.746
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'll add to that our design
to Code Learning path is a good resource,

66
00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:54.340
specifically Sarah Drasner's design for
developers.

67
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go take that.

68
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: One more question came in.

69
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Love it.

70
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How would you set
up Tailwind in a mono repo?

71
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.528
Would you set up separate packages for

72
00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:17.526
Tailwind with Storybook to develop
the completed components and styles and

73
00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.430
import them for
the other packages or apps?

74
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Can you
repeat the question?

75
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I guess the general question
is how would you set up Tailwind in a mono

76
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.450
repo?

77
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.007
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You got a few options,
you can do the whole rigmarole where you

78
00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:39.450
like, package it up, so on and so
forth, the other option is where is it?

79
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.624
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think they're specifically
kind of interested in like the reuse of

80
00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:44.410
it across.

81
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Like it's a CSS file,
and so you mono repo it and

82
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.510
do like the NPM packages thing and
that will all work.

83
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.373
The other option is like,
you can legit reference it,

84
00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:05.590
you know what I mean?, And pull it in.

85
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.961
I would arguably, if you want everything
to have the same style and listen to

86
00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:14.830
the same CSS variables, having one file,
that's the source of truth makes sense.

87
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.585
Now if you do need different
versions in different packages,

88
00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:25.563
but I think where CSS in particular,
if one has PNPM or

89
00:06:25.563 --> 00:06:30.170
TurboRepo set up make it its own package.

90
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.184
But if it is simply like there's just
a different directory structure kind

91
00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:42.810
of monorepo, you can just reference
the CSS file, and that is usually what I.

92
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.012
We have always done, we have this or at
temporal we had this thing where our SaaS,

93
00:06:49.012 --> 00:06:53.930
cloud product and
open source repo were two different repos.

94
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.586
So it was a GitHub action syncing them up,
some of that all depends,

95
00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:03.370
but at the end of the day,
it's one CSS file.

96
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.059
You can either reference it, you can
package it up, it doesn't really matter,

97
00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:15.520
it's effectively all the configuration
is typically a single CSS file.

98
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just to piggyback on that,
isn't there a compiling function?

99
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.306
So project A could use this set of classes
and project B would use these set of

100
00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:28.000
classes, you'd have to have the superset
in the CSS if you're going to have one.

101
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.204
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What spits out of the
build processes would all be different,

102
00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:33.362
but the configuration of the variables,

103
00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:37.440
you probably want to share that across
all of them, that's a single CSS file.

104
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.666
That is just the configuration
of Tailwind and

105
00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:43.088
all your CSS variables and that brand
color as Steve was talking about,

106
00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:47.219
maybe if there's some other spacing,
some other different settings effectively.

107
00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:50.245
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That is usually one
not particularly long CSS file,

108
00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:53.615
where you might have all the brand colors,
everything and

109
00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:58.460
that can live in a shared directory in
a mono repo, it can be synced across.

110
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Honestly,
depending on how often it changes,

111
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.063
I'm gonna be like between
Temporal's marketing website and

112
00:08:07.063 --> 00:08:11.657
the UI, do you know how they
get synced up?, copy paste.

113
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.225
Works for our cloud product and

114
00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:20.550
our open source product is actually
a GitHub action syncing it all up.

115
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.804
But it changes so
infrequently that no one thought

116
00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:31.190
to do that especially no
one really needed to do it.

117
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.565
I think it depends, but
at the end of the day,

118
00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:39.444
it's really the only thing that is
gonna be unique outside of the actual

119
00:08:39.444 --> 00:08:42.176
utility classes that
you're using in your code.

120
00:08:42.176 --> 00:08:46.426
Which is your normal monorepo problems
that you already solve in your code

121
00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:48.354
is a single configuration file.

122
00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:53.112
That could even be like curl it down from
a source of truth on every package it

123
00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:53.950
installed.

124
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.991
You know what I mean?, it is uniquely

125
00:08:58.991 --> 00:09:03.730
simple, well, thank you so much.
