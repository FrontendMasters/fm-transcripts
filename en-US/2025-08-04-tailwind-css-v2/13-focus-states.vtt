&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's just talk for

2
00:00:01.547 --> 00:00:05.085
a minute a little bit more about focus
states and then we'll kind of get into

3
00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.880
some of the fun things we can do with
some of the advanced selectors as well.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.194
But first, let's eat our vegetables the
same way we did with borders, rings and

5
00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:13.840
outlines.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.000
There are a few focus states.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.840
Again, this is more CSS is awesome
than tailwind specifically.

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.088
Turns out when you take a document viewer
just meant for text from the 90s and

9
00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:37.786
everyone iterates on it for 30 years, you
have a whole bunch of strange properties

10
00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:43.910
and new properties that replace those
strange properties, so on and so forth.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270
Those are true of css,
thereby they are true of tailwind.

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.710
And here we are.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.380
So I just think it's useful to talk about,
so

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.630
there's focus and
we'll talk about each one of them.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.270
Then there's also focus visible and
then there's also focus within, right?

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.149
Which is both a deep meditative concept
as well as a CSS pseudo selector.

17
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.600
These again, are not tailwind specific,
but if we're going to be playing with this

18
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.856
stuff in tailwind, it makes sense if we
can spend a moment to disambiguate these

19
00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.330
so you're not squinting going like,
I don't understand when to use what.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.610
Let's talk about it.

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.250
So focus effectively always shows, right?

22
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.210
And so it's true both if I tab onto it
with a keyboard or if I click on it.

23
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.610
If that's the effect that you want,
okay, then good, use focus.

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.250
But if you're like, yo,
I had a hover state for the mouse.

25
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.113
But I do want to have some accessibility
stuff for tabbing to a button or

26
00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:47.010
maybe a particular card on the page.

27
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.110
Maybe it's something where it's got a tab
index so they can tab to it, right?

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.179
But for people with a mouse, I don't want
to just because they clicked on a card or

29
00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.350
a table row or whatever, show that border.

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.767
Focus is not going to do what you want
because it's always going to show whenever

31
00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.827
they've anything that's tab indexable,
if they've clicked on it,

32
00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:07.310
you're going to get the outline.

33
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.150
We don't want that.

34
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.992
As you can see here,
Focus visible is like the successor,

35
00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:17.950
cause people are like, I don't want that.

36
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.949
So then because you can't change
anything about the web ever,

37
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.150
you can only add more junk onto it, right?

38
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.904
So I was like, I don't like that
focus does that, well, they're like,

39
00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:34.964
well, we can't change focus, so we just
give you another thing on top of it and

40
00:02:34.964 --> 00:02:38.590
focus visible is probably
what you thought you wanted.

41
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.282
If you didn't want the other
thing where hover and click,

42
00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:48.949
I don't get the ring but if I tab
with the keyboard then I do, right?.

43
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.453
And stuff where it is you have
the keyboard navigation both for

44
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:54.760
accessibility.

45
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.320
For the last few years have worked on
Developer Tools UIs for developer tools.

46
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.435
Turns out you know who else likes
to use the keyboard to get around?

47
00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:07.280
Developers and so
I use this one a lot as well.

48
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
But I don't always want it if
they are just using mouse.

49
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000
Maybe I want a different set of styles.

50
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.640
The other one that is fun is focus within.

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.440
You'll see that I put
these inside of a border.

52
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.640
Focus within you can see
is on the parent element.

53
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.760
We will use all of these.

54
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.320
Don't worry,
we're just doing the thought process.

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.057
Part of this focus within is on
the parent element which is to say you

56
00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:32.880
can reverse engineer this from the words.

57
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.660
If anything inside of it is focused
then it will get that style right.

58
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.620
So if you have this, like in this case,
imagine this was a form.

59
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.860
I just didn't make it a form because
I don't actually wanna submit.

60
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.273
If anything inside of this is focused,
then the entire you know,

61
00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:52.900
then this parent is focused as well.

62
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.140
So those are three.

63
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.340
They're all CSS properties.

64
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.220
You have them all to work with.

65
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.607
They have the tailwind variants so

66
00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:04.794
that instead of making again another
pseudo selector every time, you just

67
00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:10.410
simply print prefix how you want the
classes applied in those given situations.
