00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's play around
with focus within for a second, right.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.440
And see like you're like,
this seems great.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.720
When would I want to use it?

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.520
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.320
So we're going to go take a look
at our good friend the checkbox.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.561
Because the checkbox also has some
interesting and fun things that

7
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:25.040
we can do to it as well that allow us
to explore some other fun features.

8
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.530
So we can go our good friend the checkbox
over here, it's just an input field.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.370
The only thing is I said no matter
what you are, type checkbox.

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.240
So here, I've got a checkbox.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.028
I can check it where focus within or

12
00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:45.170
any of these things can
become kind of powerful is.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.231
Let's say we gave this class,

14
00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:04.990
padding, I don't know,
just give it something.

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.118
We're team rounded.

16
00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:10.002
I noticed sweet.

17
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:16.267
So we've got that kind of styled
now I could focus the checkbox,

18
00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:21.270
but what I could also do is
I could say focus within.

19
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.469
And in that case we're gonna
say that the maybe the,

20
00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.120
Outline offset, I don't know.

21
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.280
So now you can see that also
the parent will also get styled.

22
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880
This also can be useful.

23
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.720
Like that seems fine as well.

24
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.246
And so if they are tabbed into it,
we can change the entire element as well.

25
00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.932
There are some other things we can
do with the checkbox too itself

26
00:02:08.932 --> 00:02:12.810
is looking a little kind of
squirrely when they hover over it.

27
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.370
So we could say something like
we'll play with a fun one first.

28
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.090
Which is by default they check it.

29
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.050
Look, it's blue.

30
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.229
Which very much works for
my particular use case.

31
00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.144
But like, what if the brand.

32
00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:38.020
What the brand is purple, right?

33
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.081
You can do that as well.

34
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:45.259
You can say accent purple.

35
00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.660
I don't know, 400.

36
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.700
And now if they go check it,
you can see now it's a purple checkbox.

37
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.740
That way you can access the underlying
pseudo classes in the browser and

38
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.075
style that as well and
have all of that in place too.

39
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:06.032
And as you can see as they interact
with it, if we had more than one,

40
00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:11.110
whichever one they clicked on last would
be the kind of focused one in this case.

41
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.553
But the entire section.

42
00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:14.221
So if you have something around it,

43
00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:16.731
you need that ceremony focus
within is good for that.

44
00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.338
We'll actually see
a really good use case for

45
00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:22.904
that a little bit where if we
wanted to have an input that looked

46
00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:27.310
like it had a button in the middle inside
of it, we could use it effectively.

47
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.090
Having the div around it look
like we're focusing the input and

48
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.380
the input to have nothing.

49
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.020
We'll see that in a little bit as well.

50
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.980
But yeah,
you can kind of see you can do accent.

51
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.432
We can also do stuff like but yeah,

52
00:03:38.432 --> 00:03:44.659
focus is no matter what focus visible
is if they got there from the keyboard.

53
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.420
And then focus within is if any
of the children are focused.

54
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.940
I guess technically there
is no focus visible within.

55
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.813
We can add that to the web too.

56
00:03:54.813 --> 00:03:59.720
That's at some point if we all want
to do that as well, cool, cool.

57
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.145
But now what we want to do,
it's one thing to say, hey,

58
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:11.156
I want the parent styled if
something is focused inside of it.

59
00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:14.699
What if I want to do something like, hey,
I would like this whole checkbox to be

60
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.480
different if it's valid or
invalid checked or unchecked.

61
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.034
What if I want one thing
styled differently

62
00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:26.469
based on something else in there as well.
