00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.407
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I'm gonna have you
do is if we look in our little skate park,

2
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.760
there's other buttons that
we might choose to make.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.360
A primary button, which we just made,
a secondary button.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.911
And we'll look how to make one button
where the prop handles it, but

5
00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.160
that's componenty, reacty stuff.

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.280
I'll show you how to do it.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.760
But right now we're just kind
of focusing on the markup.

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
So we'll have three buttons.

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.785
Grab either the secondary button or

10
00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:33.100
the danger button or both,
and try your hand at it.

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.580
And then we'll do one of them together
based on audience appeal when we get back.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.608
All right, so our mission was to
grab either the danger button or

13
00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:55.240
the secondary button and take a run at it.

14
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.018
I am not going to do both because at
some point you'll have watched me do

15
00:00:58.018 --> 00:00:59.160
the same thing three times.

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.456
So I'm going to grab the secondary
button because it allows me

17
00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.440
to make a segue at some point.

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.680
But I need my sidebar back.

19
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.800
There we go.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.960
And we'll go ahead.

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.771
I'm going to grab the secondary button,
and

22
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:24.210
we'll make that small and make that big.

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.890
So this one in the first example, I kind
of deleted the props and stuff like that.

24
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.050
But let's do it in this one so we can see
both and so we can just grab class name.

25
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.170
No, class does not react.

26
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.500
Okay, so again, secondary button,
that more subtle button.

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.860
We could either say
that the background is.

28
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.900
Again, it's all our choice and
what we want to do.

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.260
So I could even say something
like blue 100 if I wanted.

30
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.740
Or we can just leave the background
white at this point.

31
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.260
By default, it's technically transparent,
so it's up to you.

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.738
So if I wanted to just say bg-white,
let's do that one,

33
00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:10.860
because not all colors have
to have those numbers.

34
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.660
Those are just what
the variables are called.

35
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.451
The variable for BG Blue 600 that
we had in the last one was because

36
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.880
there's a css variable
called color blue 600.

37
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.520
There's not.

38
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.398
You know, there are grays, but
theoretically they're, you know, white is

39
00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:30.480
just the standard hex code in this case,
and there's not different shades of it.

40
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.320
Those are called gray.

41
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
And so
we've got this kind of white background.

42
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.160
We can give it kind of like
the same stuff we saw before.

43
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.350
We'll give it like PX of 3.

44
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.710
I forgot what we did, py 1.5 feels right.

45
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.231
Now the issue, obviously,
as you can see here, is like,

46
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.230
it's somewhat like suspicious where
the borders of the button are.

47
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.030
Before we had a solid color background.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.510
Now we've got the secondary
button that's white.

49
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.830
It's on a very light background.

50
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.430
We'll deal with that in a second.

51
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.790
We will just do the other classes
that we saw with the primary button.

52
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.470
So we'll give it some rounding
of the edges that we cannot see.

53
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.510
And we can give that small
shadow you can subtly.

54
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.648
Now it's slowly coming to life here with
a little bit of pop from the shadow,

55
00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:19.350
which is obviously a little more
obvious than we had on the blue one.

56
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.962
But then we get to a conundrum,

57
00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:25.430
which is maybe we want to
give this a border, right?

58
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.190
This is not necessarily a tailwind thing.

59
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.630
This is just a border thing,
which is we can say border.

60
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.923
If you just say border,
you will get, I think, like,

61
00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:42.480
you can actually see if you hover over it,
you will get a one pixel border.

62
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.520
Great.

63
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.918
And you can even say stuff like
anytime you load in a given

64
00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:50.079
color as the CSS variable.

65
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:56.320
So we had a CSS variable called
dash dash color dash white.

66
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.370
We had another one called dash dash color
dash blue dash 600, they are available.

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.970
So BG White will give you
a white background border.

68
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.890
White will give you a white border text.

69
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.050
White will give you white text.

70
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.675
It takes that one CSS variable and

71
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:15.209
it creates all the utility
classes you could ever want.

72
00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.930
So I could say something like border.

73
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.330
I could say border.

74
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.810
I like slate instead of gray,
but gray is an option too.

75
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.744
Slate is just slightly bluer.

76
00:04:28.744 --> 00:04:31.210
Cool, cool, cool.

77
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.546
And just to kind of show you,
I can make it red if I wanted to.

78
00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.207
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll make it slate.

79
00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:41.250
And so we've got that border there.

80
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.490
We've got a nice little shadow.

81
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.650
In this case, we can.

82
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.994
What else?
Could we do this better?

83
00:04:47.994 --> 00:04:50.090
We should give it like a hover state,
right?

84
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.480
We'll say hover:bg-slate,
I don't know, 100 feels right.

85
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.760
So I can hover over it.

86
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.840
So we've got a button.

87
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.936
We do have a little bit of
a problem with this button that is

88
00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:11.033
not necessarily a tailwind thing and
not super obvious,

89
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:18.490
but it's something worth talking about,
which is borders take up space, right?

90
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.018
So let's say hypothetically,
this button did not have a border and

91
00:05:24.018 --> 00:05:27.130
we want to say only have
the border on hover, right?

92
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.792
You can see that the button kind of moves,
which kind of looks cool,

93
00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:37.130
except I don't want it to happen
because borders take up space.

94
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.296
And so especially, like, if we made
the border a little bit more extreme so

95
00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:46.150
if we said we're going to give
it a border of like eight,

96
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.060
which is a lot of border for
a button, but it makes my point.

97
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.260
You can see the button itself
moves dramatically, right?

98
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.084
And considering that our primary
button did not have a border,

99
00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:04.500
means that one of these buttons would
have been bigger than the other if.

100
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.760
No, I want that hover in place
if we use a border everywhere.

101
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.816
Luckily, it's not necessarily a tailwind
problem because it's just putting a border

102
00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:16.640
on there.

103
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.360
It is, however, a fact of life with css.

104
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.520
And we'll kind of look at this in
a second that it does take up space.

105
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.480
Let's go back to a regular
border in this case.

106
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.800
The other option is just
do not use a border.

107
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800
So we have another option
here called outline.

108
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.760
Outline.

109
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.970
And we'll say that outline is slate,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 600.

110
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.930
You can kind of see it
moved a little bit here.

111
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.329
And that even if I had an outline of 8,
watch very closely as I hit save.

112
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:55.890
The button itself doesn't move.

113
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.770
So an outline is effectively a border
that does not take up space.

114
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.490
This is good for interactive elements,

115
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.690
where maybe I only want to put something
on there, or when they hover over it,

116
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.210
or if it's focused or
something along those lines.

117
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.930
I don't want the whole layout
of my page shifting, right.

118
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.290
We'll look at this more in a second.

119
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.222
But basically, my kind of rule is borders
are cool for structural things like cards

120
00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:26.090
and sections and divs and stuff like that,
where the border is part of the layout.

121
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.084
But if it's something like an input
element or something interactive,

122
00:07:29.084 --> 00:07:30.530
you probably want an outline.

123
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.214
And they have a third sibling called ring,

124
00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:36.450
which we will talk about
momentarily as well.

125
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.410
So we'll give this one outline of 2,
which is outline, which is outline of 1.

126
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.185
So this is actually no bigger than the
primary button that has no sort of border

127
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:45.890
whatsoever.

128
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.690
So we've got this button here, too.

129
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.530
Yeah, we have more to do with this button.

130
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.697
There's definitely more to do to it, but
I think we can change topics for a moment

131
00:07:56.697 --> 00:08:00.770
and then we'll come revisit our button and
learn some things and do some more.
