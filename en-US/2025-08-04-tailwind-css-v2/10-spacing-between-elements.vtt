00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.862
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We know how to
style an individual component, but

2
00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:06.080
turns out most pages tend not
to be just one component, right?

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.246
Usually you have more than one component
and you need to lay them out in some way,

4
00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.080
shape or form.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.640
And we've got a bunch of ways to do that.

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.478
We've got some of the older, tried and

7
00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:19.840
true margin kind of
based layout techniques.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640
We've got things like flexbox,
we've got things like grid.

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.720
All of those we will take a tour of today.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.920
But let's kind of we'll do them in,
I think, I guess,

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.040
technically chronological order.

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.322
Cool, so I think I have another one here
called Card List, where my card that I

13
00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:41.173
just made, this is the only reason
we pulled in any framework,

14
00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:46.040
the card that I just made, I can use
here without having to do it again.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.412
And what's the thing that jumps
out at us about these cards if

16
00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:52.563
we look at them all together?

17
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:56.250
They sort of stack on top
of each other and they're.

18
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.050
Yeah, they're kinda gross, right?

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.130
I'd like to let them
breathe a little bit here.

20
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.810
So there's a bunch of tools for this.

21
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.967
You can probably think of them
in your head already, but

22
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.770
we'll talk about one of them
that you kind of get for

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
free with Tailwind,
which is just a little CSS trick.

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.980
So I'm gonna go as opposed to the website.

25
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.940
Let's go into that card-list.

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.895
And you can see as soon as I put
away some ui that all card list

27
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.860
is the div that happens
to have four cards in it.

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.373
And Tailwind gives you some utilities
that you could totally write yourself in

29
00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:42.661
CSS but are just kind of
somewhat nice in this sense.

30
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:50.027
So one of the ones that we
can use is the space-y.

31
00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:53.940
The nice part is you can hover over it and
see what it does.

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.900
Visually, we can see exactly what it does,
right?

33
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.606
If we hover over the CSS,
we can kind of get a slightly

34
00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:07.796
better sense where if
it's not the last child,

35
00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:13.145
put some margin on the bottom or
end in this case.

36
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:16.470
And so that basically applies it.

37
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.430
So it's all of them, but this one
gets no margin at the bottom, right?

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.780
And that's just using this looks
a little bit squirrely, but

39
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.465
basically it's saying for
each one where it's not the last child.

40
00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:29.550
And there's ways you can
do this with stars too.

41
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.196
Go ahead and add some spacing in
between all of them, right, and

42
00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:39.100
you can just very quickly and
easily you can guess what space x does,

43
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.360
right, not the company,
it does between if they're horizontally.

44
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.693
So if you had a bunch of buttons,
you could do space x2 and

45
00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:48.600
put some space between
each of those buttons.

46
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.248
It has another fun friend,
which is gonna look a little

47
00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:59.967
weird with these cards,
but we'll get the point,

48
00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:05.810
which is divide-y and
we have to do divide over here.

49
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.690
Perhaps they don't work with the live
coded cards, but that's fine.

50
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.380
We have examples.

51
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.210
We saw before there's space-x, space-y.

52
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.130
It'll add some space in there.

53
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.010
Here's the horizontal version
with some random buttons.

54
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.057
Effectively, it's a little more
complicated than these days,

55
00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:25.970
but this would also effectively
show us what we're doing as well.

56
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.930
Divide just puts a solid color
in between each of them.

57
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.350
So we've got the divider,
we've got the overall background color for

58
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.190
the div, so on and so forth.

59
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.790
I have never actually purposely
used divide on purpose, ever.

60
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.270
I use the space all the time.

61
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.106
You can change the color of the dividers,
but

62
00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:48.590
basically it puts something you can
kind of see in between each of them.

63
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.816
I've always just used space, but

64
00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:54.590
you can mix them up if you're like,
what about flexbox?

65
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.630
Flexbox also works in this case and
we'll look at flexbox in a second.

66
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.509
There are some times where the problem
with flexbox is that it makes everything

67
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.769
inside the flex container a flex item,

68
00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.730
which could change things
in ways you don't want.

69
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.099
A lot of times this,

70
00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.370
because it's just adding margins
will get you most of the way there.

71
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.268
So this is here if you need it,
but if you're like,

72
00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:21.290
I'd rather just use flexbox, I get it.

73
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.579
That's cool, you should do that.

74
00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:23.571
I do that too.

75
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:28.601
All right, If I'm just doing it to
add some space I will use this tool,

76
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.100
if I feel like I'm also doing
a bunch of other flex stuff.

77
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.845
No harm in using flexbox, but if you find
yourself like, I wanted to use flexbox,

78
00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:39.580
but now I'm doing this other stuff,
and I was about to.

79
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.498
Every time you think you need to reach for
some kind of custom CSS,

80
00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:44.860
you probably don't.

81
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.820
There's probably something.

82
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.380
And so if flexbox feels more
appropriate for you, go for it.

83
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.890
But if you're like, I couldn't use flexbox
because reason I needed something, so

84
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.020
then I had to write my,
you probably don't.

85
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.445
Right, it's like most things that I think
about with most libraries or frameworks,

86
00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:05.318
which is if you feel that pain,
everyone else probably feels that pain, or

87
00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:07.050
you're doing something wrong.

88
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.410
But if you feel that pain,
everyone else feels that pain.

89
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.156
And if everyone else feels that pain,

90
00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:14.730
there's probably something in
the library that does it for you.

91
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.346
Or there's also the chance
you've gone to a weird place and

92
00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:20.090
you need to rethink things.

93
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.515
But generally speaking, that applies.

94
00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:28.170
And we are gonna play with that
card spacing multiple times.

95
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.730
We'll take a look at it with the spacing.

96
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.210
Let's later, we'll go and
change it to flexbox.

97
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.067
After that, we'll go change it to grid,
just for funsies,

98
00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:38.210
and play along with it all the way and
see how all of those apply.

99
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.730
So that's kind of our first
foray in there as well.
