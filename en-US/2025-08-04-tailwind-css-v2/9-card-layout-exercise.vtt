00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.001
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's time to give
you a little bit of a challenge,

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.760
which is this is a little
bit of choice time here.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.231
We're gonna kinda go
into the Card section and

4
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:15.160
we're gonna try to kind of
begin to lay out a card.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.420
So if we look right now,
it's just these are interpolated in again,

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.018
if that stresses you out,
you can delete the script tag and

7
00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:25.600
just put in some hard coded values later.

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.240
I wanted to use more than one card and
I wanted them to say something different.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.070
What we'd like to do is
kind of get to this again.

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.390
If we look at the card right now,
we can see it's not much to look at.

11
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.350
What we want to do is apply some
of what we just saw with borders.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.430
I think a border is appropriate for
the card, a background color to it.

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.541
The part I haven't shown you yet

14
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.350
that you're just going to explore a little
bit on your own is the typography.

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.130
The hint that I will give you is text and
font.

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.490
Makes sense, right?

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.682
You'll see some options in there as
well and your choice on how exactly

18
00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:09.690
you wanna style it, but let's go
take a run at adding some kind of.

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.730
Cuz we use this card to lay out
a whole bunch of other stuff later.

20
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.744
So let's get a card that we feel good
about that we would like to use at various

21
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:18.730
points in our time together.

22
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.470
So try to apply things at your disposal.

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.442
Borders, background colors, text colors,
text dash, you'll see some text

24
00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:31.430
sizing stuff, font, you can change the
font if you want to, so on and so forth.

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.445
But let's get the kind of basics of one
of these cards that we're gonna tweak and

26
00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:35.869
play around with a little bit.

27
00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.363
But apply some of these ideas and
then we'll kind of do it together and

28
00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:42.270
then add a bunch of cards
together to see how to lay stuff.

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.279
So our mission is to apply some of the
things we were playing with the button to

30
00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.560
just something that's not a button,
honestly.

31
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.784
And like I feel like the button is my
hello world of every time I'm trying to

32
00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.600
either build a design system or
play with some styling tool.

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.440
And then like the like next one is like
some kind of like card like thing.

34
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.988
Right.
So

35
00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:12.060
really the only real big change here is
now we have more than one element, yay.

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.876
But we can kind of see how quickly that
kind of rapid prototyping piece comes

37
00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.100
together, right?

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.617
And if you've got other things that you
did, yell them out or like interject and

39
00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:24.540
we'll do those too.

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.265
But I'm just gonna kind of like vibe,
not that version of Vibe coding, but

41
00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:34.140
just kind of like go with the kind of
piece of how I would normally approach it.

42
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.020
So I'd probably give it
some kind of border.

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.200
I like border two.

44
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.591
Feels like with my screen zoomed in,
Border two now feels egregious, But I feel

45
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:52.320
like at a normal viewport, it's probably
fine, but now I feel self conscious.

46
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.520
So border one and
border are the same thing.

47
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.680
As you can see,
that is the default in there as well.

48
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.880
Feeling a little tight.

49
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.742
So at this point,
instead of doing that like PX and py,

50
00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:03.736
I think this is a great opportunity for

51
00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:07.180
just a little bit of padding evenly
throughout the entire thing.

52
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.460
Are we feeling rounded in this case?

53
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.368
Are we feeling square rounded?

54
00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:14.230
Rounded.

55
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.859
Especially because someone from
the chat said rounded earlier,

56
00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.780
I feel like this is a rounded crowd.

57
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.380
On the temporal ui, we actually just did
the great de rounding of everything.

58
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.300
I didn't realize that
roundedness was controversial.

59
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.390
So we can give a rounded, again, the nice
part is, okay, you can look at that.

60
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.430
You can also just like look
at the regular rounded.

61
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.470
Whichever one makes you happier,
go for it.

62
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.550
You don't have to have
the exact same thing I have.

63
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.269
And you can give it also just like
a subtle background if you want.

64
00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.872
So, a lot of times the 50, which might
actually be my background color for

65
00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:52.670
the page, you can give it like a subtle
little background in this case.

66
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.850
Same with the border, you can say,
border is I like slate.

67
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.010
If you like gray, use gray.

68
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.370
If you want a different color,
go for that too.

69
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.010
I don't care.

70
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.090
Live your best life.

71
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.546
Okay, I like that.

72
00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:08.896
And so now we've got very quickly,

73
00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:10.929
I can just kind of type in
these classes immediately.

74
00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:14.189
I'm not jumping back and forth
between files, adding the class here,

75
00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.450
going to another CSS file.

76
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.857
I'm kind of just doing it in line and
getting the sense here as well.

77
00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:23.920
So for the h2, I don't like,
now you're just learning my personal

78
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.700
styling preferences,
which is not what you signed up for.

79
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.180
I like semibold, somewhere in between.

80
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.000
So you do font semi bold.

81
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.460
There's probably a rhyme or reason that is
better than I can articulate right now.

82
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.740
You do get the sense of which ones are
under font and which ones are under text.

83
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.370
I'm gonna say that it's text like lg,
just a little bit bigger.

84
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.090
Base is what you get to begin with.

85
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.133
So if you wanted to see base is
going to be that one rem, right?

86
00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.330
For the rest,
everything is based on 1 rem.

87
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.974
So base is 16 pixels.

88
00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:10.945
You can see this is 1.25 rem,
which is 18 pixels, right?

89
00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:12.250
How many font sizes are there?

90
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.650
You could check the docs.

91
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.890
You could also just start typing.

92
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.619
There is a little bit of a science
to getting auto complete to kick in.

93
00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:25.820
It's gotta go after the last one text and
you can kinda get a sense of obviously

94
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.103
numbers happen first in alphabetical
order, but one could scroll through and

95
00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:36.170
find the rest of them hiding out in
here as well, xl, xs, so on, so forth.

96
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.290
Cool.

97
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.930
So we've got that in place.

98
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.176
I will show you this next one simply
because I don't know if we need it right

99
00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:47.030
now or not.

100
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.350
But like we talked about padding,
would anyone like to venture a guess?

101
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.165
If P is padding, what margin is M M M so

102
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:58.990
he's a MT1 or something like that.

103
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.230
And I'll just kind of put
a margin top on that paragraph.

104
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.597
We will talk about other ways to space
things like literally in five minutes,

105
00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:08.150
but that is one way to do it.

106
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.262
There are also a few other things
you do in terms of line spacing and

107
00:06:15.262 --> 00:06:18.410
character spacing as well.

108
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.250
Most of the things in CSS
are possible here as well.

109
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.610
I don't know.

110
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.050
I don't have strong opinions on that.

111
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.498
If anyone does,
we can do it in a second, but

112
00:06:29.498 --> 00:06:33.050
I feel pretty good about
this card right now.
