00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So yeah, we could.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.080
Theoretically we have the checkbox open.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.240
So I'm gonna do, no,
I'm gonna let you do this one.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.069
I'm gonna do a slightly more complicated
one and then I will tell you what you're

5
00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.684
gonna do afterwards so you can think about
it in advance, which is we want to do

6
00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:21.299
something similar to what we saw earlier,
where if the checkbox is checked,

7
00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:24.920
we want to change the entire parent and
maybe, yeah, like,

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.464
like maybe we refactor out peer, but
let's do something that has been like I

9
00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:34.079
remember the last time we did this course
I joked like I did a bunch of squirrely

10
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.090
stuff because you couldn't fully do this,
especially in tailwind at that point.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.632
And the support for
has wasn't totally there yet,

12
00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:47.170
but now you can do it, which is one
of the patterns that I wanna do.

13
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.875
And again,
I don't wanna write any JavaScript, so

14
00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.090
I'm not writing JavaScript today.

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.650
Write JavaScript all day, every day.

16
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.666
I don't want to write JavaScript today
is I want to do the pattern where

17
00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:02.290
if a input field is required, I want the
label to have a little red dot after it.

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.450
Right?

19
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.290
Previously you couldn't do this
just in CSS because you could.

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.525
Like if the label came before the input,

21
00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:17.010
peer wasn't going to help you because
peer can only help the things afterwards.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.328
So previously you either
A had to use JavaScript or

23
00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:29.198
B the dark pattern that I did was I
put the label after the input and

24
00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:31.880
then Flex reversed works.

25
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
I used it forever but
now I never felt good about it.

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.160
How about that?

27
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.120
Now I don't have to do that anymore.

28
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600
I have that input that we were
playing around with before.

29
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.850
Gonna just get rid of the sidebar,
put you over on the side.

30
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.010
Nope, you can take up the full height and
then we'll grab you.

31
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.680
Nope, there we go.

32
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.810
We'll go into Storybook and
let's find the input.

33
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.181
This required input, right?

34
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:16.247
Now there's no visual indicator
that this input is required and

35
00:02:16.247 --> 00:02:18.617
we'd love to handle it.

36
00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.176
What I want to do is a little red dot or

37
00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:26.940
something right here if
it is in fact required.

38
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.014
But the thing is, again,

39
00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:34.860
we can't use peer because you can only
go from the input afterwards, right?

40
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.932
But I can use the combination of group and
has together now in order to actually

41
00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:47.060
implement this, the squirreliest part is
going to be putting the actual red dot,

42
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.920
not the actually figuring
out if it should be there.

43
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.906
So let's kinda do this iteratively.

44
00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:59.336
And what we're gonna do is we're
going to say that the parent,

45
00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:05.080
in this case, the div,
is gonna be one of those group components.

46
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.330
So now children can ask
about their parent, right?

47
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.170
And that parent will
be group in this case.

48
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.570
Great.

49
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.610
And so we have that.

50
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.236
And so for label, what I want to do is you
can if you need to do those before and

51
00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:23.084
after pseudo elements, you know that
colon, colon before, colon, colon,

52
00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:25.370
after, you can do that in tailwind.

53
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.864
I will warn you that the class names
themselves can be a little verbose,

54
00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:35.718
but arguably still less characters
overall than what you would

55
00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:38.490
do line wise in terms of css.

56
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.930
So you can do something after which
will be the after pseudo element.

57
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.641
Say after and we say the content.

58
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.610
We'll start with something simple.

59
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.326
And you'll see originally this is
somewhat problematic because that's just

60
00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:01.780
gonna put that after the label
no matter what, right?

61
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.020
And so if I go ahead and
I let's make you go to the bottom.

62
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.060
Whether or not it's required,
we still see that.

63
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.340
So let's deal with that in a second.

64
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.002
I'm gonna give the after a margin left of,

65
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:23.710
I don't know, 2, okay?

66
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.025
And I'll give the after

67
00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:34.350
a text read 600.

68
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.340
Okay, but like I said before,

69
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.110
not great that it says required
even was not required.

70
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.150
But luckily we can fix that super easily.

71
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.190
Where we can say just
where is that content?

72
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.642
We could say, group has,

73
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.070
Input that is required.

74
00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:14.279
So now if it's not required,
we don't see that if it is required,

75
00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.620
we do just pure CSS.

76
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.940
No JavaScript has to change.

77
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.060
All that has to happen is if the required
attribute is on the input, we get it.

78
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.180
And so a lot of times you won't
see the full word required.

79
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.220
You'll see something like at that point
I might move it a little bit closer.

80
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.980
But now by default, now whatever use
input if it happens required you see it.

81
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.060
No JavaScript needed.

82
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.900
And then I am insane.

83
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:47.611
So a lot of times what I'll do is
I'll do after block after width 2,

84
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:52.090
after height 2 and then I'll get rid.

85
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.610
I'll make it just empty content.

86
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.420
I think I did it after, no, I did after
block, after height 2, after width 2.

87
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:13.610
Got to make the entire thing flex.

88
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.370
It's just going beneath it.

89
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.130
So you can make the label
instead of block.

90
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.446
We're gonna make it flex.

91
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.469
What am I missing?

92
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.634
After block after height 2, width 2.

93
00:06:36.634 --> 00:06:37.690
Instead of text red.

94
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.833
No, we need that.

95
00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:51.180
That IntelliSense not helping me when
I've Got word wrap like that we can do.

96
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.660
We'll talk about flexbox in a second but
now I can get this nice little pretty dot.

97
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.180
Never write a line in JavaScript.

98
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.740
There are a lot of after selectors there.

99
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.060
I don't insist that you do that.

100
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.580
You could just use the asterisk or
required or some word like that as well.

101
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.000
But now you can theoretically again
this will just now work whenever.

102
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.880
Let's refresh that, make sure that sticks.

103
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.120
We saw that with the dot before.

104
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:30.280
Yeah, I know what I did.

105
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.170
I might have to do group has
on a bunch of these as well.

106
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.050
So we can just go with
the star too either way.

107
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.917
Cuz you can watch me type that over and
over and over again, but

108
00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:46.050
the previous example we
had before two will work.

109
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.410
We could also make.

110
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.418
I'll show you how to make a variant
in a second too where you can

111
00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:58.099
like if you find yourself doing that
too many times, we can go ahead and

112
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:03.620
just make the simpler version group
as required and then return it.

113
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.120
True.

114
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.140
Do it inline.

115
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.660
A lot of times you'll see this
instead because it is like way easier.

116
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.019
But yeah, required, not required.

117
00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:15.660
All there.

118
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.180
And you can style it as much or
as little as you want.

119
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.100
We can even take off that ml-2 if
we're just doing the asterisks.

120
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.586
But yeah, now you can do a bunch of
powerful things where you can figure

121
00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:29.303
out if any element I can sell before,
I can sell after by

122
00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:32.996
kind of doing the bidirectional
hey parent, do you have this?

123
00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:35.795
Hey, like ask your parent
if you have it right and

124
00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:39.660
then like earlier peers can have it,
so on and so forth.

125
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.820
There's a bunch of places
where you can do this as well.

126
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.344
Like it's one of those things where it's
like there are some very like high level

127
00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:52.933
like yeah, the required field having again
like if someone checks the like a given

128
00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:55.659
pricing thing that we saw before or
a checkbox and

129
00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.300
they agree to the terms of service,
you want to do something.

130
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.123
It's one of those things where it's like
there's some very kind of standard small

131
00:09:02.123 --> 00:09:02.780
little niceties.

132
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.497
But then there is probably that
thing where you found yourself doing

133
00:09:07.497 --> 00:09:10.980
a bunch of JavaScript
shenanigans that you like.

134
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.554
It's like I joke some of those features
where it's like a week from now

135
00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:20.513
you'll be taking a walk and be like
I could just do that and take that 10

136
00:09:20.513 --> 00:09:25.900
lines of 20 lines of code and turn it
into just a few CSS selectors, right?

137
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.900
And all code that you have
is code that can break.

138
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.380
So the less of it is,
the less of a liability.
