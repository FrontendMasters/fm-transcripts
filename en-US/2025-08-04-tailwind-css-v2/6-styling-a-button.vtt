1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so here we have.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.400
That's the markup that's giving
me that beautiful button.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.760
What we want to do is start to style
this button a little bit with tailwind.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.877
And the nice part is because I am
using some kind of component system,

5
00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:14.880
I can now import button
from whatever file.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.239
Again, this is felt.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.863
As long as you understand where to put
a class in your framework of choice,

8
00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:22.560
it'll work.

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.410
Could be react,
could be anything you want it to.

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.111
So here we can do class.

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:31.780
And as you see, I got that
Tailwind IntelliSense set up, right?

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.700
You get a sense of some of
the things that are happening.

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.503
So if I do BG,

14
00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:38.820
you can kind of see that IntelliSense
is giving me a bunch of fun stuff.

15
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.380
What color do we want this button to be?

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.220
Blue Seems good.

17
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.108
I used to work at Twilio where
their brand color was red and

18
00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:52.026
they made all their
primary buttons red and

19
00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:56.420
then had to walk that one back
because red means things, right?

20
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.153
How do you have a dangerous button?

21
00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:00.891
So they have a very beautiful
design system now called Paste.

22
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.018
So I can only tease because
that is a now solved problem.

23
00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:07.140
All right, let's give it.

24
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.388
The nice part about the IntelliSense
plugin too is you can see

25
00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:11.860
the shades, right?

26
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.660
And the heuristic here is the higher
the number, the darker it is.

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.420
You're like, I don't like these numbers.

28
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.470
That's just in the default theme.

29
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.670
You can override the default theme.

30
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.470
You can just make three.

31
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.710
Like I said before, light and dark.

32
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.990
You will regret that when dark mode
support comes, so don't do that.

33
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.404
When I was at Temporal the designer
working on the design system,

34
00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:42.238
I almost broke into tears trying
to come up with some names for

35
00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:44.510
colors we tried subtle and strong.

36
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.950
So that way dark mode still worked.

37
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
Nothing, no naming of colors that I
have ever tried has ever made me happy.

38
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.876
I can't solve that one for you,

39
00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:58.230
but I can at least tell you
that it's a known problem.

40
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.121
As you can see,
applying that utility class does what we

41
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:10.132
think it ought to do,
which is give it a blue background.

42
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:16.803
Still button still leaves a little
bit to be desired, right?

43
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.767
We could say text is white.

44
00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.580
All right, slowly but
surely we are getting there.

45
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.172
Other fun fact is,
with the IntelliSense plugin,

46
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:38.340
you can then hover over any of these
classes and see what the resulting CSS is.

47
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.353
This technique is how I learned
JavaScript 12 years ago,

48
00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:49.959
which is I was a Ruby developer and
so I would write CoffeeScript and

49
00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.160
then look at the compiled output and
figure out how to reverse engineer it.

50
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.474
So you can also get some sense about
how stuff is working under the hood by

51
00:02:58.474 --> 00:02:59.480
hovering over this.

52
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.840
There's nothing particularly.

53
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.648
These are fairly easy classes.

54
00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:09.293
But you can also see that using
the CSS variable out of the box,

55
00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.550
you can kinda see what's happening.

56
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.801
Other than the act of compiling
this style sheet for you,

57
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.859
there's not necessarily
a lot of magic in Tailwind.

58
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.430
There's some magic, we'll talk about it,
and we'll kinda hover over the time.

59
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.750
So what else does this button need?

60
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.910
What do we need to do to
feel good about this button?

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.264
We like this button.

62
00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:31.632
This is what happens when we
have a bunch of engineers.

63
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:35.224
If I had designers in the room,
they'd be like, I got opinions, right?

64
00:03:35.224 --> 00:03:37.880
We should have one designer
in the room to like.

65
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.800
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: You need a little
padding on the left and right.

66
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's get a little
padding on the left and right.

67
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
I like that.

68
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.560
So here you can say P for padding,
X for left and right, X axis.

69
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.314
For those of you who did not, those of
us who have taken 10th grade geometry,

70
00:03:54.314 --> 00:03:56.200
not everyone in this room has.

71
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.040
And let's see, you can also get a sense
even as you go through what these are.

72
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.960
Now, the kind of base here is really four,
which is one REM.

73
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.440
This is all based on REMs.

74
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.854
The nice part is for
those of you who do not speak rem,

75
00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:19.130
they put comments in there with
what that means in pixels as well.

76
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.098
So you can see where they talk
about that rapid prototyping piece

77
00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:26.950
is as I hit Save, I don't hate that.

78
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.830
That feels a little much right.

79
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.540
Now, we all know that in
a large enough design system,

80
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.948
you don't just have button, you have
button large and button small, and

81
00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:41.390
button medium and
button extra small maybe.

82
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.630
So, you know, you can tweak any of
these and have multiple versions.

83
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.710
4.

84
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.636
We can do 3.

85
00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:50.310
As you can see,
it's just a little bit less, Dustin.

86
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.772
&gt;&gt; Dustin: Daniel would like
some subtle rounding as well.

87
00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:55.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will
100% subtle rounding.

88
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.390
We're not going full like
Microsoft on this one.

89
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.750
Don't worry.

90
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.470
I think IBM is a lot of square stuff too.

91
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.660
So we can also,
if we wanted to see what it's like

92
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.583
on the top,
we can say like 1.5 here as well.

93
00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:17.750
Whatever we want.

94
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.629
If you wanted,
like if this was like let's say a card and

95
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.470
not necessarily a button,
you could do something like.

96
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.046
And that is going to be both top,
bottom, left, right.

97
00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:33.739
You can also do P.

98
00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:35.710
Like there's definitely.

99
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.262
I think it's IBM's design system where
it's like longer on one side than it is on

100
00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:41.110
the other or something like that.

101
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.000
So you can do like PL4PR6, and
that's just left and right.

102
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.080
Let's do some subtle rounding.

103
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.183
Let's stop going down that route.

104
00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:56.080
All right,
looking slightly more button like.

105
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.720
So the request was subtle rounding.

106
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.178
I have a bunch of rounded
classes that I can pull in,

107
00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:04.600
we'll talk about them in a second.

108
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.905
But let's just go with my personal
favorite, which is rounded md.

109
00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:12.730
All right, all right,
I feel good about this so far.

110
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.690
Let's just look at some of
the other ones for funsies.

111
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.050
There is a base rounded,
which is a little bit more subtle.

112
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.810
Whichever one you want, I don't care.

113
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.183
And if you want the base rounded to
be a little bit like the other one,

114
00:06:29.183 --> 00:06:32.496
you just tweak the CSS variable, right?

115
00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:35.210
At any given point,
that one's kind of built.

116
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.675
That one didn't see the CSS variable.

117
00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:41.025
But we can define a CSS variable and
tweak any of these along the way.

118
00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:44.301
Do we like this rounded or
we like rounded md more?

119
00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:48.970
Editing is going to be fun for this one.

120
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.810
So we all sit here and think about it.

121
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.570
I like md.

122
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.970
We're going to go with md.

123
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.096
The other one that is
useful is rounded full,

124
00:06:56.096 --> 00:07:00.470
which is definitely a hack that
will give you a pill like shape.

125
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.430
Or if this thing was symmetrical,
a circle, right?

126
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.670
Which is useful for
stuff like avatars and badges.

127
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.590
Using a fun CSS hack of calc, infinity
times one pixel will get you that.

128
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.262
Previous versions of Tailwind,
it was actually just border radius,

129
00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:23.390
like 999,000 pixels or
something along those lines.

130
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.270
I don't remember.

131
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.230
But you can get to a full one.

132
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.214
I'm gonna go md.

133
00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:31.307
What else does button need?

134
00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:34.915
I think it could use a subtle shadow,
right?

135
00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:39.107
[INAUDIBLE]
So we can do this shadow md.

136
00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:40.190
And it's subtle.

137
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.590
It's there.

138
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.568
What's cool about this is I don't
know about the rest of you all, but

139
00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:47.190
I have never in my life.

140
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.390
There's a few things that I
still don't know how to do.

141
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.382
One is I never remember
the actual HTML tag for

142
00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:53.590
bringing a CSS file because
I do it once a project.

143
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.262
I do know at this point,
but that's not fair.

144
00:07:57.262 --> 00:07:59.620
Also, I have never remembered
the syntax for a box shadow.

145
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.460
And now I don't have to.

146
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.318
I just know the shadow MD will work for
the most part,

147
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:08.540
which, you know and
you can do as you can see at any point.

148
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.899
Like, what other shadows are there?

149
00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:11.260
I'm glad you asked.

150
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.900
Right.

151
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.740
There's all sorts.

152
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.020
You can even change the color
of the shadow as well.

153
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.534
I don't want to, but
we can give it a shadow of 2 XL,

154
00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:23.553
which is going to be
a little bit more extreme.

155
00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:25.092
It doesn't look all that extreme,
let's see.

156
00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:31.189
Maybe refresh or is it just simply that
the contrast on my screen isn't great?

157
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:33.932
So, yeah, let's go back to md.

158
00:08:33.932 --> 00:08:40.458
You can kinda see all that in place and
very subtle shadow there.

159
00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:46.883
So now that looks like a button, right?

160
00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:47.480
We can even do.

161
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.840
Let's see, let's try shadow.

162
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.040
Dustin's looking at me like,
I don't know if there's a shadow there.

163
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.238
We're all gonna find out together.

164
00:08:53.238 --> 00:08:55.440
It was just a very subtle shadow, right?

165
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.200
If I make it some more egregious color,
we can see our shadow.

166
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.805
In fact,
I don't even like the MD at that point.

167
00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:03.600
I'm gonna make it a small shadow.

168
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.760
I just think that I made this
background color slightly off white.

169
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.440
So it's very subtle.

170
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.230
I think the background's like slate 50 or
something like that.

171
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.550
Okay, so we've got a nice
little subtle shadow there.

172
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.390
Now you'll be like, okay, yeah, but
I've used this CSS and JS stuff before.

173
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.630
What about pseudo elements?

174
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.348
What about pseudo selectors?

175
00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:25.987
Where am I gonna have to do that?

176
00:09:25.987 --> 00:09:27.590
I'm gonna put it inline style, aren't I?

177
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.030
No, no, no.

178
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.910
That is where those variants come from.

179
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.616
So now we could do
something like hover and

180
00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:41.677
we'll say hover BG blue,
make it slightly lighter.

181
00:09:41.677 --> 00:09:45.000
So if we look at that,
you can kinda see what it's doing, right?

182
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.204
It's defining a new class where it
is kinda escaping that colon so

183
00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:50.438
that is valid CSS.

184
00:09:50.438 --> 00:09:53.880
It's saying .hover:blue 500.

185
00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.225
It's basically saying make the media
query or the pseudo selector of hover,

186
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:04.919
so on and so forth, and
does some other modern CSS stuff.

187
00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.455
But now we can kinda go over.

188
00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:11.010
And when we hover over it,
we've got a button that interacts, right?

189
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.850
And anything else we
need to do this button.

190
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.090
Do we feel good about this button?

191
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.850
Any other changes?

192
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.010
I feel good about this button.

193
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.641
Dustin,
&gt;&gt; Dustin: The reordering of the classes

194
00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:28.050
that's happening on Save, is that prettier
doing that or is that the tailwind plugin?

195
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:28.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's a great question.

196
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.770
I'm glad you asked it.

197
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.740
I believe it's the.

198
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.700
I think on save.

199
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.263
It's both.

200
00:10:37.263 --> 00:10:39.782
Possibly cuz I have
prettier running on save,

201
00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:42.700
I think that the IntelliSense
plugin will also do it.

202
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.700
It will read the prettier settings.

203
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.900
I both have prettier running on save
as well as the intellisense plugin.

204
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.100
I am pretty sure they both do it.

205
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.189
But then also you have one
as a pre commit hook too for

206
00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:56.460
that person who didn't install it on
your team so they don't ruin everything.

207
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.020
You know who that person is.

208
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.579
Cool.
So we've got a button.
