00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
some anti-patterns and some patterns.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.880
Making one off classes in this case,
right?

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.760
Feels like, well, I need this class.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.000
I need one for my button, whatever.

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.640
I mean this class,
if you just go my button now it'll work.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.342
If you try to do hover:my-button,
it won't,

7
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:27.868
cuz you didn't give it the right hooks for
it to figure that out, right?

8
00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:32.841
Instead, @utlity my-button,
now Tailwind knows,

9
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:36.540
okay, when I see hover colon or md colon,

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.172
it just gives it the wiring to
know how to do all of that, right?

11
00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:48.015
Another one is you can at any given point
opt out of all of the theming stuff and

12
00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.490
use arbitrary values, right?

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.767
And this will all work.

14
00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:57.917
Good luck refactoring that code later,
right?

15
00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.820
It's kinda using arbitrary
values anywhere, right?

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.100
The more you kind of go rogue on
certain places, the sadder you will be.

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.793
But at any given point, if you're like,
I need this one off one time thing,

18
00:01:09.793 --> 00:01:12.580
you can use this bracket syntax and
it will totally work.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.975
You will just be sad on a long enough
timeline and then you'll be like,

20
00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:19.310
I hate Tailwind.

21
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.830
You don't hate Tailwind.

22
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.236
You got to look inward at that point
instead, just set some theme variables and

23
00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:29.329
again, if you're only using it once,
sure, use the arbitrary value.

24
00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.768
But if you just nested the same color a
thousand places in your code base, again,

25
00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:37.881
the worst crimes I have ever committed
on my own code base is getting a little

26
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.350
egregious thinking I know regex better
than I do when I find and replace, right?

27
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.672
And so
we can just add additional utilities and

28
00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.000
these will be supported everywhere.

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.354
You will be happier over the long term.

30
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:54.880
So yeah, just the high level things.

31
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.440
And again, we will see these in practice.

32
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.760
They are just kind of to put some mile
markers in your brain as we go along.

33
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.026
When in doubt, probably have most
of our styling happening in HTML,

34
00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:13.238
the air quotes because
that HTML might be jsx,

35
00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:19.520
that HTML might be a svelte file,
that HTML might be angular markup.

36
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.120
How about that?

37
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.660
Other than tweaking our theme will
probably not spend too much time in

38
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.303
CSS land.

39
00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:32.600
You're like aw, or you're like, yes,
both of those are very good reactions.

40
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.676
We'll look at tweaking
the theme as we need to and

41
00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:40.702
occasionally if we need to make on either
side of that colon, you can make custom

42
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:45.300
utility if you need to make a new kind
of what you would think of as a class.

43
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.919
But if you also wanna have that
MD colon makes a media query and

44
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.100
puts the class inside of it.

45
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.605
That's what we call a variant, you can
make those as well as we go through.

46
00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:59.424
And with that, let's go get set up.
