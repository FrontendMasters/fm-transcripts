00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.560
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's a bunch
of ways to do dark mode.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.600
The default way is there's a media
query based on prefers color scheme,

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.680
light or dark, which is basically.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.880
That just reads the os, right?

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.624
Like if you were in dark mode in macOS or
Windows, great,

6
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.120
it'll render dark mode if you are in.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640
Yeah, like whatever.

8
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.560
It'll just basically go
in the operating system.

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.650
The other way to handle dark mode is,
is to simply have a class called dark.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.517
And if anything inherits from that class,
anything under that class,

11
00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:32.290
it should be dark.

12
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.050
Tailwind will let you
do both out of the box.

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.730
It is going to just do the user
color scheme right now.

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.050
Nothing we have done so far.

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.730
I mean, it works in dark mode,
but it's just light.

16
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.530
So let's talk about what
that might look like.

17
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.666
I'm going to go into I don't know,

18
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:54.170
let's go back to that card list because
I'm pretty sure those will break.

19
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.060
Really?
We have to go to card.

20
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.860
Card list is just a bunch of these
cards and we can see what happens.

21
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.420
So in the storybook, I get so angry
when I change the size on it too much.

22
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.220
I didn't write this.

23
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.900
It's not my fault.

24
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.660
I have this little toggle here that will
change me between light and dark mode.

25
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.416
As you can see,
that's not a good look, right?

26
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:27.555
And even that darker background is
actually me using dark mode in tailwind,

27
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:32.390
honestly what would normally happen
is it would look exactly the same.

28
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.615
I just cheated a little bit because
going to Storybook internals,

29
00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:37.350
I do an entire course on Storybook.

30
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.590
If you want to learn how to
do this yourself, let's not.

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.030
Anyway, can we all agree that this
is a problem that needs solving?

32
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.900
Yes, right?

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.220
Making people do this in
order to read the content.

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.660
You're not gonna pass accessibility
standards on readability like this.

35
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.620
I think that's fair.

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.860
So we can go into that card and
check out how easy this is.

37
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.100
Okay, so we said that the BG is slate and
the border is whatever.

38
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.370
What we can do is we can say

39
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.610
dark colon, BG slate 800.

40
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.650
Dark colon, BG, No border, slate.

41
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.130
I want darker, lighter.

42
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.690
I don't know.

43
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.110
Let's do 700.

44
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.710
If I don't like it, I'll swap them.

45
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.470
It'll be fine.

46
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.550
And we'll say dark text slate.

47
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.710
No, the text will be white.

48
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.088
At that point everything will be good.

49
00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:05.800
So put those classes in, and
we can see that things work in dark mode.

50
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.040
Now there is a caveat out of the box.

51
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.160
The default, as I said, A second ago and
then forgot that I said it out of the box.

52
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.967
Dark mode by Tailwind is triggered when
the user the prefers color scheme is dark.

53
00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:28.567
And so that's like, if you ever wanna test
it out yourself, you can go in the Chrome

54
00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:33.280
dev tools, you can, you can grab
an element, you can hit this paintbrush.

55
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.480
I have it set to manual.

56
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.989
So it's not gonna do anything right now,
but

57
00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.160
you can like force into either one of
these, and you will see that, right?

58
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.040
The other option.

59
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.720
Cause like that'll work,
that will follow whatever the OS is doing.

60
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.029
However, you've probably seen
a lot of cases where it's like

61
00:03:54.029 --> 00:04:00.430
you can toggle between day and
night mode or system settings, right?

62
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.790
And Tailwind will respect that.

63
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.710
You just need to tell it what
the thing you want to do is, right?

64
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.430
So for example,
in some cases that might just be.

65
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.350
You put a dark class on things, right?

66
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.990
Great.

67
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.142
Sometimes you might have like,
does GitHub have

68
00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:26.110
this where there's like
various shades of dark, right?

69
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.798
And so a lot of times you might have
a data attribute which is like data

70
00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:31.950
themedark, right?

71
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.504
Any of these things,
if you just want one of those other ones,

72
00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:39.470
you just need to give it some kind of.

73
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.709
This is a custom variant.

74
00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:45.827
So we just changed dark to mean anytime
you're in a class that you either

75
00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:51.310
have the class called dark or you are a
child of something, and in dark mode.

76
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.678
And so if instead you wanted
to use a data attribute,

77
00:04:56.678 --> 00:05:03.510
you can do like data theme equals dark,
so on and so forth, right?

78
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.790
I'm using the class one in this case.

79
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.819
And this will then say like,

80
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:12.310
hey, also trigger dark mode if
they are in something, right?

81
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.122
And this is nice because then you do the
toggle, that does involve JavaScript where

82
00:05:16.122 --> 00:05:19.240
then you put the class on the body and
now everything is in dark mode.

83
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.800
That way people can choose to be in dark
mode even if the browser's in light.

84
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240
And more importantly,
who can also do that really easily?

85
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.640
You Without either going into the dev
tools or anything along those lines.

86
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.160
And so kind of just using that
dark variant, you can go ahead.

87
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.400
And now things will automatically support
light and dark mode with again, just.

88
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.000
You treat it like responsive design,
you start out in light mode, right?

89
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.783
I guess you could theoretically
take that custom variant and

90
00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:54.466
make one called light and start in dark
mode and then implement light mode.

91
00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:55.960
That's a thing, I guess.

92
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.440
But you kind of like set
that up as well and dark and

93
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.240
light mode become super easy and
you just say how things should change.

94
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.600
In these cases as well.
