00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What my challenge for you
is again, we can remove some of the ones.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.320
You don't need as many boxes as you want.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.779
What we kind of do is want to get that
traditional blog layout where you've got

4
00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.600
a header going across the top, a sidebar
either side, your choice, and a footer.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.467
The sidebar should be a static amount and
kind of get that top, bottom,

6
00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:25.785
that master detail view that all the time
we see in macOS apps, where we would see

7
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.652
something along the top, any kind
of webpage we've ever seen before,

8
00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:33.016
the header, the footer, and
then two columns in the middle.

9
00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:35.240
But responsive,
we want a one column layout.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.760
So we'll start out and I won't
totally give you the answer just yet.

11
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.176
And honestly the exact
details are kind of,

12
00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.600
I'll leave it as
an exercise to the reader.

13
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.040
We don't want that order there either.

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.890
That's that min height killing me there.

15
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.810
And this row span three.

16
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.889
Just cleaning up everything.

17
00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:11.970
And you can use as many of the nine
as you want and everything.

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.335
But we wanna ust kind of have that header,
footer, sidebar.

19
00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:19.940
But where it starts out on mobile,
something closer to this, right?

20
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.900
And then kind of as we grow out,
like this should be along the top.

21
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.820
These should be siblings to horse's side.

22
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.511
And maybe 4 is a footer.

23
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:29.996
If you wanna have more in there, you
wanna have two sidebars, have fun, do it,

24
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:30.786
I'm here for it.

25
00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:35.180
Any of those that make you happy, whatever
kind of layout that changes, right?

26
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.549
But our job is to mix some amount
of the ordering, the spanning and

27
00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.140
the break points for
some layout that makes us happy.

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.820
If it's something slightly different or

29
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.740
something that like applies to you,
go for it.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.096
We can try out different versions
together in about 10 minutes, I think,

31
00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:52.740
just to play around with it.

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.799
And we'll try out different ideas and
try some challenges out like that, but

33
00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.060
definitely try again.

34
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.160
We want to mix the breakpoints,
the ordering and some of the Colin and

35
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.940
Roast band to try a few of these out for
ourselves.

36
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.261
The kind of goal that I'm going for

37
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:17.870
implicitly is like this kind of pattern,
not that pattern.

38
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.645
We've got a sidebar,
we've got the header along the top,

39
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.230
we've got the content, right?

40
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.990
As you can see, the sidebar always stays.

41
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.590
I'm zoomed in, so
I get to that mobile view real fast.

42
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.990
We get a single column in mobile,
the sidebar kind of moves up.

43
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.600
The header always takes up the full width,
so on and so forth along the same line.

44
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.253
That you kind of commonly
see in this case,

45
00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:48.616
the goal is to take this
very simple stack layout and

46
00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:54.360
kind of do some of the more
traditional layouts we might see.

47
00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.381
Again, I am happy for challenge mode,
but let's do the assignment first and

48
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:05.770
get to the point where we would like
to have everything else in place.

49
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.330
Okay.

50
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.305
So this one, the challenge is somewhat

51
00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:18.170
straightforward where we might.

52
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.866
What we wanna do is kind of
have this eventually get to

53
00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:27.050
that kind of sidebar kind of piece
where these stack at some point.

54
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.833
And so I think grid calls one for
starting out with seems great.

55
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:32.500
And that is effectively the default.

56
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.620
So as you can see, nothing really
changes when we get rid of that.

57
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.660
Effectively, at the largest,
it is grid calls two.

58
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.180
Unless we decide to do two sidebars,
which, you know what?

59
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.660
Just to make things interesting for
ourselves.

60
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.380
Why not?

61
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.860
I'm feeling spicy, I need a challenge.

62
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.970
So we wanna have a main
body in the center.

63
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.890
Two sidebars, whoa, right?

64
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.252
So that we know that at
least let's say large,

65
00:04:09.252 --> 00:04:12.490
we want to do grid calls three.

66
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.652
That is not going to
get us there just yet,

67
00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:20.090
because that is not
what I was looking for.

68
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.107
So what we want to also say is,
for that top and

69
00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:29.192
bottom, we'll say at the large breakpoint,

70
00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:33.920
we're gonna say that it is
a grid calls three as well.

71
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.360
So it'll span all three.

72
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.120
That's not what I want.

73
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.040
I don't want grid-cols-3.

74
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120
I want call span three.

75
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.320
Call span three.

76
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.240
Cool.

77
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.360
And so we've got that for
the top piece, right?

78
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.850
The bottom will do the same thing.

79
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.250
So at the large breakpoint.

80
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.250
Nope, col-span-3.

81
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.170
Look at that.

82
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.690
We're getting there.

83
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.970
We're getting there.

84
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.690
I like it.

85
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.410
Cool, cool, cool.

86
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.768
And so,
then we wanna kind of get these to,

87
00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:19.139
that 3 takes up most of the space, right?

88
00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.120
And I kind of feel like,
cuz I get to make my decisions.

89
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.960
So I let you make your
decisions when you did it.

90
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.720
I kind of want the sidebars at that point
to be kind of, like, fixed in size.

91
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.190
So I'm gonna say that
instead of grid calls three,

92
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.360
we're gonna say the first
column should be.

93
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.200
I think 20 rem is what I put on my site.

94
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.960
We'll have the middle one take
up as much space as it needs.

95
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.320
And that second bonus sidebar,
let's have it be smaller.

96
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.520
Maybe it's like icons or something.

97
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.528
I don't know.

98
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.311
So now we kind of get to,

99
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:08.680
we have these two sidebars that work
the way they're Supposed to work.

100
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.980
And we've got that other
piece there as well.

101
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.060
We can even say that the height should be.

102
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.980
Well, it's actually, let's say
the height goes at large will be.

103
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.300
So H screen is another just fun one that
wasn't worth dedicating all the time to.

104
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.200
It's just saying height should
be 100 view height, right?

105
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.120
So that's the full size of the screen.

106
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.015
And so now we have another problem here,

107
00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:52.514
which is we need our rows to
kind of be laid out correctly so

108
00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:58.720
we can do something like there's
a bunch of ways I could do this.

109
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.280
I could give the header a max height.

110
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.320
I don't hate that.

111
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.440
But let's try LG grid rows.

112
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.640
Do something similar.

113
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.561
That is too many REMs.

114
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:29.645
20 rems, that's a lot of rems.

115
00:07:36.262 --> 00:07:40.093
Right, and we kind of get
something similar there as well.

116
00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:42.530
Let's jack that down to 4.

117
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.941
And so now we get this
stacked layout on mobile and

118
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:56.210
then magically as we get bigger, we get
this kind of more like blog like layout.

119
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.370
And again, did not take.

120
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.518
Now remember, for the grid columns and
grid rows, you can either

121
00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:07.860
give it a number and that will work and
that will give you evenly sized ones.

122
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.820
It's basically repeating.

123
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.260
Like it's basically.

124
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.700
They'll take up an even amount.

125
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.740
You can also.

126
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.516
And that underscore is a space in this
case you can kind of see what it's doing

127
00:08:17.516 --> 00:08:20.761
under the hood, which is if we
look at the CSS that's generated,

128
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:25.186
it's saying Grid Template Columns 21 FR10
and just putting some comments in there so

129
00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:26.370
you can see the pixels.

130
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.570
Because none of us can do
that math in our head.

131
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:38.050
Did I print out a REM to pixel to tailwind
size thing at my desk at one point?

132
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.250
Like a dork?

133
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:40.950
Yes.

134
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.530
But then I just learned to just hover
over stuff and not do that anymore.

135
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.170
And now I'm not embarrassed
when people come over.

136
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.360
So yeah, we can put in arbitrary
values and like we said before,

137
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.900
you can put in arbitrary values whenever.

138
00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:02.011
Now what I will warn you is that like if
you do it too much with your colors and

139
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:07.380
stuff like that, right,
like it gets weird.

140
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.980
You should probably do that in the theme,
so on and so forth.

141
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.524
But like for

142
00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:14.067
stuff like the grid where that's usually
almost always like a one off thing,

143
00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:17.740
it's totally legit versus having to jump
back to a theme for a one off question.

144
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.180
Cause you're kind of like defeating
the purpose of tailwind at that point.
