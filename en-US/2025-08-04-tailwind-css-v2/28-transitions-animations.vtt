00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.191
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Real quick,
just a little aside on some of the built

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.716
in transition animation
stuff that is in intel and

3
00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:15.100
the most common one is, and
we mentioned this at one point,

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.640
we saw it in some of the examples
is the transition colors.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.477
Most of the properties,

6
00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:27.120
these just map to the values of
the transition property in css.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.630
But you can do everything,
just the colors, so on and so forth.

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.270
And then it will then just apply.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.473
If we go back to our button,
for instance, if we go and

10
00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:46.372
put in a transition colors,
you can see that is adding okay,

11
00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:50.655
transition property, color background,

12
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:56.390
color border, color outline,
color text decoration.

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.020
You get a little more gran.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.340
The yellow if you want it'll put
in some basic defaults in there.

15
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.860
And now you will theoretically get.

16
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.940
Let's go to the.

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.620
Where's my.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.380
You will get a very kind of like
subtle transition in there for free.

19
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.180
You can do that to everything,
so on and so forth.

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.970
And so you can hook up to those things.

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.730
We can put those in there and
get those transitions super easily.

22
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.970
Again with a simple addition or
removal of that transition property.

23
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.530
Again you can tweak that to
the things that you want to do.

24
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.850
All the classics are in there,
which is kind of great.

25
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.930
The other thing you can do is you can set.

26
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.570
If you want to get even more granular,

27
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.170
you can just use that arbitrary
value syntax that we saw earlier.

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.587
And there are things like duration
where you can say like okay,

29
00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:55.370
some built in stops in there.

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.210
I think I usually.

31
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.730
Yeah, like 100, 200, 300, like 150.

32
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.290
You can see in the autocomplete.

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770
But you can always put in
custom amounts as well.

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.250
And you can see that's a little slower
one and that's great and wonderful.

35
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
And then you can change
all of those things again.

36
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.954
Tailwind's job is to take
stuff that exists in CSS and

37
00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:16.060
move it into utility classes for you.

38
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.860
So if you can do it in css,
you can do it here as well.

39
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.060
The other one, I'm actually going to look
at this because I think it looks nice.

40
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.700
On their site.

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.220
There are some just built in animations.

42
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Spin ping.

43
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.540
The only one I ever really use is pulse.

44
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.650
You can see this one actually
I use spin sometimes.

45
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.530
Right Animate Spin on that SVG is
just spinning that SVG in a circle.

46
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.370
The one I aspire to use
that one in one day.

47
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.570
I've never actually used it.

48
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.930
The one that I use is like for
skeleton stuff.

49
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.570
This pulse animation, which not on that
screen definitely looks a little bit more.

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.474
But if you made the colors more extreme,

51
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.610
it kind of Gives you that kind of
loading state, so on and so forth.

52
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.844
And these are just like if we
put it on our button real quick,

53
00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:18.753
we said animate Pulse, you can kind of see
that there is a keyframe set up called

54
00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:24.220
Pulse that just kind of does that
animation as you go through.

55
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.420
So a few of those kind of built
in again that transition.

56
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.700
If you're also just using
transforms to move stuff around.

57
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.198
The other one that comes
in helpful sometimes is for

58
00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:40.470
if you're using modals or
the Popover API and you want to have.

59
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.470
We'll do it.

60
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.470
I have a popover.

61
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.070
Hold on.

62
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.350
We won't do the full popover right now,
but I made one just in case it came up.

63
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.870
Is a lot of times you
might want it to fade in.

64
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.941
The problem is the ways that you used to
have to do that was you would have it have

65
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:03.857
a class where have opacity 0 and then
you would slap on another class as soon

66
00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:09.280
as he came onto the page to then simulate
as if it was fading into existence.

67
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.953
Right?
There's actually a CSS feature called

68
00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:14.640
Starting Style which we have in the notes.

69
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.720
You can totally and should check it out.

70
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.801
It's just that I use it
like once a year and

71
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.720
that felt once a year is even generous.

72
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.760
And what it will do is allow you.

73
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.760
You can basically write class.

74
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.921
Hey, you should have an opacity of 100,
but

75
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:42.560
your starting style is
going to be opacity zero.

76
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.280
And this will.

77
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.480
You no longer have to do that trick
where you throw it on the page.

78
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.640
It's going to opacity zero.

79
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.912
And as soon as it's on the page
then you throw another class on and

80
00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:53.760
it transitions those two states.

81
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.255
This one,
it will start out with an opacity zero in.

82
00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:00.210
And you can see this is normal,
just CSS opacity zero percent.

83
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.170
And then it will immediately like
fade in to being fully there as well.

84
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.890
But yeah, so there's like a lot.

85
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.319
Again, if you can do it in css,
there is an analog in Tailwind and

86
00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.170
most of them are not far off from
what the CSS syntax would look like.

87
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.370
Right?

88
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.746
And like I said, there is a whole
list of any pseudo selector has

89
00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:29.140
a variant that you put
on the front that works.

90
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.483
Most of these properties have something
that like effectively goes right

91
00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:34.340
over there.

92
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.791
Even like the weird esoteric stuff
that I have never used in my life,

93
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:39.620
like CSS masks and stuff like that.

94
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.804
There is support for

95
00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:45.270
almost all of those things out of the box
at various levels of like Esoteria.
