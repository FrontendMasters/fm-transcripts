00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.416
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If button was
the hello world and card was the okay,

2
00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:04.560
I want to see with more
than one component.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.882
I feel like the one place that is the area
in which most of us have to spend

4
00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:15.040
time when building kind of like
a component library design system.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.040
Form inputs, input fields,
all of those things.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.846
Those are usually the heavy lifting of
a lot of what we're kind of styling and

7
00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:28.290
designing.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.770
And you can see this version
that I've got on the page here.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.930
We're gonna go jump back over to the skate
park in a second and style one of these.

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.810
But if I just grab a basic form input,
as you can see, Tailwind, again,

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.930
is not like Bootstrap in the point where
you can smell it from a mile away.

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.090
It is simply a library for you to kind
of like, use these utility classes.

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.850
It does give you some default padding.

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.810
Which one.

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.560
REM being 16 is not
particularly controversial.

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.280
The color palette is totally customizable,
but like I said, it is not out of the box.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.661
Your app should not smell like
a Tailwind app immediately, right?

18
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.295
Because Tailwind does not give
you a lot out of the box and

19
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:10.319
you're still kind of like
doing that theming yourself.

20
00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.000
So this is our good friend,
the input field.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.800
And what we're gonna do
is not unlike the card.

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.152
We are going to slice and

23
00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:22.540
dice it like a dozen different
ways over our time together.

24
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.900
Because there is a lot of nuance
to all the things you can do.

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.260
If you think about, like, the default
form state, what if it's required?

26
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.540
What if it's invalid?

27
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.740
What if it's all of these?

28
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.884
What if it's a number field?

29
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:33.780
What if it's a range?

30
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.540
So what is the checkbox input?

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.820
There's a number of, like,
varietals of the input field.

32
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.540
That gives us a kind of a rich place to
kind of go looking in this case as well.

33
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.036
So let's go ahead and
let's take a look at at that.

34
00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:52.200
If I go back into the playground,

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.740
I can see that I've got an input,
and cool, cool, cool.

36
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.585
This one has what looks like
a little bit more markup,

37
00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.460
just simply because we're going to use it
for a whole bunch of different purposes.

38
00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.695
I'm gonna look at just the code for
a second and

39
00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:07.420
then we'll take a look
at it in storybook too.

40
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.340
But effectively, it's a div.

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.587
It's got a label, it's got an input,

42
00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:20.930
it's got a little bit of support for
some ARIA tags.

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.506
You can put a little description or
an error Message again,

44
00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:30.262
just some templating so we can pop
that stuff in with Storybook and

45
00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:34.930
not have to make 1000 of these and
copy and paste our classes 1000 times.

46
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.090
Because like we said before,
yes, that feels annoying.

47
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.689
But arguably, in any larger code base,
whether that's Ruby on rails,

48
00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.288
through jQuery, through React,
through Svelte, through whatever,

49
00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:46.899
you probably have some kind
of templating going on.

50
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.880
Cool, all right,
that looks like some markup where

51
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.242
we've got just some placeholders in
there and a little bit of conditional.

52
00:02:54.242 --> 00:02:58.373
And in our Storybook side of the house,
you're going to see that it doesn't look

53
00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:01.860
like much, but don't worry,
we'll make it look like something.

54
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.740
They're very close to what
we saw on the page earlier.

55
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.970
If you click on it, you will see the
outline ring that comes from the browser.

56
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.770
That's about it.

57
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.290
If you want to get rid of that, you can do
outline none and you won't even see that.

58
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.722
But what it turns out is you can do all
sorts of stuff and you can see I made

59
00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:26.970
a bunch of stories here that are just
little tweaks to the input field.

60
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.410
All this is is the same input field,
but it's type email, right?

61
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.490
You know,
I guess they all have a placeholder.

62
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.360
Yeah, this one has
the description filled in.

63
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.480
This one has an error.

64
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.600
This one's a password field,
this one's disabled.

65
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.088
The other thing that you can do,
especially if you have a little more

66
00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:53.363
screen real estate than I do, is you can
go ahead and if you're just designing,

67
00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:58.053
you can toggle any of these the way
that you want in Storybook, right?

68
00:03:58.053 --> 00:04:01.993
Set any of the other properties that come
with an input field however you might want

69
00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:03.835
if you need to test different states.

70
00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.370
But we don't need to do that.

71
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.010
If you're playing around and
you want to, it's there for you.

72
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.170
But these are all
the same input component.

73
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.010
These are not different
files you have to edit.

74
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.792
This is just one component with some
different placeholder settings for

75
00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:17.850
you to experiment.

76
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.850
Okay, so we wanna style this thing, right?

77
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.970
And there is a lot of rich
things we can do here as well.

78
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.401
So we'll do some basic styling here where,
like I said, most CSS properties

79
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:38.410
that you would want to use have a tailwind
class that is associated with them.

80
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.440
So, for instance, if we wanted to do
the kind of more traditional thing where

81
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.733
they stack, right,
we can make them block elements, right?

82
00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:47.450
Just display: block.

83
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.690
Anyone want to venture what that class is?

84
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.730
Block, block, display, inline.

85
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.395
Sometimes it's the property
name in this case,

86
00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:00.060
it is the value dot block
gives us display block.

87
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.420
Okay, now they're stacked.

88
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.140
I could technically do that for
the input as well.

89
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.820
That feels right.

90
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.460
So now they're both block elements.

91
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.500
So they both kind of stack
on top of each other.

92
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.300
What else?

93
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.620
You know what my favorite font
weight is or should we do medium?

94
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.100
Let's do medium.

95
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.134
I like semi-bold.

96
00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:20.940
You wanna see the difference?

97
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.242
Semi-bold's a little heavier.

98
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.329
Too dark, see?

99
00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:29.339
Semi-bold is 600.

100
00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.850
Medium, I'm gonna guess is 500.

101
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.650
The default is usually 400.

102
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.690
There's also thin.

103
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.930
You want to go the other direction.

104
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.810
There's bold, which is, I believe, 700.

105
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.770
Don't quote me on that.

106
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.850
So we've got that.

107
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.410
All right, we're getting there.

108
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.730
What else do I wanna do?

109
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.517
Label, you could
theoretically do something.

110
00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:49.789
Like I said, you can use gray.

111
00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.460
I like slate.

112
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.327
I read a blog post one time,

113
00:05:54.327 --> 00:06:00.100
like five years ago that said you should
never actually use full black anywhere.

114
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.020
So now I take that seriously.

115
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.300
I don't even know if it's true.

116
00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:06.180
It's just one of those things.

117
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.980
As a front end engineer, sometimes
I like cosplay as a designer, but

118
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.153
I don't know what I'm talking about.

119
00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:16.728
All right, the input field, I mean, the
label was not what was driving us nuts.

120
00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:20.947
This is what's really hurting our
feelings in this case, right?

121
00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:21.730
I don't love this, right?

122
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.177
So there's a bunch of options in
this case for stuff like focus or

123
00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:33.810
anything that happens on any
kind of interactive level.

124
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.690
Border is a bad idea because we know
it's going to shift the layout.

125
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.650
I've seen it done both ways
in different code bases.

126
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.395
For an input, whether or
not you use a border and

127
00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:50.240
then theoretically an outline for
the hover states, or whether or

128
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.360
not you just have an outline and then
change it for the hover states, either.

129
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.315
I think as long as you're
consistent about that,

130
00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:59.732
if you have some inputs that do
use outlines that have border,

131
00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:02.400
that's gonna be problematic cuz
good luck aligning those things.

132
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.600
Either is fine with me.

133
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.959
I've done both.

134
00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:08.994
It's fine.

135
00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:11.354
So let's do.

136
00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:16.044
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why do you have class block
on the label and class block on the input?

137
00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:19.248
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Because they're
both technically in-line, right?

138
00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:20.660
So I wanted to make them both block.

139
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.593
At this point, one block,
the other one will stack below it.

140
00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:26.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so
that doesn't carry through.

141
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.833
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, because it's
only applying to this element.

142
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:30.390
Right, block.

143
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.340
Yeah, these appear so
they wouldn't cascade anyway.

144
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.780
But font and
colors cascade layout does not.

145
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.040
So we got it on both of those now
they're both block elements and Cool.

146
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.884
So now we can begin to style this
one where there are a lot of things

147
00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:51.949
that we can do to an element in this case.

148
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.640
So let's see, we can go ahead and
I'm gonna say,

149
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.720
let's give it some kind of,
let's do a border.

150
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.370
Let's do the one that I
didn't do in the notes.

151
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.930
Why not?

152
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.217
No, not doing that.

153
00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:11.770
I'm not doing that this time, Dustin.

154
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.890
Not doing it.

155
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.686
I'm not going rogue.

156
00:08:14.686 --> 00:08:20.730
We'll give it an outline of 2, 1, okay?

157
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.135
The nice part about the IntelliSense
is if you have duplicate class names,

158
00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:29.464
it'll give you the brown squiggly.

159
00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:34.076
Because outline one and outline not
only contradict each other, but

160
00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:37.350
they're also the same class, right?

161
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.270
So let's just go with
outline in that case.

162
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.713
So it's got outline.

163
00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:44.041
We'll say outline-slate.

164
00:08:51.782 --> 00:09:00.631
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and
we were team rounded in this case, right?

165
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.046
MD is too much?

166
00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.800
Steve's face said MD is too much.

167
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.520
Feels better, right?

168
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.040
You want some padding, don't you?

169
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.080
You want a little bit of padding?

170
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.200
I'll give you a little bit of padding.

171
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.520
Give it a little bit of padding there and
we can give you a little py.

172
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.120
I don't know.

173
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.320
Let's do 1.5 in that case.

174
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.840
Too much.

175
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.445
Too much.

176
00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:27.180
That's the nice part, is that you
can kind of see all this stuff.

177
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.948
The other thing I might do here for

178
00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:34.860
right now is I'm gonna do space y.

179
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.100
Let's go with one.

180
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.340
Just a little bit of breathing room.

181
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.399
The nice part about using space
versus using a margin bottom or

182
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.599
margin top is when description or
error show up,

183
00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:50.830
that spacing will be every
element inside that division.

184
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.510
So they will also get that spacing right.

185
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.105
If you find yourself again like
putting like MB1MB1MB1 to put

186
00:09:58.105 --> 00:10:02.350
a margin bottom on all of them but
the first one, stop.

187
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.270
Take a moment of self reflection.

188
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.670
Realize if something is that tedious,
there might be a better way.

189
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.731
So that space Y that we just saw
earlier will work and we gave it

190
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:15.710
a little space and it'll work for when
the other stuff kind of comes in as well.

191
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.390
And like I said, you can check
out one of those other stories.

192
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.951
Be a little more screen
real estate than I do.

193
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:21.467
You'll see it immediately.

194
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:25.976
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it best to put that space
on the div, the outside container there?

195
00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:28.424
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So space in this case,
like flex and grid,

196
00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:31.560
will then put space between
all the children, right?

197
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.440
So like everything but the first child is
going to get a margin bottom in this case.

198
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.515
So in that one you would have
to put it on the parent and

199
00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:41.800
that would put the spacing in
between all of its children.

200
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.880
Cool, cool, cool.

201
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.890
What else might we want to do to this?

202
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:53.410
There's tons that we can do right now it
technically has a transparent background.

203
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.890
So that doesn't matter cuz
that background is white.

204
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.330
Storybook does not like
how zoomed in I am.

205
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.330
So we'll deal with that in a second.

206
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.610
It's technically transparent.

207
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.330
So if you put it on a card that had
that background, it's going to change.

208
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.780
So let's give it a background of white so
it' stays.

209
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.630
We don't see anything different there
cuz white on a white background.

210
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.530
Cool, and so
now we've got kind of the basis.

211
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.499
The other thing you can do, this is
a personal design choice, I don't care,

212
00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.690
is you could decide if you want
it to be the full width, right?

213
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.410
And so that one's just width full.

214
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.610
And there are a whole
bunch of other stops.

215
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.181
There are even fun like fractional
ones like width 1/3 and

216
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:41.537
stuff along those lines or width screen
all of the different variations.

217
00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:45.370
But width full is just a fun thing for
width 100%.

218
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.330
Dustin, what's up?

219
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.930
&gt;&gt; Dustin: What is your reasoning for when
to use Flexbox vs When to use spacing?

220
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.639
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I generally think
if all I am absolutely doing at all

221
00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:59.049
is just spacing on one dimension and I'm
not doing stuff like aligning, you know,

222
00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:02.570
center aligning all the items or
anything along those lines.

223
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.860
I will usually use the space.

224
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.123
I'm gonna be honest with you,
I don't know if this is true.

225
00:12:11.123 --> 00:12:16.053
I feel like if I just use Flexbox for

226
00:12:16.053 --> 00:12:24.260
one thing that I'm wasting a flexbox or
something.

227
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.980
I'm not convinced there's
a performance hit.

228
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.140
I have never seen one.

229
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.660
But somewhere deep in my soul I feel
like there is based entirely on feels.

230
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.260
And I feel guilty if I use a Flexbox
when I could have used the space.

231
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.020
That's not the answer you wanted.

232
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.180
That's the real answer.

233
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.131
But yeah, there are some implications
of a flexbox and flex items, so on and

234
00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:46.860
so forth.

235
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.300
Have I ever been bitten by them?

236
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.940
I have not.

237
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.900
But I understand there's
probably a reason why they exist.

238
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.860
I don't need to get bitten
by Them to find out.

239
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.033
So, yeah, if I'm only using it for
the spacing, only in one direction and

240
00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:02.700
not using it to reflect stuff,
I will go for space.

241
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.184
But part of that is emotional.

242
00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:08.454
Sorry, [LAUGH] it's true.

243
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:13.820
Cool, so then we can kind of talk
a little about these focus states.

244
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.179
And there's various focus
states that are present here.

245
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:23.245
In this case, we've got this outline of

246
00:13:23.245 --> 00:13:29.653
four that I kind of put in
there while I was talking.

247
00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:30.790
Seems a little egregious.

248
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.949
Blue-400, I like that.

249
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:41.821
And the outline is slate normally.

250
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.670
I could also go for 600 both ways.

251
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:51.003
All right, so now when it is focus,
it will get that as well.

252
00:13:51.003 --> 00:13:53.342
So you kinda like, either way,

253
00:13:53.342 --> 00:13:58.294
cuz inputs get the focus also when
you are typing into them, right?

254
00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:01.954
There are a few other cool things and
we can argue are these tailwind,

255
00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:03.040
Are they css?

256
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.192
They're technically css,
because tailwind is just CSS

257
00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:14.000
that you can do where you can say,
let's make the placeholder.

258
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.040
The color one is super easy.

259
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.800
And then we'll show there's a variant for
the rest of this.

260
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.173
I'll do something a little more
egregious here so that [LAUGH].

261
00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:29.920
This is like, yeah, on one hand,
I'm trying to make this realistic.

262
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.400
On the other hand,
this is no place for subtlety.

263
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.640
You can see I can make the placeholder
red, which is a ridiculous idea.

264
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.495
But just, you know, going from kind of
a gray to kind of a bluish gray does not

265
00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:41.680
really make my point
the same way red does.

266
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.260
And you can also even, like,
there is also a placeholder variant.

267
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.590
So I can say placeholder,

268
00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:00.380
and I could say, like, italic.

269
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.606
Now the placeholder is italic, so

270
00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:06.700
you can style that placeholder
as well with all these.

271
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.023
I don't actually want to do that, though.

272
00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:09.090
That looks stupid.

273
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.690
So we'll get rid of that.

274
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:18.675
But yeah,
I could do something like placeholder,

275
00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:25.010
slightly lighter text,
whatever you want to do.

276
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.730
So you can style that as well.

277
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:32.812
The other thing you can do in tailwind,
depending on what you are trying

278
00:15:32.812 --> 00:15:39.010
to achieve, is for most things, we've only
talked because we're positive people.

279
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.850
We've only talked about a positive value.

280
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:51.650
For instance, what if you wanted
to have the outline offset?

281
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.490
We know how to do.

282
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.370
Let me give it a border for one second.

283
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.180
And I can do outline offset.

284
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.140
Let's do something a little more.

285
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.740
So I've got that outline
around the input field.

286
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.449
And so the other thing you can do if
you wanted to at any given point for

287
00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:23.759
a lot of these classes,
is you could give it a negative value.

288
00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:28.727
Most of these variants also have a,
actually not of all things,

289
00:16:28.727 --> 00:16:30.820
not an outline.

290
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.291
That's why ring exists, right?

291
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:36.886
But if you wanted negative margins,
this is negative MT2, negative MT4,

292
00:16:36.886 --> 00:16:42.100
like a dash before that will be
the negative value in either direction.

293
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.420
Outline, you can't have an inset outline.

294
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.505
Well, mostly because those words
don't even make sense, and

295
00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:49.620
that's why you would still use a ring for
that.

296
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.460
But you can do negative values as well.
