1
00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:07.027
So let's hop into organizing HTML,
section 5 here under HTML.

2
00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:10.009
And we're gonna talk about
how we organize HTML.

3
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.626
So far I've just been showing you tags,
and

4
00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:16.743
how individual tags maybe a few that
are nested inside of each other.

5
00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:19.479
But now let's build bigger things, right?

6
00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:24.114
You can see on this course website,
we have this central content area, and

7
00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:27.586
we have these different sections and
headers, right?

8
00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:33.047
How do you build components, right,
tags of tags of tags, right?

9
00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:35.880
So that's what this section is all about,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.960
it's how do I organize
bigger pieces of HTML.

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.268
So let's say that you're making
a social media type website and

12
00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:47.431
you're gonna make a news feed,
how would you organize that?

13
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.409
Well, let's take a look at this.

14
00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.262
Let's say you have the username here and
then you have when it was posted.

15
00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.589
And an image, maybe that's their.

16
00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.459
What kind of image they posted or
maybe it's their profile picture or

17
00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.733
something like that.

18
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.710
And then we have like the text here,

19
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.394
like a dog having an existential crisis,
for example.

20
00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.203
So that would come out looking
something like this, right?

21
00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:16.819
The user name posted 15 minutes ago,
their profile picture,

22
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.395
and whatever their tweet is or
whatever their bark,

23
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.996
maybe it's a dog social network So

24
00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:29.200
I've organized that to
something like this.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.925
And I put an h3 here, that's just
like a stylistic choice, right?

26
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:33.659
Is that a header?

27
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.248
Is it not a header?

28
00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:39.171
Some people probably say it's not
a header, so you'd make that a p instead.

29
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:41.263
This is kind of your choice, right?

30
00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:44.081
At this point is just kind
of how you feel about it.

31
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:45.448
We'll stick with h3 though.

32
00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:51.967
And yeah, that is how I would organize it.

33
00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.611
But a div to encapsulate all of it, right?

34
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.546
Think of it as like that cardboard box
that keeps everything together, right?

35
00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:02.209
This is one whole post, right?

36
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.921
And then we'll look at here with
the classes in just a second, but

37
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.013
you kinda keep every like thing together.

38
00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:13.531
So again, kind of touchy-feely,
kind of organizationally.

39
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.715
But imagine you're moving into a new
house and there's cupboards everywhere.

40
00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:23.534
What's the correct place that you're
supposed to put all of your utensils?

41
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:28.362
Well, it probably should go in a drawer,
probably should go in the kitchen, but

42
00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:29.285
which drawer?

43
00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:30.830
There's not a correct answer to that.

44
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.322
It's just kind of how you
choose to organize things.

45
00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:36.407
And that's the point I'm trying
to drive home for you here,

46
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:39.324
it's not a preferential after
a certain point, right?

47
00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:42.813
You don't wanna put your utensils in the
bathroom, that doesn't make any sense, so

48
00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:43.888
you probably wouldn't.

49
00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:46.045
You'd wanna put them in the kitchen.

50
00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:49.794
Where you choose to put them in
the kitchen makes the most sense to you.

51
00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:50.909
Same thing with HTML.

52
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.329
So we kept all the light
things together with a div.

53
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.469
Its container like a copper box,
we talked about that.

54
00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.841
And typically we'll put everything
together, kind of in an encapsulating

55
00:03:05.841 --> 00:03:10.023
div just to make sure that it's kind
of logically divided off by itself.

56
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:16.550
You also could have put this in what's
called an article like this article.

57
00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:22.195
What's the difference between a div and
an article?

58
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:25.043
Functionally, nothing.

59
00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:28.416
There's actually no functional
difference between a div and an article.

60
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:32.093
Everywhere that you could use a div you
could use a article, and vice versa.

61
00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:35.625
So why would you use
an article versus a div?

62
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.348
An article is just a more specific thing.

63
00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.675
It's kind of a bit of documentation,

64
00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:42.814
here's an entire article
that sits off by itself.

65
00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:44.613
An article is just like
a bit of information.

66
00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:46.999
It's not as much as
an article in a website,

67
00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.941
it could be a little tweet, right?

68
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.978
A tweet could be considered an article.

69
00:03:50.978 --> 00:03:55.622
It's just like a unit of information,
right?

70
00:03:57.484 --> 00:04:00.948
So in this particular case,
I would say article might be a better one.

71
00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:05.213
It's like a cardboard box
that has a label on it,

72
00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:09.592
that says this type of box,
and that's all it is.

73
00:04:09.592 --> 00:04:12.436
There's also section, right?

74
00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:14.470
That's another one.

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.010
Section is the same thing,
whatever you'd call it a section.

76
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.318
So if I was designing a house in HTML,
I'd say a kitchen is a section,

77
00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:24.903
a bathroom is a section,
a bedroom is a section, right?

78
00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.891
It's a larger macro unit of a website.

79
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:30.398
Could you use a div there?

80
00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:31.315
Absolutely.

81
00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:33.342
Do most websites just use divs there?

82
00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:41.275
Usually, but there are some of these more
specific semantic kind of styles of tags.

83
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.698
And it's just like a labeling system for
you to kind of keep track of everything.

84
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:50.701
So we'll leave in here a div cuz I would
say most websites here probably would call

85
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:54.906
it a div, just because most developers
are lazy and they call everything a div.

86
00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:59.596
But I just wanted to kinda get
you used to some of these newer

87
00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.812
semantic style HTML tags.

88
00:05:01.812 --> 00:05:03.472
So that bears mentioning as well,
divs are just older.

89
00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:06.570
Divs have always been around in HTML.

90
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.536
Articles, and sections, and

91
00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:14.141
some of those other things have only been
around since HTML 5, which is like 2012.

92
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:19.054
I don't know if it's 2012,
it's within the past 15 years.

93
00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:25.183
Whereas, HTML is much
older than that Okay.

94
00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:31.982
So let's look at the exact same thing,
but this time I added classes.

95
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.006
Is this a bit a lot clearer,
like what everything is supposed to be?

96
00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.345
This is a social post, this is their
username, this is the posted date,

97
00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:52.645
this is the profile picture,
and this is the text, right?

98
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:59.017
I would argue this is like a million times
more clear in terms of the code instead

99
00:05:59.017 --> 00:05:59.618
of this.

100
00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:01.902
This, you have to look at it,
and scrutinize, and

101
00:06:01.902 --> 00:06:05.533
kinda looking at it from all the link,
it's like okay, what did they mean here?

102
00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:07.119
What are they trying to do?

103
00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.560
Whereas if I come look at this,
everything is labeled, right?

104
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.700
It's like having one of those
label guns when you're moving,

105
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.372
it's like you can put a label on
everything so you know exactly what it is,

106
00:06:17.372 --> 00:06:19.165
where it goes, where it came from.

107
00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:24.466
So that's why I wanted to show you classes
as a methodology of documentation for

108
00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:25.266
yourself.

109
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.364
I now get everything here of
what it's supposed to do.

110
00:06:29.364 --> 00:06:31.362
Does it make sense?

111
00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:34.961
What I'm trying to do right now is I'm
trying to teach you to write code,

112
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.849
not just to write code the first time,

113
00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.760
so that when you come back later and
try to maintain it, that it's way easier.

114
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.522
Cuz you write code once and
you maintain it forever.

115
00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:48.613
So optimize for the forever part and
not for the writing part of it.

116
00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:55.022
And you can see everything
here looks exactly the same,

117
00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:59.002
this code is just much easier for
you, the coder, to read later.

118
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:03.117
Now, we'll eventually use classes to
do styling and stuff like that, but

119
00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:05.416
that's just part of why you use classes.

120
00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:09.352
It's also as a method of labeling
things that you're doing.

121
00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:17.224
Okay.

122
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.230
So let's say we wanna make a full
feed of one of these, right?

123
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.492
So I'd have some sort of like
social feed class, right?

124
00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:30.551
And now, I can have a bunch
of these social posts, right?

125
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.529
So I have sassy_pants here.

126
00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.611
And then I have TailCurious here, right?

127
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:41.077
And so I can have a bunch of these
different posts next to each other.

128
00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.231
And I reuse all of the same structure,
right?

129
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.737
It's like, again,
if you're building your house,

130
00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:53.168
if you come up with one blueprint, you can
reuse that blueprint over and over again.

131
00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:56.998
So all of these social post
each one has a username,

132
00:07:56.998 --> 00:08:02.627
each one has a posted date, each one
has their own text, so on and so forth.

133
00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:07.088
Does that makes sense?

134
00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:09.391
That kind of defining it once,
we are able to use it over and over again.

135
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:14.173
We're defining these reusable
components for ourselves to use later.

136
00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:19.904
And you can see it comes out, so
I have this post and this post.

137
00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:23.962
It's all Luna,
[LAUGH] at the end of the day,

138
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:30.823
but, And I mean,
this is all if you look at Twitter, or

139
00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:35.087
Facebook, or Pinterest, or some of those
things, they're doing exactly this, right?

140
00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:37.776
They're defining a set of HTML and they're
just reusing it over and over again.

141
00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:41.216
Cuz every tweet structurally
looks the same, right?

142
00:08:41.216 --> 00:08:44.550
They just have different
content inside of them, and

143
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.308
they're just reusing the same structures
and classes over and over again.

144
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.727
And then notice that I grouped all
of those together into one div

145
00:08:58.727 --> 00:09:00.740
of a social feed, right?

146
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.317
Cuz I'm grouping I'm using a larger
box to encapsulate the smaller boxes.

147
00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:09.741
Cuz you're trying to store
all the like things together.

148
00:09:16.673 --> 00:09:17.403
All right.

149
00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:25.128
So, let's say we wanted to make
some sort of like nav bar, right?

150
00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:28.953
You've been on lots of websites,
this website has a nav bar,

151
00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:31.834
right, this little thing
affixed to the top.

152
00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:33.576
I'm sure you can imagine a nav, right?

153
00:09:33.576 --> 00:09:37.986
So nav there's another one of these
kind of, this could be called a div for

154
00:09:37.986 --> 00:09:38.922
sure, right?

155
00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:43.059
But a nav is like a more specific thing
that says, this is specifically for

156
00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:46.615
navigation, right, so
that a user can get around my website.

157
00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:50.709
And then it has an unordered
list of links, right?

158
00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:54.332
So the first one will take you home, the
second one will take you to the Newsfeed,

159
00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:56.517
and the third one will take
you to the About page,

160
00:09:56.517 --> 00:09:58.880
and the fourth one will take
you to the Contact page.

161
00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:05.797
And this is all grouped together in a ul,
which is inside of a nav.

162
00:10:05.797 --> 00:10:09.117
And then you end up with something
like this, right, Home page, NewsFeed.

163
00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:13.103
And then we'll use CSS to make it
into a neat-looking navigation.

164
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.206
Does that makes sense?

165
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.588
Cool.

166
00:10:21.944 --> 00:10:24.873
So again, it's obviously not styled,
we'll get to the styling part of it later.

167
00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:27.926
The thing that I want you to
focus on is the content of

168
00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:30.484
being the links that go different places.

169
00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:38.850
Another question someone might ask is,
what does slash mean here?

170
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.083
If you put slash here,
if I click on this Home link,

171
00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.409
it'll take me to whatever
the root of the domain is.

172
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:49.572
So in this particular case,
it'll be to btholt.github.io,

173
00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:52.125
which is a totally different website.

174
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.201
It actually just has like videos from me,
right?

175
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:59.039
But that's unrelated to this website.

176
00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:02.550
And then if I go to NewsFeed, /newsfeed,

177
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.754
this is going to go to
btholt.github.io/news.

178
00:11:06.754 --> 00:11:10.114
So that means go all the way
back to the domain and

179
00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:12.552
then start the domain from there.

180
00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:14.888
Does that make sense?

181
00:11:14.888 --> 00:11:16.509
So that's what that leading slash means.

182
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.644
It means go all the way back
to the root domain, and

183
00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:22.190
I wanna go relative to that root domain.

184
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:30.635
As opposed to if I put
https://www.google.com.

185
00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:35.879
By putting, this is called the protocol
here, I've now delineated that

186
00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:41.136
I actually want to go to a whole new
website, a different domain, right?

187
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.030
And then just to make this a little
bit different, if I put Home here,

188
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.821
notice that there's no slash here.

189
00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:52.624
It will be relative to
where I am right now.

190
00:11:52.624 --> 00:11:59.303
So it's gonna try and
go to the domain/this/lesson/html.

191
00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:02.932
And it's gonna replace
organizing html with home,

192
00:12:02.932 --> 00:12:08.221
which is nothing at the moment, so
you're gonna get a 404 page, right?

193
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:12.313
But it's relative to wherever you are,
it's the last slash here.

194
00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:18.522
So to try to go to /home
instead of /organizing-html,

195
00:12:18.522 --> 00:12:20.909
that's called the relative link.

196
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:26.692
Cool.

197
00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:36.184
Okay, we didn't give nav a class,
you totally can.

198
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.612
Home-nav or, Header-nav or
something like that.

199
00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:49.692
In general though you don't
have too many navs there, so

200
00:12:49.692 --> 00:12:53.173
it's descriptive unto itself,
again, totally up to you.

201
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:02.873
I chose to do this with a ul and li.

202
00:13:02.873 --> 00:13:08.231
In general, if I have a list of things and
they're the same things, right,

203
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:13.502
so like a list of links, or a list of
blog posts, or a list of favorite pets,

204
00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:17.654
right, I'll usually use
an unordered list to show that.

205
00:13:17.654 --> 00:13:20.764
You don't have to,
this could just be divs inside of divs.

206
00:13:20.764 --> 00:13:23.720
Totally valid as well, totally up to you.

207
00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:31.607
If HTML feels kinda like loosey goosey,
it's cuz it's super loosey goosey.

208
00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:35.499
It's just kind of like whatever
you make sense to you.

209
00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:38.977
You get to have a lot of preference here,
it's another way of saying it.

210
00:13:41.507 --> 00:13:43.242
There's no magic way to name classes.

211
00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:47.952
So none of these classes have
any special meaning, right?

212
00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.713
I could have called them
literally anything.

213
00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:56.403
It's just something that
makes sense to you.

214
00:13:56.403 --> 00:14:01.285
The only thing being is that they have
to be, one, they're not case-sensitive.

215
00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:05.862
So if I put like nav-list,

216
00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:09.763
I don't know,
we're putting random capital letters.

217
00:14:09.763 --> 00:14:13.082
It's case insensitive,
so it doesn't matter.

218
00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.725
So just always do lowercase.

219
00:14:14.725 --> 00:14:19.239
That's kind of like what people do
is they just always use lowercase.

220
00:14:19.239 --> 00:14:22.220
And then obviously if
I have nav space list,

221
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.390
that's two different classes,
not one class,so you have to use the dash.

222
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.070
You can use underscores but
everyone uses dashes

223
00:14:38.338 --> 00:14:42.061
And naming things is hard.

224
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:44.351
Don't worry,
that's just true for everybody.

225
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:50.370
So, Yeah, Mark?

226
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.972
&gt;&gt; Why do we not need the file
extension HTML in the path?

227
00:14:54.972 --> 00:14:58.824
&gt;&gt; So notice here like I
have organizing-html and

228
00:14:58.824 --> 00:15:01.816
it's not .html like that, right?

229
00:15:01.816 --> 00:15:03.337
Would that work?

230
00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:03.954
It would.

231
00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:06.372
Interesting, good for you.

232
00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:09.596
I was not expecting that to work.

233
00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.060
Why don't you need the HTML?

234
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.816
Sometimes you do, it depends on whatever
your web server is doing, right?

235
00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:21.027
So in this particular case,
I have a toolkit called Next.js,

236
00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:23.148
which don't worry at all about that, but

237
00:15:23.148 --> 00:15:26.501
that's what I'm using to generate
this entire course website.

238
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:31.180
And so the URLs, the links here, right,

239
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:38.150
whatever the address is,
which another word for that is URL.

240
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.445
The URLs that it generates
don't have .html at the end.

241
00:15:42.445 --> 00:15:47.432
So therefore you don't have to use them,
apparently it works both ways, but

242
00:15:47.432 --> 00:15:49.745
in my case, it doesn't need them.

243
00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:52.845
In other cases,
you will need that .html because,

244
00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:55.875
it's just referring directly
to the file on disk or

245
00:15:55.875 --> 00:16:00.112
something like that, it'll actually
expect that .html to be there.

246
00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:04.006
So it's a little unspecific, I'm sorry,
it's kind of a hard question to answer.

247
00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:07.280
It just depends on
whatever your server is,

248
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.529
whatever is giving the HTML
file to the client at the end.

249
00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:17.248
Whether expects the .html or
it does not, right?

250
00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:22.013
I guess a good example that is the address
of a house, right, when do you

251
00:16:22.013 --> 00:16:26.710
put North in an address, or when do
you put avenue in an address or not?

252
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.038
The answer is you put in whatever you have
to, to get it delivered to the end person.

253
00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:34.119
Whatever the postmaster recognizes,
that's what you're gonna put in there.

254
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:37.767
Same thing here, whatever your postmaster,
whatever your server expects,

255
00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:39.712
that's what you're gonna put in there.

256
00:16:39.712 --> 00:16:42.877
And it can be arbitrary to
whatever the postmaster expects or

257
00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:45.118
whatever your server that you're using.

258
00:16:45.118 --> 00:16:50.240
Whether that's PHP, or
Ruby on Rails, or just an Nginx,

259
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.011
or any one of those technologies expects.

260
00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:58.151
And I can't really be any more specific
than that, it really just depends on,

261
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:01.163
you have to take another course
to figure out which one for

262
00:17:01.163 --> 00:17:03.064
whatever server you're using is.
