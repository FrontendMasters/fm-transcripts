1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.515
Something that probably we haven't
talked a little bit about yet,

2
00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.930
but notice that these
are on different lines.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.510
This is actually just purely
from me as the developer, right?

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.927
If I hit Enter a bunch of times here, so

5
00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:15.490
there's a bunch of what we
would call whitespace here.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.108
Notice, this isn't getting
a lot more spaced out.

7
00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:21.100
Actually, it is for a different reason.

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.323
But typically, this whitespace
is not actually significant.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.116
Yeah, I forgot these are in
preformatted code blocks.

10
00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:40.840
Typically, though, in HTML,
the amount of whitespace is not important.

11
00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:49.012
So yeah, okay, cool.

12
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.951
Let's talk about anchor tags.

13
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.080
Anchor tags are links, right?

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.896
So if I wanted to send you to
a different web page, so, and

15
00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.850
I think we kind of intuit this already.

16
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.634
If you look at this and you saw this
on a page, right, Frontend Masters,

17
00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:06.311
Visual Studio Code, CodePen,

18
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:10.550
you would know because these are colored
differently and they're underlined.

19
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.682
And there's the little pointer
guy whenever you hover over it,

20
00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:14.907
that's a link, right?

21
00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:15.713
That goes somewhere.

22
00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:22.400
So if I click on this, right,
it takes me to frontendmaster.com, right?

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.970
That is what a link does.

24
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.581
So the a, which stands for anchor,
not that you really need to care,

25
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.148
you've just caught an a tag,
that's what I do.

26
00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:35.480
Then this little href bit here,
which is called an attribute.

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.770
There's a whole section of attributes, so
we'll talk more about that here in a bit.

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.409
But the href identifies where it goes,
right?

29
00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.913
So this goes to www.frontendmasters.com.

30
00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:48.213
And then here, between this is actually
what's displayed to the user, right?

31
00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:52.820
So if I hover over this, it doesn't
actually say frontendmasters.com, it just

32
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.250
says Frontend Masters, but if I click
on it, it takes me to Frontend Masters.

33
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.397
Same thing here with the VS Code one and
the same thing here with CodePen.

34
00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:10.445
So that's the way that you link various
different things, is using a tags, Okay?

35
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.912
Let's talk about divs,
which is short for division.

36
00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:21.670
I like to think of divs
like cardboard boxes.

37
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.102
A cardboard box is more
defined by what's in it than

38
00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.200
the cardboard box itself, right?

39
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.336
The most interesting part of a cardboard
box is not the box, unless you're a cat.

40
00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:38.940
It's more what's inside of
the box that makes a difference.

41
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.536
So here, I just put a random div here so
that you can see.

42
00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:47.674
Here, I just made it a red square,
using a little bit of CSS here,

43
00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:50.557
which again will have
a whole section on CSS.

44
00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:53.046
But in and of itself,
if I just do div like this,

45
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.576
This is an empty cardboard box,
there's literally nothing in it.

46
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.340
I have to put something in it for
it to be interesting.

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.060
So now, I have a cardboard
box that has a heading in it.

48
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.300
That's way more interesting
than an empty cardboard box.

49
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.159
So a div, which is a division, is
basically you're identifying this part of

50
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.023
something is distinct from something else.

51
00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:24.625
It's a generic divider between something.

52
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.609
It'd be like, if you had a filing cabinet,

53
00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.627
you put dividers between your various
different types of files, right?

54
00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:33.990
So we'll use them a lot.

55
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.168
It's actually one of the most common
tags you use, because typically,

56
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:40.570
you have a lot of divisions of various
different sorts of things in your code.

57
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.331
But in and of themselves,
they don't do anything,

58
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.416
they're defined by what they're in.

59
00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:48.617
This will make a lot of sense
once we start getting into CSS,

60
00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:52.142
because you'll use divs and
CSS together to move things around to

61
00:03:52.142 --> 00:03:55.170
make them different colors,
all those sorts of stuff.

62
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.009
So again, this div here, it's defined
by style and what I put on it.

63
00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.568
I basically took a marker and
made a pretty div.

64
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.912
But I can put things inside of it as well,
which is what I just did there.

65
00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:11.724
Right, cool.

66
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:17.408
So that's a div.

67
00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:20.247
By the same token,
there is this thing called the span.

68
00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:23.947
So if a div is a cardboard box,
a span is a Ziploc bag,

69
00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.400
it's a much smaller idea of a div.

70
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.788
So you can see here,
I have this bit of text here.

71
00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:34.258
So this is a paragraph of text here,
this is important text, but

72
00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:36.525
I wanted to really emphasize important.

73
00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:41.955
So what I did here is I put important
into a Ziploc bag using a span, right?

74
00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:45.451
So you use it to emphasize
different parts of text, or

75
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:50.132
just denote that this bit of text is
different than the rest of the text.

76
00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:51.983
And then you can use things like CSS or

77
00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:54.562
JavaScript to make
the individual span do things.

78
00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:59.620
But it's gives you basically a hook to
hook on to some specific piece of text.

79
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.708
If I take off this style portion here,

80
00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:06.384
this important part still in a span,
right?

81
00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:09.790
It's still here, but
I just haven't done anything with it.

82
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.198
So basically,
I put a little hook on it, and

83
00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:14.683
I didn't do anything with the hook, right?

84
00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:18.650
So you need to do something with it
before the span is actually useful.

85
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.810
So I just made it underline
something using a bit of style here.

86
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.292
This is CSS, again,
we have a whole section on it, so

87
00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.130
don't worry necessarily about that.

88
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.980
I want to show you want you
can do with the span, Okay?

89
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.436
Let's talk about ordered lists,
unordered list, and list items.

90
00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:45.720
So you'll see ol and ul tags, stands for
ordered list and unordered list,

91
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.940
and it's exactly what it sounds like,
it's just a list of information.

92
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.644
So if I look down here,
I have this bit of information.

93
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.954
So you can see here the 1, 2, 3, the first
one, the second one, and the third one,

94
00:05:59.954 --> 00:06:01.590
and that just looks like this.

95
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.198
I have an ol with three different li's.

96
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.830
So the ol denotes that this
is a list of stuff, right?

97
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.466
And inside of the list, I'll have various
different list items, the li's, right?

98
00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:17.057
The first one, the second one,
the third one.

99
00:06:17.057 --> 00:06:22.294
So notice, I didn't actually say 1, 2,
3, I didn't put that anywhere, right?

100
00:06:22.294 --> 00:06:25.754
By making it an ordered list,
those just show up automatically, right?

101
00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:31.840
Cuz I'm making a list and
checking it twice, okay?

102
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.246
So an ol is an ordered list.

103
00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:38.790
And you use an ordered list when
the order is important, right?

104
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.898
If I put the first one here,
and then the second one here,

105
00:06:42.898 --> 00:06:45.130
that doesn't make any sense.

106
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.917
I've now since lost the sense of order, so

107
00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:54.190
this ol doesn't apply anymore,
doesn't make any sense.

108
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.616
So you use the ol when order is important,
right?

109
00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:01.520
If I was gonna list out, I don't know,

110
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.536
the past ten winners of the MBA,
there's an order to that, right?

111
00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:11.409
And if I switched the order,
then the list would no longer be correct.

112
00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.459
So that's kind of the thought
process that you should use to

113
00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.135
determine if you should use an ol or ul.

114
00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:20.784
Is that if I switch the order
of two of these things,

115
00:07:20.784 --> 00:07:22.460
will the list still be correct?

116
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.076
If that's true,
that means that there's no order,

117
00:07:27.076 --> 00:07:30.370
then you use an unordered list, a ul.

118
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.198
So here, notice that these are bullet
points, which implied no sense of order.

119
00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:39.621
I could swap any one of these, an item
in the list and other items in the list,

120
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:42.420
blah, blah, blah,
doesn't matter which one comes first.

121
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.190
So this is a good candidate to
be used with an unordered list.

122
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.606
So again, anything that's a list
of things, you'll use a list,

123
00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:51.563
whether it's unordered or ordered.

124
00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.003
Cool.

125
00:07:57.003 --> 00:08:01.861
A button, as you may have guessed,
is a button.

126
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.155
So you can see here, I have this Click me
button, it doesn't do anything, right?

127
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:15.142
But that's how you create buttons in HTML,
is with the button tag.

128
00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:18.595
So you can think of this button like a
doorbell that someone installed on a house

129
00:08:18.595 --> 00:08:20.496
and didn't actually hook up to anything.

130
00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:22.656
It's a button,
you can totally press the doorbell,

131
00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.249
it just not gonna do anything, right?

132
00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:27.552
I've installed my doorbell
on this particular page,

133
00:08:27.552 --> 00:08:32.668
I just never hooked it up to anything, so
if you click the button, nothing happens.

134
00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:34.329
In other words, typically,

135
00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:37.589
you need JavaScript for
the button to react to something.

136
00:08:41.461 --> 00:08:46.240
Question mark, yeah,
it doesn't do anything.

137
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.762
But these are just good things that
you can show to users like, hey,

138
00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:51.212
you should click this because
it's gonna do something, right?

139
00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:53.821
If you had like a form
on a checkout page and

140
00:08:53.821 --> 00:08:57.848
you have a checkout button that
you're telling the user, hey,

141
00:08:57.848 --> 00:09:02.040
click me, I'm gonna do that action
that the button says, right?

142
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.656
Okay, let's talk about image tags,
which are img tags.

143
00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:14.925
So, some people kinda get confused,
it's like, shouldn't image live in CSS,

144
00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.420
it's like it's style, right?

145
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:23.125
But think about it, if you go to
Instagram, right, a social media site for

146
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:28.353
images, the content of
Instagram is the images, right?

147
00:09:28.353 --> 00:09:32.950
So normally belongs in the content, the
images typically will live in your HTML.

148
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.402
Because that was really confusing
to me when I was starting,

149
00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:40.907
I was like,
why am I putting my style in my HTML?

150
00:09:40.907 --> 00:09:42.220
Particularly with images,

151
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.069
they belong more to the content
than they belong to the style.

152
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:52.381
You can sometimes use images with CSS,
and we'll talk about that,

153
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.496
but you can make background images.

154
00:09:54.496 --> 00:09:59.269
But look at the dotted background
here on my website, that would be

155
00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:04.310
a good candidate for a background
image as opposed to a content image.

156
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.893
And I'm talking content images more
like if you go to the newspaper, and

157
00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:12.024
you're reading the newspaper, there's
a big image of whatever the top story is.

158
00:10:12.024 --> 00:10:14.000
That's content, right,
that's part of the story.

159
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.080
That should live in your HTML, okay?

160
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.451
So I have three image tags here of my
best doggo, Luna, very cute doggy.

161
00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.238
She's kind of a jerk, I love her.

162
00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:32.702
The way I do that is I've an image tag,
you give it an src, which stands for

163
00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:34.658
source, as you might imagine.

164
00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:36.555
You tell it where it lives, right?

165
00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:38.600
So this is just an address, right?

166
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.084
So if I copy and
paste this into a different tab, right,

167
00:10:44.084 --> 00:10:50.520
this is actually a valid address
on the Internet for Luna, okay?

168
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.574
And I give it an alt text, so an alt
text is if someone is hard of seeing or

169
00:10:55.574 --> 00:11:01.348
blind, they can tab over this and
obviously they can't see the image, right?

170
00:11:01.348 --> 00:11:05.920
So the screen reader will tell
them what you put here in the alt.

171
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.542
So I'm gonna say, technically,
it is valid to leave these off.

172
00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:13.846
But I'm going to tell you that
if you have an image tag,

173
00:11:13.846 --> 00:11:16.570
you should always put an alt text.

174
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.700
It's just the ethical thing to do so
that everyone can enjoy the Internet.

175
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.996
The Internet is for everybody, okay?

176
00:11:23.996 --> 00:11:28.810
Now, notice here, these are self-closing
tags, which we talked about, right?

177
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.200
Because there's nothing
inside of the image, right?

178
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.394
The image is just a tag unto itself, so

179
00:11:33.394 --> 00:11:36.146
that's why you're gonna
put this slash here.

180
00:11:36.146 --> 00:11:40.010
And technically, it is optional,
you can leave it off.

181
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.294
I just choose to put it
on there because to me,

182
00:11:42.294 --> 00:11:44.590
it makes it more clear
what I'm trying to do.

183
00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:51.710
One more thing about alt text,
Google and Bing will index it.

184
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.173
So Google will crawl your website,
it'll find all those alt texts,

185
00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:57.631
and will index your images
based on that as well.

186
00:11:57.631 --> 00:12:02.375
So alt text is always a good idea, okay?

187
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:05.840
So you can see there, I mean, you can
see here, I'm putting a lot of random

188
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.966
whitespace in these, it's totally fine for
you to just do something like that, right?

189
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.729
The spacing here is totally optional.

190
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.709
In fact, you might even argue,

191
00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:24.398
might be clearer if everything
was all on the same line.

192
00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:25.284
That is up to you.
