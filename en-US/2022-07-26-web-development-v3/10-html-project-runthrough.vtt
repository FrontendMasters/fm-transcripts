00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.864
Let's go over my example
of how I did this,

2
00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:06.608
which to say is not necessarily
is the most correct way.

3
00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:10.229
There's infinitely correct
ways of doing this.

4
00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.239
I'm just gonna show you
the way that I chose to do it.

5
00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:17.881
So again click here on Brian's blog
at the bottom of the HTML project.

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.601
You'll get this, and
if you click View Page Source you can see,

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.687
How I chose to do it.

8
00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:30.555
So I have an h1 here with Brian's blog.

9
00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.739
I don't have any classes here.

10
00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.366
You very likely could have and
should have put classes in here.

11
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.705
Because we're not doing CSS,
I didn't necessarily do that, but

12
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.720
you definitely could have.

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.200
All right, looks like I did put in some.

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.522
So I have a section here for the intro,
I have a section here for the blog posts.

15
00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:56.898
A couple of paragraphs of introduction,
an h2 intro here, blog posts here.

16
00:00:56.898 --> 00:01:01.218
And then I have a bunch of
articles of blog posts, right,

17
00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.743
with the images, h3s and h4s.

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.965
And I repeat that the same kinda
structure for each article and

19
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.668
blog post kind of thing.

20
00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:16.930
That's it.

21
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.662
That was the homepage of the blog.

22
00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:26.525
And then if we go to the About page,
same kind of thing.

23
00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:35.208
Brian's blog about me,
a link back to Brian's blog.

24
00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:41.329
A couple of paragraphs of who I am,
some fun facts.

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.868
This is true.

26
00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:47.358
I once ate a burrito with the band
sugarcoat and I don't even like sugarcoat.

27
00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:49.586
But the burrito was pretty good,
so I was okay with it.

28
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.330
And I won my first gaming tournament.

29
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.777
I was six cuz I beat someone that didn't
know how to play Sonic and Knuckles,

30
00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:58.415
and I did.

31
00:01:58.415 --> 00:01:59.037
Another fun fact.

32
00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:04.358
Pinnacles of Brian's achievements there.

33
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.445
Anyway, that's it.

34
00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:12.556
That's really the extent of
what writing HTML looks like.

35
00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:13.805
It's a lot of this,
nesting tags inside of tags.

36
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:18.863
Now, some of like what's dictating and
the reasons why I'm nesting it in

37
00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:24.491
such a way that, like I'm putting things
together in the same boxes, it's gonna

38
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:29.653
make a lot of sense once we get into
the CSS portion, which we're about to.

39
00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:32.896
So I'm trying to teach you good practices
now that are gonna lead to better

40
00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:33.746
practices later.
