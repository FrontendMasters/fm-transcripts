[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.410
&gt;&gt; Scott: What is a directive?

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.110
A directive is really just a class.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.080
We actually have three
types of directives.

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.030
You already know one.

6
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.140
You've used it so
many times already that's a component.

7
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.792
A component is a directive
with a template that's it.

8
00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:20.823
We also have attribute directives,
which we also use to,

9
00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:26.092
attribute directives are like directives
that change the host component or

10
00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.333
the host element that it's on.

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.192
So the style, behavior, things like that.

12
00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:36.360
So, ngClass would be one,
ngStyle would be actually a directive.

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.560
A structural directive actually
changes the component or

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.228
the host element's structure,
it's HTML content.

15
00:00:43.228 --> 00:00:48.470
So NG4, ng-switch, things like that,
NGIf, those are all

16
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.140
structural directives because they change
how the element is rendered into the DOM.

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.810
So there are tons of built in attribute
and structural directives, but

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.543
we can also, of course, make our own.

19
00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:03.670
And then we'll talk about
how to access the DOM and

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.208
do things you would normally do in jQuery.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So

21
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:12.269
a directive is responsible for
modifying a dynamic template.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.644
A component is a specific
kind of directive,

23
00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:19.708
we talked about this.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So

24
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:24.495
we're gonna breeze past these right here
because I think its better if I just get

25
00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:28.960
into the code and show you this stuff,
so don't worry about this stuff.

26
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.440
So we're gonna talk about structural and
attribute directives.

27
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.860
We're gonna create a directive, and then
we're gonna create a structural directive.

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.650
So we're just gonna do that.

29
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.560
I'd rather just do that live than
this is what this is, cuz it's yeah.

30
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.780
So when we do create these directives
the way the accessing the DOM is using

31
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.660
the ElementRef.

32
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.320
The ElementRef is exactly
what it sounds like.

33
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.480
It is a reference to element
that the directive is hosted on,

34
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.430
so we will use that to
get access to it and

35
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.120
that object has a property called a native
element which gives us the native element.

36
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.950
So that is how we would do things.

37
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.430
So that pretty much takes you back to
Angular 1, where you had the element

38
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.670
object that was in the link function and
the compile function and what not.

39
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.840
And you can do things there.

40
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.795
That's what it's getting to.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So here's an example

41
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:28.000
of how you would access the DOM
inside of a attribute directive here.

42
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.442
It's a blink tag.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bring it

43
00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:36.952
back.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So

44
00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:38.450
we're gonna get into this a little more.

45
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.920
Okay, any questions?

46
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.940
I just wanted to get right into it.

47
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.310
So if you have any questions so far?

48
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.750
Otherwise, I just want to get into it.

49
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.020
Wanna see me mess up.

50
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.880
All right, so let's do it.

51
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.185
So first, what we're gonna do is,
we'll make some basic

52
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:06.280
attribute directives, then I'll
show you some of the built in ones,

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.720
and then we'll talk about some
structural directives, and

54
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.710
then I'll set you guys off on exercises.

55
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.579
Cool?

56
00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.930
All right, so let's just make a basic
attribute directive, let's just make one,

57
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.360
I'm gonna call it what's a cool one?

58
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.820
Color.

59
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.425
What'd you call it?
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH]

60
00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:36.310
All right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Got a K

61
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.650
&gt;&gt; Scott: Sorry, there we go.

62
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.424
There you go.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

63
00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:42.400
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.

64
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wait no,

65
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.725
did you mean like MARQ?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah

66
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.615
&gt;&gt; Scott: Like a marquee.

67
00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.385
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What you gotta do is you

68
00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:54.645
gotta grab all of the elements in
the component and bunch them together.

69
00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:57.427
So it's marquee and the funky bunch.

70
00:03:57.427 --> 00:04:01.376
[LAUGH] Boom.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let's just do that-

71
00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:04.037
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'll give $5 if you can do

72
00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:07.333
that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH]

73
00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.055
&gt;&gt; Scott: Next time.

74
00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:13.870
We'll just make a color one
that just changes the color

75
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.670
of text when you hover over it initially.

76
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.180
So the first thing we need to do is import
our dependencies, our modules here.

77
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.950
So, that's going to include
stuff from Angular 2, of course.

78
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.845
So, we have the directive that we have.

79
00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:39.935
I´ve been using before and
that´s all we need for now.

80
00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:43.570
So, now all we have to say
is it is the directive,

81
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.936
&gt;&gt; Scott: or am I get the fancy or

82
00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:50.785
I got to save it first.

83
00:04:50.785 --> 00:04:53.385
There we go.
I say it is not highlight.

84
00:04:53.385 --> 00:04:55.180
So we use the directive.

85
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.480
Decorator here instead of component.

86
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.590
And again,
component is just a type of directive.

87
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.740
But this is like the foundation of it.

88
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.810
So like a component,
we can give it a selector.

89
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.100
In this case the selector
is an attribute so

90
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.960
I'm gonna use the CSS attribute selector
similar which is the square brackets.

91
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.135
And I'm gonna say it's

92
00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:23.030
attribute is gonna be Colorer.

93
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.060
What's a better name?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's perfect,

94
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.540
just go with it.
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] Let's do it, colorer.

95
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It sounds like

96
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.370
something somebody would release.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, colorer more.

97
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.810
All right.
So we got color and

98
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.060
that's pretty much all we're going
to need now for that directive.

99
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.210
And then what we're going to do is
we're going to just export this

100
00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:52.050
&gt;&gt; Scott: Colorer, cool.

101
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.800
So we'll have that, and
then we need to access the dom.

102
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.750
So what we'll do is,
we need to import the element ref.

103
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.463
We'll come down here in our constructor.

104
00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:11.820
&gt;&gt; Scott: And I'll just call this o.

105
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.300
Let's go to the ElementRef.

106
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.268
So now we have that.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And then just

107
00:06:20.268 --> 00:06:25.634
right off the bat I'll just go ahead and

108
00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:29.570
say _el.nativeElement.

109
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.030
So now we have the native dom element
here, which means I can access

110
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.810
the style property and
get the color property on that.

111
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.150
And I'll just say red.

112
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.990
And so it changed the color to red or
whatever listing is hosted on.

113
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.010
So now let's use this thing.

114
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.840
So let's just inject it into the app.

115
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.750
So now we're gonna app and
we just need to add it to the directives.

116
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.207
So we'll say colorer which also
means we need to import it.

117
00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:14.614
&gt;&gt; Scott: No, is that not right?

118
00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:19.025
&gt;&gt; Scott: I called it color,

119
00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:22.491
okay.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now we imported it so

120
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.380
now we can actually use it.

121
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.340
So what we need to do is just go, now
because it's at the app level component,

122
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.080
that means every child component and
including app now has access to

123
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.180
our directory that we just made
cuz it's at the top of the tree.

124
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.550
So we'll just go ahead and
go to app.html we'll use it here.

125
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:48.570
Let's find a piece of text.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let's add it here to the span.

126
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:54.816
So now we can say,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Colorer.

127
00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:57.600
Like that,
just like you would any attribute.

128
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.510
So, let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Scott: There it is.

129
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.910
So, it's red.
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right?

130
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.810
Any questions on that?

131
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.910
So that's a basic attribute directive.

132
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.320
Let's just review that for one second.

133
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.456
Pretty simple here.

134
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:20.086
Directive, annotation,

135
00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:26.040
a selector access to the native
element and then just dial it.
