2
00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:08.625
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So, what we are going to
do is create a widgets feature.

3
00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.640
You're welcome to use any of
the other features as an example.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.540
So, for instance you could reference home.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.020
They're fairly consistent.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.400
Other than experiments I tend to
build out on that a little further.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.096
And, so create a widgets feature,

8
00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:28.060
that's going to include the file
structure, the class for it.

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.340
You can do your template inline or
as a template URL.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.848
Your call,
play around with both if you want,

11
00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:47.500
and then display your widgets
component in the home component.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.955
Bonus, if you actually look at the routes,
so

13
00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:55.320
there's a few things I'm gonna allow you
to push yourself on, is you can create

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.400
a simple route to navigate to that
component, the widgets component directly.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.470
It's pretty easy to figure it out.

16
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.502
And so if you want to add an additional
button to the nav bar across the top to go

17
00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:09.833
to widgets, we're gonna do that anyways.

18
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:14.394
But it wouldn't hurt to maybe
get a head start on that,

19
00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:17.873
as well as, please write a widgets test.

20
00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:22.779
And, fairly straightforward but the big
thing is I want you to create the widgets

21
00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:27.560
file structure, and the file, and
then get that rendering in your home page.
