00:00:00.517 --> 00:00:04.138
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:04.691
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right so

3
00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:08.930
the first thing we're going to do is
a template expression via interpolation.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.540
Okay, simple enough.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.040
Let's do that.

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.950
Let's put some interpolation here.

7
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.509
And say message.

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.560
So message is going to be a string
which is going to equal hey.

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.190
Pretty boring message.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.490
Boom.

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.769
So let's serve that up and

12
00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:45.151
see if that works.
&gt;&gt; Scott: No.

13
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.830
Oops.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.850
I forgot to npm install.

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.005
This is gonna take forever.

16
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.900
[LAUGH] So
let's just assume that works for now,

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.410
we'll come back when it's done installing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Give me

18
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.480
the benefit of the doubt.
&gt;&gt; Scott: The next thing is we're gonna do

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.650
a property binding.

20
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.650
All right, cool.

21
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.140
Well there's really not
anything interesting we could

22
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.605
bind to in this h one so
let's just make some real HTML here.

23
00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:14.750
Let's just say, widgets, here.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690
And then we'll go back to our
h one example that we had.

25
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.590
And we'll use the same thing that we had,
which was message, cool.

26
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.550
And then let's just use a button.

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.950
That's pretty awesome, pretty simple.

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.400
Click.

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.510
Actually, we've done button before.

30
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.130
Let's do something different.

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.240
Let's try something else.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Center,

32
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.450
A mouse over.
&gt;&gt; Scott: A mouse over?

33
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.510
What about a scroll?

34
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.880
Let's try a scroll.

35
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.670
That's usually a big killer for
performancing.

36
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's try that.

37
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.650
Let's see a scroll.

38
00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.934
So we'll do a scroll here.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.

39
00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:06.111
[LAUGH] So
we'll bind to the scroll event, and

40
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:11.570
when that happens we'll say,
handle scroll.

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.984
Boom.
So now we need to come down here and

42
00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:21.880
we need to say, handle scroll.

43
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.454
This is gonna be a lot,
hopefully it doesn't work break.

44
00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:32.995
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.

45
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:33.917
&gt;&gt; Scott: Well obviously don't

46
00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:36.394
have anything to scroll so
lets make this thing scrollable.

47
00:02:36.394 --> 00:02:42.947
And we'll add some styles here.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

48
00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:47.082
we'll say dot scroll class.

49
00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:50.944
Height of

50
00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:57.225
&gt;&gt; Scott: 100 pixels.

51
00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:02.467
Width of

52
00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:08.050
&gt;&gt; Scott: 300 pixels.

53
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.283
And then we'll say, overflow
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.

54
00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:19.907
Cool, so that thing's gonna scroll and

55
00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:24.267
we'll just put some stuff in here like

56
00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.846
&gt;&gt; Scott: 20 pixels.

57
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.630
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oops.

58
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.674
This is a shortcut that I'm using.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Aw, what?

59
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.511
Really?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's what happens when

60
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:54.698
you've got 19 updates.
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] I can't do that Emmett?

61
00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:55.732
Really?

62
00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:58.771
Okay, whatever.
I tried to do like, I'm using error for

63
00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:03.887
these short cuts but it's like not,
this is why I don't use sometimes.

64
00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:09.421
It's really ridiculous.

65
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.210
Cool.

66
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.020
So we got all that.

67
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.100
So now let's check out the scroll.

68
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.150
Let's even make it so
it definitely has to scroll here.

69
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.320
Okay, so let's check it out.

70
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.610
So now let's see handle scroll.

71
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.978
Yeah!
It all installed.

72
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.924
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so let's go here.

73
00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:40.272
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right and then,

74
00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:45.178
widgets.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Where is that widget at?

75
00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:59.090
&gt;&gt; Scott: Widgets, widget, handle scroll.

76
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.789
Why is that thing not on the page?

77
00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:02.421
Let's save that again.

78
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:08.448
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'm

79
00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:12.579
just saying.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Any errors?

80
00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:13.695
Hm.

81
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:14.561
No errors.

82
00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:30.930
&gt;&gt; Scott: What?
Let's see what's going on here.

83
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.330
Look at that.

84
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.284
It's not even showing up somehow.

85
00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:42.488
It's too small.
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

86
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.990
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

87
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.150
Cool.

88
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.650
Okay.

89
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.940
So now, on scroll,
we had a contant dot log.

90
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.400
It's already got 43 in it, so there we go.

91
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.510
Scroll it.

92
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.956
So it pretty much handle any event.
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right,

93
00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:21.180
so the next one we need to do is,
I did the event binding.

94
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.549
Supposed to be property binding first.
&gt;&gt; Scott: But

95
00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:30.180
now let's do the property binding.

96
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.790
Let's bind a property to,
what's a good one?

97
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do like Is Scrolling?

98
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.780
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is Scrolling.

99
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.280
Okay.

100
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.410
That's complicated,
you know what, let's see.

101
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.300
What about the input?

102
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.390
Let's do a property binding on
the input to the placeholder.

103
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.010
Nope, placeholder is an attribute,
not a property, I believe.

104
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.831
Or is it?

105
00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:02.748
Let's see.

106
00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:07.530
Placeholder.

107
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.727
All right, I think that's just
an attribute so that might not work.

108
00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:13.742
Let's not do that.

109
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:14.730
I know what you can do.

110
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.170
Let's try a,
we will bind to an attribute property.

111
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.321
So some of the small cases I said where
you can actually bind to attributes,

112
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:24.029
this is the one.

113
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:29.432
So we'll bind to the style

114
00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:35.690
dot transform property.

115
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.490
Yeah, that's what we'll do,
style dot transfrom.

116
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:45.316
And then what we'll do is
move this button here,

117
00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:49.146
style transform equals and

118
00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:53.157
then we will say x position.

119
00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:57.708
Cool, so then what we'll do,

120
00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:05.214
we'll make a constructor.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

121
00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:10.207
I will say this dot
&gt;&gt; Scott: Transform.

122
00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:14.625
&gt;&gt; Scott: Which does nothing right now and

123
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:22.003
then we'll make a transform method.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Which this

124
00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:27.631
dot.
&gt;&gt; Scott: x position,

125
00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:35.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: Equals 30 pixels.

126
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.798
There we go.

127
00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:44.401
Or no.
Zero pixels, zero pixels.

128
00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:49.154
This dot exposition equals,

129
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:56.790
I know what we'll do.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Zero.

130
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.323
And then we'll do this one at interval.

131
00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:34.151
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

132
00:09:34.151 --> 00:09:35.849
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yup, I need to put pixels.

133
00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:44.196
&gt;&gt; Scott: Whoa,

134
00:09:44.196 --> 00:09:49.612
is this getting complicated.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

135
00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:50.360
&gt;&gt; Scott: But

136
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.430
I think it's done now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

137
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.340
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oops, I got it backwards,

138
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:59.978
hold on.
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

139
00:09:59.978 --> 00:10:01.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

140
00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:02.945
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, let's

141
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.825
see if that works.

142
00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:07.575
So, wait, that's still not right.

143
00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:11.923
It needs to be translate x.

144
00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:18.520
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

145
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.990
Now, it should work.

146
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.677
Really complicated, but
I need it to be complicated on purpose.

147
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:24.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

148
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's what he's

149
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.740
telling himself.

150
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.282
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Actually, let's do this.

151
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.704
&gt;&gt; Scott: This is not for

152
00:10:34.704 --> 00:10:35.730
you guys to copy.

153
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:41.272
So, if you try to copy, like don't.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're

154
00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:43.330
saying we're not good enough?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

155
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that what you're

156
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.658
saying?
&gt;&gt; Scott: No, I'm saying

157
00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:45.217
I'm not good enough.

158
00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:56.910
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're taking bets in the

159
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.615
chat room if you're gonna pull this off.

160
00:10:58.615 --> 00:10:59.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right.

161
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.470
Let's see.

162
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.960
Let's check it out.

163
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.228
All right, so stuff.

164
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.662
[LAUGH] We'll see what happens with this.

165
00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:08.847
So we have this thing- There's no way for

166
00:11:08.847 --> 00:11:11.668
me to recover after this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

167
00:11:11.668 --> 00:11:13.462
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's transformed and

168
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:15.980
it's gonna translate by this.

169
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.990
So, and I'm gonna doing new transitions so

170
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.420
it's probably not gonna be smooth but
we'll see what happens.

171
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.131
It's working.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

172
00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:28.803
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go so

173
00:11:28.803 --> 00:11:33.872
I'm binding to this style attribute.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

174
00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:35.036
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'd like to bridge it.

175
00:11:35.036 --> 00:11:36.064
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

176
00:11:36.064 --> 00:11:36.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Let's talk about it later.

177
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That could have been in

178
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.180
a mouse over.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I mean I can make it nice.

179
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.372
We can, if I want to make it nice, I can
just come up here and we could do this.

180
00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:51.050
Button.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just realized

181
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.970
what's happening.

182
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.500
Scott doesn't want to do the router
module, and he figures if he

183
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.590
just stalls we're going to be like, sorry.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

184
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.956
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your module today.

185
00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:05.534
&gt;&gt; Scott: Transform .3 seconds ease in.

186
00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:08.273
There we go, now it'll be smooth-ish.

187
00:12:08.273 --> 00:12:16.759
Let's see if it reloads.

188
00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:17.970
Hey, there we go.

189
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.562
See [LAUGH]
So yeah so

190
00:12:24.562 --> 00:12:29.750
that how you bind to
&gt;&gt; Scott: Properties.

191
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.548
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

192
00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:33.421
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yup [LAUGH]
