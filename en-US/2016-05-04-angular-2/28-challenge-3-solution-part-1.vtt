00:00:00.517 --> 00:00:04.138
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:04.691
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right so

3
00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:08.930
the first thing we're going to do is
a template expression via interpolation.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.540
Okay, simple enough.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.040
Let's do that.

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.950
Let's put some interpolation here.

7
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.509
And say message.

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.560
So message is going to be a string
which is going to equal hey.

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.190
Pretty boring message.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.490
Boom.

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.705
So let's serve that up and
see if that works.

12
00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.151
&gt;&gt; Scott: No.

13
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.830
Oops.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.850
I forgot to npm install.

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.005
This is gonna take forever.

16
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.900
[LAUGH] So
let's just assume that works for now,

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.030
we'll come back when it's done installing.

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Give me
the benefit of the doubt.

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.650
&gt;&gt; Scott: The next thing is we're
gonna do a property binding.

20
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.650
All right, cool.

21
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.140
Well there's really not
anything interesting we could

22
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.605
bind to in this h one so
let's just make some real HTML here.

23
00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:14.750
Let's just say, widgets, here.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.690
And then we'll go back to our
h one example that we had.

25
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.590
And we'll use the same thing that we had,
which was message, cool.

26
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.550
And then let's just use a button.

27
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.950
That's pretty awesome, pretty simple.

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.400
Click.

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.510
Actually, we've done button before.

30
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.130
Let's do something different.

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950
Let's try something else.

32
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Center, A mouse over.

33
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.460
&gt;&gt; Scott: A mouse over?

34
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.510
What about a scroll?

35
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.880
Let's try a scroll.

36
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.670
That's usually a big killer for
performancing.

37
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's try that.

38
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.650
Let's see a scroll.

39
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.975
So we'll do a scroll here.

40
00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:05.702
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.
[LAUGH] So we'll bind to the scroll event,

41
00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:11.570
and when that happens we'll say,
handle scroll.

42
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.984
Boom.
So now we need to come down here and

43
00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:21.880
we need to say, handle scroll.

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.454
This is gonna be a lot,
hopefully it doesn't work break.

45
00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:29.858
Okay.

46
00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.995
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.

47
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.984
&gt;&gt; Scott: Well obviously don't
have anything to scroll so

48
00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:36.394
lets make this thing scrollable.

49
00:02:36.394 --> 00:02:38.896
And we'll add some styles here.

50
00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:47.082
&gt;&gt; Scott: And we'll say dot scroll class.

51
00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:50.944
Height of

52
00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:57.225
&gt;&gt; Scott: 100 pixels.

53
00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:02.467
Width of

54
00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:08.050
&gt;&gt; Scott: 300 pixels.

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.283
And then we'll say, overflow
&gt;&gt; Scott: Scroll.

56
00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:19.907
Cool, so that thing's gonna scroll and

57
00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:24.267
we'll just put some stuff in here like

58
00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.846
&gt;&gt; Scott: 20 pixels.

59
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.630
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oops.

60
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.675
This is a shortcut that I'm using.

61
00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:46.674
&gt;&gt; Scott: Aw, what?

62
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.560
Really?

63
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.608
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's what happens
when you've got 19 updates.

64
00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:54.698
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] I can't do that Emmett?

65
00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:55.732
Really?

66
00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:58.771
Okay, whatever.
I tried to do like, I'm using error for

67
00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:03.887
these short cuts but it's like not,
this is why I don't use sometimes.

68
00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:09.421
It's really ridiculous.

69
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.210
Cool.

70
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.020
So we got all that.

71
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.100
So now let's check out the scroll.

72
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.150
Let's even make it so
it definitely has to scroll here.

73
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.320
Okay, so let's check it out.

74
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.610
So now let's see handle scroll.

75
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.978
Yeah!
It all installed.

76
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.924
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so let's go here.

77
00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:41.160
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right and then, widgets.

78
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.178
&gt;&gt; Scott: Where is that widget at?

79
00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:59.090
&gt;&gt; Scott: Widgets, widget, handle scroll.

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.789
Why is that thing not on the page?

81
00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:02.421
Let's save that again.

82
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:04.358
Yeah.

83
00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:10.056
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'm just saying.

84
00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:12.579
&gt;&gt; Scott: Any errors?

85
00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:13.695
Hm.

86
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:14.561
No errors.

87
00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:30.930
&gt;&gt; Scott: What?
Let's see what's going on here.

88
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.330
Look at that.

89
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.284
It's not even showing up somehow.

90
00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:39.020
It's too small.

91
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.488
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.990
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

93
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.150
Cool.

94
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.650
Okay.

95
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.940
So now, on scroll,
we had a contant dot log.

96
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.400
It's already got 43 in it, so there we go.

97
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.510
Scroll it.

98
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.151
So it pretty much handle any event.

99
00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:21.180
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so the next one we
need to do is, I did the event binding.

100
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.734
Supposed to be property binding first.

101
00:06:26.204 --> 00:06:30.180
&gt;&gt; Scott: But
now let's do the property binding.

102
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.790
Let's bind a property to,
what's a good one?

103
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do like Is Scrolling?

104
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.780
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is Scrolling.

105
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.280
Okay.

106
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.410
That's complicated,
you know what, let's see.

107
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.300
What about the input?

108
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.390
Let's do a property binding on
the input to the placeholder.

109
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.010
Nope, placeholder is an attribute,
not a property, I believe.

110
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.831
Or is it?

111
00:06:58.831 --> 00:07:02.748
Let's see.

112
00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:07.530
Placeholder.

113
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.727
All right, I think that's just
an attribute so that might not work.

114
00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:13.742
Let's not do that.

115
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:14.730
I know what you can do.

116
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.170
Let's try a,
we will bind to an attribute property.

117
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.321
So some of the small cases I said where
you can actually bind to attributes,

118
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:24.029
this is the one.

119
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:29.432
So we'll bind to the style

120
00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:35.690
dot transform property.

121
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.490
Yeah, that's what we'll do,
style dot transfrom.

122
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:45.316
And then what we'll do is
move this button here,

123
00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:49.146
style transform equals and

124
00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:53.157
then we will say x position.

125
00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:57.708
Cool, so then what we'll do,

126
00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:01.916
we'll make a constructor.

127
00:08:05.008 --> 00:08:10.207
&gt;&gt; Scott: And I will say this dot
&gt;&gt; Scott: Transform.

128
00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:17.468
&gt;&gt; Scott: Which does nothing right now and
then we'll make a transform method.

129
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:22.693
&gt;&gt; Scott: Which this dot.

130
00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:27.631
&gt;&gt; Scott: x position,

131
00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:35.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: Equals 30 pixels.

132
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.798
There we go.

133
00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:44.401
Or no.
Zero pixels, zero pixels.

134
00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:49.154
This dot exposition equals,

135
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.770
I know what we'll do.

136
00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:56.790
&gt;&gt; Scott: Zero.

137
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.323
And then we'll do this one at interval.

138
00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:35.849
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yup, I need to put pixels.

139
00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:47.293
&gt;&gt; Scott: Whoa,
is this getting complicated.

140
00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:51.345
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: But I think it's done now.

141
00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:51.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: Oops, I got it

142
00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:52.661
backwards, hold on.

143
00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:01.695
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

144
00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:02.945
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, let's

145
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:04.825
see if that works.

146
00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:07.575
So, wait, that's still not right.

147
00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:11.923
It needs to be translate x.

148
00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:18.520
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

149
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.990
Now, it should work.

150
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.677
Really complicated, but
I need it to be complicated on purpose.

151
00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:24.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's

152
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.740
what he's telling himself.

153
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.282
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Actually, let's do this.

154
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: This is not for
you guys to copy.

155
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.504
So, if you try to copy, like don't.

156
00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:43.099
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're saying
we're not good enough?

157
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:44.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that what you're saying?

158
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.217
&gt;&gt; Scott: No,
I'm saying I'm not good enough.

159
00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:56.130
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

160
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.615
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're taking bets in the
chat room if you're gonna pull this off.

161
00:10:58.615 --> 00:10:59.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right.

162
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.470
Let's see.

163
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.960
Let's check it out.

164
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.228
All right, so stuff.

165
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.662
[LAUGH] We'll see what happens with this.

166
00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:10.853
So we have this thing- There's no way for
me to recover after this.

167
00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:13.462
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's transformed and

168
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:15.980
it's gonna translate by this.

169
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.990
So, and I'm gonna doing new transitions so

170
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.420
it's probably not gonna be smooth but
we'll see what happens.

171
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.124
It's working.

172
00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:28.803
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go so

173
00:11:28.803 --> 00:11:33.822
I'm binding to this style attribute.

174
00:11:33.822 --> 00:11:35.036
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'd like to bridge it.

175
00:11:35.036 --> 00:11:36.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Let's talk about it later.

176
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.829
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That could
have been in a mouse over.

177
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.180
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I mean I can make it nice.

178
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.372
We can, if I want to make it nice, I can
just come up here and we could do this.

179
00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:50.460
Button.

180
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just
realized what's happening.

181
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.460
Scott doesn't want to do
the router module, and

182
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.514
he figures if he just stalls
we're going to be like, sorry.

183
00:11:57.514 --> 00:11:59.956
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your module today.

184
00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:05.534
&gt;&gt; Scott: Transform .3 seconds ease in.

185
00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:08.273
There we go, now it'll be smooth-ish.

186
00:12:08.273 --> 00:12:16.759
Let's see if it reloads.

187
00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:17.970
Hey, there we go.

188
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.562
See [LAUGH]
So yeah so

189
00:12:24.562 --> 00:12:29.750
that how you bind to
&gt;&gt; Scott: Properties.

190
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.421
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yup [LAUGH]
