[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Now you guys
are gonna be doing the challenge.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.260
So flesh out the widgets template
with the following stuff.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.924
A template expression via interpolation,

5
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.093
so brackets, a property binding.

6
00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:29.290
An event binding and a two-way binding.

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.546
They can be whatever you want.

8
00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:31.046
&gt;&gt; Audience: [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes?

9
00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:32.340
&gt;&gt; Audience: Is there any reason why you

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.380
wrapped the style property with a bracket?

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.740
Because I think it works
with just the back ticks.

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.298
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: In the bracket.

13
00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:42.963
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

14
00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:46.290
In more that one style.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.340
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
you have more than one.

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay, so
if you wanted to load a list.

17
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
you can have more than one style.

18
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.790
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's also pretty powerful.

19
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.500
You can stack up, pretty cool.

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.810
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
you can put many styles here,

21
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.400
so it just became a habit, and
I think my linter freaks out if I don't.

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.580
&gt;&gt; Audience: I see.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Or maybe it doesn't.

23
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.490
It did earlier.

24
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.090
I don't know.

25
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.456
It doesn't like me.

26
00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:04.120
So.
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay.

27
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.960
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Just, so do I like,
you know what I'll let this pass.

28
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.810
I'll let this one pass.

29
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.234
So, you can put multiple stuff in there,
which is pretty awesome.

30
00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:13.235
So, yeah.

31
00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:17.740
Add these new template
lessons that we learned.

32
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.200
They can be anything, any properties.

33
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.730
Add some clicks to your widgets.

34
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.240
add some variables that are going to be
rendered in a target via interpolation,

35
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.430
an event binding, and a two-way.

36
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.870
We didn't talk about two-way,
I didn't talk about it on purpose.

37
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.620
So, I need to leave something there for
you guys to explore.

38
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.350
But we did talk about open slides, so

39
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.810
I didn't really show you
an example of how to do it.

40
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.500
But if you know how to do property and

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370
you know how to do event binding,
It's just both of them combined.

42
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.050
So, you should be fine there.

43
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.218
Bonus, use a local variable via hash tag.

44
00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:52.040
Use a built-in directive
via the asterisk and

45
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.920
use the elvis operator with a setTimeout
to demonstrate a temporary null.

46
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.220
So I don't know about the Elvis thing,
I need to look into that.

47
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.680
The hashtag thing we went over,
so you can check that out.

48
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.260
Note, you can put that hashtag
on anything in the template and

49
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.940
it'll store as a lower variable.

50
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.170
It's almost like if you use React,
it's like refs.

51
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.260
You ever use a ref in React?

52
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.750
It's like that.

53
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.250
Very similar.
