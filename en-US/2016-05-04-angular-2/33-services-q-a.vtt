2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes, sir?

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What would
you ever put in for

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.080
metadata in an injectable decorator there?

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, I think you
could do additional providers in here.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.010
That's a good question.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So, the injectable decorator
is only needed if you want to inject

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.850
other services into that service.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.620
So, in this case, Lukas isn't injecting
anything into that service, so

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.680
if he got rid of injectable
it would actually still work.

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.341
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But

12
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.104
if he were to put a service in that
service, then he would need injectable.

13
00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:33.701
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well,
there's some confusion,

14
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.360
I have some confusion around that.

15
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.220
I think the document, actually,
is not crystal clear about that.

16
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.390
So, Pascal, the way he writes in his
blog post, you would think that you

17
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.600
only need injectable if you need
to inject something into it.

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.150
But the document says that injectable,
it makes that service

19
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.020
available to the injector to
be injected into other things.

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.518
For injection.

21
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:03.620
And so, that's, I will be the fist
person to admit that I'm confused.

22
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.842
&gt;&gt; Scott: Beta.

23
00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:08.154
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,
so to that I just say beta.

24
00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:11.750
&gt;&gt; Scott: But you should always do
injectable because you never know,

25
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.148
if you write this in third party module,

26
00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:18.958
you never know you if somebody's gonna
extend this, or like you have to go back.

27
00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.075
So just always do it because
it won't hut to add it.

28
00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:24.262
But It will hurt if you don't have it
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Scott just reached in

29
00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:25.940
and pulled me from the abyss.

30
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.119
Thank you.

31
00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.377
Nice save.

32
00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:31.580
Are you ready to talk about routes or
what?

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,
there's a question here.

34
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.097
Is there a way to inject the pricing
service without putting it at the root app

35
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.234
component level?

36
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:41.117
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,

37
00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:47.007
I believe you can go
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Does this take?

38
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.118
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm
getting all greens, so

39
00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:56.423
I'm thinking
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So,

40
00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:59.160
by doing that gonna need an instance.

41
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.310
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, so
I think you can inject it right in here.

42
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.819
Let me just check real quick.

43
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.803
Angular io.

44
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.737
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This
is where muscle memory,

45
00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:19.073
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Injectable metadata.

46
00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.499
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You may, the way that
I'm reading it, actually have to inject it

47
00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.500
into a top level component for
it to be available for your service.

48
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.472
It doesn't look like this actually takes
any parameters, which is interesting.

49
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.622
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, the injectable
director doesn't take any injectables,

50
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:54.808
which is weird cuz it's
name is injectable.

51
00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.680
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That just
seems like hypocritical.

52
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.206
I want to be injected, but
I'm not accepting, seems rather one way.

53
00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:10.480
So, anyways, I, apparently at this point,
in order to get a service

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.510
available to another service, you have to
inject it at some top level component.

55
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.150
If I find out anything different,
I'll let you know.

56
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.696
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So,
some random thing on the Internet said

57
00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:28.433
if you used component you
don't need to use injectable.

58
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.022
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So maybe you can use
component and give it providers.

59
00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:36.490
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Interesting.

60
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.430
If you could find that random thing,
post a link somewhere.

61
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.190
That would be helpful.

62
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.200
We are a community.

63
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.022
A child does not raise itself.

64
00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:50.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The other way,
there is a way to get your service.

65
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.160
So, you just have to have
injectable in your service.

66
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.922
And then the service that you wanna
inject, just annotate it inside

67
00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.781
the constructor of the service that
you're trying to inject it into,

68
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.613
and it should work.

69
00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:05.835
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And you can annotate
it directly in the constructor?

70
00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:07.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, you can enter
it directly into the constructor.

71
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.640
As long as you import it in the top
of the file, you should be fine.
