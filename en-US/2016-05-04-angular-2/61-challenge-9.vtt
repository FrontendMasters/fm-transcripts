00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.191
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay.
So for the sake of the challenge,

3
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:14.220
it's going to be ngModel, with ng-click
that will get you through phase one.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.800
So what I want you to do is,
in your widget-details form, your object,

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.620
your selected object, I want you to
create a form and bind to that via input.

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.384
Then I want you to find
a way to submit that up to

7
00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.510
the parent component via output.

8
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.860
Now, what I'd like you to do from here is
take what you've seen in the plunks and

9
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.460
start to build out
FormBuilder to control that.

10
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.240
So start to actually set up
a control group via FormBuilder and

11
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.900
then add in some validators for
that, at least one for the bonus.
