00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.405
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Welcome to
Build Better Apps with Angular 2.

3
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:47.321
This is, as Mark said,
my third Frontend Masters Workshop, so

4
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:53.329
I was here kind of towards the beginning
of when Frontend Masters was still kind

5
00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.150
of growing up and it's since turned
into a quite a veritable platform.

6
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.910
I owe Mark actually, I was telling him
last night that I really think kind of

7
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.244
the genesis of my career in Angular
started with Frontend Masters.

8
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.375
I'd been blogging for a bit, but then
once I had hooked up with Mark and we did

9
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.950
Frontend Masters, it seems like everything
just went kind of to the next level,

10
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.940
so huge thanks to him for that.

11
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.320
I really just appreciate his commitment
and his passion to building something that

12
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.390
helps people learn, and
he's really just passionate about

13
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.300
changing just how people learn, and
providing the best possible resources.

14
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.405
So just being conversational
here as we kinda get started.

15
00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:42.919
It's amazing to me how when I go places,
even in Europe and

16
00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.362
different places where people
will come up to me and say,

17
00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:50.615
I got into Angular because of your
Frontend Masters course that I saw.

18
00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:55.441
And so that is really, truly why I
do what I do, is because Angular has

19
00:01:55.441 --> 00:02:00.300
been very good to me,
it's provided a really good livelihood.

20
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.265
But being able to take the things that
I'm excited about and convey it to

21
00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:10.415
other people, cuz I believe true
mastery is when you can convey mastery.

22
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:15.252
And so for me is that,
my goal is by the end of these workshops,

23
00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:19.158
so we have today Angular
2 getting to know it, and

24
00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:22.985
then we have a reactive
Angular on the third day.

25
00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:27.277
Is that everybody walks out with
a strong foundation for Angular 2,

26
00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.941
that they can go and
build real things, but

27
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:34.755
more importantly that it impacts you and
in your life in your quality of life.

28
00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:38.757
Cuz I believe that when you have
skill sets that you can translate,

29
00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:43.260
that you write better applications
that makes people's lives better, so

30
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.205
kind of a big grand vision here.

31
00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:50.138
So for day one,
my goal is that we have a strong grasp on

32
00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:54.975
how to build a single,
basic feature in Angular 2.

33
00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.087
And so what I mean by that is,

34
00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:01.665
I tend to think of applications
as a composition of features.

35
00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:06.137
And so we're going to learn how to build
a single feature that's going to include

36
00:03:06.137 --> 00:03:10.620
a template, a component, a service and
then eventually we will route to it.

37
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.640
But, a single feature.

38
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.494
Then day two, is we're going to
learn how to put together multiple,

39
00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:17.960
non-trivial features.

40
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.472
So we're gonna learn how to basically
work with a single building block, and

41
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.768
then in day two we'll learn how to put
these building blocks together and

42
00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:26.676
start to build more interesting things.

43
00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:30.080
And then on day three we're going
to learn how to make them reactive.

44
00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:34.655
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So here is the agenda.

45
00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:41.084
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're gonna just
talk about the Angular 2 big picture,

46
00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:44.988
we're just gonna lay it all out,
high level, what is Angular 2,

47
00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:48.075
what's new in Angular 2,
what are the big pieces?

48
00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:52.750
Then Scott's gonna do
a Prerequisite Primer in Tooling.

49
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.630
So one of the things with Angular 2 is,
Not only do you have to learn Angular 2,

50
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.490
but there's some additional skills and

51
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.470
tools that you kinda need
to wrap your mind around.

52
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.600
Then I'm going to talk about
component fundamentals and

53
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.260
what goes into building a component.

54
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.290
Scott gets the best module of the day,
which is templates,

55
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.210
which is one of my favorite things.

56
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.390
I'll be back to talk about services.

57
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.011
And then Scot gets the worst
module of the day as a result,

58
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:26.165
that's karma, and
he gets to talk about routing.

59
00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.845
So, Angular 2 Big Picture.

60
00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:32.300
And you'll notice these icons
in the bottom of the slide, so

61
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.590
this is a satellite, this is kind of
me kind of broadcasting information.

62
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.500
And so the modules are gonna
kinda go in this format.

63
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.875
So Scott or I will talk
a little bit about some theory,

64
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:48.385
then we're going to kind of show some
examples so we'll talk about it.

65
00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:52.480
We'll show it in code either in plunks or
in the sample project, so

66
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.867
you can kind of see what it looks like
in the code so it'll anchor it, and

67
00:04:56.867 --> 00:05:00.255
then we'll give you
an opportunity to do challenges.

68
00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:02.918
So probably 15, 20 minutes of talking,

69
00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:07.345
10 to 15 minutes of walking through
some code, offering commentary.

70
00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:12.799
And then we'll turn you loose for 20, 25
minutes to actually kind of apply what we

71
00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:17.820
have talked about and then we can answer
questions, and kind of go from there.
