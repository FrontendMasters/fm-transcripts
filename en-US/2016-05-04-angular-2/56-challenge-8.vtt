00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.621
&gt;&gt; Scott: For the exercise,
or the challenges,

3
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:11.470
use nglf to give feedback to the user
whether or not a widget is clicked.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.840
However that feedback you want it to be,
it could be anything.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.890
It could be a style, it can be a message,
an alert, whatever you want it to be.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.110
Some feedback that it was clicked.

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.230
And then create a custom directive
to modify the style of the widgets

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.610
when a user interacts with it,
like on mouseover.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.200
Yes, again, you can do this
with CSS on hover, I get it.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.370
But just do something with a directive
on some type of action with the widget.

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.230
Maybe change the color,
maybe animate a color and fade it.

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.920
Something that'll be nice.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.005
And then, add inputs to the directive
to allow it to receive the widgets' id.

14
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:46.809
And that's it.

15
00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:56.668
We're not gonna do anything with the id.
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so, it is 1:53.

16
00:00:56.668 --> 00:01:02.548
We'll come back here at 2:10,
and see where everybody's at.

17
00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:16.527
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's still a little

18
00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:17.695
confusion on that one.

19
00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.908
Would it be it makes sense you could just
throw it in a plunker example form or

20
00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:23.055
something?
&gt;&gt; Scott: What's,

21
00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.535
the animation one that I did?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah I think he's getting

22
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.645
confused about how it's
happening in the four.

23
00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:30.655
Or in, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: He's talking

24
00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:32.115
about this click right here.

25
00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:36.264
Okay, I took my

26
00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:41.678
microphone off.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can just hang it

27
00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:50.203
on the outside of your shirt if you want.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay,

28
00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:53.029
yeah, so let's walk through,
see why that's happening.

29
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.700
So the reason that's happening is
because I'm inside of this for loop.

30
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.950
Which is gonna have a new instance
of item every single time, but

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.330
each instance of item is
sharing the same show model.

32
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.499
So whenever show is true,
all items will show hey.

33
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.530
So to get around that,
there's a couple ways.

34
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.310
We can just not use one model here.

35
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.824
For instance, we can say ngif,

36
00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:28.167
if active item triple

37
00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:33.490
equals the current item.

38
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.196
We can do something like that, so

39
00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:44.078
then when you click, you can set active,

40
00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:49.286
and then you can pass in the item, and

41
00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:56.539
then down here,
you can say activeItem=object.

42
00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:02.482
And then down here,
this .activeitem equals the item

43
00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:12.047
that we're gonna pass in.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So

44
00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:16.858
now, only if the active item is
equal to this item should this show.

45
00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:24.418
So let's check it out.

46
00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:25.638
I think it reloaded.

47
00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:31.767
Let me reload it just to make sure, okay.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

48
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:38.106
there we go.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Wait no, it's not doing it?

49
00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:40.618
I got some errors.

50
00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:44.558
Click, looks like I messed up.

51
00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:52.622
Toggle, setActiveItem.

52
00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:55.218
Let's just, we'll change it here.

53
00:03:55.218 --> 00:04:04.710
Let's try that again.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So there we are.

54
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.340
So now it's only gonna do it
if that's the active item.
