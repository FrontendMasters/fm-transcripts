[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:06.478
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: First thing we had to
do was create a method inside a service

3
00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:08.310
that uses HTTP to get the widgets.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.070
So, let's do that.

5
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.810
Let's go to the widgets-service.

6
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.930
We'll keep this mock data here for now.

7
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.057
But the first couple things we need to do
is import, I'm gonna start doing this.

8
00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:20.957
That's what I'm gonna start doing.

9
00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:24.010
So we're gonna import from HTTP.

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.750
It's going to be the HTTP module,
and that's really all we need, oops.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.170
And then now we just need to inject it,

12
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.729
which means we need to make a constructor
function, so let's do that.

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.790
I'm just going to make it private,
because it's not being used anywhere else.

14
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.450
So we have that.

15
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.320
Then I'm just going to make a method
to fetch the widget stat not there yet.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.690
So let's just do that.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.259
So going to call this one fetch.

18
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.188
Widgets,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

19
00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:08.110
what it's gonna do is it's going to return
an observable that we can subscribe to.

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.665
So actually let's get that URL in here
too, so let's just make it private.

21
00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:23.695
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: URL this key, local host,

22
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:27.168
3000 widgets.

23
00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:32.239
Let's do that, and
we'll go to agentspeed.get,

24
00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:37.423
to that url, and
then we want to map Which means we need

25
00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:42.608
to bring in our operator
from our operator R-X-ES,

26
00:01:42.608 --> 00:01:47.010
which is rx/,
I forget the path every time.

27
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.930
What was it?

28
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Add.

29
00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:53.670
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
add, that's what it was.

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.740
Map.

31
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.500
Thank you.

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.230
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's add operator.

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.795
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Add operator.

34
00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:08.291
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: rxjs/add/operator/map.

35
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.990
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Thank you.

36
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.930
So we got that,
get the URL, and let's map,

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.810
let's get the response,
going with the response.json.

38
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
In this case just as JSON because
that's going to be an array.

39
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.900
We could actually catch the error here
too, but we'll skip that for now, so

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.450
we'll just return that.

41
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.140
So that's step one.

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.910
Any questions on this?

43
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.980
All right, injected the http, made a get
request to the specified resource URL.

44
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.841
And I'm going to map the response to
just get the JSON back from the server,

45
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:48.156
and that's it.

46
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.961
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so step two was to
return that method from the service and

47
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.801
and subscribe to it in the component so

48
00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:00.330
you could display the data
inside the component's template.

49
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.400
So what that means is that we need to
get rid of this static widgets, so

50
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.340
we'll just get rid of that, and
we'll say widgets is just an array.

51
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.317
And then now if we go to
where we were actually using

52
00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:21.276
the widget service, which was
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Where

53
00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:22.790
were we using the widget service.

54
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.200
Widgets TS.

55
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.850
Yeah, okay so this is where
we're using the widget service.

56
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.550
But we will just sort it right here and
we'll keep that.

57
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.270
That will work for now but
right here is where we were binding to

58
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.970
the static widgets from the widget
service, we are not gonna do that.

59
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.910
So now what we're gonna do is,
let's just make another method, and

60
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.720
we'll probably call it the same thing,
fetchwidgets, we'll do that.

61
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.610
So now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna come down here to,

62
00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.765
actually I'm going to make that private so
we can access it.

63
00:03:57.595 --> 00:03:59.995
And we'll make another-
actually make that method now.

64
00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:08.215
Fetch widgets and

65
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:16.310
right now all it's going to do is
this.widgetService, fetchWidgets.

66
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.020
And that'll call it, and
we can verify that so

67
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.030
let's just look at what's happening
when everything loads up.

68
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.110
We can go under the network tab.

69
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.700
Is it getting it?

70
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.870
It looks like it's not getting it.

71
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.650
Let's see what we did here.

72
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.101
Fetch widgets, widget-service,

73
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:59.980
this._http.get(this.url), res.json().

74
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:08.076
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's go back here,
_widgetsService,

75
00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:12.081
this.fetchWidgets, fetchWidgets.

76
00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:18.060
So first, we'll just, I actually expect
this to be called right now, but it's not.

77
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.820
Let's see what's going on.

78
00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:29.771
It's definitely

79
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:34.994
getting in

80
00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:39.059
there.

81
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.080
It doesn't seem to be.

82
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.805
Being called, hm.

83
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah got to subscribe

84
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.741
to it.

85
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.970
[LAUGH] Look at that.

86
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.670
I fell for my own thing.

87
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:18.620
So we need to come back in here and
subscribe right here, boom.

88
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.239
So now that we subscribed we get
the data or in this case the widgets.

89
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.456
Now we'll just say this,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: dot

90
00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:37.374
widgets equals widgets.

91
00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:38.480
And that's it.

92
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.376
Which will be NT ready because there
aren't any widgets in my, database.

93
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:46.480
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got that.

94
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.440
So just to.

95
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.170
Get the thing going,
we can just add some right quick.

96
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.210
A widget has an ID,
a name, and a description.

97
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.870
Right it has a name and a price.

98
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
already in your other file.

99
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I thought I got rid of it.

100
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You it up.

101
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.030
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Did I?
Okay let's check it out.

102
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.019
No I got rid of it, yeah I know, it sucks.

103
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.440
We'll just have a price, right,
is that with the model you guys had?

104
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.080
Okay, a description, a name.

105
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.030
I'll just put all that stuff on there and
a price.

106
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:29.270
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so
at least we should have one.

107
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.841
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

108
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.595
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You probably have to restart

109
00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:43.525
the JSON server.

110
00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:44.655
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I restarted it.

111
00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:46.590
I just did it so
quick you I didn't see it.

112
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's all right.

113
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.720
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] So there it is.

114
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.140
So there is our one widget.
