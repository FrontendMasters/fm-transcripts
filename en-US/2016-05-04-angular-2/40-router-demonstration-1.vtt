[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:07.353
&gt;&gt; Scott: So you guys made a widget
feature that you're going to be, well,

3
00:00:07.353 --> 00:00:11.621
the exercise is going to be taking this
widgets feature and making a new route.

4
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:14.445
But I'm not going to do that because
that's what you're supposed to do.

5
00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.520
[LAUGH] We're just going to do
something else, something much smaller.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.715
Let's make a new one.

7
00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:24.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: So you don't need to copy this,

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.800
this is just to show you the example,

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
and we'll go over a lot of stuff that we
talked about and deeds a little detail and

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.340
then you're going to convert
the Wizard over to that.

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.791
All right, so let's

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.737
just make a new thing and

13
00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:49.429
we'll call it demo and import.

14
00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.880
I need some shortcuts.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.650
I actually set up short cuts and
then they changed their API, and

16
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.120
I didn't feel like changing them again.

17
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's a question
that came up in the chat.

18
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.190
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes?

19
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What if you have a child
route that you want to display in a modal?

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: A child route that
you want to display in a modal?

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.340
That's an event.

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.480
There's a couple ways you can do that.

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.020
You can take advantage of
the parameters inside the URL and

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.350
use the route parameters to detect
when a certain parameter is hit.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.190
And then inside the component
that's mounted,

26
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.100
when that parameter is activated,
the remodal, that's one way.

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.250
But really, it'll be up to you using some
of the life cycle hooks to determine

28
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.330
what's going on in a routing.

29
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.250
And depending on what's going on in
a routing, whatever state is going to

30
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.600
activate your modal, then launch the modal
from that component being route to.

31
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I mean,
routes to modals are really,

32
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.110
that's a really advanced like used case,
even with like UI router,

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.390
there was a lot of discussion around
how to actually do that correctly.

34
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.920
You know, I think they have
a route map too of modal.

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.590
You can actually hook into like the router
life cycle books and spin it up yourself.

36
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.240
But currently,
I haven't seen any solution of like,

37
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.940
map this route directly to a component.

38
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.510
You can map it to a component that's spun
up a modal, and that might, you know,

39
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.190
work as well as having kind
of a intermediate, kind

40
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.110
of proxy component that says when I go
here, just initialize this modal for me.

41
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.960
That's one possibility.

42
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.080
But I haven't seen a clean way
to do that pretty much ever.

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.740
You go through iRouter, there was a lot
of kind of nuances that went with that.

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.240
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yep.

45
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.240
All right, so
I just set up a basic component here.

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.892
Exported it.

47
00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:43.640
Now I'm going to go back into
the top of my component tree,

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.680
where most of my routings,
in this case, all of the routing.

49
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.369
I'm just going to make
a new routing config here.

50
00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.650
Path/demoname.

51
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.980
The name is important.

52
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.634
We should keep these uniquely named.

53
00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:02.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: Component.
And if you don't, I'm guessing,

54
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.050
because this is an array, I'm guessing the
last one would override the previous one.

55
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.000
So if we called this items, I'm guessing
the top items would no longer be items.

56
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.032
This would now be items.

57
00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:19.567
&gt;&gt; Scott: And then demo.

58
00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:28.270
And then we'd need to
Import demo from demo.

59
00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:36.744
&gt;&gt; Scott: Now,
if we go over to our, so many tabs.

60
00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:38.090
There we go.

61
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.200
Go here.

62
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.980
And, then we'll add a link and
the acml here.

63
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.376
So, I'll copy the one that's here.

64
00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:55.330
Call this demo.

65
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.250
And, if we look,

66
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.500
we notice that route to our link is
pointing to some model called links.items.

67
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.065
I'll go into app component,

68
00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:10.198
I'll look at the links, there's items,

69
00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:16.508
I'll add another one called
demo that goes to demo.

70
00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:24.550
Now we have this demo link up here,
click on it and.

71
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.380
Didn't update.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I don't think

72
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.930
you actually changed the link.

73
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.450
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, I didn't?

74
00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:31.148
Yeah, I didn't.

75
00:04:31.148 --> 00:04:33.443
Thank you.

76
00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:36.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, I did this before and
I just thought like,

77
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.398
I've added this information like five
different places and it's all the same

78
00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:42.493
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH]

79
00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:44.302
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There's got to be an easier

80
00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:46.270
way to do that.

81
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.520
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, probably is.

82
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.420
There we go.
So, now we navigate to the demo.

83
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.340
So, that's a basic route.
