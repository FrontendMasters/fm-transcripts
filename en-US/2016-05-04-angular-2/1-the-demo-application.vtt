00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.969
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.940
&gt;&gt; Lukas: A bit of housekeeping.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.920
So, the demo application that we're
gonna start out with is just a simple

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.630
web application with basic features.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.720
We'll be building out a new
widgets feature in this.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.770
And feel free to use the existing
code that's in the sample application

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.310
as a reference point and

8
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.440
again please explore,
don't be afraid to try new things.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.830
Is that if something totally
breaks you just you know,

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.440
undo the local changes and
no, we keep doing it.

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280
But I really want to encourage
everybody to have fun.

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.540
You know try something new, try different
things like, what happens if I try this?

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.870
Well let's find out and
try it in the code.

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.670
And so, this is what this looks like.

15
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.860
It's just a basic web page with
three kinds of a bunch at the top.

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100
Each one of those represents a feature and

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.560
then we're gonna be hooking it in
a widgets feature right next to that.

18
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.170
So, I'll just show you what
this looks like real quick and

19
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.410
then I will tell you how to download it.

20
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.690
So you can see here,
home, about, experiments.

21
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.620
And then in the experiments 1,
we have Azure, a sub-component and

22
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.646
a few extra things happening.

23
00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:17.850
But for starters we'll kind of work
out of just use the home components as

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
a reference, but really a simple web app,
that I found this really helpful for

25
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.240
people to just kind of ramp up.

26
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.260
And so you can download this here,
if you go to this bit.ly link.

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.290
And so because this is a demo application,
that you're going to do your challenges

28
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.240
on, that now everybody gets to
put on their spacesuit, and

29
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.860
kind of go exploring in
this uncharted territory.

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.630
But this was built off of the Angular
class starter which is an excellent,

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.850
excellent project seed that Scott Patrick
Stapleton and myself have worked on.

32
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.923
By that, I mean 98% Patrick,
1 % Scott and myself, I think I've fixed

33
00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:05.997
some spelling errors in the readme but
they have done a really good job of kind

34
00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:11.016
of putting a really full featured
Angular 2, our project seed out there.

35
00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:19.596
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So is everybody able to find and
download this web app?

36
00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:26.813
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Also if you go to
Github.com/onehungrymind everything

37
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.310
is there as well.

38
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.270
For all of the, for
actually all of the days in the workshop.

39
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.540
Now, we will be probably
changing some things.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.900
You know so day 2,
we'll probably tweak some things tonight.

41
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.880
So, if you download it now,
you may need to download it tomorrow.

42
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.980
The reactive stuff we may
make some additional changes.

43
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.670
So, just make sure on the day of the
workshop you down the latest for that, but

44
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.580
that's at gethub.com/100 mind.

45
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.710
So we sent out the survey,

46
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.710
which I think we have like a hundred
people actually submitted that.

47
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.050
Thank you for doing that.

48
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.940
There is, there was a broad spectrum
of skill sets and requests, so

49
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.860
we have individuals from I don't
even really know Angular but

50
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.720
I think it's really going to be this rad
thing to kind of moreso in the middle.

51
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.760
I'm pretty familiar with Angular 1.

52
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.740
I don't know Angular 2.

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.250
I'd love to know more about it and
kinda see what it's about.

54
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.740
And then on the other end you had a few
people that really had very specific

55
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.860
technical questions.

56
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.810
And we're going to do our
best to get to all of them.

57
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.080
With that said, one of the biggest
requests that came in is that

58
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.880
we'd really like to see
working examples of things.

59
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.930
And I know that Ward Bell is doing
a valiant effort in the documentation but

60
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.400
even myself is like how
does this thing even work?

61
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.300
And then you start scouring
the internet for plunks.

62
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.580
So what I have done is if you

63
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.301
go to onehungrymind.com/fem-examples

64
00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:07.570
you can see a ton of Plunks
here that we've generated

65
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.320
to use as one for demonstration purposes.

66
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.420
But even if we do not get to all of
them please feel free to go through and

67
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.058
check these out.

68
00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:26.249
And
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And let me see here.

69
00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.688
We just pick one.

70
00:04:27.688 --> 00:04:35.400
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.936
so myself and another developer have
spent a significant amount of time

72
00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:42.204
actually working through these and

73
00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:46.830
this would just be poetic justice if
the plunker just crashed right now.

74
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.180
The first workshop I did it's like,
we're gonna do it on Plunker and

75
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.550
I'm gonna have no dependencies on anything
else and Plunker went down and so

76
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.400
I basically had to freestyle for
most of the day.

77
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.550
But you can see here we have
a readme that we're pulling in.

78
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.990
We actually had some pretty
good commentary about that.

79
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.950
And you can see the code here, so we're
bringing back the blink tag of sorts and

80
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.560
then from here you can see
this actually rendering.

81
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.850
And it may have already went but
this is the idea.

82
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.760
So you actually have kind of
what it's doing, the code in it,

83
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.290
and the code actually rendering
down here in the bottom, and

84
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.860
you can also jump in and
see the code and play around with it.

85
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.550
So this alone I think is going
to be a really good resource.

86
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.850
We'll be adding day two tomorrow and
day three on Friday.

87
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.207
So, when it's all said and done, who knows
there might be a hundred useful plunks

88
00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:52.946
that you guys can use for kind of
a cookbook reference style resource.

89
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.555
&gt;&gt; Lukas: One of
the repository to download.

90
00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:07.205
Scott threw this together last
night at three in the morning.

91
00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:08.405
I don't believe he sleeps.

92
00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:09.965
In fact, I think he is a vampire.

93
00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:14.435
There were some questions about,

94
00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:19.160
is this workshop going to be
in TypeScript JavaScript.

95
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.288
I think, some of the questions
was actually normal JavaScript,

96
00:06:23.288 --> 00:06:28.480
plain JavaScript, and the answer is
we are going to do this in TypeScript

97
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.770
because I believe you get the most
mileage out of Angular 2 with TypeScript.

98
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.330
But we are going to,
Scott is going to have some commentary

99
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.550
on how you actually do
Angular 2 with es 6 and es 5.

100
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.500
And so he has created this
repository right here for

101
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.800
us to reference in the second module.

102
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.169
Again this is at GitHub.com/onehungrymind.
