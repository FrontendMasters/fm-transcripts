[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:05.670
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So let's walk through
this challenge real quick.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.370
The idea was to create a widgets feature,
display it on the home page.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.620
So from the app directory you could see
that I have about, experiments, home.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.610
These are specific features and then we
have a common directory where we put our

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.530
common things that need to be
shared across the application.

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.910
So we'll just go here,
create a new directory, widgets.

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.322
And then within this, am just going
to create a new type script file.

9
00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:44.126
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Keeping with
the convention of the application,

10
00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.240
we'll go widgets.component.ts.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.306
I'm not going to add this.

12
00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.519
From here, export class

13
00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:58.792
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So create the class.

14
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:06.475
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Component from

15
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.601
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Core, like so.

16
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:23.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Component, we'll go selector.

17
00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:31.419
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Widgets.

18
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.894
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Watch your colon.

19
00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:39.692
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Yes, I was just looking at those
squiggly lines thinking like what is it

20
00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:40.972
trying to tell me here.

21
00:01:59.255 --> 00:01:59.780
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Okay.

22
00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:06.759
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And then from here,
let's go into our home component.

23
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.233
Let's import our widgets
module that we just created.

24
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.199
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

25
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.856
&gt;&gt; Lukas: We'll define
this as a dependency.

26
00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:39.401
&gt;&gt; Lukas: We'll hop
into the template here.

27
00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:53.440
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And let's see if this rendered.

28
00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Hello widgets.

29
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.120
Boom!

30
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.123
Done.

31
00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:04.745
Mission accomplished.

32
00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:12.079
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Scott,
are you ready for templates?

33
00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.961
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] Yes,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You

34
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.364
din't show the extra credit.

35
00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:19.997
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Fine.

36
00:03:22.123 --> 00:03:24.906
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So we will go into-

37
00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:40.060
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So we're just gonna
add a new route definition here.

38
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.558
We'll go widgets.

39
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:51.130
&gt;&gt; Lukas: You can see here it's like,
I don't know what this thing is.

40
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.296
Well there's a good reason for that.

41
00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.559
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Widgets, widgets.

42
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.986
Like so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You gotta change home

43
00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:04.800
component to widgets in
your import statement.

44
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.360
&gt;&gt; Lukas: That's right.

45
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.940
Thank you.

46
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're welcome.

47
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.920
&gt;&gt; Lukas: If I had a t-shirt,
I'd give you one.

48
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.340
Any t-shirt.

49
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.790
And I need to do one more thing.

50
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.830
&gt;&gt; Lukas: We'll go here, duplicate this.

51
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.240
We'll talk about what
routerLink does a little bit.

52
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.670
But for now it's pretty self explanatory.

53
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.900
This is the simplest possible version
of a router component that you can use.

54
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.740
And that is in your route config, so
again we're seeing decorators here.

55
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.632
We're decorating this class to have
like these routes available to it.

56
00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:51.290
And the convention seems to kind of space
these out so they line up like a table.

57
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.060
I don't really have a thought about this.

58
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.340
In fact I'm leaning against it but

59
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.820
this is the way it is now so,
I'm trying it out to see.

60
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.989
But we want to have a path of widgets.

61
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.450
The name is widgets and
it uses the widgets component.

62
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.180
So you can imagine this is why
it's called the component router

63
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.520
because it maps a route
directly to a component.

64
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.982
Now let's see if this actually worked.

65
00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:26.732
&gt;&gt; Lukas: [SOUND] Boom!

66
00:05:26.732 --> 00:05:29.100
Like I'm learning stuff.

67
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.910
Like I know things now.

68
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.340
And there you have it.
