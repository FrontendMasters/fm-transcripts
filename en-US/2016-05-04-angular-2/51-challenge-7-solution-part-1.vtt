[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's jump into
the code and see what this looks like.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.270
So basically what we need to do is
break out this widget component.

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.580
Into a few sub components, and
wire it up using input and output.

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.760
So let's see what we have right now.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.990
This is kind of what we wanna end up with,
and this is what we're working with.

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.770
So, the first thing I'm going to do,
is I'll go ahead and

8
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.780
just get this out of the way,
I'm going to go into the widget service,

9
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.110
and Scott was being a little wild here.

10
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.980
With this crazy map thing that he's doing.

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.290
Which I appreciate very much.

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.285
Well I'm actually going to
convert this back to a static

13
00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:04.776
structure because it doesn't
translate to JSon very well as is.

14
00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:09.423
So we'll go id: 1,

15
00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:15.112
name: 'Widget 01',

16
00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:22.356
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And for some reason,

17
00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:27.998
just feel intuitively that
widgets should cost money.

18
00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:29.203
We'll just go here.

19
00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.783
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It would be really
handy if there was a web store plug in, or

20
00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:42.941
an ID plug in, in general, that you
could actually do a column select, and

21
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:47.298
then for every number in that column,
it would just basically loop through and

22
00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:48.509
increment it by one.

23
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.458
So if anybody's listening.

24
00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sublime does that.

25
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.345
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just stop.

26
00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.933
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Isn't there an online
service that'll create you a whole path

27
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:56.956
of dummy dot ers?

28
00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:58.180
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'll bet there is.

29
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sublime has column select
in the multi run increment numbers.

30
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.914
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
I mean I know you can do column select,

31
00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:07.284
but it'd be interesting to be,
say like I'm at one, or I got it once,

32
00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.180
I'd like to do one, two, three, four.

33
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.780
That's-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Excel does that.

34
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Excel.

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.850
Okay, so I'm gonna switch over to Excel,

36
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.610
we're gonna knock this out,
and we'll all go home.

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.410
Thank you.
All right, so

38
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.360
now I have a widgets collection here.

39
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.900
We'll hop into here and
see if this is rendering on the page.

40
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.240
Yes, it is.

41
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.200
So the first thing we need to do
is create a widget list component,

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.300
and put this in here.

43
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.407
So we'll go here, New File.

44
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.330
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Sure, why not.

45
00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:07.463
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: WidgetsList.

46
00:03:13.287 --> 00:03:15.377
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Actually hold on,
did I do?

47
00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:20.618
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.

48
00:03:24.825 --> 00:03:25.900
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now check this out.

49
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.660
Actually I messed this up.

50
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.890
Let's do this one more time.

51
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.320
So this is the live
template that I sent out.

52
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.119
Go like this, 'widgets-list'.

53
00:03:43.144 --> 00:03:45.395
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now some of
this I'm actually going to delete.

54
00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:54.530
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Because we're going to
do it inline, but at least we're started.

55
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.670
The reason I said ViewEncapsulation for

56
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.320
none is cuz I was actually using
an angular two material library.

57
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.990
Not the angular two material library, and
I was having some issues with my styling.

58
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.750
But, now you know.

59
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.344
Okay, from here, let's go,

60
00:04:14.344 --> 00:04:19.298
and I need to import input.

61
00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.305
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Input.

62
00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.330
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widgets.

63
00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:41.864
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I do this wrong?

64
00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:47.026
I don't have an interface for
this yet, but we'll just click that.

65
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.786
Then from here, we'll just.

66
00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.534
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Dump
this out on the screen.

67
00:05:02.587 --> 00:05:03.160
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

68
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.200
Am I missing anything?

69
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.680
If I'm just pulling widgets in,
I think I'm okay.

70
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.597
Then we'll go back to our widgets here.

71
00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:33.381
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

72
00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:57.789
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You gotta fix line three.

73
00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:58.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Fix line three?

74
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.997
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
it's not a relative power.

75
00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:06.525
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Air five.

76
00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:11.889
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Doing

77
00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.930
a property binding here
because it's an input.

78
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.070
"Widgets".

79
00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:25.795
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay?

80
00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:27.448
Slide back into here, and hopefully.

81
00:06:37.717 --> 00:06:41.665
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is widgets,

82
00:06:41.665 --> 00:06:46.410
widgets, widgets.

83
00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:53.902
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I've overloaded widgets.

84
00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.964
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so this happens
actually frequently where I'll have

85
00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:01.950
a component that is actually
represents a list of something.

86
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.550
And so I'll say, it's widgets.

87
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.560
But then you would see here
selector is widgets, but

88
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.720
then I'm actually trying to actually do it
down here as well, and this is confusing.

89
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.994
So, I believe that's why that's happening.

90
00:07:18.994 --> 00:07:23.419
Just refresh to make sure.

91
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.241
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's double check,
I may be wrong.

92
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:30.873
Widgets.

93
00:07:30.873 --> 00:07:32.143
JSON.

94
00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:51.124
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's there.

95
00:07:51.124 --> 00:07:56.606
It's not getting in here, so
let's see what I have done wrong.

96
00:07:56.606 --> 00:08:00.489
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I don't think you passed
the widget type into your service.

97
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.400
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What's that?

98
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.848
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I don't think you passed
the widget type to your service.

99
00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:12.320
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In.

100
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Does a zero component
need a listed directive so it can use?

101
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.724
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I just added the widgets list in here.

102
00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:22.610
[LAUGH].

103
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.220
You know what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's the exact

104
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.641
same mistake I make.

105
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:28.826
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
word to the wise, if you mess this up,

106
00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:33.850
nothing's going to happen,
and I do this all the time.

107
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You'll want
to call that directives.

108
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.818
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I don't
do that all the time.

109
00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:45.374
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Thing about live
coding in front of people, man,

110
00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:46.296
you gotta be fearless.

111
00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:50.297
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,

112
00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.580
there we go.

113
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.800
So in case anybody was curious,

114
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.200
WidgetsList is a directive,
not a provider.

115
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.120
Okay, so now, the first condition
of the challenge is completed.
