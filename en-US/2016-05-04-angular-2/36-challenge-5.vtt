&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We are going to
have a pre-workshop challenge.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.860
And so this just to kind of,
one, set the stage for

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.540
what we are going to be doing for
the rest of the day, but

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.560
also to just review some of
the challenges that we did yesterday.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.160
So, what I want you to do, pull down
the repo and using the items feature as

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.770
a reference, create the file structure for
a widgets feature.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.110
It doesn't need to do really anything
other than possibly like a hello

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930
widgets onto the stage.

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.080
You can drop it right into
the items component there.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.000
So that's the default route just so
you can see it rendered.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.745
But I would like for
everyone to put their thinking caps on and

13
00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:56.260
as you can see here, so
I have my items feature,

14
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.240
go ahead and create the folder, create
the items component and the items HTML.

15
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.860
And then, just to make sure
that it is a valid component,

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.060
you can dump it or import it into
the items feature and display it.
