00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:03.737
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.157
&gt;&gt; Scott: So let's check out
query params and how that works.

3
00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:14.911
So now let's say we want
to have id on here, right?

4
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.370
We do that a lot.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.080
So now we'll have id here and

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.471
then we'll go into our, at the html here,
and then what we'll do here is, sorry.

7
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.810
Enter our ts, and
we'll just pass in a static id for now.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.208
And we'll just say id is 20.

9
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:36.270
All right, so the second argument to
this array was gonna pass into id,

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
an object with id property, we'll just
do static id for now, which is 20.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.718
And then now,
if I want to get access to this ID

12
00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:52.368
inside this component,
I can go into here and

13
00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:59.940
then I can import from Angular
to size router or routing.

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.010
Not router.

15
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.064
Router, yeah.I can get the routes params.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So

16
00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:14.715
now that I have the route params,
now I can inject it in here and

17
00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.605
I'll just say private.

18
00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.384
&gt;&gt; Scott: Routes let's just say router.

19
00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:26.243
That's just too much work.

20
00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:36.220
We'll just call it params.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Or is

21
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.277
that the other way around with the typing?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No that's right.

22
00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:42.537
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, cool.

23
00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:46.820
So we got that, and now what we can do is,
we can just look at it.

24
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.020
We can say, params.get,

25
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.170
and then the key of
the thing we wanna get.

26
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.756
So the ID.

27
00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:07.367
Let's just alert that.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So,

28
00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:14.565
let's check that out.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now if I click on this thing.

29
00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:21.852
Boom, alert 20,
which is the ID that we put in there.

30
00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:28.670
Again, there's no, if you want
to add multiple parameters here.

31
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.710
You can totally do that.

32
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.450
Just make sure you reference them
with the same key inside your

33
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.900
look up on the route params.

34
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.260
And questions on the parameters?

35
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.810
Nope, okay.

36
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.170
So the other thing, before we get back
to child routing, we got navigating.

37
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.360
So let's check out the navigating.

38
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.368
So if we want to navigate to another
route, let's say, without clicking on that

39
00:02:56.368 --> 00:03:01.055
link, but inside of our JavaScript
somewhere, when this action happens.

40
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:06.602
So what we'll do is we'll come in here and

41
00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:10.723
we'll say go ToDemo(); and

42
00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.695
we need to inject the router.

43
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:20.615
So, constructor() here,
contructor Constructor.

44
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:26.375
&gt;&gt; Scott: And we'll inject the router.

45
00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:33.554
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is that up there?

46
00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:38.412
No, make sure we import it.

47
00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:42.994
So we've got the router, that's good.

48
00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:49.217
And then now we can come down here and
say this._router.navigate.

49
00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:53.985
And we're just going to literally navigate
to the same thing that we did inside

50
00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:59.315
the template which was,
oops, which was this.

51
00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:09.710
So I'm just gonna say this.links.demo.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we got that.

52
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.230
And I was gonna wire this up
in the template somewhere.

53
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.130
Let's just make a trivial
button where I click.

54
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.879
&gt;&gt; Scott: That has a click Listener

55
00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:29.839
that just says go to demo.

56
00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.501
All right, so
on click it's going to fire this function,

57
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:37.914
which is then going to call
the router.navigate to the links.demo,

58
00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:41.458
which is going to mount the demo
component with this id.

59
00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:47.918
All right, so let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Click demo and

60
00:04:47.918 --> 00:04:49.971
it looks like I broke something,

61
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:56.778
let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I left user in there somewhere.

62
00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:05.512
&gt;&gt; Scott: The zone's AS is really good

63
00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:07.639
with this and stuff.

64
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.638
Really good stuff, boom.

65
00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:14.119
That works that way too.

66
00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:17.664
Any questions on this?
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right,

67
00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:20.330
now let's try the child router.

68
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.649
Notice I said try.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

69
00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:24.960
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] Yeah.

70
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.974
So let's just set up a child
routing here on demo.

71
00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:30.980
And what we'll do is we'll do dot,
dot, dot.

72
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.810
We got a question back there?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, any reason why

73
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.290
the params has a get function instead
of just allowing you to use the dot?

74
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.670
To get the ID?
&gt;&gt; Scott: I don't know the exact

75
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.650
implementation details on that.

76
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.770
Maybe it's because the values
might be dynamic and they change.

77
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.800
They're not static.

78
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.180
Instead of having a pass
by reference object.

79
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.120
They wanted to put getters and

80
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.400
setters to make sure that
the value is always up to date.

81
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.498
I'm guessing that's why they would do it.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

82
00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:10.246
then we'll also say use as default here,
or actually, will that work here?

83
00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:12.945
We'll come back to use as default.

84
00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.378
Well I'm just gonna put child there, and

85
00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:18.585
then now if I go to the demo,
change this to backticks.

86
00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:31.532
&gt;&gt; Scott: I can now put a router outlet in

87
00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:39.480
here so
let's just make sure we say demo here.

88
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.870
And then I'm also gonna
put a router outlet here.

89
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.000
So now that I have an router outlet

90
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.030
here I need to set up a router config for
this component.

91
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.130
So now we'll do a router config.

92
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.130
Again, after we import it.

93
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.916
Or route config.

94
00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:10.371
[NOISE]
Oops,

95
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:17.150
all right.

96
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.190
And then I'll just make another one.

97
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.900
Path and we'll call it demo one,
and its name is one.

98
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.530
And its components is, we haven't made
it yet but it's gonna be ChildComponent.

99
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.275
Maybe I'll change it to ChildCom
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's what we'll

100
00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:49.478
do.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool,

101
00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:53.594
so all we need to do is make
that I'll just do it right here.

102
00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:21.594
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right so we got that.

103
00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:24.313
Oops, ChildComponent.

104
00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:29.013
[SOUND] [LAUGH] What was that?

105
00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:31.720
All right, so now that we set that up-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Mom,

106
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.891
I'll call you right back.

107
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:36.304
I'm the middle of something.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Now that we set that up,

108
00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:38.850
when we navigate to demo,
it should also load this ChildComponent.

109
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.630
Let's check it out.

110
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.720
Looks like something is,
yeah, I'm still on this URL.

111
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.080
Let's go over here.

112
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.670
Looks like I broke something,
let's see here.

113
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.010
I just gotta get rid of that.

114
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.729
Let's get rid of this stuff.

115
00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:13.563
&gt;&gt; Scott: Refresh, there we go.

116
00:09:13.563 --> 00:09:15.329
Threw it out there.

117
00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:18.609
It's not resolve to
a terminal instruction.

118
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:25.422
&gt;&gt; Scott: Hm, terminal instruction,

119
00:09:25.422 --> 00:09:28.429
what does that even mean?

120
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:37.865
Demo component.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think we need to.

121
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:42.839
Use as default.

122
00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:47.272
I think what it's saying is
that we couldn't resolve what's

123
00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:50.778
going on in demo so
we don't know what to load up.

124
00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:55.117
Okay that's not the resolution.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just make the first one

125
00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:55.717
false.

126
00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:58.768
The items says default.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah but

127
00:09:58.768 --> 00:10:02.975
I don't think that's going to solve this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You can only use one

128
00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:04.773
as default, right?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

129
00:10:04.773 --> 00:10:08.835
it's still going to say that.

130
00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:13.856
So I think what we need to do is-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: In the second one for

131
00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:22.476
demo, set that to use as default.
&gt;&gt; Scott: We'll try that.

132
00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:26.051
But what I think what we need to do
is the child stuff on the sub child

133
00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:30.287
of the demo.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

134
00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:35.320
that still don't read.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think what

135
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.137
we need to do is come into demo and
put useAsDefault

136
00:10:41.137 --> 00:10:48.195
here.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

137
00:10:48.195 --> 00:10:50.916
I think that is what we want.

138
00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:52.515
Why is this syntax look different?

139
00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:53.553
This is using JavaScript.

140
00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:57.794
I'm like what.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

141
00:10:57.794 --> 00:10:59.333
that looks like what we wanted.

142
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:03.043
So now, if we go to Demo.

143
00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:05.534
It's still trying to do that but
it mounted demo child.

144
00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:18.348
&gt;&gt; Scott: So that's child routing,

145
00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:20.113
[LAUGH] as you can see.

146
00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.890
Any other questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: What did you just do

147
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.760
to fix it?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

148
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.960
so the fix was because it was complaining

149
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.500
because it didn't know how to resolve-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I see.

150
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.680
&gt;&gt; Scott: This, so

151
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.200
I said, by the way, this is the default so
this is the one you should resolve.

152
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.953
The error was kind of cryptic but

153
00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:46.409
I figured out that's what it was asking.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Any

154
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:49.300
other questions on the routing?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So,

155
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.930
when you have a child-route,
you have to have

156
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.390
a default route somewhere?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

157
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.610
I'm pretty sure there's
an option in the docs.

158
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.050
So we can look right quick.

159
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.720
It changes, that you can say,
hey I just want, if there,

160
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.940
if we know what navigates to one of
my childs, don't even worry about it.

161
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.680
Just mount what's here and
don't freak out.

162
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.630
I'm pretty sure there's an option for
