00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:03.737
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.157
&gt;&gt; Scott: So let's check out
query params and how that works.

3
00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:14.911
So now let's say we want
to have id on here, right?

4
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.370
We do that a lot.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.080
So now we'll have id here and

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.471
then we'll go into our, at the html here,
and then what we'll do here is, sorry.

7
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.810
Enter our ts, and
we'll just pass in a static id for now.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.208
And we'll just say id is 20.

9
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:36.270
All right, so the second argument to
this array was gonna pass into id,

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
an object with id property, we'll just
do static id for now, which is 20.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.718
And then now,
if I want to get access to this ID

12
00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:52.368
inside this component,
I can go into here and

13
00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:59.940
then I can import from Angular
to size router or routing.

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.010
Not router.

15
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.685
Router, yeah.I can get the routes params.

16
00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:14.715
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now that I have the route
params, now I can inject it in here and

17
00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.605
I'll just say private.

18
00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.384
&gt;&gt; Scott: Routes let's just say router.

19
00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:26.243
That's just too much work.

20
00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:27.282
We'll just call it params.

21
00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:38.738
&gt;&gt; Scott: Or is that the other
way around with the typing?

22
00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:39.277
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No that's right.

23
00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:42.537
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, cool.

24
00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:46.820
So we got that, and now what we can do is,
we can just look at it.

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.020
We can say, params.get,

26
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.170
and then the key of
the thing we wanna get.

27
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.756
So the ID.

28
00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:59.307
Let's just alert that.

29
00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:08.167
&gt;&gt; Scott: So, let's check that out.

30
00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:14.565
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now if I click on this thing.

31
00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:21.852
Boom, alert 20,
which is the ID that we put in there.

32
00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:28.670
Again, there's no, if you want
to add multiple parameters here.

33
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.710
You can totally do that.

34
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.450
Just make sure you reference them
with the same key inside your

35
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.900
look up on the route params.

36
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.260
And questions on the parameters?

37
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.810
Nope, okay.

38
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.170
So the other thing, before we get back
to child routing, we got navigating.

39
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.360
So let's check out the navigating.

40
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.368
So if we want to navigate to another
route, let's say, without clicking on that

41
00:02:56.368 --> 00:03:01.055
link, but inside of our JavaScript
somewhere, when this action happens.

42
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:06.602
So what we'll do is we'll come in here and

43
00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:10.723
we'll say go ToDemo(); and

44
00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.695
we need to inject the router.

45
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:20.615
So, constructor() here,
contructor Constructor.

46
00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:26.375
&gt;&gt; Scott: And we'll inject the router.

47
00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:33.554
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is that up there?

48
00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:38.412
No, make sure we import it.

49
00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:42.994
So we've got the router, that's good.

50
00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:49.217
And then now we can come down here and
say this._router.navigate.

51
00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:53.985
And we're just going to literally navigate
to the same thing that we did inside

52
00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:59.315
the template which was,
oops, which was this.

53
00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:05.332
So I'm just gonna say this.links.demo.

54
00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:09.710
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we got that.

55
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.230
And I was gonna wire this up
in the template somewhere.

56
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.130
Let's just make a trivial
button where I click.

57
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.879
&gt;&gt; Scott: That has a click Listener

58
00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:29.839
that just says go to demo.

59
00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.501
All right, so
on click it's going to fire this function,

60
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:37.914
which is then going to call
the router.navigate to the links.demo,

61
00:04:37.914 --> 00:04:41.458
which is going to mount the demo
component with this id.

62
00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:42.338
All right, so let's check it out.

63
00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:51.298
&gt;&gt; Scott: Click demo and it looks like
I broke something, let's check it out.

64
00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:56.778
&gt;&gt; Scott: I left user in there somewhere.

65
00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:07.639
&gt;&gt; Scott: The zone's AS is
really good with this and stuff.

66
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.638
Really good stuff, boom.

67
00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:14.119
That works that way too.

68
00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:15.119
Any questions on this?

69
00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:20.330
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right,
now let's try the child router.

70
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.268
Notice I said try.

71
00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:24.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] Yeah.

72
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.974
So let's just set up a child
routing here on demo.

73
00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:30.980
And what we'll do is we'll do dot,
dot, dot.

74
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.730
We got a question back there?

75
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, any reason why the
params has a get function instead of just

76
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.290
allowing you to use the dot?

77
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.080
To get the ID?

78
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.650
&gt;&gt; Scott: I don't know the exact
implementation details on that.

79
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.770
Maybe it's because the values
might be dynamic and they change.

80
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.800
They're not static.

81
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.180
Instead of having a pass
by reference object.

82
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.120
They wanted to put getters and

83
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.400
setters to make sure that
the value is always up to date.

84
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.427
I'm guessing that's why they would do it.

85
00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:07.127
&gt;&gt; Scott: And
then we'll also say use as default here,

86
00:06:07.127 --> 00:06:10.246
or actually, will that work here?

87
00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:12.945
We'll come back to use as default.

88
00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.378
Well I'm just gonna put child there, and

89
00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:18.585
then now if I go to the demo,
change this to backticks.

90
00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:32.676
&gt;&gt; Scott: I can now put
a router outlet in here so

91
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:39.480
let's just make sure we say demo here.

92
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.870
And then I'm also gonna
put a router outlet here.

93
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.000
So now that I have an router outlet

94
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.030
here I need to set up a router config for
this component.

95
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.130
So now we'll do a router config.

96
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.130
Again, after we import it.

97
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.916
Or route config.

98
00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:10.371
[NOISE]
Oops,

99
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:17.150
all right.

100
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.190
And then I'll just make another one.

101
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.900
Path and we'll call it demo one,
and its name is one.

102
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.530
And its components is, we haven't made
it yet but it's gonna be ChildComponent.

103
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.474
Maybe I'll change it to ChildCom
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's what we'll do.

104
00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:53.594
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool, so all we need to do is
make that I'll just do it right here.

105
00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:21.594
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right so we got that.

106
00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:24.313
Oops, ChildComponent.

107
00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:29.013
[SOUND] [LAUGH] What was that?

108
00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:31.720
All right, so now that we set that up-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Mom,

109
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.891
I'll call you right back.

110
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:35.431
I'm the middle of something.

111
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.265
&gt;&gt; Scott: Now that we set that up,
when we navigate to demo,

112
00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:38.850
it should also load this ChildComponent.

113
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.630
Let's check it out.

114
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.720
Looks like something is,
yeah, I'm still on this URL.

115
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.080
Let's go over here.

116
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.670
Looks like I broke something,
let's see here.

117
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.010
I just gotta get rid of that.

118
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.729
Let's get rid of this stuff.

119
00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:13.563
&gt;&gt; Scott: Refresh, there we go.

120
00:09:13.563 --> 00:09:15.329
Threw it out there.

121
00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:18.609
It's not resolve to
a terminal instruction.

122
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:28.429
&gt;&gt; Scott: Hm, terminal instruction,
what does that even mean?

123
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:29.509
Demo component.

124
00:09:35.193 --> 00:09:37.865
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think we need to.

125
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:42.839
Use as default.

126
00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:47.272
I think what it's saying is
that we couldn't resolve what's

127
00:09:47.272 --> 00:09:50.778
going on in demo so
we don't know what to load up.

128
00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:53.499
Okay that's not the resolution.

129
00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:55.717
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just make
the first one false.

130
00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:58.117
The items says default.

131
00:09:58.117 --> 00:10:02.217
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah but
I don't think that's going to solve this.

132
00:10:02.217 --> 00:10:03.837
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You can only
use one as default, right?

133
00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:08.835
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,
it's still going to say that.

134
00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:13.856
So I think what we need to do is-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: In the second one for

135
00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:16.255
demo, set that to use as default.

136
00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:22.476
&gt;&gt; Scott: We'll try that.

137
00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:26.775
But what I think what we need to do is the
child stuff on the sub child of the demo.

138
00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:31.315
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, that still don't read.

139
00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:39.059
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think what we need
to do is come into demo and

140
00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:41.975
put useAsDefault here.

141
00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:50.916
&gt;&gt; Scott: And
I think that is what we want.

142
00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:52.515
Why is this syntax look different?

143
00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:53.553
This is using JavaScript.

144
00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:54.733
I'm like what.

145
00:10:57.454 --> 00:10:59.333
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,
that looks like what we wanted.

146
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:03.043
So now, if we go to Demo.

147
00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:05.534
It's still trying to do that but
it mounted demo child.

148
00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:20.113
&gt;&gt; Scott: So that's child routing,
[LAUGH] as you can see.

149
00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.070
Any other questions?

150
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: What did
you just do to fix it?

151
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.960
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, so
the fix was because it was complaining

152
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.500
because it didn't know how to resolve-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I see.

153
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.700
&gt;&gt; Scott: This, so I said,
by the way, this is the default so

154
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.200
this is the one you should resolve.

155
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.457
The error was kind of cryptic but
I figured out that's what it was asking.

156
00:11:46.137 --> 00:11:48.986
&gt;&gt; Scott: Any other
questions on the routing?

157
00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So,
when you have a child-route,

158
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.920
you have to have a default
route somewhere?

159
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.610
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure
there's an option in the docs.

160
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.050
So we can look right quick.

161
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.720
It changes, that you can say,
hey I just want, if there,

162
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.940
if we know what navigates to one of
my childs, don't even worry about it.

163
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.680
Just mount what's here and
don't freak out.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.630

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.710
It's definitely in there.

167
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.840
I'll figure it out before the solution and
we'll come back to it.
