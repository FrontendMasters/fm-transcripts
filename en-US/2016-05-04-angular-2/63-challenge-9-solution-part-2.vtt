[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:06.602
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's see what
happens if we'll go back in here and

3
00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.394
we're just going to freestyle for

4
00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:15.540
just a moment.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.258
gonna take this off, actually,
you know what, I'll leave it on there,

6
00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:18.020
it's not gonna hurt anything.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.410
And then from here, let's go submit, you

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.460
know what?

9
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.355
Let's just do the same thing here.

10
00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.858
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Refresh the page.

11
00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:49.260
I got a good feeling about this.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.636
Let's go here.

13
00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:57.002
Let's set this for a lot of money.

14
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.820
I need to sell a few of these so
I can buy some blue suede shoes.

15
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.747
And uh-oh, nothing happened.

16
00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:11.231
Let's see what's going on here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ngform,

17
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.286
submit, submit, submit, submit.

18
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.484
See if maybe I got my syntax wrong

19
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:31.531
here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's

20
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:36.406
pull in a local method real quick.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think instead of

21
00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:41.238
submit that there's a NG in front of it,
NG submit on the form.

22
00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:43.663
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like this?

23
00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:44.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

24
00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.830
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That does not seem to

25
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.835
be working, my friends.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just tried

26
00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:06.290
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It did work for you?

27
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.167
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

28
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.752
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Are you on like Beta

29
00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:15.424
10?

30
00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:20.236
Hasn't been released yet.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have a film belt

31
00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:24.238
to buy.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,

32
00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:28.910
I'm channelling Scott Moss here,
I'm not gonna freak out.

33
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.877
Let's see what's going on here real quick.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: The integrity

34
00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:43.961
of the handler Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I wonder if that's

35
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:44.660
overwriting it.

36
00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:56.878
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I'm
gonna do just for a test.

37
00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:13.606
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let me see if

38
00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:24.258
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Have I forgot.

39
00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:26.285
You know what?
That'll bite you every single

40
00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:31.861
time.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: From

41
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:36.648
now on if I forget this and
somebody corrects me

42
00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:41.086
before I crash and burn, you get a dollar.

43
00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.961
All right, so now I really have
a good feeling about this,

44
00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:48.375
I feel like redemption is
right around the corner.

45
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:54.737
[SOUND]

46
00:03:58.933 --> 00:03:59.583
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Where was I?

47
00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:00.864
Yes.

48
00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:05.758
No.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm saving this for

49
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:06.666
later, just kidding.

50
00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:09.696
[LAUGH] All right,

51
00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:15.358
now I'm just getting stubborn.

52
00:04:15.358 --> 00:04:19.496
[NOISE] That was Mark's mom calling
to figure out what's taking me so

53
00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:24.285
long.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The customer

54
00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:29.987
calling saying, what's up with this demo?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: The docs

55
00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:32.180
say you have to import core directives.

56
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.190
Is that the case?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Core directives?

57
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.390
Let's see something here just real quick.

58
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.900
Test.

59
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.870
Let's see if this is working at all.

60
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.907
If not

61
00:04:58.907 --> 00:05:05.960
I will.

62
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.151
When all else fails,
let's just check the docs real quick.

63
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.634
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [SOUND]

64
00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:28.429
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I mean,

65
00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:32.304
is this not what I'm doing?

66
00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:39.094
Just to cover our basis,
Scott, I'm stalling for time,

67
00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:46.134
okay.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now the question is,

68
00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:51.667
is this in CORE DIRECTIVES,
it seems like it would

69
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:57.495
be in form directives.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If I

70
00:05:57.495 --> 00:05:59.587
can make a suggestion for the docs,

71
00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:04.260
the one thing that would be nice if they'd
actually show the imports, cuz now,

72
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.308
I don't know where core directives is.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Wouldn't core directives

73
00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:10.600
automatically import?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, so

74
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.530
then the question is why
is that in the docs then?

75
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: I didn't hear.

76
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.255
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well.

77
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.674
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: I have form directory.

78
00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:31.368
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I just don't know how

79
00:06:31.368 --> 00:06:33.938
to do this any more simpler than this.

80
00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.487
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Your submit button might be

81
00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:56.655
outside of your form, [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You know what?

82
00:06:56.655 --> 00:07:01.100
That actually may be it.

83
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.530
Okay, you are on the verge
of winning a dollar bounty.

84
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.340
If this works,
I'm totally going like Cuban Goodwin, Jr.

85
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.932
when he won the Oscar or whatever when
he's just running around the stage.

86
00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:28.436
Scott, prepare yourself.

87
00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:31.990
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Boom!

88
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:38.151
Okay so, my pain is your pleasure.

89
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.779
I'm gonna save you a lot
of time in the future.

90
00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:46.555
The reason why this was not working is
because I did not have a submit button in

91
00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:47.160
my form.

92
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.180
So it was down here because
I was using material design.

93
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.340
It was down here in kind of the footer and
then I had my form up top.

94
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.690
So, what we have here is
a failure to communicate.

95
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.490
So moral of the story is,
if you're going to use ng submit,

96
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.810
make sure you have a submit
button in your form.

97
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:23.300
Air five, air five, air five, air five.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm so

98
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.155
glad I'm hanging out with 200
of my best friends right now.

99
00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: [LAUGH]

100
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.385
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If I had any feelings

101
00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:39.062
at all, I would be embarrassed.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,

102
00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:42.730
you remote, folks,
I thought you had my back.

103
00:08:55.842 --> 00:09:01.660
All right, so I'm just going

104
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.788
to try this one more time.

105
00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:09.330
Okay, so that's good.

106
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.944
We go back up here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

107
00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:23.489
I'm going to
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm gonna call this

108
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.023
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: saved.

109
00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:38.568
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Omit and we're going

110
00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:44.404
to go with selected widget.

111
00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:49.354
All right,
let's see if we're back from the brink.

112
00:09:56.918 --> 00:09:57.880
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

113
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.900
So you can see it in
the console down here.

114
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.730
We've now surfaced this to the top.

115
00:10:04.334 --> 00:10:05.510
One other thing that I'm working on,

116
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.100
as soon as I get it working,
I will post this as well.

117
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:15.790
I have a half-formed form builder in here,
that there's a disconnect,

118
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.180
it's trying to look for name and
price on selected widget.

119
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.240
It doesn't exist yet.

120
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.808
I think this is constructor
verse entity on init, so

121
00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:27.660
that'll be the next thing that I try,
but with that said,

122
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.120
are there any questions
about forms in Angular?

123
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.670
Remember, submit button goes in
the form or ng submit does not work.
