00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.874
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:05.754
&gt;&gt; Scott: So let's go ahead and
walk through this solution.

3
00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:07.314
Creating route to the widgets feature.

4
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:08.394
Let's do that.

5
00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:09.769
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

6
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.140
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let's go over
to our app folder here.

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm not sure that I like
this syntax better.

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.970
I might just go back to type script here.

9
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.850
There we go.

10
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.780
This isn't that good either.

11
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.300
Sublime can do it.

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.070
Adam needs to figure it out.

13
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.880
So we'll just say widget, a name.

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.410
Widget seems appropriate.

15
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.240
Add a component, the widget component.

16
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's already
name widgets I believe.

17
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.030
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is it?
Okay.

18
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.410
Well that's what it shall be.

19
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.623
Widgets from

20
00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:59.285
/widgets/widgets.

21
00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:09.380
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right.
So we made a route, and

22
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.642
just by doing that, we should be
able to navigate to it, manually.

23
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.770
Right.
So if we come in here,

24
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.130
should be able to come in here and
see widgets.

25
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.190
And we get that.

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.200
All right, so

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.780
just by setting up that configuration
we can mainly navigate to it.

28
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.320
We haven't set up any configuration
in the app yet so let's do that.

29
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.120
So the next thing is use the route link
to navigate to the widgets feature.

30
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.350
Okay, let's do that.

31
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.856
So if we go into our app.html,
can set up another

32
00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:44.375
routerLink here that
will go to links.widgets.

33
00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:54.178
&gt;&gt; Scott: Widgets, and
then down in app.typescript,

34
00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:58.253
well just make another
entry here into our links.

35
00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:08.914
&gt;&gt; Scott: Widgets.

36
00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.240
That's gonna break.

37
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.740
There we go.

38
00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:19.015
So now we have a widgets link up here
in the navbar that we can navigate to.

39
00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:26.155
Any questions on this so far?

40
00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.785
Anybody get stuck on one of these parts?

41
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.500
A little confusion.

42
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.910
The next thing we want to
do is create method in

43
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.110
the items component that imperatively
navigates to that route.

44
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.280
Let's go over to items and
we'll go to the items component here.

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.790
And we know we're going to use the router
so we might as well just import that now.

46
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.525
So I'll just go do that.

47
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.270
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we get the router service.

48
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.085
Go over to the constructor here.

49
00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.480
&gt;&gt; Scott: Inject it into the constructor.

50
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.790
And then, now,
we just need to create some functionality.

51
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.025
So we'll just say, go to widgets.

52
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.952
&gt;&gt; Scott: The start
router.navigate to widgets.

53
00:03:36.952 --> 00:03:41.560
It's now easy to wire this up
to something inside of here.

54
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.810
Let's just, yeah, let's just get rid of
the widgets component, that's at the top.

55
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.080
And now we'll just add
a button that has a click

56
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.580
that says go to widgets.

57
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's spelled
differently down below.

58
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.850
&gt;&gt; Scott: Ok, thank you.

59
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No, that was teamwork.

60
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.380
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes, it was.

61
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.160
Here we go.

62
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No,
it's still spell different.

63
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.794
&gt;&gt; Scott: Still spell different.

64
00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:19.813
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's got
to widgets down below.

65
00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:20.689
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is it?

66
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.909
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, it is.

67
00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:30.282
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go, go to widgets.

68
00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:35.730
All right, so now, if we go to Items and

69
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.360
we click on this ugly button,
it will go to a widgets.

70
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.590
All right?

71
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.780
So now, we got that set up.

72
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.120
Any questions on that part?

73
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.960
All right.
Everybody understand that we need to make

74
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.150
sure we inject this service in
order to call the navigate method.

75
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.900
That's where it comes from.

76
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.640
And we pass it into
the constructor of the component.

77
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.873
And because I initialized
this service as private,

78
00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:08.323
this really just makes it,
by doing that, it's just saying this.

79
00:05:08.323 --> 00:05:12.800
Router equals router.

80
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.180
That what is doing.

81
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.910
I didn't have to set that up.

82
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.930
And if you want to check that out,
"Where is the build?

83
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.830
I was thinking random memory.

84
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.620
Never mind.
Whats it really going to build?

85
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.650
but that is really what I was doing.

86
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.750
So the next thing we need to do
is add both route parameters and

87
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.140
query parameters, which are pretty much
the same thing, to the widgets route.

88
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.940
Okay, let's do that.

89
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.610
So, let's say widgets and then id.

90
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.860
Let's look at the widgets service here.

91
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.855
Widget name.
Let's give these widgets ID's.

92
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.305
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let's do that.

93
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.621
&gt;&gt; Scott: It was right here.

94
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.636
And description.

95
00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.250
&gt;&gt; Scott: So let's build this up so
we can use this.

96
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.290
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool.

97
00:06:43.414 --> 00:06:46.645
&gt;&gt; Scott: So
this is just shorthand syntax.

98
00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:51.720
Because it's only one parameter,
I can skip the return key word.

99
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.840
It's implicitly gonna return.

100
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.775
Because it's multi-line I have to
wrap it in parentheses, right here.

101
00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:01.874
&gt;&gt; Scott: So, if that's kind
of confusing let me do this.

102
00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:10.310
&gt;&gt; Scott: It's just in this.

103
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Post the error
that it complains about.

104
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.390
&gt;&gt; Scott: It's complaining about that.

105
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.790
It's not.

106
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.970
What is it complaining about?

107
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.140
Well now this is an object,
now I have to wrap this.

108
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.920
I need to wrap that in parentheses,
so that's going to stay like that.

109
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.069
There we go.
It was complaining because it didn't

110
00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.131
know if this was an object literal or
a function body bracket.

111
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:38.696
That's why it was complaining.

112
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.040
So I route the around it and

113
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.180
I don't have to put the return key word
because it's implicit, it's implied.

114
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.560
So yeah,
we're just gonna return this for the.

115
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.235
We added the IDs there,
I'm gonna go ahead and

116
00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:04.630
make a function inside of Right here.

117
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.332
Let's expand the gotoWidgets
to take a widget number.

118
00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:14.634
Or id which is string.

119
00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:21.990
So we'll say id id is ID.

120
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.660
so we can use the object shorthand
method and just put id there.

121
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.420
That'll work.

122
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.330
If the property name
matches a local variable

123
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.860
that you're going to assign to
the property name, you can just write.

124
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.810
The name once and it will assign it.

125
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.810
So it's equivalent doing this ID, ID.

126
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.269
I can just say ID.

127
00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:44.808
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we'll do that.

128
00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:52.093
&gt;&gt; Scott: And then inside the widgets
component we need to anybody remember

129
00:08:52.093 --> 00:08:56.655
the service I need to inject in here
to get access to the parameters?

130
00:08:56.655 --> 00:08:59.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, exactly.

131
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.720
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we got route params in here.

132
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.838
We just need to place it in here.

133
00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:25.176
&gt;&gt; Scott: Param, yeah.

134
00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:30.730
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool, so now we got that.

135
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.734
And now what we can do is we can

136
00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:44.550
just grab the active widget.

137
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:53.273
Which would be this dot-widgets-dot-find.

138
00:09:53.273 --> 00:09:58.938
What the widget

139
00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:05.476
whose widget.id

140
00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:12.450
=== params.id

141
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.249
ID.

142
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:25.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Based on integer?

143
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.143
&gt;&gt; Scott: [SOUND] Yeah it probably will,
there,

144
00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:33.288
will fail on the lookups, good catch.

145
00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:39.849
Active Widget equals a string or
an object.

146
00:10:47.608 --> 00:10:49.267
&gt;&gt; Scott: Or yeah.

147
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:02.538
&gt;&gt; Scott: Ooh, that's a lot.

148
00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:04.290
Let's break that off on the next line.

149
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.910
There we go.

150
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.290
So, then we go to active-widget and
then what we can do,

151
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.078
is we can just put the active-widget here.

152
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:27.467
&gt;&gt; Scott: I will say ActiveWidget.name,

153
00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:30.990
description.

154
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.030
So let's check it out.

155
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:43.460
If it all works we should have the active
widget here, so let's check it out.

156
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.050
Something broke.

157
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.750
id was not included in
the parameters passed in.

158
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.890
So where ever, I think I know where,

159
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.860
it's that button that I left somewhere.

160
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.160
This thing or-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

161
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.680
you're not passing in an ID.

162
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.790
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I'm not passing and ID.

163
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.509
We'll just default to
something really quick.

164
00:12:12.388 --> 00:12:14.648
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let's default to one for now.

165
00:12:21.168 --> 00:12:23.677
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay.

166
00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:24.764
Really?

167
00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Cuz you're
already on that page?

168
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.230
Change the URL in your browser to open it.

169
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.260
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, that's true,
we are already on this page.

170
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:40.070
Let's say two.
Let's refresh real quick.

171
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.230
So now we get ID was not included.

172
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.905
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is that
the link at the very top?

173
00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:44.940
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.

174
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.596
I think that's it.

175
00:12:48.596 --> 00:12:54.315
Link.this, yeah its this right here.

176
00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:14.210
&gt;&gt; Scott: Type number is not
assigned by the type string.

177
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.100
Really?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You got anything in your

178
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.160
default assignment?

179
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.790
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right here?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: String that you're passing.

180
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.290
&gt;&gt; Scott: Here.

181
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.870
Good old TypeScript.

182
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.803
That's why we use it.

183
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:31.671
[LAUGH]
And refresh.

184
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.810
And you don't wanna refresh.

185
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.310
Now you refresh.

186
00:13:40.969 --> 00:13:42.380
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, I'll refresh it.

187
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.210
There we go.
Okay.

188
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.490
So now, click on Widgets.

189
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.860
There it is, widget 1.

190
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.860
I am active widget 1.

191
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.340
If we change this to 2,

192
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.020
Widget 2, widget 3, so forth.

193
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.790
Any questions on the parameters?

194
00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.180
Accessing those and
adding dynamic things to the page?

195
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.778
Everybody got that?

196
00:14:11.778 --> 00:14:14.308
Okay.

197
00:14:14.308 --> 00:14:18.990
So now, the child stuff,
let's just do that.

198
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.740
Let's just get it out of the way.

199
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:26.140
I know there's questions.
[LAUGH] I know there's questions, we

200
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.830
already have the demo one set up.

201
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.700
So, I could do it again, but.

202
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.618
Is there any questions on the child stuff?

203
00:14:36.278 --> 00:14:40.260
&gt;&gt; Scott: Everybody go through the example
of getting the child thing set up?

204
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.210
No?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm getting an exception,

205
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.920
primary outlet is already registered.

206
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.900
Is that a common?

207
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.100
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's because you
probably have used default.

208
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.058
Twice on the same component,
route and config.

209
00:14:56.058 --> 00:15:00.568
You can only use use default for
one route per routing config and

210
00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:03.220
that's where the error comes from.

211
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.900
So if you have that you probably ran to
the same thing that I have where I was

212
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.080
trying to set up it's like
a grandchild as a default.

213
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.070
Put use default on that child's router
config and not the top level config.

214
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.540
So on the nested router config,
use default on that path.

215
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:28.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Does that mean that if
you define route configs in all Places.

216
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.280
You only get one use default
across the union of all of those.

217
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You get one use default or
is it just within that per route of the.

218
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.990
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, per route of the.
