00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:07.852
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What I want you to
do is take your widgets feature and

3
00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:12.113
make it a new route,
add a link to the top of the nav bar,

4
00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:15.380
actually it's on the slides right here.

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's why I made them.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.680
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so
create a route for the widgets feature.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.620
Use routeLink to navigate
to the widgets feature.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.530
Create a method in the items component
that imperatively navigates to the route,

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.740
so that means use the router
service that we talked about.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.490
And then, add parameters to the widgets
route, and use the route parameters to

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.370
capture those parameters, and show a
different widget based on that parameter.
