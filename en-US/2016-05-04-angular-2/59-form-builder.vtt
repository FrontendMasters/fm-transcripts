1
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.196
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In this module
we are going to talk about Forms.

2
00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:12.268
Now Forms is interesting
in Angular 2 because,

3
00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:17.350
quite frankly,
they have changed everything.

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.070
So with that said I'll make
a bit of a confession.

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.136
Or rather being that I am a fairly lazy

6
00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:34.229
individual
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That.

7
00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:42.614
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I have found within
a form simply using ngModel to bind

8
00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:47.707
to an object on your component
that you then modify,

9
00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:54.074
make your updates, and
then when you're ready to do something,

10
00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:58.535
then you bind to a click event and
you emit it.

11
00:00:58.535 --> 00:00:59.035
Emit it.

12
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.490
It sounded like I said admit it.

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.760
Admit it, you emit it.

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.870
And so this is a minimum viable form.

15
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.360
And so when we get to the challenge,
if this is approximately what you had,

16
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.850
this would be totally fine.

17
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.588
Now, in Angular 1,
we have ngModel as well, and

18
00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:29.640
it provides to a data binding,
pretty straight forward.

19
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.670
But then when we think about it, there's
are lot of other things to help us along.

20
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.080
So for instance, we had the form
controller in Angular 1 and

21
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.930
that got created behind the scenes
implicitly that every time

22
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.730
you created a form Angular would come,
like swoop back around, and

23
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.020
create this controller on your
form to keep track of that state.

24
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.120
And so that still exists.

25
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.750
You have now what it's
called a form control,

26
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.030
which you can manage an individual control
or an individual input, or form element.

27
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.370
Then you can bring those together and

28
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.680
group them together, and so
you can have a group control.

29
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.770
Let me just go down here.

30
00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:34.200
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so you can have
a form control, a form group control.

31
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.400
And then, where I think it gets
interesting, is then they have bundled

32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.570
that all up into a form builder,
which I think is the most interesting.

33
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.220
So just to reiterate real quick,
if you simply want to get the state, or

34
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.310
rather the value,
of a form you can use ngModel.

35
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.670
If you wanna get the state of it,
then you use a form control.

36
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.090
If you want to group those together,
then you can use a group control.

37
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.440
But then, if you want to have more
programmatic control, so for instance,

38
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.940
applying validations and different
things to this group of controls and

39
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.310
do more of a data model driven approach,
a form-driven or

40
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.288
to forms, then you use Form Builder.

41
00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:23.466
So this is what we're going to
discuss here is form control,

42
00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:26.918
form group control, Form Builder, and

43
00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:31.910
then we'll also talk about how
to submit the form as well.

44
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.684
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let me
just see what I got here.

45
00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:40.918
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,
all right, so let's just.

46
00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.204
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm gonna skip
the slides for the most part, and

47
00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.372
we're gonna jump straight into the code.

48
00:03:55.148 --> 00:04:00.114
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So first and foremost,
again, I was talking about the minimum

49
00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:06.020
viable effort to get the value from
an input and move it somewhere else.

50
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.480
This is ngModel.

51
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.165
And we've been kinda
playing around with this.

52
00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:14.460
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All day long.

53
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.087
Let me just go into the demo here.

54
00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:21.160
And so now you can see that-.

55
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.660
I wanna update this, actually,
let me bind something here real quick.

56
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.060
I'll just go with h.

57
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.517
Then we're just going to bind to-
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: selectedItem.

58
00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.250
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I really should
just turn this into a live template.

59
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.908
All right, let's refresh.

60
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:54.836
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So here,
you can see now we have our object and

61
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:58.222
then as I type it things are happening.

62
00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:05.447
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's look at
the other end of the spectrum and

63
00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:08.160
then we'll kinda work to the middle.

64
00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:16.549
So Form Builder,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We start out

65
00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:22.691
by importing form directives, and so just
like in Angular 1, when you have a form,

66
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:29.165
Angular 1 also has a form directive that
goes through and attaches things to it.

67
00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:31.930
This is where form directives come in.

68
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.240
So when you import this,
then any time you import a directive,

69
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.720
and it goes into the directives array, so

70
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.170
any of our components that we've
developed, that in that template,

71
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.910
if it recognizes any of those selectors,
it's going to attach that component to it.

72
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.761
So in this case with form directives,
now it's looking and

73
00:05:54.761 --> 00:06:00.846
it's saying here's this form, and because
we have form directives on this component,

74
00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:05.544
it's going to basically extend or
augment the standard form just like in

75
00:06:05.544 --> 00:06:08.957
Angular 1 and
provide additional functionality.

76
00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:18.322
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: From here,
we are injecting Form Builder and

77
00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:26.466
all Form Builder does is it
takes a group of controls and

78
00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:31.970
allows you to attach them together.

79
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.149
So in this case,
let's just look at the code in the IDE.

80
00:06:44.927 --> 00:06:49.094
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: One second here.
Let's clear the deck and we-

81
00:06:58.787 --> 00:07:00.726
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So now I've created

82
00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:03.820
this kind of wonky object here.

83
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.931
I was actually just seeing
if I could define the shape

84
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:14.230
of something on the fly, but we have
this person, my first name is Luke,

85
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.902
my last name is Ruebbelke, and
this is my top secret password.

86
00:07:17.902 --> 00:07:24.090
And now what we're doing is,
we are generating

87
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.604
essentially a new instance of, or we're
calling Form Builder and we're saying

88
00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:36.280
group these things together in
such a way that when it renders,

89
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.850
we have this object that
we can do things with.

90
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.392
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You notice here

91
00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:51.883
that I have like ngControl, and ngControl,

92
00:07:51.883 --> 00:07:57.082
ngControl and so
when I add ngControl to an element,

93
00:07:57.082 --> 00:08:02.401
so remember Form Builder is
just a group of controls,

94
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:07.009
that when I add ngControl,
I now have access to

95
00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:11.290
the state of this input
via this name here.

96
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:17.395
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now

97
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:22.994
when this renders we can do things like,

98
00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:26.460
this is no longer valid.

99
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.340
And so, Form Builder is basically
programmatically generating this for

100
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.600
us and allowing us to add
validations to the fields.

101
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.290
Now it is.

102
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.960
And you can notice that
as well the input or

103
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.166
your button is disabled, because
you are no longer in a valid state.

104
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:52.090
So I'm going to put in my password again.

105
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.380
Now it's ten characters long, super.

106
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.645
So we'll go back into
how we're defining this.

107
00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:08.950
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
we're creating a group, and

108
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:14.410
we're saying this is first name,
last name, and in here, so

109
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:21.550
we want to actually bind to this object,
and we want to set a validation to this.

110
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.850
So, in this case we're
saying this is required.

111
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.320
You can also group your validators
together using Validators.compose.

112
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.960
So you can see here that we're
saying not only is it required,

113
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.420
but we want a minimum length of ten.

114
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.115
Just see if I can hop into here.

115
00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.013
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then, so
individual group, ngControl, and

116
00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:57.830
then we're actually grouping these
together using control group.

117
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.510
So this is just a way to
kind of organize those.

118
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.916
So, when I first saw this
I was fairly confused.

119
00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:08.150
I was like well, what is going on,
like what's the point of this.

120
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.620
And there was kind of,
just like in Angular 1,

121
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.230
there's a lot of things kind
of happening under the hood.

122
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.580
The simplest way to think of it,
is that you just have a control for

123
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.470
each input, you can group those
together with a control group and

124
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.480
then you can get the state of that.

125
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.840
So for instance, if you look here,
we have our Form Builder,

126
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.890
the group that's been
returned by Form Builder.

127
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.890
And we're simply saying is this valid?

128
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.440
So this is very similar
to Angular 1 when we

129
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.940
do something like dollar valid or
pristine.

130
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.630
And so a lot of those
properties still come through.

131
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.090
And actually,
let me just see here real quick.

132
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:55.929
I think I can,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I

133
00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:56.824
know we have required.

134
00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:01.941
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just
curious real quick,

135
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:06.700
what is on
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

136
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.018
required minLength,
maxLength, pattern, null and

137
00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:13.780
then compose that we saw that
allowed us to put this together.

138
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.530
So these are kind of the basic
ones that we had with Angular 1.

139
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.200
The upside is, it's a post Angular 1 where
you have to do like ng-min length, and

140
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.060
then set that in there on the template.

141
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.840
You are now actually able to
do this programmatically here.
