[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:11.075
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I'm going to
go ahead and do a new widget service.

3
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:19.064
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we'll go export

4
00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:28.564
class.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

5
00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:31.042
I'm going to go widgets.

6
00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:45.338
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Sure.

7
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:47.643
That's probably good enough.

8
00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:57.564
We'll duplicate this a few times.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm trying

9
00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:03.685
to think of how I can possibly one-up
Scott with the crawling button of doom.

10
00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:06.764
Okay so I defined my class.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Got to take chances.

11
00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.642
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Got to take chances.

12
00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:11.845
Your button actually reminded
me if anybody has seen Mr.

13
00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:16.582
Peabody or Sherman and Mr. Peabody or that
creepy doll like that Leonardo da Vinci,

14
00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:19.202
like you know Like Papa,
Papa, or whatever.

15
00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:22.826
So if you haven't seen that movie
that's what that button was

16
00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:24.855
the programmatic equivalent of.

17
00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:30.616
So from here import injectable from,

18
00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.136
I think this is in

19
00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:39.316
core.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're

20
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:40.429
doing this from memory.

21
00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.450
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Is this it?

22
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.481
I think it is.

23
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.471
Now let's go ahead and
we'll go to our widgets

24
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:57.066
component.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I

25
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:01.770
think in this case I do actually have to,
well let's see.

26
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.714
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Up here?

27
00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:13.972
&gt;&gt; Audience: In providers there.

28
00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:15.167
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay.

29
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.241
So actually, you know what?

30
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:24.400
I am going to do it here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widget

31
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.996
service.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so

32
00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:38.982
there's actually a question which I hadn't
thought about until we brought it up and

33
00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:43.956
then I remembered is talking about
hierarchical injectors is that how

34
00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:49.182
come in for instance the home component
we don't have to put providers and

35
00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:52.074
define that on our component meta data.

36
00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:57.442
And the reason being is because at
the top level here it has been defined,

37
00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:01.138
so its available from
the app component all the way

38
00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:06.232
down.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So just go in here.

39
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:11.437
We're going to go like so.

40
00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:19.693
And then back to our widgets component.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And go to constructor.

41
00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:36.184
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Holy moly!

42
00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:39.892
Did you guys see that?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did that just

43
00:03:39.892 --> 00:03:45.965
happen?
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's code

44
00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:46.485
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Whoa,

45
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:49.442
I've been living below my privileges.

46
00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:54.093
Like we would have cut 20 minutes
of this workshop had I known that.

47
00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:55.202
&gt;&gt; Audience: That's WebStorm right?

48
00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.207
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.

49
00:03:57.207 --> 00:04:02.191
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I guess this just

50
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:03.736
turned into a WebStorm commercial.

51
00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:05.347
That was,
man I just don't wanna do that again.

52
00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:08.624
That was, I'm gonna do that one more
time because I can't believe that just

53
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.453
happened.
&gt;&gt; Audience: You have public or

54
00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:13.064
private on there?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I'm just going with

55
00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:15.093
default to public for now.
&gt;&gt; Audience: Default.

56
00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:15.938
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, so if you don't

57
00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:22.512
put anything it just defaults to public.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That's so

58
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.920
rad.
&gt;&gt; Audience: You know you can do fuzzy

59
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.866
typing too.

60
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:31.492
You could type like W I D S E R,

61
00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:34.785
yeah like that.

62
00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:37.233
Yeah.
That's it

63
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.318
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So if anything,

64
00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:43.589
I think that's a pretty good case for
typescript, and writing code that conveys

65
00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:48.627
intent, because now you get things
like automatic imports, which honestly

66
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:53.766
I had forgot about that because I haven't
done Flex in like six or seven years.

67
00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:58.258
But that used to be pretty common of like,
I need this thing tab and it would just

68
00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:01.083
bring that import in for you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Can we get Adam to do that

69
00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:01.937
as well?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah,

70
00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:05.862
I would imagine it probably would.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Adam's pretty good.

71
00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:06.950
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, so we should.

72
00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:10.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just doesn't have

73
00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:12.668
those powers with the templates.

74
00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:13.713
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

75
00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:25.989
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Why
doesn't it like this?

76
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.963
That's why.

77
00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:34.525
So I'm just going to set
this array type any.

78
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:39.499
Just initialize this to

79
00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.725
an empty array, and

80
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:50.696
then from here let's go like so.

81
00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.275
And,

82
00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:03.009
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll follow up with

83
00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.507
Scott's stellar template binding example.

84
00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:11.176
And we'll go with I don't know.

85
00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:16.726
Div ngFor

86
00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:22.275
widget of

87
00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:27.134
widgets

88
00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:40.723
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hopefully this works.

89
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.507
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yea.

90
00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:51.223
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, let's do something

91
00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:52.158
else real quick.

92
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We can,
but I don't know man.

93
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.003
I don't wanna spoil the pipe's module.
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay.

94
00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:27.624
&gt;&gt; Audience: What would you call this

95
00:07:27.624 --> 00:07:30.368
module?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's currency and

96
00:07:30.368 --> 00:07:33.374
then you can set some options on that.

97
00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:37.427
To my dear good friends slipping out
the back, I will see you tomorrow.

98
00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:38.467
&gt;&gt; Audience: I set my schedule around

99
00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:41.352
an end time of 4:30.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Wow, I apologize, but

100
00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:43.635
I'll see you tomorrow?
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yes sir.

101
00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.553
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

102
00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:51.134
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I don't know how we

103
00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:53.794
got Chris Stapleton to
come to my workshop but

104
00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:56.456
I'm just actually star-struck right now.

105
00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:08.745
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So widget one at $100.

106
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:17.249
Now let's just.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: See here.

107
00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:26.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hm.

108
00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:32.965
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is where I get

109
00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:40.691
into a bit of shaky ground as I start to,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Scott,

110
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:44.257
if I start to embarrass myself,
so help me, I'm blaming you for-

111
00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.942
&gt;&gt; Scott: [INAUDIBLE]

112
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.756
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH].

113
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:35.866
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think I'm doing

114
00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.484
this wrong.
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

115
00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.809
I would never do math on live coding.

116
00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:40.705
What.

117
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:45.070
[LAUGH] That's one thing
you don't want to do, math.

118
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:53.077
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: No,

119
00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:56.355
I am doing this wrong.

120
00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:57.380
I'm going to do something else.

121
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.982
[LAUGH] Half price.
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]

122
00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:03.908
Thatâ€™s it.

123
00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:05.380
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH]

124
00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:12.142
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Price x 0.5.

125
00:10:12.142 --> 00:10:13.401
All right.

126
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:14.183
Am I doing okay?

127
00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:15.783
You think this makes sense?

128
00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:16.556
Anybody in chat?

129
00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:21.362
I know we got some.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There's some fairly

130
00:10:21.362 --> 00:10:24.970
sharp individuals in there.
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's okay, man.

131
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.274
It's math.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's just math.

132
00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:34.911
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I wonder.

133
00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:44.042
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes!

134
00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:48.137
That is so rad.

135
00:10:48.137 --> 00:10:51.649
I just,
how do you say five hours in a week?

136
00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:54.572
Auto imports.

137
00:10:54.572 --> 00:11:02.188
Okay, so here, I'm just gonna add this.

138
00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:13.800
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Really pushing my

139
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.481
luck here.

140
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:20.428
[LAUGH]
That's awesome.

141
00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:03.504
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I could probably do

142
00:12:03.504 --> 00:12:04.737
math here, right?

143
00:12:23.438 --> 00:12:24.146
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think I've just

144
00:12:24.146 --> 00:12:29.711
messed this up, hang on.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's not do static.

145
00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:41.021
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Does this look right

146
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.082
Scott?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, it's gonna return numbers,

147
00:12:43.082 --> 00:12:44.550
an array of numbers.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so,

148
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.420
it's just gonna loop through and just.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Return in the radio.

149
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.481
Half price numbers.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is not gonna

150
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:56.434
work, hang on.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I need to

151
00:12:56.434 --> 00:13:01.064
do.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I need to do a, but

152
00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:05.670
we obviously do this different if I
was thinking about immutability but.

153
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.471
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

154
00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:25.267
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I said this once,

155
00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:28.434
I'll say it again.

156
00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:33.700
I mean, that's pretty rad so
I have now injected

157
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.581
my pricing service into
my widget service and

158
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:44.754
I am applying my half off pricing scheme,
for everyone.

159
00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:47.710
So anybody who wanted to buy a widget,
you're welcome.
