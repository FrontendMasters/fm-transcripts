[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:11.075
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I'm going to
go ahead and do a new widget service.

3
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:20.035
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we'll go export class.

4
00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.042
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
I'm going to go widgets.

5
00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:45.338
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Sure.

6
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:47.643
That's probably good enough.

7
00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:49.647
We'll duplicate this a few times.

8
00:00:56.624 --> 00:01:01.326
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm trying to think
of how I can possibly one-up Scott with

9
00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:03.685
the crawling button of doom.

10
00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.677
Okay so I defined my class.

11
00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:06.764
&gt;&gt; Scott: Got to take chances.

12
00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:08.642
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Got to take chances.

13
00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:11.845
Your button actually reminded
me if anybody has seen Mr.

14
00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:16.582
Peabody or Sherman and Mr. Peabody or that
creepy doll like that Leonardo da Vinci,

15
00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:19.202
like you know Like Papa,
Papa, or whatever.

16
00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:22.826
So if you haven't seen that movie
that's what that button was

17
00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:24.855
the programmatic equivalent of.

18
00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:30.616
So from here import injectable from,

19
00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:34.221
I think this is in core.

20
00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.429
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're
doing this from memory.

21
00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.474
Let's see.

22
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:47.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Is this it?

23
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.481
I think it is.

24
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:53.321
Now let's go ahead and
we'll go to our widgets component.

25
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.770
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think in this case
I do actually have to, well let's see.

26
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.714
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Up here?

27
00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:13.972
&gt;&gt; Audience: In providers there.

28
00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:15.167
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay.

29
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:19.241
So actually, you know what?

30
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:20.180
I am going to do it here.

31
00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:25.130
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widget service.

32
00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:36.791
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so there's
actually a question which I hadn't thought

33
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:41.427
about until we brought it up and
then I remembered is talking about

34
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:46.738
hierarchical injectors is that how come
in for instance the home component

35
00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:52.074
we don't have to put providers and
define that on our component meta data.

36
00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:57.442
And the reason being is because at
the top level here it has been defined,

37
00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:01.677
so its available from the app
component all the way down.

38
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.232
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So just go in here.

39
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:11.437
We're going to go like so.

40
00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:16.141
And then back to our widgets component.

41
00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:19.693
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And go to constructor.

42
00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:36.184
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Holy moly!

43
00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:37.207
Did you guys see that?

44
00:03:39.213 --> 00:03:40.387
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did that just happen?

45
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.485
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's code
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Whoa,

46
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:49.442
I've been living below my privileges.

47
00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:54.093
Like we would have cut 20 minutes
of this workshop had I known that.

48
00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:55.202
&gt;&gt; Audience: That's WebStorm right?

49
00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.207
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.

50
00:03:57.207 --> 00:04:02.191
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I guess this just

51
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:03.736
turned into a WebStorm commercial.

52
00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:05.347
That was,
man I just don't wanna do that again.

53
00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:08.419
That was, I'm gonna do that one more
time because I can't believe that

54
00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.144
just happened.

55
00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:11.853
&gt;&gt; Audience: You have public or
private on there?

56
00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:14.534
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I'm just going
with default to public for now.

57
00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:15.093
&gt;&gt; Audience: Default.

58
00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:17.504
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, so if you don't
put anything it just defaults to public.

59
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.200
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That's so rad.

60
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.866
&gt;&gt; Audience: You know you
can do fuzzy typing too.

61
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:31.492
You could type like W I D S E R,

62
00:04:31.492 --> 00:04:34.785
yeah like that.

63
00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:37.233
Yeah.
That's it

64
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.318
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So if anything,

65
00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:43.589
I think that's a pretty good case for
typescript, and writing code that conveys

66
00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:48.627
intent, because now you get things
like automatic imports, which honestly

67
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:53.766
I had forgot about that because I haven't
done Flex in like six or seven years.

68
00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.509
But that used to be pretty common of like,
I need this thing tab and

69
00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.974
it would just bring that import in for
you.

70
00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.532
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Can we get
Adam to do that as well?

71
00:05:01.532 --> 00:05:03.963
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah,
I would imagine it probably would.

72
00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:05.862
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Adam's pretty good.

73
00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:06.950
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, so we should.

74
00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:12.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just doesn't have
those powers with the templates.

75
00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:13.713
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

76
00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:25.989
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Why
doesn't it like this?

77
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.963
That's why.

78
00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:34.525
So I'm just going to set
this array type any.

79
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:39.499
Just initialize this to

80
00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.725
an empty array, and

81
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:50.696
then from here let's go like so.

82
00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.275
And,

83
00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:03.009
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll follow up with

84
00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.507
Scott's stellar template binding example.

85
00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:11.176
And we'll go with I don't know.

86
00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:16.726
Div ngFor

87
00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:22.275
widget of

88
00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:27.134
widgets

89
00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:40.723
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hopefully this works.

90
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.507
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yea.

91
00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:52.158
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
let's do something else real quick.

92
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We can,
but I don't know man.

93
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.745
I don't wanna spoil the pipe's module.

94
00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:22.003
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay.

95
00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:28.680
&gt;&gt; Audience: What would
you call this module?

96
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.374
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's currency and
then you can set some options on that.

97
00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:37.427
To my dear good friends slipping out
the back, I will see you tomorrow.

98
00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:39.858
&gt;&gt; Audience: I set my schedule
around an end time of 4:30.

99
00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:42.931
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Wow, I apologize,
but I'll see you tomorrow?

100
00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:43.635
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yes sir.

101
00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:44.553
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

102
00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:53.584
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I don't know how we
got Chris Stapleton to come to my workshop

103
00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:56.456
but I'm just actually
star-struck right now.

104
00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:08.745
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So widget one at $100.

105
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:10.409
Now let's just.

106
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.249
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: See here.

107
00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:26.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hm.

108
00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:35.633
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is where I get
into a bit of shaky ground as I start

109
00:08:35.633 --> 00:08:40.691
to,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Scott,

110
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:44.257
if I start to embarrass myself,
so help me, I'm blaming you for-

111
00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.942
&gt;&gt; Scott: [INAUDIBLE]

112
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.756
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH].

113
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.843
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think
I'm doing this wrong.

114
00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:37.484
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

115
00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.809
I would never do math on live coding.

116
00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:40.705
What.

117
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:45.070
[LAUGH] That's one thing
you don't want to do, math.

118
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:56.355
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: No,
I am doing this wrong.

119
00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:57.380
I'm going to do something else.

120
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.364
[LAUGH] Half price.

121
00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:03.908
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
Thatâ€™s it.

122
00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:12.142
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Price x 0.5.

123
00:10:12.142 --> 00:10:13.401
All right.

124
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:14.183
Am I doing okay?

125
00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:15.783
You think this makes sense?

126
00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:16.556
Anybody in chat?

127
00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:17.695
I know we got some.

128
00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:23.497
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There's some
fairly sharp individuals in there.

129
00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:24.970
&gt;&gt; Audience: It's okay, man.

130
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.972
It's math.

131
00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:27.274
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's just math.

132
00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:34.911
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I wonder.

133
00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:44.042
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes!

134
00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:48.137
That is so rad.

135
00:10:48.137 --> 00:10:51.649
I just,
how do you say five hours in a week?

136
00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:54.572
Auto imports.

137
00:10:54.572 --> 00:11:02.188
Okay, so here, I'm just gonna add this.

138
00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:16.481
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Really
pushing my luck here.

139
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:20.428
[LAUGH]
That's awesome.

140
00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:04.737
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I could
probably do math here, right?

141
00:12:23.438 --> 00:12:25.188
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think I've
just messed this up, hang on.

142
00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:29.711
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's not do static.

143
00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:41.508
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Does
this look right Scott?

144
00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:44.004
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, it's gonna return numbers,
an array of numbers.

145
00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:47.204
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so,
it's just gonna loop through and just.

146
00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.420
&gt;&gt; Scott: Return in the radio.

147
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.669
Half price numbers.

148
00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.294
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This
is not gonna work, hang on.

149
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.924
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I need to do.

150
00:12:59.954 --> 00:13:01.064
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I need to do a, but

151
00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:05.670
we obviously do this different if I
was thinking about immutability but.

152
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.471
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

153
00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:28.434
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I said this once,
I'll say it again.

154
00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:33.700
I mean, that's pretty rad so
I have now injected

155
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.581
my pricing service into
my widget service and

156
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:44.754
I am applying my half off pricing scheme,
for everyone.

157
00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:47.710
So anybody who wanted to buy a widget,
you're welcome.
