00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Use NGF to get
feedback on the user whether or

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.390
not the widget is selected.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.500
So let's do that.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.197
Let's go back to those widgets and

5
00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:18.911
I believe it's going to be in

6
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:24.230
the Widgets list, component.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.090
So we want to give some type of feedback
when these things are selected.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.800
So what we can do is we'll just
add an NGF here, we can say,

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.630
let's just do something very trivial,
let's just add,

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.750
well I guess that's what
the master detail does.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.000
We could say, what did everybody else do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Highlighted the background.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270
Invoke center,
highlight the background also.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.770
Highlight directive.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Well, I'm saying for

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500
the NGF?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.940
if you don't have anything selected,
don't show the right side.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.680
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Out of span.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, let's do that.

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.040
That sound cool.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So,

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.700
if nothing's selected in the master detail
view, then you didn't show anything.

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.860
Like here, or, where is it at?

21
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.338
Right here.
There we go.

22
00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:18.320
So, if nothing's selected here, then

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.170
you didn't show anything on the right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, cuz the background's

24
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.490
grey and the card was.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Let's state in a list.

25
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.630
Let's do something in here.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.580
So what we can do is,
when you select a wizard, we could,

27
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.701
actually let's come back,
I'm not drawing a blank.

28
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:42.989
Let's do the other one first

29
00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:47.970
too trivial.

30
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.110
Let's create a custom directive that
modifies this style, this one's more fun.

31
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.140
So let's make another directive that like,
we can do here, have some fun with this.

32
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.530
Let's just highlight the car a different
color, change the text, different stuff

33
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.990
like that when you click on the directive
so we know it's actually active.

34
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.890
Right now, it's kinda playing,
we don't know which one is clicked.

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.970
So let's do that.

36
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.790
We'll do it on mouse over and
also when it's active.

37
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.950
So let's start with the mouse over one.

38
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.340
Let's just add a new file here.

39
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.384
And we'll call

40
00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:26.040
it On, I'm so

41
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.472
bad with names,

42
00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:36.516
highlight it,

43
00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:40.790
Highlight.

44
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.388
So we call it highlight and
we'll do this thing again.

45
00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:01.183
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

46
00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.362
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Our selector will be highlight.

47
00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:21.118
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And then what we'll do is we'll

48
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:26.850
export the class.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Highlight.

49
00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:31.974
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

50
00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:37.110
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And we also need Element Ref.

51
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.690
And we'll inject that
into our constructor.

52
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.199
So we have that and then we only want

53
00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.664
this to happen on mouse enter so

54
00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:07.546
we have our host here [SOUND] and
we'll just say,

55
00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:17.850
&gt;&gt; Lukas: 'initHightlight()'.

56
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.900
We're gonna make that method, cool.

57
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.736
And all this is gonna do,

58
00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:36.557
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Change the background color.

59
00:04:36.557 --> 00:04:42.427
Color to,
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Green.

60
00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.783
All right, seagreen.

61
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.794
I didn't make that up, that's a CSS color.

62
00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:53.726
[LAUGH]
Okay, now why is this freaking out?

63
00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.870
Native event, nativeElement.style.

64
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.390
There we go.

65
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.702
The text will probably look bad,
so we'll change the text

66
00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:04.426
too.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Let's just do this.

67
00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:27.716
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There you go.

68
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.720
So we go that now we need to wire it
up to our components so we can use it.

69
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.308
So what we have to do is go into the,
what's happened to the- Wizards list?

70
00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:46.210
Yeah the wizard's list,
that's what we were doing.

71
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.020
So add to the widget list but we only
want it on the individual widget so

72
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.202
we place one here on the component,
we will say directives and

73
00:05:58.202 --> 00:06:06.111
it is called highlighter or highlight,
&gt;&gt; Lukas: and imports

74
00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:17.780
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Highlight from /highlight.

75
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.452
And it's not liking me.

76
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sometimes I've noticed with

77
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.740
adding you have to save first.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Yeah, you're right, cool.

78
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.640
So we got that, and now we have
the widget for the widgets, and

79
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.480
what we'll do is just place that here,
so now we can just say Highlight.

80
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:56.810
Now let's see what happens.

81
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.020
Cool, so a highlight kinda works,
but still green, so

82
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.210
we need to go back and fix that.

83
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.825
So what we'll do is we'll come back and

84
00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.736
we'll just do the inverse.

85
00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:22.976
&gt;&gt; Lukas: I'll call this
something else now.

86
00:07:42.855 --> 00:07:43.614
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

87
00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:49.180
&gt;&gt; Lukas: If highlight then we'll do this.

88
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.860
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Else.

89
00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:03.021
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So lash worker is not

90
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:03.586
working here.

91
00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:09.002
Let's do that.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Else we'll do this.

92
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.565
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Let's check it out.

93
00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:25.295
There we go, it's highlighting.

94
00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:28.059
Still that is not good enough.

95
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.640
I would probably do something like this.

96
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.930
Add some styles let it
ease in a little bit.

97
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.500
It's like it hurts my eyes
when it's transitioning.

98
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.490
What is this?

99
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.197
This is a widget-card.

100
00:08:57.428 --> 00:08:58.214
&gt;&gt; Lukas: A little transition never hurt

101
00:08:58.214 --> 00:09:07.930
anybody.
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

102
00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:17.029
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Cool, much better.

103
00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:19.909
All right, so
now we have a nice little highlight.

104
00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:26.429
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Any questions on that?

105
00:09:27.929 --> 00:09:28.553
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Actually I did just

106
00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:29.220
noticed one thing.

107
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.110
It doesn't look like the text is changing,

108
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.280
that's because it's not
propagating down and that's fine.

109
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.250
Let's change in the style, well the text
isn't changing because of the hierarchy of

110
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.820
the HTML where it's Texas here and there
is this, the color is being set here so.

111
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.300
But that's fine.

112
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.036
Any questions on that?

113
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.130
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Why didn't that break?
