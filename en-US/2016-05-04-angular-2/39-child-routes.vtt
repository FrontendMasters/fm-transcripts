[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:09.590
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Child routes,
they're unique for Angular Two.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.260
But they are ideal, we need child routes.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.170
That was the whole cavit about
the Angular One routers was like,

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810
what's the story behind this?

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.830
How do we do this?

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.230
And we couldn't so UI router came out.

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.080
So this is our implementation,
it's different, but it works.

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.834
So, components of child routes
are ignorant of the parents' route

10
00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:28.620
implementation.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.910
So children don't know that
they belong to some parent.

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.870
They don't know what their parents'
configuration is, they just don't know.

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380
They use routes and paths, and that's it.

14
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.352
But the parent, and its config.

15
00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:45.137
And it's path property,
the path property here.

16
00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:49.601
The path property at
the end of it you just need

17
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.490
to put a forward slash dot, dot, dot.

18
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.125
That's it.

19
00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:58.080
[COUGH] Excuse me.

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.720
So you put a forward slash dot dot dot
on the path of the parent property

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.120
whose child route, or whose route
will have a child inside of it.

22
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.720
I know.
You're looking at me like, what.

23
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.700
Trust me.

24
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.950
We'll go through it.

25
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.420
But that's how you set up a child
route instance, you have to do that.

26
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.522
And then this is gonna allow you
to place another router outlet

27
00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.023
inside the child component.

28
00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:31.225
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So right here at the top,
we set up another component here for

29
00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:34.760
the path, and you can see we put
forward slash dot, dot, dot.

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.250
This means, hey inside of this,
another-component template,

31
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.570
there's going to be another
router outlet and it, too,

32
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.610
will have it's own route config
which is right below it.

33
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.200
There's another route config and then, so

34
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.490
where it says /first, that's going
to be mounted on another-component.

35
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.820
So, it's going to be
another-component/first.

36
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.722
That's where that's gonna be mounted.

37
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.734
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.430
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
so let's get into it.

39
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.450
I've got some plunks.

40
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.750
I want to do a little
bit of live coding and

41
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.920
then we're gonna jump into our exercise,
cool?

42
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.460
All right, so
one of the plunks that I wanted to show

43
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.730
was one that I thought was kind
of gnarly was a child router.

44
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.456
So we'll just look at that for a little
bit and then we'll do some live coding.

45
00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.046
So any questions on the child router?

46
00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.774
I seen some confused faces.

47
00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:43.455
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just one, if you had,
if you wanted a bare route,

48
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:49.050
like just the parent route
ending with the last component?

49
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.270
But without a child component part,
how would you do that?

50
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.800
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Well, if you just want,
I'm guessing what you're saying is

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.440
you have a bare route, and then you
have another extension on the route.

52
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.621
First you have slash users and
slash users ID.

53
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.400
Is that what you're saying?

54
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.086
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, well kind of.

55
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.720
CEC had users, and
then a child component is our profile.

56
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.660
For whatever reason.

57
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.050
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
I see what you're saying.

58
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.980
That depends on where you
want profile to load up.

59
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.940
Does profile load up in users or
does profile render on its own page?

60
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.830
There's a difference.

61
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.450
If profile loads in the users template,
then you need child routing.

62
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.554
If profile is its own page then you don't,
you just navigate to it normally and

63
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:27.174
you're fine.

64
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.620
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll go over that example,
yeah.

65
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.350
So it really all depends on where do
you want that component to render.

66
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In other words,
is it parallel or is it nested?

67
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well what if it's nested but
you also want just to

68
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.690
be able to look at the user record?

69
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.690
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I see what you're saying.

70
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.960
So you can set a,
you don't have to go to the child route.

71
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.390
You can set the parent
route as the default.

72
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.170
So therefore if you don't want to go to
the profile but just look at the user,

73
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.450
you can go there and
the profile won't render.

74
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.910
Yeah, you just have to put use default on
the parent, the one that has dot dot dot.

75
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

76
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.170
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You can put
use default on that, yeah.

77
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.270
Good question.

78
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.220
So, this thing doesn't render by default?

79
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.490
Okay.

80
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.180
So let's take a closer look at this stuff.

81
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.910
So the child routes.

82
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.412
Let's just look at the code.

83
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:30.705
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Where's it at?

84
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:31.228
That's not it.

85
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:36.770
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There it is.

86
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.320
So, in the parent router,
is that big enough?

87
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.080
Do I need to make this bigger?

88
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.970
Let's make it bigger.

89
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.710
So in the PAN router, again, when you
setup the route config, it's pathed, so

90
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.260
normally you would just make
a path like this, right.

91
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.300
And then you'd be done,
like here's my path.

92
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.122
But because we're gonna have a child,

93
00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:04.342
we're gonna have another component
render or another component render

94
00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:09.400
in this router outlet we need to say hey
we're gonna set up a child router here.

95
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.860
So we just do dot, dot, dot, and
then now we add our router outlet.

96
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.070
And then for the child component
if we go into the child component.

97
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.570
Where is it at?

98
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.110
This one right here.

99
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.415
You see it has a router outlet and the
only reason it can do this is because we

100
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.338
put the dot dot dot in its
parents configuration.

101
00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.028
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
now it also has a router outlet and

102
00:05:36.028 --> 00:05:37.820
it also has its own route config.

103
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.454
And it too could have its own children.

104
00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.810
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll go over this
a little more, it's, I know.

105
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.710
It's different than most
routing frameworks.

106
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So pop that on to full
screen and then see what that looks like.

107
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.700
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, where is
the full screen button, this thing?

108
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.229
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, yeah.

109
00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.771
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
so, I spilled it.

110
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:18.325
Let's refresh.

111
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.525
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
I guess it just didn't want to do it.

112
00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:37.658
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's try that again.

113
00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:43.390
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, here we go.

114
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.280
So right here, let's check it out.

115
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.910
If we go look at our component,
right here,

116
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.130
inside another component,
it just says, introducing.

117
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.930
So we scroll down on what's rendering,
that's all we see.

118
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.250
Introducing, it's child
hasn't been mounted yet.

119
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.000
There's no route,
nothing has been placed here.

120
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.310
We haven't navigated anywhere, right?

121
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.810
That's it.

122
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.380
It's just empty.

123
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.410
Then if we go look, and
you see this button right here.

124
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.730
It says, hey, if you click this button
it's going to go to Firstchild.

125
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.000
So, we didn't talk about Firstchild.

126
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.100
But, Firstchild is really, all it's
going to do, it's just going to say,

127
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.120
hey we want to load up
the route called Firstchild.

128
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.639
All right, so, if we go back to
the router configuration, did I pass it?

129
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.726
Right here, the name of this route
is called Firstchild all right?

130
00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:40.630
So when we click this button
we're saying hey, we want to,

131
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.901
mount Firstchild route as the child
component for this route.

132
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.863
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
that's where the relationship comes,

133
00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:54.220
because remember,
the child doesn't know about the parent.

134
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.698
So this is where the relationship comes,
right here.

135
00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:02.547
So we're mounting the first child
component onto another component when we

136
00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:03.578
click this button.

137
00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:07.226
So that's why when I click this button,

138
00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:12.163
the first child component is
going to be rendered right

139
00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:17.114
in here to this router outlet,
or another component.

140
00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:19.824
But even more so,

141
00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:25.800
if we go look at Firstchild component.

142
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.310
Again we can make sure that the templates,

143
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.690
everything is there,
everything is mounted.

144
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.085
And again the first child also
has its own routing setup.

145
00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:45.360
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes.

146
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, in another component, if
you were to have the link to Firstchild in

147
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:55.480
that template would you have to define
another component in the router link or

148
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.210
could you just say Firstchild,
it'll know where to go?

149
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.220
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so because the child
doesn't really have a parent, it doesn't,

150
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.400
so if you just navigated straight to it,
yeah, it'll just load it up.

151
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.280
So, but I think this is actually,
now that I think about it,

152
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.870
it's actually a good thing because
then you can use the routes.

153
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.860
Maybe I want this route to be
a child route on this link, but

154
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.180
on this link I want it to be separate.

155
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.140
I want it to be it's own route because
it doesn't know about its parent.

156
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.380
So yeah, if you just navigated to it,
if you just navigated to first,

157
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.550
it would just load up first.

158
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right, but
if you add the link in the template for

159
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.870
another component.

160
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.640
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Inside of-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Inside of there.

161
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.990
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you had a link.

162
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And so in the router link.

163
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.778
So let's say in between the router
outlet in [CROSSTALK] h1,

164
00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:38.462
you had an a with a router outlet.

165
00:09:38.462 --> 00:09:39.780
You could just say FirstChild?

166
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.455
You wouldn't have to say-
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Well this is FirstChild.

167
00:09:43.455 --> 00:09:44.138
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

168
00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:46.020
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right
we are our FirstChild.

169
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.830
But you mean like if we try to set
up the navigation in this page.

170
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

171
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.150
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I think if
you just put Firstchild,

172
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.340
it's just gonna mount just
Firstchild without a parent.

173
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cuz in your app you're
saying route to another component and

174
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.380
then Firstchild.

175
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.790
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So if you're already in

176
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.966
another component.

177
00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:02.539
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Is it aware?

178
00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:05.217
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, and you wanna
[CROSSTALK] have a link to Firstchild.

179
00:10:05.217 --> 00:10:06.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

180
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Could you just
router link equals Firstchild and?

181
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.960
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't
think it would be aware.

182
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.590
The way they have it set up,
from my understanding,

183
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.500
is that the child just doesn't
know anything about the parent.

184
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.810
Even though it's mounted on that URL.

185
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.504
I would say, we can test it, but
I'm guessing that it won't know and

186
00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:22.280
you still have to set that up.

187
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I'll give it a shot and
see what happens.
