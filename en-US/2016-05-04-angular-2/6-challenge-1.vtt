00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.444
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:06.605
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let me show
you the challenges real quick, and

3
00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.460
I'm gonna back into the demonstration.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.246
This is kind of a, this was a tough
challenge for me to come up with because

5
00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:20.060
I've talked a lot about a lot of things,
a very broad big picture.

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.640
These are all the pieces,
these are kind of how they fit together.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580
These are the talking points.

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.010
If you're in the elevator and
they say, hey, tell me about metadata,

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.420
you can simply say, well,
what did Luke say on that one slide?

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.035
Okay, boom.

11
00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:32.716
I've just impressed my friends

12
00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:37.177
at the party.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I'd like you to

13
00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:40.970
do is download the sample application,
make sure you can run it.

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.940
From here, I'd like you to go through and
identify all the major pieces.

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.822
So, where am I bootstrapping
the application?

16
00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:49.227
Where are my components?

17
00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.792
Where are my services?

18
00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.170
How are they working together?

19
00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.480
And so, from there, I'd like you to go to
a component and add in a property to it.

20
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.440
And then, bind to it in that template.

21
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.840
So, for instance, you could go home and
you could just add a property, and

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.180
then make sure it's rendering in the view.

23
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.430
Then, what I'd like you to do is add
a new property to the StateService,

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
consume it in the component,
and display it in the template.

25
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.341
As a bonus, create an interface.

26
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.970
And so, this is just gonna
be kind of copy and pasting.

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.329
This is let's explore a little bit.

28
00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.842
And the new property that you created,

29
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.740
type that property to that
interface that you just created.

30
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.060
So, in this case, you might create
a user object, or some, a config object.

31
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.180
And then, you would just
create an interface for that.

32
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.158
And so, I'm gonna give everybody,
let's say 15,

33
00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:54.311
20 minutes to kind of pull that down.

34
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:59.105
Just go through the app, see where the
components are, the services, how they fit

35
00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:03.850
together, and just start adding some
properties, and just play around with it.

36
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.971
So I would just like everybody to
familiarize themselves with what

37
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.706
an Angular application kind of looks like.

38
00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:14.468
And we will be available for questions,
and we will pick this up in about 15,

39
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:21.375
20 minutes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Repo are we using,

40
00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.273
cuz there's two running
around at the moment.

41
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:26.104
There's starter, and
then there's another one you've got.

42
00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:26.724
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,

43
00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:30.406
it's not the-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it the one you showed

44
00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:33.039
up before the nice?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's the FEM

45
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.150
[CROSSTALK] simple web app.

46
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.850
And so, I'm kind of going to, actually,
do this a little bit with you guys.

47
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.230
But if you go to the right here,

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.760
I don't wanna say too much because then
I'll just do the challenge for you.

49
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.780
But in the app folder, you'll notice
you have about, experiments, and home.

50
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.800
And so, you'll notice that will match
up with the navigation on the top.

51
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.020
And then, experiments,
I have another sub-component.

52
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.390
So, explore on, explore the relationship
between the experiment's component and

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.405
the experiments details component.

54
00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:16.280
And then, generally,
I will abstract out my services

55
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.950
if they need to be shared across multiple
components into a common directory.

56
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.060
And so, you have your experiment service,
your state service.

57
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.310
So, this is right here.

58
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.780
And if you want to see what
an interface looks like,

59
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.970
you can see it here in
the experimentmodel.ts

60
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.171
file.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Any

61
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:51.548
questions before I release the hounds?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And,

62
00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:56.140
fight.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: One question.

63
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.640
I don't know if you covered this.

64
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.490
Did you,
there's the core gs dependency was missing

65
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.960
from the package JSON.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Was it?

66
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you see that?

67
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.704
Chad had issues with that earlier.
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

68
00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:11.126
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I was able to get

69
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.433
it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

70
00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:15.160
core.js just isn't in there.

71
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.567
So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

72
00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.740
it probably depends on the browser
people are running, so [INAUDIBLE]

73
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.692
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

74
00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:23.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Definitely make sense.

75
00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:23.772
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But you just might want to

76
00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:24.647
update on this.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, officially,

77
00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:26.970
I do accept pull request.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's already there.

78
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.725
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes, so, Scott,

79
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.281
if you wanna accept that pull request.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But

80
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:31.781
I'm just-
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm dreading

81
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.986
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Everybody on video seat

82
00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:34.021
knows that.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah.

83
00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:37.579
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, I do use Chrome

84
00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:41.453
kind of as my default browser, which I
think gives me a fairly distorted view

85
00:04:41.453 --> 00:04:45.735
of how awesome the web is.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Cuz then you have

86
00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:48.880
to support IE.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

87
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.340
Firefox is not too bad.

88
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.590
Safari is, eh.

89
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.350
And so, I just go where it's easy.

90
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.229
But, yes.

91
00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.329
Depending on what browser you're on,

92
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.581
you may experience an error that
I have not experienced yet.

93
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.645
Just surface it, and we'll get through it.
