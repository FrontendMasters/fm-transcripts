[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We need to
create a form for widgets-detail.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.900
And then bind the form to
the widget object that's selected,

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.860
sent in via @input.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.870
And then be able to modify it and then
send it back out to the parent component.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.360
So let's hop into the code and
I have preemptively

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.670
filled some of this out for
the sake of styling.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.460
So we just go here.

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.980
You can see that now our
widgets list is purty,

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.060
as well as our widget
details is semi-styled.

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.160
What is it missing?

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.650
Well, it is missing form fields.

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.860
Let's go ahead and put those in.

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.311
So we'll go to,
I'm just going to copy at least one

15
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:01.529
to get us started.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll go here.

16
00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:07.338
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Paste this in, and

17
00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:13.220
we're going to bind this
to selectedWidget name.

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.444
Enter a name, placeholder, class type,

19
00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:21.620
that's pretty straightforward.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then what we wanna do,

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.080
we'll place this in as well.

21
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.789
And we're going to do
selected widget price.

22
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.016
And we're going to say enter a price.

23
00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:41.650
Now, I'll talk about this more tomorrow,
about what's happening here.

24
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
But, when you start to
focus on the mutable

25
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.360
data in Angular 2, ultimately,
the question comes.

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.240
It's like, well If everything's immutable,
how do you actually do any work?

27
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.570
And the most obvious place where
someone could look at that is,

28
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.960
well what about forms, right?

29
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.550
How do you have an immutable
data structure and

30
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.610
do anything with it, much less a form?

31
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.220
And so the approach that I use for this,

32
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.050
after talking to Rob about it,
is that you are going

33
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.470
to have to have some mutable state in
your application in order to do work.

34
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.540
Mutable state in itself is not bad.

35
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.500
You have to be able to control it.

36
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.490
And so, the way to do this with
a form is to when you get an object,

37
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.660
using an input you can
actually overwrite that.

38
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.540
So in this case when somebody
sets a widget via input,

39
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.120
I'm taking this value and I'm saying
take this widget and just copy it.

40
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.510
Make a copy of it using
object at a sign so

41
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.000
that internally to my form
I can work on this object.

42
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.220
So now I'm not actually mutating
state up the stream, and

43
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.339
I think that's actually why my form
builder's not working, cuz I think this.

44
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.740
But if timing issue is messing up but the
main thing is when you are dealing with

45
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.390
forms you want to
minimize mutable state or

46
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.630
encapsulate so that you're only
mutating state within this component.

47
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.480
You can overwrite the input and
then make a copy of it.

48
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.940
One of the thing that I am doing is

49
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.300
I'm creating a reference to
the original name of the widget.

50
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.800
The reason why I'm doing that is,
if I select this and

51
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.820
if these are bound to the same properties,
via reference, and I start typing here.

52
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.750
Had I not stored that reference into
something else, it would say editing

53
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.020
ASDF ASDF, and so
I simply just create a reference so

54
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.440
that when I actually start editing the
object you're not losing that connection.

55
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.140
So this is purely a UX optimization
of LeKay I'm editing widget one but

56
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.460
now this new name of the form is
whatever I just typed in here.

57
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.560
So, selected widget and then up in
the form this is what I'm binding to.

58
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.350
It comes in over at the setter object
assigned, which is our friend.

59
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.670
We are creating a copy and
then we're working locally.

60
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.653
And then when we are ready to save this,

61
00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:43.780
we can go,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Click,

62
00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:52.125
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go saved, emit,

63
00:04:52.125 --> 00:05:01.203
selected widget.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

64
00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:05.778
now we are mutating it or
passing it back up to do something,

65
00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:08.806
then in widgets, then we will go here,

66
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.079
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: weÂ´ll go Saved.

67
00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:23.815
Save widget event,

68
00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:31.200
we'll pass it in.

69
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.573
Save widget widget.

70
00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:39.127
Actually, let's

71
00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:44.860
just do a console

72
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.014
log here, save.

73
00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:59.550
If everything went well,

74
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.430
It is here,

75
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.414
actually, let's,

76
00:06:10.414 --> 00:06:14.860
yes sir?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wouldn't you want,

77
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.410
instead of having the click event on
the submit button, wouldn't you want to

78
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.710
do the submit on the form?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You could.

79
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.200
Why, you preemptively
have met me at the pass.

80
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.500
That's where I was going.
