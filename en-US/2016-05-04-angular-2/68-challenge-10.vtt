2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.041
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: For this challenge,

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.796
you're gonna create a method inside
the widget service to get widgets.

4
00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:12.350
It says widgets.json right there but
I'll give you the URL where it is,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.880
it's actually the same URL for the items
except for it's the widgets resource.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.410
So it's just 3001/widgets, that's the URL.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.080
And I'll put it up in a minute.

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.472
And then kind of like what we just did,
the method that you made, I need you to

9
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.970
return it from that service and subscribe
to it in the widget's component, or

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.373
the widget's list component, or
whatever component you're gonna be in.

11
00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.539
Subscribe to that, and
get access to the data.

12
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.924
And then if you want to,
you don't have to,

13
00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.306
if you want to change it to a promise and
check it out that, change it to a promise,

14
00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:46.830
make sure it's still working and
go that way.

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.423
And then for bonus because
the Json serves does accept posts,

16
00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:54.580
create another method to post
a new widget to the server.

17
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.820
It's the same URL just a post for it.

18
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.981
So before you get started what you have
to do, if you go into your Repo and

19
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:08.058
you go to db.json, just make sure,
underneath this item's array or

20
00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:13.502
above it, just make a new entry called
widgets and set it equal to an array.

21
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:21.731
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And you might have to
restart your Webpack if that happens,

22
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:24.060
to reinitialize the server.

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.810
It actually might work without it.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.980
It might create the widgets
if you try to post it but

25
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.890
just to be safe, I would do this.

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.430
So again, just add a new entry on
this JSON file called widgets,

27
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.490
set equal to empty array.

28
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.580
The JSON server command line tool
reads this file like a database.

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.200
It's a live file that it writes to.

30
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.620
If you issue a delete request to this
JSON server, it will delete it from file.

31
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.510
If it's a post request to the JSON server,
it'll write to this file.

32
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.440
So it's a live file.

33
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.180
And once you have all that, like I said,
you might have to restart and

34
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.430
the URL is just port 3000/widgets.

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.614
Just like it is for items,
port 3001 I'm sorry.

36
00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.103
3001.

37
00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.592
No, wait, it's 3000.

38
00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:12.466
Okay.

39
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.355
Right, that's 3000?

40
00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:16.139
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, 3000 for the database.

41
00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.881
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [CROSSTALK] Yeah, so it's
3000 for the database, 3000 for the app.

42
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:19.890
Sorry about that.

43
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.193
Yeah, the URL's gonna be the 3000, or
whatever port you're configured to be on,

44
00:02:24.193 --> 00:02:26.531
by default it's 3000 for the JSON server.

45
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.750
The same URL that's in the item services.

46
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.960
If you look in item services,
it's that URL, but with the widgets.

47
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.170
It's the resource name,

48
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
it's whatever resource name you put in
that db.json file that we just put.

49
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.799
Because we put widgets,

50
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.260
the JSON server exposed this as
a resource, as a URL for us.

51
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.420
Whatever you put in here, if you put
cookies, you can now go to /cookies.
