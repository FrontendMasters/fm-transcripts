00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.248
Caching, we talked about caching earlier,

2
00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:07.884
but we never talked about caching at
this level, like Memcached and Redis,

3
00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:11.225
this is caching your database
versus caching your UI.

4
00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:15.926
That's what the browser does, and
that's where we talk about CDNs,

5
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:18.486
and minifying your CSS, and your JS.

6
00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:23.246
That form of caching, this form of caching
is about caching your data, right?

7
00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:28.759
You're using Redis and caching to speed
up application and reduce database load.

8
00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.821
These are very complex tools
that I only recommend if you're

9
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:39.577
gonna be using a complex backend
databases, things of that nature,

10
00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:43.961
you don't have to, but
if you use the database one.

11
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.681
If you go and use MySQL and database,

12
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:49.135
then you probably need to start focusing
on caching as well on this level.

13
00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:55.881
Error handling, this is telemetry, is what
it's called, the big word is telemetry,

14
00:00:55.881 --> 00:01:02.445
w observability is the family this belongs
to, where we're looking at the errors and

15
00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.481
we're watching the logs and
things of that nature.

16
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.500
I think Sentry.io is
a company that Bliss and

17
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.310
Scott are always talking about that
they love that handles a lot of this.

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.326
I highly recommend that if you're
gonna put something into the web,

19
00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:21.320
you need to know this.

20
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.928
This is something that, especially as
front ends, we don't really care about,

21
00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:26.515
we'd be like, that's cool.

22
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:29.690
I just came here to push pixels and
make things pretty on the web.

23
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.574
No, you have to know how to fix things and
make things logging.

24
00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:37.148
This one right here, use TypeScript.

25
00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:41.952
For me, this is mandatory if
you're using any framework.

26
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:47.879
And four years ago, I'd have been like,
no, you can use JavaScript if you want to.

27
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:52.485
Today, if you're using React,
you need to be using TypeScript.

28
00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.400
And you're using Next.js,
you need to using TypeScript.

29
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.580
The harsh reality is when it comes to
building enterprise applications or

30
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.060
production-level applications in the real
world, people are using TypeScript.

31
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.928
So you need to be out there
using TypeScript as well, right?

32
00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:14.312
And that's the only way you're going to
show the employers that you understand

33
00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:18.384
the importance of their stack is by
using things that they value, right?

34
00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:21.100
And types makes the code safer.

35
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.845
So we are practicing a safety thing.

36
00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.788
I'm old school JavaScript, I grew up
before types, so I didn't care about

37
00:02:30.788 --> 00:02:35.667
types cuz I was like, I know JavaScript,
so that's not a problem with me.

38
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:40.339
But types, it makes it better,
types makes your product safer.

39
00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.485
And the last thing on this
list is add dark mode.

40
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:49.376
Adding dark mode is a normal
small thing that helps

41
00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:54.267
showcase you understand the UI,
UI theming, and

42
00:02:54.267 --> 00:03:00.098
how to change it based upon
the user requirements, right?

43
00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:05.012
So the first phase of your dark
mode is you wanna make sure

44
00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:09.510
that on the click,
they can change dark mode.

45
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.906
But you also need to make sure that
it picks up the system settings,

46
00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:15.015
cuz guess what?

47
00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.993
If my systems are already
set to dark mode,

48
00:03:17.993 --> 00:03:22.479
I don't wanna have to set everything
else to dark mode, right?

49
00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.814
That is something you have to think about,
right?

50
00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:25.929
So you might do that first.

51
00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.090
You can be like, all right, first system
setting, I choose a light mode, dark mode,

52
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.050
base point, I want the system set.

53
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.625
Then, I create the button so
that they can make the decision for

54
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.803
themselves if they want
something different, right?

55
00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:44.627
So, think of it like that,
but that is my checklist.

56
00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:47.781
If you do these checklists this way,
I mean,

57
00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:50.770
you will have a fighting chance out there.
