00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.543
This is a gotcha one,
right here this use at least one API

2
00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:08.106
within the portfolio, usually has one API.

3
00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.836
When I'm saying this,
I'm like your portfolio is a project,

4
00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:18.460
you want to showcase anything that
people would think about as a JavaScript

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.750
engineer, you wanna use that in
your portfolio, and APIs is one.

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.540
It's very easy to just
post your GitHub links,

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.320
it's more impactful to use the GitHub API
and bring your GitHub links and

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.740
GitHub repels in, right, so
that's what we're thinking about.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.990
What's the more,
more impactful work, right?

10
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.420
We can show our pin repos, we can also
bring that pin work up via our GitHub API.

11
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.071
There are things that we can
do with that API, Spotify API,

12
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.800
show what you're listening
to right now on Spotify.

13
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.314
I don't do that because
I was in hardcore rap,

14
00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:02.790
I don't want people thinking less than me.

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.822
But I'm also, like I'm 36,
so hardcore rap for

16
00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:11.684
me is like Ice Cube before he hit kids and

17
00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:15.222
stuff right [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; No,

18
00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:18.723
[LAUGH] one of my kids listen to that guy,
and

19
00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:24.076
I am officially the discerning
father just shaking their heads,

20
00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:29.765
saying you whipper-snappers don't
know what real music is [LAUGH].

21
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.851
I'm there, I'm that guy,
I'm sitting there,

22
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:37.268
shirt tucked in, shaking my head [LAUGH].

23
00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:40.721
Just looking at them
judging their music like,

24
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:46.720
you don't understand what real music is,
all right, sure son, whatever.

25
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.242
&gt;&gt; Any tips for making our tracking GDP
are compliant or is that something that

26
00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:55.359
the services we're using like
Google Analytics will take care of.

27
00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.788
&gt;&gt; Google has done a lot of work of
making everything GDP are compliant, I do

28
00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:04.960
recommend you focus on GDPR compliance as
well, thanks for your call-out on that.

29
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.320
Because that is how the GDPR compliance
even though it is UK feel focus.

30
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.247
It is very important everybody is
adopting, this is the way, right,

31
00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:17.595
it's very Mandalorian on that.

32
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:22.888
But yeah, so GDPR is very important
when you're tracking, definitely highly

33
00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:27.794
recommend, but definitely keep that up,
keep up those good questions.

34
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:32.616
So next one that we have,
I think I've said this before,

35
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:38.742
add a blog have I said that earlier but
for me, I'm gonna say that again,

36
00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:43.865
it is a great supplement to your
portfolio that showcases you

37
00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:49.413
know how to make it, so
that your project is very focused on CRUD.

38
00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:53.752
You understand theming as well,
those are two things that I see and

39
00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:56.500
you understand storage and databases.

40
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.319
So those are things that I'm automatically
gonna know when I see you have a blog

41
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.680
attached to your website, right?

42
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.697
&gt;&gt; So when you see a blog you mean
something that's like self-hosted not

43
00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:10.383
using like medium or depth to-
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what I mean.

44
00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:11.338
&gt;&gt; All right?

45
00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:18.683
&gt;&gt; I mean, on your portfolio is a
standalone internal on their self-hosted.

46
00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:23.441
This should be a gimme, but I've seen
enough people still not doing it,

47
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:26.952
I put it on here, any way,
music responsive design,

48
00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:32.596
make sure your portfolio looks great on
all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

49
00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:38.311
You might need to go bigger
cuz you're technologists,

50
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:43.904
because people who see me in
tech as you see over there,

51
00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:49.690
the giant long desk,
top monitors, we all have them.

52
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.188
So you might wanna see
how your website is, and

53
00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:58.929
how the things you build look on large
monitors because that's, you know,

54
00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:04.402
you never know when someone's gonna
put your product on the big screen,

55
00:04:04.402 --> 00:04:08.374
and you're like, my goodness,
it looks so bad.

56
00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:12.506
7000 bucks, 7000, [LAUGH] look,

57
00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:16.293
I've been there you'll find out, and

58
00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:21.940
also see how it looks on unusual
products as well, right?

59
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.735
How, if somebody's looking at
your product from a watch face or

60
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:31.290
something like, they can do that now?

61
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.530
There's some watch faces that can show
your website, and you're like, okay.

62
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.180
How does that look?

63
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.365
That's gross, I don't wanna do that, or

64
00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:42.290
somebody decides they're
gonna put it on a Tamagotchi.

65
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.052
I've seen, I have a troop who figured
out how to use Audrino, an Audrino and

66
00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.160
a Tamagotchi.

67
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.988
And like, welcome to the internet,
here we are, and I'm like, so that's how

68
00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:57.752
Betsuko looks pixelated, that's great,
like, can you get off our website now?

69
00:04:57.752 --> 00:05:02.140
So, please do that,
I'll see how it looks everywhere.
