WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:04.846
And the final, final boss,
as we like to call them, right?

2
00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.148
The developer team.

3
00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:13.188
So I view the developer team, the devs,

4
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:19.275
they are the final boss,
gatekeeping, right?

5
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.798
If you're meeting them, it's a good thing,

6
00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:25.306
but it's gonna be a stressful
thing at the same time, al right?

7
00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:31.010
Now, here is one of those things where
if you've done your portfolio right,

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.009
you have solved 50% of your problem.

9
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.022
If you've done your portfolio right,

10
00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:39.563
because you want a portfolio that is
what I like to call front loaded.

11
00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:41.924
As then you want to answer so

12
00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:46.961
many questions about yourself
prior to them meeting you.

13
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:51.560
They don't have any questions asking or
you wanna have them.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.658
They're thinking about the questions to
ask you about the thing that you already

15
00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:56.448
know, right?

16
00:00:56.448 --> 00:01:00.266
So that's how you want to be able to,
it's almost like, well,

17
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.404
it's not almost like,
it's exactly like PSYOPS.

18
00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:06.438
It's how we do in the military,
is what psychological operations.

19
00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:11.210
Is that we want the user, the person
that we're speaking to, to ask us or

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.141
talk to us about the things
that we're already experts in.

21
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.631
And then we may have more
expertise to them, right?

22
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:22.302
So we're guiding, we're using our
resources, such as our portfolio and

23
00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:27.211
our resume and the work that we've done
to guide them towards that direction.

24
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:31.461
So that builds more interest in us and
makes that as the interview easier for

25
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:32.206
us, right?

26
00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:37.389
So that is what you have to do
with your developer team, right?

27
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.706
Such things like we've spoken earlier,

28
00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:42.428
you wanna talk as if you're
already on the team.

29
00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:47.275
The rule of thumb that I always use
with my troops is that you want

30
00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.397
to pass what I like to call The 5PM rule.

31
00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:54.739
Which means you wanna be the person
that after 5PM on Friday they do not

32
00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.737
wanna throw you out of a window.

33
00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:59.740
They don't want to like
quickly get your new computer.

34
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.598
Do they just send you and like revoke
your access after 5PM on a Friday, right?

35
00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:06.014
That's your goal.

36
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:06.965
How do we do this?

37
00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:11.571
We answer our questions clearly, we make
sure we study the resources, study for

38
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:12.531
the interview.

39
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.506
We make sure that we ask before the
interview like who's all on the dev team.

40
00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:21.685
So that way you can research them because
you may have something that you find

41
00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:22.934
interesting on them.

42
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.558
So you can have these conversations.

43
00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:28.072
You want them to feel as if
you're already on dev team.

44
00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:32.422
I use a lot of wheeze,
I use a lot of how we're gonna do this,

45
00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.522
how I would do this with you.

46
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.502
I'm always trying to put
myself in a position,

47
00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:38.940
is like I am already on the other
side of the table with you.

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.040
And I always try to keep
the conversation moving in light,

49
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.393
because you want them laughing.

50
00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:50.337
The worst thing you can have
is an interview with the dev

51
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.464
team that goes the time allotted.

52
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:57.030
The more you go over,
the better your chances of getting hired,

53
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.409
the more laughter there is,
the better chance to get hired.

54
00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.912
These are just rules that I have seen
that work like they don't make sense.

55
00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:08.296
But remember,
you're still dealing with people, and

56
00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:12.263
people in the end like to work
with people that they like, right?

57
00:03:12.263 --> 00:03:17.902
So they wanna know that you can do the
job, but they also wanna know I'm gonna be

58
00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:23.898
spending a substantial amount of time from
my dogs, my wife and my kids, from you.

59
00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:28.510
And I want to know that that's
going to not make me want to smack

60
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.272
myself with my MacBook Pro, right?

61
00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.382
Because these things are expensive, and

62
00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.799
you know health care in
America is outrageous.

63
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.008
So just, let me know in advance like how
are we going to work together, right?

64
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.739
So that's with the developer teams,
Mark I saw you had your hand raised?

65
00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.714
&gt;&gt; Yeah, someone just commented they think
Fang companies are still looking for

66
00:03:54.714 --> 00:03:59.514
fundamentals and foundation and
software development like OP

67
00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:03.608
solid big O donation algorithms and
systems design.

68
00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.792
&gt;&gt; I can answer that, that is,

69
00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:11.070
firstly when it comes to Fang
organizations, I mean it's very weird

70
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.900
to say Fang now because stock
market has to clear what Fang did.

71
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.031
That's a common understanding,
they're not looking for

72
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.682
the just core fundamentals anymore.

73
00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:28.187
Right now in the era of tech we're in,
it's more rounded.

74
00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:32.190
It's more of like, think of it as like
a specialization of skill, right?

75
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.557
So we're talking about cloud computing.

76
00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:36.881
We're talking about AI,
we're talking about DevOps,

77
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.079
we're talking about the specialized units,
right?

78
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.257
As opposed to computer science the things,
right?

79
00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:47.063
I have never in my eight years
of programming had to use or

80
00:04:47.063 --> 00:04:50.007
been asked a question for
any of these LLPs things of that.

81
00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:55.673
I have been asked questions
in regards to patterns,

82
00:04:55.673 --> 00:05:01.994
because patterns help you
learn other languages faster.

83
00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:06.954
And which is why I always recommend
learning patterns of a language.

84
00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:12.457
I think there's a young woman, Lydia, she
just did a JavaScript patterns course for

85
00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:13.516
you
&gt;&gt; Lydia.

86
00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:17.275
&gt;&gt; Lydia, yeah, so I definitely recommend
that class because patterns will

87
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.852
help you switch from
language to language faster.

88
00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:24.324
Because once you understand the pattern,
and the why this code is doing this,

89
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.050
you'll understand how
to do the thing better.

90
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.709
Now, am I saying that data structures and
Algos are unnecessary?

91
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:35.631
No, what I'm saying is that they're not,

92
00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:42.950
my Microsoft interview no one asked me one
question on data structures and algos.

93
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.423
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really depends on
the role because when I was

94
00:05:46.423 --> 00:05:49.820
interviewing a lot in
the JavaScript engineering or

95
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.774
like the closer you get to
the word engineering in the title.

96
00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:55.627
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; You are absolutely gonna need

97
00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:56.570
to know that stuff.

98
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.377
&gt;&gt; Yes, closer you get to the engineering
part, that deep level stuff, you will.

99
00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:05.953
But I guess the closer you get to
underneath the API, or the closer you get

100
00:06:05.953 --> 00:06:10.619
to building the API and stuff is where
they start asking these questions.

101
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.921
Yeah, that's a good analogy, or
a good way to look at it, right?

102
00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:19.060
Is, hey, the closer you get to under,
very very under the hood,

103
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.436
like that's the more this stuff matters.

104
00:06:22.436 --> 00:06:27.632
Like yeah, types of things that they
are gonna be looking at for you, right?

105
00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:29.568
So I put those in the readme.

106
00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:31.682
So the technical component of course,

107
00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:34.572
that's what they're gonna be looking for,
right?

108
00:06:34.572 --> 00:06:37.969
Culture fit assessment,
like I said, 5PM rule.

109
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.606
They wanna make sure that hey, guess what?

110
00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:46.109
I don't want to throw you out of the
office if I don't wanna call the doorman,

111
00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:48.833
I'm like, just America, doorman.

112
00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:52.975
Europeans do [INAUDIBLE] or they want
to evaluate your projects, right?

113
00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:57.278
This is where you know your portfolio and
making sure it's a Picasso size.

114
00:06:57.278 --> 00:06:59.611
Is like making it shine, al right?

115
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:05.094
You want to ensure that even if you start
playing, you have the information needed

116
00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:10.034
to be able to showcase how you think
of things, to why you think of things.

117
00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:13.829
The way that you're going to, where
you're going with your thought processes,

118
00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:14.718
things like that.

119
00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:16.781
And of course, portfolio review,

120
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:21.678
where they're gonna be reviewing your
projects, get hubs, all this stuff, yes?

121
00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:25.758
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you're gonna get
into it more later, but online,

122
00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:29.440
Michael was asking,
are there any signals of resume?

123
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.139
Are there any things that we should
avoid putting on a resume that

124
00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:39.027
makes us look like a not a fit or
too experienced, inexperienced?

125
00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:42.808
&gt;&gt; I will definitely put,
I'll get more into that, but

126
00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:47.606
the number one red flag I am seeing
is the term full stack developer.

127
00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:50.789
That has got a negative
connotation in the industry.

128
00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:55.315
So you've put web developer, software
engineer, front engineer, back engineer,

129
00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:58.415
what are you exactly trying to do,
especially as a junior,

130
00:07:58.415 --> 00:07:59.543
you should be doing.

131
00:07:59.543 --> 00:08:03.749
Because they are people like okay,
so your junior but

132
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:07.958
you understand the intricacies
of the entire stack?

133
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.350
That doesn't make any sense, right?

134
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.274
So that's the number one red flag,
keyword that we are seeing.

135
00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:16.267
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I will echo that.

136
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:21.664
We're hiring at front of masters, and we
see that all the time, as people generally

137
00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:26.545
in the the beginner couple of years put
full stack on the resume all the time.

138
00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:33.075
And it's laughable, it's like, yes, okay,
you can spin up a node server or whatever.

139
00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:36.780
Like you use Next.js, but that doesn't
make you a full stack developer.

140
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.456
&gt;&gt; Yes, the harsh reality is, I mean,
just because you can put a website on

141
00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:44.463
the web does not make you
a full stack just yet.

142
00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:47.977
Because there's a lot of things in
the middle when it comes to being

143
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:48.739
a full stack.

144
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:53.654
We're talking about security, we're
talking about the rules on front end and

145
00:08:53.654 --> 00:08:55.939
back end are completely different.

146
00:08:55.939 --> 00:08:59.404
Like picking the rules are depending
on what part of front end, or

147
00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:02.492
what part of back end you
are completely different, yes?

148
00:09:02.492 --> 00:09:06.566
&gt;&gt; In other words, like people like could
realistically call themselves fools,

149
00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:10.781
that are almost like seniors at these
teams you were just talking about, people.

150
00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:12.220
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; I will say two,

151
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.890
three years of experience at least.

152
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.738
&gt;&gt; If you wanna see,
if you're actually a full stack,

153
00:09:17.738 --> 00:09:20.540
go to front of
masters.com/learn/full stack.

154
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.501
And tell me if you actually
know all of those things.

155
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.129
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I want you all to get paid and

156
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:25.821
get jobs.

157
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:31.029
And one of the first things you need to do
is drop that full stack off your resume.

158
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:35.735
Because especially as an entry level,
that kind of opens you up for

159
00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:40.696
a lot higher scrutiny versus thinking
of yourself as, you know what,

160
00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:43.806
this is I'm really strong
in a part of this,

161
00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:47.358
because this is what I
initially caught my focus.

162
00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:50.333
Which is what I'm happy about
most of the people in this room,

163
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:53.955
is that you know you're not talking in
the format of full stack engineers.

164
00:09:53.955 --> 00:09:57.060
You're like, I want front-end,
I'm UI, I'm back in.

165
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.536
I want to do DevOps,
a new cloud computing.

166
00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:02.350
You're looking at,
secularizing your skills first and

167
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.764
then you're gonna expand as you get more
experienced in the your career stacks.

168
00:10:07.764 --> 00:10:09.770
Which is the smartest thing to do, right?

169
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.360
Trying to learn everything
at once is insane.

170
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.497
Trying to learn a thing that
you know follow the 3AM rule.

171
00:10:16.497 --> 00:10:21.956
Which for me is, if whatever it is at
three o'clock in the morning that they

172
00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:27.866
call me that I have to be on call to fix,
that's the thing I want to learn, right?

173
00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:33.151
So follow that rule and
you'll be okay, yes, Mark.

174
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:34.279
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I definitely agree with that.

175
00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.308
It's almost like a spearhead,

176
00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:39.996
it's like these are the few
skills I'm the strongest at.

177
00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:43.771
And I'm interested in all these
other things around it, and

178
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:47.991
that's gonna signal to the employer
much better than saying, no,

179
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.193
I'm already at this level
of the the entire stack.

180
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:51.966
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

181
00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:55.727
&gt;&gt; I know I'm really,
I'm strong in this area, and

182
00:10:55.727 --> 00:11:01.384
I'm looking to expand my skills in
these two, three, four or five areas.

183
00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:05.419
&gt;&gt; Exactly, you don't want to come like,

184
00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:10.047
especially on dev teams
because you're gonna

185
00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:14.677
have somebody on the dev
team that's probably

186
00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:19.197
gonna be equal to what
your true strength is.

187
00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:22.651
And then other people on the developer
team that's going It's gonna be able to

188
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.334
walk circles around you on
the things you're not strong on.

189
00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:27.999
So you wanna focus on your strengths and

190
00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:31.403
be able to use that as your
biggest selling point.

191
00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:35.200
But if you say that you're, you put
a bunch of stuff on your resume and

192
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.559
your LinkedIn that you're not strong on,

193
00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.769
you've opened,
you create an opening in your game that is

194
00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:45.054
gonna allow someone to ask questions
that you're not prepared for, right?

195
00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:49.767
So that the aim of this is to make sure
that we have we put all the odds on our

196
00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:50.802
side, right?

197
00:11:50.802 --> 00:11:54.834
Which is why we don't use full stack,
especially as a junior entry.

198
00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.727
You have less than a year's experience.

199
00:11:56.727 --> 00:12:02.446
It's just pretty, it's a pretty hard pill
to swallow that you're a full stack.

200
00:12:02.446 --> 00:12:06.395
And I'm not being,
like it's I'm not being mean about it,

201
00:12:06.395 --> 00:12:08.958
I want you to win, this is a safe space.

202
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.285
Like, don't ask me don't
cancel me on Twitter.

203
00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:13.935
Like, I mean, I don't even use
Twitter like that anymore.

204
00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:17.526
So, like, go ahead and
like do that if you want.

205
00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:18.850
Yeah, what's up, man?

206
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.974
&gt;&gt; So I have a question.

207
00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:24.690
We were talking about these three
users and kind of three people that

208
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.223
you need to convince to give you
the go ahead in order to get a job.

209
00:12:28.223 --> 00:12:28.822
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

210
00:12:28.822 --> 00:12:32.926
&gt;&gt; I notice frequently there's kind of
a division between like the AI/HR people

211
00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:36.719
where they have a set list of
requirements they're looking to hire for,

212
00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:38.409
they use that to filter people?

213
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.581
And then you got the dev team,
who have the real world actual requirement

214
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:43.974
Tournaments for
what you'd be doing in the day to day.

215
00:12:43.974 --> 00:12:47.651
How do you get to the second groups that
way you know what to talk about when

216
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:52.057
oftentimes what you're seeing online with
these applications, and you know what's

217
00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:56.123
available like about the job isn't really
what the people are actually doing.

218
00:12:56.123 --> 00:12:59.432
A good chunk of the time,
&gt;&gt; One thing I have done with my troops,

219
00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:03.735
so I've instructed my troops to do that
as really helped is that we go and

220
00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:06.045
we enter informational interviews.

221
00:13:06.045 --> 00:13:10.241
You're gonna talk about this
more in the networking part, but

222
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:15.716
we'll actually research that company on
LinkedIn before we do the application.

223
00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:20.717
And we'll see if there's anyone in any of
the networks within our internal network,

224
00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.773
that is connected to somebody
at their company, and

225
00:13:23.773 --> 00:13:28.019
see if we can get an informational
interview about this particular job.

226
00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:31.758
And if we can go get that,
we go one step further and

227
00:13:31.758 --> 00:13:37.649
try to get the recommendation for this
particular job as well for the student.

228
00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:42.253
So that's one thing that I
definitely recommend before you.

229
00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:48.370
I never recommend doing that whole
like blind apply apply apply,

230
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.501
fast apply like that is your
worst adversary, right?

231
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:56.108
You're applying before
you're getting intel.

232
00:13:56.108 --> 00:13:59.745
You can't go in a battlefield, you
always get the intel first before you go

233
00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:02.709
in there, because that's how
you end up in ambush, right?

234
00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:06.343
And we are not doing that, so
what we do is that we gather

235
00:14:06.343 --> 00:14:10.455
intelligence to formulate a plan and
then we attack, right?

236
00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:14.428
So that's how we approach
every interview process,

237
00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:18.413
from the application phase
to getting the job phase.

238
00:14:18.413 --> 00:14:22.979
I am always researching, I'm like,
you know what I'm human, I'm Batman,

239
00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:27.766
not Superman, like, well, they call me
Captain America, but he gets shot too.

240
00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:33.796
So, [LAUGH] in the end,
I need to plan stuff before I execute,

241
00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:39.015
because when I fail to plan,
I plan to fail, right?

242
00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:41.805
&gt;&gt; Any question on like the hiring
the developer's conversation?

243
00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:44.877
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So under the understand the tech stack

244
00:14:44.877 --> 00:14:49.109
part, it mentions like talk
about experience if you have it.

245
00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:53.851
Like how would have you gotten past the
ATS section of the process without saying

246
00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.914
that you have experience with it?

247
00:14:55.914 --> 00:15:00.686
&gt;&gt; Well so I think someone he
picks up his question like how

248
00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:02.981
the two can like diverge.

249
00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:07.772
By the time you get to the developer, the
team that developed dev team, they can be

250
00:15:07.772 --> 00:15:12.579
talking about a totally different problem
they're gonna be working on, right?

251
00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:17.447
I've been in that chair in which I'm
talking about the job that I'm looking at

252
00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:18.552
is one stack, but

253
00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:23.229
they're talking about switching over
to another stack in the interview.

254
00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:28.597
And then I'm like, I have experience in
that I've already been working on that.

255
00:15:28.597 --> 00:15:33.117
Let me show you something that
the architecture of how I was using these

256
00:15:33.117 --> 00:15:37.405
micro services of these three separate
front ends to be able to work

257
00:15:37.405 --> 00:15:39.415
in unison with this API layer.

258
00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:42.481
So let me show you how I would do that,
right?

259
00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:45.306
And that helped me get the job already,

260
00:15:45.306 --> 00:15:50.191
because they had the offer letter
before I was out the door, right?

261
00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:54.198
So that's how that happened,
because you never,

262
00:15:54.198 --> 00:15:58.308
like I said, you really,
the companies halfling.

263
00:15:58.308 --> 00:16:03.043
I know that like the person doing the job
break is somebody who talk to somebody,

264
00:16:03.043 --> 00:16:07.921
who talked to somebody, who talked to
somebody that hasn't touched the code base

265
00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:11.547
in like seven years, and
they have no idea what's going on.

266
00:16:11.547 --> 00:16:14.485
And then by the time you get to
the developers there was like, hey,

267
00:16:14.485 --> 00:16:16.706
let me show you what we're
really talking about.

268
00:16:16.706 --> 00:16:18.225
And then you get the job.

269
00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:21.264
And then they're like,
everything that they told you was a lie.

270
00:16:21.264 --> 00:16:22.627
This is what's going on.

271
00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:26.165
Enjoy, like,
enjoy this place is hey, like FYI.

272
00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:29.924
So like, I've been on jobs where like,
hey, guess what we're doing C sharp.

273
00:16:29.924 --> 00:16:34.187
That wasn't in my interview at all,
like why are we doing C sharp?

274
00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:39.217
[LAUGH] I don't get it, like I guess I'm
here now, so we're gonna C sharp together.

275
00:16:39.217 --> 00:16:41.883
So it's just about being adaptive, right?

276
00:16:41.883 --> 00:16:45.109
And you know use those opportunities,
yes, Mark?

277
00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:46.525
&gt;&gt; What about certifications?

278
00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:49.187
Can that help you?

279
00:16:49.187 --> 00:16:51.862
&gt;&gt; I was gonna talk about
that in the resume.

280
00:16:51.862 --> 00:16:53.713
&gt;&gt; Well let's hold the thought,
that must have skipped.

281
00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:54.523
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

282
00:16:54.523 --> 00:16:58.510
&gt;&gt; Let's get into it, love all your
questions, there's another one about

283
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.062
getting a job in the US if you're abroad,
using US sponsorship.

284
00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:03.441
I don't know if you're
gonna get into that.

285
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.430
&gt;&gt; No, I'm not, but
I wasn't gonna get into that, but

286
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.230
I can answer that question now.

287
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.232
&gt;&gt; Okay, why don't you just
answer it quick, and then.

288
00:17:10.232 --> 00:17:12.043
&gt;&gt; Al right, what's the question?

289
00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:18.271
&gt;&gt; Just getting a job in the US if
you're abroad and you need a visa?

290
00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:19.637
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Al right, so

291
00:17:19.637 --> 00:17:23.820
you have to firstly look for the jobs
that are willing to do visa sponsorships.

292
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:29.854
They usually explicitly say if they are or
they aren't, that's first one.

293
00:17:29.854 --> 00:17:33.621
Secondly, you need to make sure
you get those requirements and

294
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.834
they tend to be more of
the collegiate route, right?

295
00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:39.562
So if you're not gonna college for

296
00:17:39.562 --> 00:17:43.702
computer science that's
gonna be very difficult or

297
00:17:43.702 --> 00:17:48.603
a type of very strong mathematics
based like degree program.

298
00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:53.018
Very difficult to get into those type
of programs, those type of jobs, but

299
00:17:53.018 --> 00:17:54.644
they're not impossible.

300
00:17:54.644 --> 00:17:58.034
So I definitely, I just recommend,
doing your research on that.

301
00:17:58.034 --> 00:18:03.271
On each job, each industry,
do internships, informational.

302
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:08.007
If that's your goal,
you need to make sure you need to stack

303
00:18:08.007 --> 00:18:12.762
the odds on your side for
the visa, visa sponsorship jobs.

304
00:18:12.762 --> 00:18:17.391
&gt;&gt; There was, I would say in
our discord and on Instagram,

305
00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:22.512
there's some threads around
somebody who was from Mexico and

306
00:18:22.512 --> 00:18:28.835
they got a job at Google using in front
of masters was their main resource so.

307
00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:31.644
&gt;&gt; That's dope
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so

308
00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:36.951
you might want to reach out
on our discord as well.

309
00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:40.116
&gt;&gt; I haven't been on discord in so
long, I'm an old person, man.

310
00:18:40.116 --> 00:18:44.540
I don't be on these discords and
all these other do-thingies and stuff.

311
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.192
I have a TikTok just for the kids,

312
00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:53.030
man [LAUGH] I'm old sarge,
that's who I am.
