00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.671
SEO, how many of you have heard about SEO.

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:05.758
Nice, you'd be amazed how
many times I don't hear that,

3
00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:09.869
I'm in rooms like the younger youngins
they don't know anything about SEO.

4
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.586
They haven't heard about SEO,

5
00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:14.829
they don't know why they should
care about SEO they're like

6
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.270
shouldn't SEO go to someone else while
there are whole companies to handle SEO.

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.711
SEO is very important because
you want to be able to

8
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:28.789
optimize your websites for
search is much as possible and

9
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.658
especially where search
engine optimization is going

10
00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:38.442
to be a part of AI within this week,
for Bing, right?

11
00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:42.537
So you need to make sure that your
work is able to get to the top.

12
00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:49.317
When you type your in, it shouldn't be,
what's your name again?

13
00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:50.180
&gt;&gt; Cocowong.

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.506
&gt;&gt; Cocowong, so
it should be when they type Cocowong in,

15
00:00:54.506 --> 00:01:00.920
it should not be Cocowong from Little Rock
or Cocowong from Chile or somewhere.

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.440
It should be you, right?

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.390
That's what you want.

18
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.995
You know what?

19
00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:08.751
This person's, prison,, record picture.

20
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.560
They're like, wait, girl,
she went to jail, nope.

21
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.745
Like, because [LAUGH] I've seen it.

22
00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:16.660
I've seen, like, even it happened to me.

23
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.990
Somebody from Ohio had
their prison thing up.

24
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.710
And I was, that's.

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.010
I got to fix my SEOstat.

26
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.262
So you have to think about that when
you think about SEO, you got be first,

27
00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:34.586
like there's like four Jerome
harder ways and I'm first and

28
00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:39.540
I'm sort of point where one Jerome
harder way is now named as he has.

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.830
I chase all his stuff online or Jerome
Ramon Hardaway because he's like people

30
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.174
keep reaching out to me thinking I'm you.

31
00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:50.920
And I'm like it we're friends now we
all started a podcast called drove and

32
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.892
drove out of a joke like [LAUGH].

33
00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:56.690
It would have been hilarious like,
it's awesome.

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.766
That's how immature I am though.

35
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.518
&gt;&gt; What does SEO look like in practice?

36
00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:03.740
&gt;&gt; SEO looks like in practice.

37
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.130
So let's start from the most
granular situation.

38
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.840
You're a text editor, right?

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.051
In your head, there should be a section
where you're adding the words

40
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:19.839
that you wanna be searched for
when it comes to your text editor.

41
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.081
Or let's say, well, because you're doing
the API, so yours is a little different,

42
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.304
but let's say someone brought up next.JS.

43
00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:29.841
Next.js actually has an SEO like tag page

44
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.655
that only focuses only on
the SEO from that, right?

45
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.839
So, when I'm thinking about SEO,
like for instance,

46
00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.091
when I'm with Vets2Code,
I'm looking at the SEO tag,

47
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:45.253
Next.js component, I'm looking at
those words that we have in there.

48
00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:49.299
They're all about veterans, JavaScript,
they're all about learning how to code.

49
00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.997
Software engineering, military spouses,
things of that, these are the words,

50
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:58.530
keywords that I want to be found for,
when it comes to the Internet, right?

51
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.110
So like that is what,
SEO is at its core, right?

52
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.277
We're using that or

53
00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:09.320
let's say I don't want my site like follow
for SEO because it's not ready, right?

54
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.548
So now I'm on a robots.txt file and
I'm putting a no follow and a robots.txt

55
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:20.350
because I don't want the I don't want the
Internet to index my site just yet, right.

56
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.110
Things like that.

57
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.810
That's what SEO is essentially.

58
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.440
And there's also like a page,
I think it's called Google Console.

59
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.021
Where you can put your LinkedIn and

60
00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:34.213
have them in a start indexing as well,
search console.

61
00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.955
&gt;&gt; So
you can almost think of it as SEO for

62
00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:41.572
a website is kind of like making
your resume ATS ready sort of.

63
00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:43.614
&gt;&gt; Yes, so,
&gt;&gt; It's parsed by the machines correctly

64
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:44.292
in the right way.

65
00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:49.248
&gt;&gt; Or that is easier to find, right
like and the more backlinks you have,

66
00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:51.521
the higher your SEO is, right.

67
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.262
Like that's one thing that
they don't they took.

68
00:03:54.262 --> 00:03:58.553
The larger the website is and
not more of the back links have they have,

69
00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.830
the higher the SEO becomes, right.

70
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.798
That SEO that you see people chase
back links like it's PokÃ©mon.

71
00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:07.395
They're just got to catch them all.

72
00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:10.231
It's like okay that's cool like
you're too going too hard.

73
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:11.247
Let's back
&gt;&gt; Links

74
00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:13.024
like from somebody else linking, do you?

75
00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:15.938
&gt;&gt; Yeah, someone else linking to them or
another company linking to them,

76
00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:17.460
things of that nature, right?

77
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.620
You wanna try to stay within your brand,
like your brand atmosphere or

78
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.860
your brand ecosystem, and that's where.

79
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.743
There's no SQL really, shines, right,
like if everybody who found that Sukkot

80
00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:35.086
was looking for a veterinarian then
we would have that's horrible SEO.

81
00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:38.590
Even though you know, people were looking
for veterinarians who code I'm like,

82
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.230
why do you need a coded veterinarian?

83
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.110
Are you talking about like
the animal is going in?

84
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.260
I don't understand.

85
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.800
But like that is what we would have to.

86
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.770
That's what we try to we
avoid right with our SEO.

87
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.750
Okay, web performance,
utilizing web performance best practices.

88
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.209
So lazy loading, i.e,
having images load after paint and so

89
00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:03.856
they glow so they don't hold up
the rest of the loading process.

90
00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:08.819
Code splitting, caching, so we have,
how many of us have had experience

91
00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.432
with caching a website,
like the first load of pain.

92
00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:16.609
Frst time you pull up a website it moves
a little bit slower but then the second

93
00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:21.175
time you pull it up as fast because it's
already been cached, right, all that data

94
00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:25.310
is already there It just pulls it up,
that was pretty snazzy, right?

95
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.730
So we need to practice and
have those implemented as well.

96
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.662
Those are good web performance, helps
with the speed of the website, helps with

97
00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:37.990
you getting the data and tools and
resources that you need out there faster.

98
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.469
And it's gonna reduce,
it reduces your load times.

99
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.717
Helps your search ranking students so
it goes hand in hand with SEO,

100
00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:48.350
remember speed helps SEO.

101
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.952
Security best practices,

102
00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:58.572
now this starts come into play when
we started doing a lot of things for.

103
00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:02.053
Think of it like when started when our
forms are just starting our databases.

104
00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:04.833
Start even with our light once
we push to live to the web,

105
00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:07.496
this is when security starts
coming to play, right,

106
00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:10.700
I just can't push live to the web and
I have HTTPS, right?

107
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.070
And it's your site on safe,
you're going to get there.

108
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.980
So we're gonna go to your site and it's
going to be, hey, this site is gonna save.

109
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.560
What do you recommend that
you want to continue?

110
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.320
Or you just want to go back, right?

111
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.536
Everybody's saying that pop up happened,
right?

112
00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:27.067
Well, that's because someone's SSL
cert certificate is expired or

113
00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:32.057
they use HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS
protocol, right, like these are all

114
00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:36.994
the things that you have to think of
when you're starting to push to the web.

115
00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:41.185
Now when you're thinking of,
if you're going to have a blog,

116
00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:45.615
you're going to need a database
to store the information, i.e,

117
00:06:45.615 --> 00:06:48.900
the text and
the images of your blog, right?

118
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.127
How do we have to secure that
database with correct passwords and

119
00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:55.520
correct security procedures?

120
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.510
If we're going to have
login authentication forms.

121
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.079
Like if we want anything that the human
being has to interact with the information

122
00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:08.715
in, we're gonna wanna make sure that a,
have Captcha to make sure it's a human,

123
00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:11.940
and b, make sure they can't
do cross-site scripting or

124
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.383
anything else of that nature in our forms.

125
00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:20.651
And C, be able to like not you know send
us spammy content like with a bot, right.

126
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:24.727
So these are all things that we have to
think about when we're you know building

127
00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:28.187
our websites once we start wanting
people to interact with them and

128
00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:29.386
that's what we want.

129
00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:33.796
We want our websites to be
interacted with people, right?

130
00:07:33.796 --> 00:07:38.247
So just think about that when
you're building your website,

131
00:07:38.247 --> 00:07:41.256
make sure you think of, you keep that in.
