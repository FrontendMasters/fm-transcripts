WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.489
After we put the experience part,
right, and

2
00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:09.679
then we have our projects,
now comes our education.

3
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:17.651
Now the only time I recommend putting
certifications on your resume,

4
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.704
only times this actually matters,

5
00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:28.206
is if they are in correlation
directly to technologies.

6
00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:34.309
Our experience, my eight years of
experience, what I have seen is that.

7
00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.739
If the certification has absolutely
nothing to do with a type of

8
00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.688
technology directly, it is owned
by a company, it does not matter.

9
00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:53.133
If it's cool that you have a free
Code Camp certification, doesn't matter.

10
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:58.649
Now that AWS cert, that Azure, and
the AZ-900 cert, that's something, right?

11
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.553
That tells me, that you have actually
looked at a technology that we may use for

12
00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.796
work and you've certified.

13
00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:11.486
And you've gone through and
from the company itself and

14
00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:17.891
these aren't small companies and
they just don't throw their certs away.

15
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.717
So that lets me know that
you've done some serious work,

16
00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:26.108
you have a ground-level understanding
of technologies we use.

17
00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:32.255
Beyond that, I do not recommend you
putting certifications on there.

18
00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.788
Unless I might say it was from
a technical institute, but

19
00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:40.361
even if you go to a bootcamp, well,
most bootcamps aren't accredited.

20
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:45.125
So the real only certifications that
truly matter come from the technologies

21
00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:46.077
of companies,

22
00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:51.145
like technology companies with the tech
that you're gonna be using, all right?

23
00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:52.964
So you have cloud computing,

24
00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:56.760
certifications are gonna be
very important for you, right?

25
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.722
When it comes to your job hunt, there's
one thing saying you wanna get in cloud

26
00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:03.501
computing, one thing talking
about Edge computing.

27
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:07.405
You need to know the difference between
cloud computing and Edge computing.

28
00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:08.876
If you're computing in the cloud,

29
00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:12.570
Edge is you're trying to bring the data
as close to the user as possible, right?

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.701
So you need to know those differences,
you need to understand how you would use,

31
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.432
Azure, or AWS, or whatever technology.

32
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:25.048
I guess what CloudFlare, to be able to
do those things with the person, and

33
00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:28.727
that's where those certifications
they matter, right?

34
00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:33.346
I'm pretty sure the chats
called Banana is over for that.

35
00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:34.689
&gt;&gt; Just some questions.

36
00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.652
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

37
00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:39.178
&gt;&gt; One was around that
this person did a year and

38
00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:43.852
a half at university,
then switch to more self-taught.

39
00:02:43.852 --> 00:02:48.128
Do they put the university
experience on at all?

40
00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:51.687
&gt;&gt; I don't, I don't know, I tell my
students we need to finish the college,

41
00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:54.643
there's just no point because
it's not they're gonna ask.

42
00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:58.982
If it requires a college degree,
they are not going to ask for

43
00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:04.015
proof of you going to college and
you didn't finish college, right?

44
00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:08.979
And they only really asked for
the degree if it's pertinent to the job or

45
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.561
you put on the resume.

46
00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:15.758
One of the students that
just came through last year,

47
00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:20.838
it held him up for
his job because he went to school for

48
00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:24.314
drama and he had a degree for drama.

49
00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:27.888
And they gave him a lot of drama
because he had to wait for

50
00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:31.638
his degree to come through
before he could start his job.

51
00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:35.262
So he almost lost his job waiting for
the degree to start his job.

52
00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:40.258
Cuz the federal government was like, hey,
we need this degree before cuz you put

53
00:03:40.258 --> 00:03:43.659
it on your resume, so
it has to be a part of our records.

54
00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.963
And he got the job in December, nobody
was at school at the time he got the job.

55
00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:51.925
So it took them like six,
seven weeks to get this degree and

56
00:03:51.925 --> 00:03:54.174
he barely almost lost
his job because of it.

57
00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:59.144
So, I recommend that if it's not important
to the degree, I mean it's on the job,

58
00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:02.987
if you didn't finish your degree
program don't even put it on.

59
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:11.718
&gt;&gt; So what about if they did certificate
from a company that uses Python but

60
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:16.073
they're looking for
a JavaScript-TypeScript role?

61
00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:17.382
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, you can do that,

62
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.666
cuz it still shows you that you've
learned some programming, right?

63
00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:25.580
That's where the whole, like I said,
learning patterns comes into play, right?

64
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.368
Learning those patterns
helps you transition,

65
00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.885
learning other languages faster, right?

66
00:04:30.885 --> 00:04:36.358
People know, or at least it's lore in our
culture that once you learn one language,

67
00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:39.536
the second language is
gonna be faster to learn.

68
00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:42.153
I personally don't believe that, or

69
00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:47.059
maybe it's just that my brain didn't
do that the first two languages,

70
00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:52.895
JavaScript's my second language, Ruby
was a dream, JavaScript was a nightmare.

71
00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:58.346
PHP made me never want
to write PHP again and

72
00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:02.744
then Python was like this is nice.

73
00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:05.423
Nice, this is lovely, okay, that's cool.

74
00:05:05.423 --> 00:05:09.895
But then C# came back, and
I was like, okay, here you go,

75
00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:12.047
you hate me too, all right.

76
00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:16.745
So, like I said, I don't believe
in that but a lot of people do.

77
00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:17.519
I say put it on,

78
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.003
cuz it at least shows that you have
experience working in a language.

79
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:26.649
&gt;&gt; What about graduate level courses,
like Stanford courses, that kind of thing?

80
00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:31.464
&gt;&gt; How would that correlate
to your ability to program?

81
00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:37.399
For me, it's like okay, that shows
that you're good at going to school,

82
00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:42.317
that shows your mastery level
of that subject but not so much.

83
00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:46.186
How does that correlate to
your programming skills?

84
00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:51.433
My rule stands, if it has nothing
to do with you being able to code,

85
00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:57.551
or you like technology roles when comes
to education I don't even put it off.

86
00:05:57.551 --> 00:06:01.622
I've never put my

87
00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:06.513
degree on my resume.

88
00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:09.356
Only reason people know I went to
FSSU is coz I have it on my LinkedIn.

89
00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:13.316
And the only reason I have it on
my LinkedIn is because my wife and

90
00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:16.179
I went to the same school and
she made me do it.

91
00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:19.872
So that's it, I don't even care.

92
00:06:19.872 --> 00:06:23.758
&gt;&gt; How about having a universal resume for

93
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:28.239
everything versus multiple more specific?

94
00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:29.631
&gt;&gt; I love that question,

95
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:35.143
I am King of universal resume versus 8000
different resumes with light core things.

96
00:06:35.143 --> 00:06:39.885
I for me, I have written one resume,
I know the skills that I have,

97
00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:43.717
I know where I'm trying to
be where I'm trying to go.

98
00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:46.329
I focus on, if I'm going to a job search,

99
00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:49.627
this is what I'm grading
every job I applied for by.

100
00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:54.172
Because I know that if it's not about
this, probably I'm not gonna be

101
00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:59.120
a good fit for them, I'll be wasting
their time, I'll be wasting my time.

102
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.520
I'm not gonna be able to put
the best foot forward to make sure

103
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.554
that I get the greatest success metrics.

104
00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:13.468
So, that's one of the first step
I do when I plan my job hunt.

105
00:07:13.468 --> 00:07:19.002
I wanna make sure that I put myself
in the strongest position possible.

106
00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:24.065
So I put a thing like, I believe in
my 3 AM rule, there's no tomorrow.

107
00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:29.340
All right, this is the thing that you call
me about it 3 o'clock in the morning,

108
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.242
I would be like okay, let me get on my
computer and figure this out, right?

109
00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:37.982
If my pager, if I was on call
I had a pager a PagerDuty,

110
00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:41.571
blew up my phone like that's
part of being in tech.

111
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:44.599
You might be on call for
a weekend rotation, and

112
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.702
PagerDuty will send a Slack message,
then send a text message.

113
00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:51.816
And then call you if something goes down,
right?

114
00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:57.162
Is this the thing at 3 o'clock in
the morning, if I'm on PagerDuty for work,

115
00:07:57.162 --> 00:08:02.676
I'm not gonna be 100%, man,
I might be 30, but I'm not gonna be 100.

116
00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:04.086
Yes sir.

117
00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:08.906
&gt;&gt; How about listing only
the program main languages that you

118
00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:13.931
are really good with versus
a lot of programming languages?

119
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.892
&gt;&gt; I don't recommend listing
anything you don't wanna work it.

120
00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:22.924
You could be good at something and
still not wanna work in it, right?

121
00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:25.910
So let's say, right now market strategy.

122
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.183
Ruby on Rails is actually growing and
jobs right now in the market.

123
00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:36.786
So, if I'm like okay,
Ruby on Rails is what I wanna learn,

124
00:08:36.786 --> 00:08:40.608
am I gonna put Django, Python, .NET?

125
00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.958
No, I have experienced in .NET.

126
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:48.443
I will never put .NET on my resume,
cuz I do not wanna get paid for

127
00:08:48.443 --> 00:08:52.007
writing .NET, that's a fact, right?

128
00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:56.352
I know PHP, I don't put it on my resume,
as a matter of fact,

129
00:08:56.352 --> 00:09:00.760
I've scrubbed my GitHub of PHP,
that's how serious I am.

130
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.532
I don't wanna get paid for it,
I don't wanna anyone to ask me about it.

131
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:08.789
You don't even wanna get
recruiters hitting you,

132
00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:13.048
there's one lone resume
from when I worked in PHP.

133
00:09:13.048 --> 00:09:17.939
Almost a decade ago, that I can't find and
I keep getting hit up

134
00:09:17.939 --> 00:09:22.940
from random people to hey,
I notice you have experience in PHP.

135
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.539
Where are you finding this resume so
I can burn it off of the Internet,

136
00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:30.650
I don't do, right, so that's just my rule.

137
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.577
I don't put anything on my resume
that I'm, A, not amazing at,

138
00:09:35.577 --> 00:09:37.918
B, don't wanna get paid for.

139
00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:41.694
And usually when you're working in
languages they have to go together, right?

140
00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:47.425
So, if you're putting Python, .NET all
these backend languages on your resume.

141
00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:50.621
Usually, what's going on for
the job, they're not asking you for

142
00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:53.379
all those backend languages
unless you're like DevOps.

143
00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:58.253
And you need a little bit of understanding
of multiple back-end languages to be

144
00:09:58.253 --> 00:09:59.866
able to make things work.

145
00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:03.020
But usually,
it's a comparison style, right?

146
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.863
Okay, like back before years 2015, right?

147
00:10:06.863 --> 00:10:12.981
If you were using Rails,
you weren't really using JavaScript,

148
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:16.875
you more than likely going to use jQuery,

149
00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:22.897
cuz you're gonna make Rails do
all the logical things, right?

150
00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:26.877
So now use JavaScript and
Hotlink and ES 2015.

151
00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:31.095
But back in 2013-2012,
when you were using Rails,

152
00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:34.594
is this Rails jQuery,
that was in unison, right?

153
00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:36.243
You use the RBs, ERBs.

154
00:10:36.243 --> 00:10:38.814
&gt;&gt; Or even CoffeeScript.

155
00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:41.426
&gt;&gt; CoffeeScript is another thing
that I will never put on my resume.

156
00:10:41.426 --> 00:10:46.537
[LAUGH] Why would you bring,
that's just bad memories,

157
00:10:46.537 --> 00:10:49.700
man, that's triggered, okay.

158
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.398
&gt;&gt; So, I've seen this on people's resumes
where they put like the percentage

159
00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:54.163
level or like.

160
00:10:54.163 --> 00:10:55.070
&gt;&gt; Do not do that.

161
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:55.949
&gt;&gt; Okay.

162
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:58.829
&gt;&gt; Don't do that on your portfolio,
don't do that on your resume.

163
00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:02.913
One, who are you basing
these percentages on, right?

164
00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:07.244
There's no table,
like there's universal that says, yeah,

165
00:11:07.244 --> 00:11:13.270
this is the percentages of everything, you
answer these, this is the percentage of.

166
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.208
Are you basing upon,
how much of it you've written,

167
00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.706
have you based upon how
fast you can write it?

168
00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:23.711
Or what is this metric that you're
using to get these percentages, right?

169
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:25.944
You don't have that metric.

170
00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:29.522
That metric may not mean even
if I see these percentages, and

171
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:33.801
you've put them there, it may not even
mean the same thing to me when I'm

172
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:37.541
looking at it as opposed to what
you did when you put it on there.

173
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:38.453
So just don't do it,

174
00:11:38.453 --> 00:11:41.868
cuz I might interpret it as something you
don't want me to interpret it as, so.

175
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:45.246
&gt;&gt; I have seen people use
stuff like HackerRank and

176
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:49.638
the assessments they do in
combination to kind of show off what

177
00:11:49.638 --> 00:11:53.448
Hacker Inc thinks they can do,
I'll put it that way.

178
00:11:53.448 --> 00:11:54.213
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

179
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.659
&gt;&gt; The resume is that worthwhile at all or
not?

180
00:11:55.659 --> 00:12:02.774
&gt;&gt; No, it's not,
when it comes to teach or learning code.

181
00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:06.596
Not learning code, but
assessing people's coding skills,

182
00:12:06.596 --> 00:12:10.060
it's more alchemy and
then arithmetic, that's one.

183
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.144
And two, when I look at those
hackering things, I'm like,

184
00:12:14.144 --> 00:12:19.527
are you good at solving hackering problems
or are you good at solving problems?

185
00:12:19.527 --> 00:12:22.538
Cuz those are two different things,
and like full disclosure.

186
00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:29.829
I'm considered a HackerRank
star all-star by them, right?

187
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:34.658
I still don't buy into
the HackerRank philosophy,

188
00:12:34.658 --> 00:12:38.071
because I've seen people who bomb.

189
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:41.308
HackerRank problems can
even get past the basics,

190
00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:44.249
build amazing things
when done the right way.

191
00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:49.786
This is how we teach you how to
solve our problems type deal.

192
00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:56.517
And a company can say, all right,
well you can solve those problems,

193
00:12:56.517 --> 00:13:02.234
I know that you at least know
how to solve problems, right?

194
00:13:02.234 --> 00:13:07.002
Versus how some companies like Microsoft,
they are looking at how you solve

195
00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:11.042
the problem, why you solve
the problem that you solve, right?

196
00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:15.673
I was there in my org in
ISE we're looking at okay,

197
00:13:15.673 --> 00:13:20.762
could you have reused some
code to solve this problem?

198
00:13:20.762 --> 00:13:25.464
Was there a common-sense
solution to this problem that

199
00:13:25.464 --> 00:13:28.772
you weren't looking at technically?

200
00:13:28.772 --> 00:13:34.342
I literally had a, one of my hardest
questions from my interview was.

201
00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:40.971
So you're trying to get all the data
from all these cars at the same time,

202
00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:46.632
but there we're in different time zones,
how do you do that?

203
00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:50.851
And I'm sitting here going through
all of these cron jobs and

204
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:55.648
all this other stuff and the guy was like,
well, you just wait till 2

205
00:13:55.648 --> 00:14:00.380
o'clock in the morning, and
on Eastern coasts on the West coasts.

206
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.935
And he was like, about for usual matter of
time, like 80% of those cars have stopped,

207
00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:08.548
so you just wait till that time and
you just pull them all of their time.

208
00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:11.196
And I was like, yeah,
that's right, it makes sense.

209
00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:15.196
Most people are sleeping around between
those hours late either dead asleep or

210
00:14:15.196 --> 00:14:18.420
they're just about to get up
isn't when on the West Coast lot.

211
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.612
I was like, yeah, that makes
100% sense not technical at all,

212
00:14:21.612 --> 00:14:23.292
I just was just waiting to the west.

213
00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:26.993
He said you just wait to the West Coast,
goes to bed and

214
00:14:26.993 --> 00:14:30.383
then you pull all the data,
that was the answer.

215
00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:34.034
It wasn't a super intricate problem,

216
00:14:34.034 --> 00:14:38.576
sometimes that's not how you solve it,
right?

217
00:14:38.576 --> 00:14:43.321
When you're thinking about these ideals
of how to judge yourself on code,

218
00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:46.106
don't even do that, that's not your job,

219
00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:49.666
your job is their job to judge
you on code, not your job.

220
00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:53.484
Your job is to know that you can solve
any problem when given the right tools.
