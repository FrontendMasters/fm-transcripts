1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.103
And here's another one,

2
00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:08.095
the final one, project based networking.

3
00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.834
If you go, say,
it's on line 42 and networking MD,

4
00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:19.645
project based networking is the one that
really made my claim to fame, right?

5
00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:24.745
I use Vet Sue code, is the project
that I was networking on for

6
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:28.052
the first two years of building it out.

7
00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:30.949
Talking about this app,
talking about the work I was doing.

8
00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.591
Talking about how I was trying to help
people doing these projects doing,

9
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.331
building small projects out on it.

10
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:43.620
Talking about how to leverage GitHub,
things of that nature with it.

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.656
That was my first step, right, of
helping people, of being able to connect

12
00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:54.630
with people and stuff like, this is the
person want to use tech for good, right?

13
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.800
Asking questions like, hey, I'm using
slick carousel, how do I do this better?

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.761
And then they're like, okay, yeah, you do
this thoroughly, and they're like, yo,

15
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.556
this is dopest project,
what are you doing?

16
00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:06.149
Sorry, it was swearing.

17
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.942
This is dope project cuz that's
what the person really said to me.

18
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:13.410
[LAUGH] I was like so,
what are you really doing?

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.420
And I was like,
this is what I'm working on.

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.943
I'm working on helping veterans transition
into technology using software engineering

21
00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:22.141
and working remotely.

22
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:25.768
It was like, that is the coolest
thing ever, how can I help?

23
00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:27.740
Talk to another person about it and
talk to another person.

24
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.203
Built out more things,

25
00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:33.446
talk to verse sale about how some of
the things we're doing next as and

26
00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:38.440
getting advice from them as things like
even as far as close to a year ago, right?

27
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.603
I'm still doing this thing where I
talk to people and I'm like, hey,

28
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.910
here's my project, here's what I wanna do.

29
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.711
What's your advice for how I do this.

30
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:53.113
This is what I've researched,
this is how I've wanted to implement it,

31
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.890
here are my thoughts on this.

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.784
I'm interested in hearing yours since you
are the domain expert in this, right?

33
00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:05.645
And they're talking to you,
they love talking to you about this.

34
00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:09.657
And they are so excited and
then they see the work that you're doing,

35
00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:12.089
they know that things are gonna improve.

36
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.050
The things that you're implementing
is going to help people.

37
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.775
They want to see how can I
get more involved, right?

38
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.785
And that's your cue to get them more
involved, right, and same way with yours.

39
00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:23.749
You go to a project.

40
00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.168
If you build an API, and you like you
talk to somebody else who's a back end

41
00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.533
engineer, you ask them about the API.

42
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:33.001
How do I make a secure API layer?

43
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.844
Is this the best format for my API?

44
00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:41.341
Have I made the right decisions to ensure
that the right type of information

45
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:46.930
will be able to go to somebody or
even worse, not worse, better?

46
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.147
Talk to a frontend about how
would they leverage your API?

47
00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:54.410
What feedback would they do about
your API to be able to talk?

48
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.274
How your API push things to the GUI,
to the front end, right?

49
00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:02.017
They ask them,
if they were to get your API,

50
00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:06.171
do you have the proper documentation and
resources available, so

51
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:09.920
they can understand your API and
utilize that, right?

52
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.405
Now it just collaboration that show
cases on documentation, it showcases,

53
00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:16.410
you are the ones to learn, right?

54
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.038
You could write an API on GitHub,
open discussions and then have

55
00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:26.670
discussions with front ends about your
API to say, how do I leverage that?

56
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.783
And that's all trackable work, right?

57
00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:31.956
And you could talk about
that at a interview.

58
00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:37.262
Now you've created work that
you can talk about, right?

59
00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:40.064
That's how I use projects, right?

60
00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:43.425
I create a thing, I talk about the thing.

61
00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:47.629
Then I try to get feedback on the thing so
I can get closer to my goals of being able

62
00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.348
to end use project to help people,
use project help people get jobs.

63
00:03:51.348 --> 00:03:54.444
If it's not me, someone else I love,
building those networks,

64
00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:57.557
building those relationships so
I help people get jobs, right?

65
00:03:57.557 --> 00:04:03.616
My goal is 1% of all veterans,
ex-military a year by 2027.

66
00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:09.027
And that's like, let's say,
2500 people a year, helping them get jobs.

67
00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:12.501
So I love talking about that with
other people in their life, yo,

68
00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.720
here's my job listings, if you need it.

69
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.050
Here's the job listings I have,
if you need it, right?

70
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.365
Same way with you all,
we're talking about your journeys,

71
00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:22.900
talking about your building front end.

72
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.300
You say, hey, I would love to
build a UI with your backend,

73
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.890
with your API,
is there a way I can look at it?

74
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.481
You ask for case, give you feedback
on how to create the backend or

75
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.962
how to create the API in a manner
that makes sense for frontend.

76
00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:40.723
That's a great way for
you all to start and be able to have that.

77
00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:45.640
Use those projects to network then
you go to another person backend,

78
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.070
go to an engineering manager,
go to a gym young type, right?

79
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.150
And then you go ask questions from them.

80
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.641
That's how that flow starts.

81
00:04:54.641 --> 00:05:00.258
And seeing people, especially,
in your community, you just start here in

82
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:05.542
your community at your meetups or
is there like a Minnesota tech slack?

83
00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:07.220
&gt;&gt; There's a JavaScript.

84
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.744
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so yeah, you start in there and
you start asking the questions that

85
00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:17.492
a Minnesota JavaScript group and you're
like, hey, can someone review this for me.

86
00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:21.630
Can you help me with this, that, and
the third, what's your feedback on this?

87
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.080
And that's how it starts.

88
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.306
The next thing you know, hey,
someone's talking about,

89
00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:31.380
yo, there's this kid that's always
asking good questions all the time.

90
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.479
He's growing and
he executes when you answer his questions.

91
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.426
And he's always in
the open-source community,

92
00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:42.140
seeing where he can volunteer and pull
his weight to give back to the community.

93
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.681
I think that, if we see that person's
resume, we should at least give them a go.

94
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.370
Let's see what they have to say.

95
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.623
Let's see if we can find a good fit for
them, right?

96
00:05:54.623 --> 00:05:56.554
That's how it is done, right?

97
00:05:56.554 --> 00:06:03.316
I have friends who their job was made for
them, right?

98
00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:06.850
Cuz of their networking and
how they use their projects to network or

99
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.004
how they networked at conferences or
how they networked with informationals,

100
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.680
things of that nature, right?

101
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.000
Someone's like, look,
I really like this person.

102
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.260
I know this person's gonna be able
to do and accomplish big things.

103
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.500
I want this person to accomplish
big things with and for me, right?

104
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.511
And that's how it starts.

105
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:28.123
Now the fourth way of
networking that I find funny,

106
00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:33.754
I didn't even put it in here because it's
too funny for me, but I know it works.

107
00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:39.892
Starting a podcast,
that is the funniest way to do it.

108
00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:42.918
But people love talking about themselves.

109
00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:49.026
And they will get on a podcast and
start building a relationship from there,

110
00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:53.730
they'll go from the Maya board member,
Taylor Desean.

111
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.010
He was the one, let me know,
that's how he networks.

112
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.170
He uses his podcast to network and he'll
ask people to come on his podcast and

113
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.082
they'll talk.

114
00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:04.299
He's like, hey,
it worked with you, didn't?

115
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.970
And I was like, yeah, you did work for me.

116
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.030
Okay, okay, well played, well played.

117
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.174
So I know that is the fourth and
final way to network.

118
00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:19.430
But I think it's kind of
ridiculous cuz I was like,

119
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.860
I can't believe that worked on me but
it is what it is.
