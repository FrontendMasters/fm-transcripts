1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.539
All right.

2
00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.841
So now we are in the first
thing that we need to work on.

3
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.593
Now first thing we're going to be focusing
on working on because like we don't

4
00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:12.769
have enough time for your to do your
outline for your brag documents.

5
00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.535
And your branding database, but you take
that, you can make that as a template.

6
00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:24.411
I also have a template for
your resume as well attached to that,

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.473
here's the most difficult yes yet
most simple

8
00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:34.431
part of getting your getting ready for
a job.

9
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:39.798
Your resume is a powerful tool that serves
as a concise summary of your your skills,

10
00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:42.189
expertise and achievements right.

11
00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:46.904
This is gonna be the first thing that
the robot is gonna see you the AI is

12
00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.783
gonna see, HR is going to see
the developers are going to see it's going

13
00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:55.620
to be the fang pass out around
a table everything right?

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.766
So this is very important.

15
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.566
The purpose of these purpose
primary purpose is to

16
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.231
provide a snapshot a professional history,
or

17
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.911
how that professional history correlates
with the industry trying to break into.

18
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:13.671
It's very important to remember
when you're looking at your job,

19
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:18.929
your job history and seeing where can I,
even though it's not technical,

20
00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.705
where can I pull the technical
components and technical parts out?

21
00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.006
That's very important, right?

22
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.381
When I was first interviewing and
I was like.

23
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:34.044
There's nothing about my jobs or
my industry or

24
00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:38.817
anything like that that could
help me become a technologist.

25
00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:42.035
I was like, this is going to suck.

26
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:46.008
Then I started learning more
about tech and learning and

27
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.552
doing this one on one correlation.

28
00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:53.010
My military experience had lots of things
that helped me become a technologist.

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.279
Lots of, my degree in criminal justice,
lots of things to help me with technology,

30
00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.179
understanding patterns, right,
that's a very important thing in criminal

31
00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.857
justice and forensics, right,
understanding, picking up the clues and

32
00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:11.671
being able to put those together,
that's very important.

33
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:15.546
Have you ever debug code that isn't yours?

34
00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:20.253
It is the exact same thing as
trying to solve a murder loop

35
00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:24.775
the same thing except there's
no bad guys at the end.

36
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:28.399
But that I mean, the one on one
correlation was there and I was like, wow,

37
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.756
I can I can do this because
I've done that part.

38
00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:35.491
So this part, probably a little less
stress, except I'm using semi-colon,

39
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.110
everything goes bye-bye, but
that's what you want to do.

40
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.990
You wanna have it as your primary purpose,
as a snapshot of your professional history

41
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.719
and how it correlates with
where you want to go.

42
00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.985
Alright, the structure of your resume.

43
00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:57.171
Typically it is structured as
a format of sections, right?

44
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:01.686
So you have your contact information,
professional summary or objective,

45
00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:05.859
work experience, education,
skills, achievements, and awards.

46
00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.820
These are the core parts of your,
of every resume.

47
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.042
Now they don't have to be in that order
the two that has to be mandatory up top

48
00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:19.279
should be your professional summary
should be your contact information.

49
00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.818
Those two should be up top.

50
00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:26.068
Now with your professional summary
that is also a place you should

51
00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:31.615
be putting the key words for the resume or
for the job in there as well.

52
00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:35.831
You need to make sure you write your
professional summary in a manner where

53
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.739
keywords are interchangeable.

54
00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.354
Right.

55
00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:43.868
So now that we've done that, if you
look at the if you look at the template

56
00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:47.350
that if you could pull it up,
that would be fine as well.

57
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.075
I don't need it.

58
00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:49.742
I actually know this part.

59
00:03:49.742 --> 00:03:54.402
I don't like the back of my head
because I've yelled at more than enough

60
00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.732
people about this.

61
00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:58.836
You go to README, the README.md,

62
00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:04.430
there should be your resume at the bottom,
and your resources.

63
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.356
It's a template.

64
00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.646
You can export it as markdown, HTML, PDF.

65
00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.732
You can edit it however you want to.

66
00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:12.609
So as you see, the top.

67
00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.230
Professional summary, contact information.

68
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.292
That's the only two places you should
have your contact information, right?

69
00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.331
I mean, the only place you should have it,
professional summary.

70
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:24.181
Professional summary is where
you should be interchanging

71
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.180
the keywords based upon what's in a job.

72
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.767
Make sure your professional
summary actually matches.

73
00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:35.010
Actually it's worded in a manner where you
can switch out keywords as needed, right?

74
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.983
So now we get into that
work experience background.

75
00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:43.756
I always put the work experience first
cuz that's usually the hardest part,

76
00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:48.017
especially if you're a non traditional
programmer coming from like

77
00:04:48.017 --> 00:04:52.070
an entrepreneur science background or
bootcamp or self taught.

78
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.064
That's the part where you tend to like
need to focus on how do I correlate

79
00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.895
my current my job paths for

80
00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:03.159
where I want to go to say this is
why I should be able to do this.

81
00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.085
So I always put that first.

82
00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:08.308
Unless I'm coming from
a CS degree background,

83
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.754
then I put education first, right?

84
00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:11.875
Yes?

85
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.687
&gt;&gt; How about writing accomplishments and
positions?

86
00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:21.499
Is it okay if I have 10 lines or should I,
in the last two positions, is that okay?

87
00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.405
&gt;&gt; 10 lines of accomplishments
in the last two positions?

88
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:25.835
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

89
00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:29.033
&gt;&gt; I try to keep it up to like
three have between three to five.

90
00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:33.198
But if you don't if you're lighten other
ones by all means, you know go for broke.

91
00:05:33.198 --> 00:05:34.918
&gt;&gt; Another question.

92
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:39.697
In the context of the job hunt is
finding your targets before you do your

93
00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:44.487
reconnaissance like job titles
are a meaningless phrase of strings.

94
00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:48.456
So how do you find things
that are appropriate for you

95
00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:51.119
&gt;&gt; well if I'm on LinkedIn always looking

96
00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.029
for say you you've never
had a job in tech.

97
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.781
I am going to look for entry level
to less than a year of experience

98
00:05:58.781 --> 00:06:02.127
I'm going to first focus
on the experience.

99
00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:05.274
Then I'm gonna focus on the skills
that are strong, your strongest and

100
00:06:05.274 --> 00:06:06.066
you said Python.

101
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:10.927
So I'm gonna look for entry level
two years of experience with Python.

102
00:06:10.927 --> 00:06:13.609
I know that for
a fact you've said already,

103
00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:16.518
you're starting your undergraduate career.

104
00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:18.176
So I know you've been to college at this.

105
00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:22.600
So they may be looking for
college degree but also maybe looking for

106
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.869
equivalent work.

107
00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:28.923
So I'm going to look for
them to explicitly say college degree or

108
00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:31.647
equivalent experience, right?

109
00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:35.245
Because you actually gain your experience
of writing Python while in college.

110
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:39.668
So if your degree may not match computer
science, I still know that you have like

111
00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:42.520
an analytical mathematics based degree,
right?

112
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.143
So these are like the three
things I'm looking for

113
00:06:46.143 --> 00:06:51.327
before I'm even going into anything
else about this company, right.

114
00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:55.011
So like that's how I that's
how I break it down.

115
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:58.016
I'm always looking for the you know
like say it's like forensics right.

116
00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:02.772
It's like looking at the clues of
like like you know a crime scene like

117
00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:05.970
you know so
you have to look at your strengths.

118
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.574
So first, I guess that's how I look at
it first, first look at your strengths.

119
00:07:10.574 --> 00:07:14.338
And then do your reconnaissance
based upon your strengths, right?

120
00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:17.255
Like so
because it said that's what I gather.

121
00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:20.290
Speaking to you, I think we spoke your
intro was maybe five minutes long and

122
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.615
under five minutes like 3040 seconds long,
right?

123
00:07:22.615 --> 00:07:24.518
But just based upon those 3040 seconds.

124
00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:27.788
That's how I would look for a job for you.

125
00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:29.769
That's where I would start, right?

126
00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.809
And then as I would go deeper,
that's why I was like,

127
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.986
I really wanna get a one-on-one
with this gentleman so

128
00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:38.635
that way I can see exactly
where he needs to go.

129
00:07:38.635 --> 00:07:41.513
And how he needs to search and
how to be strategic for that, right?

130
00:07:41.513 --> 00:07:46.940
So that's just a quick overview
of how I would do that.
