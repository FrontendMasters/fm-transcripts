00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.082
So as a developer,
your GitHub profile is essential to,

2
00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.639
your professional brand, right?

3
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.705
The harsh reality is that even
a person that doesn't know anything

4
00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:16.415
about GitHub ie the user number
two is gonna go there, right?

5
00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:21.193
And they're gonna judge you based upon
the most arbitrary things on your GitHub.

6
00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:24.215
Hey, guess what, I don't see a user image.

7
00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.065
Hey, I don't see a GitHub profile Read me.

8
00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:28.622
I don't see any pan projects.

9
00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:34.738
I don't see anything that showcases that
you're native to this platform, right?

10
00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:37.924
And this person doesn't write code at all,
right?

11
00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:42.492
The AI, ATS systems, the chat bots,
the things that are gonna be checking,

12
00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.884
the links that are,
the HRAI tools that check the links.

13
00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:50.636
And then can actually pick up
how many repos do you have and

14
00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:55.292
does this specialized repo exist and
things like that.

15
00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.134
They're gonna judge you too, right?

16
00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:58.977
You're gonna get flagged for those things.

17
00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:04.644
So you have to pay special attention,
as a programmer,

18
00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:09.468
we're told that the resume
is the first thing if

19
00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:14.787
you're gonna build your
build a opinion about you.

20
00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:19.661
For me I can't get into finance
like it's gonna be the third,

21
00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:24.443
the first thing that people tend
to build opinion about you is

22
00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:28.504
your portfolio, I mean,
is your GitHub profile.

23
00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:32.805
That's what I've seen like I myself,
I build totally biased,

24
00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:37.503
I build it like I will formulate half
of my opinion on a programmer based

25
00:01:37.503 --> 00:01:41.584
upon what I see on their GitHub,
like immediately, right?

26
00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:45.339
When applying for jobs and employers, they
have reviewed GitHub talking about that.

27
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:49.623
So let's look at what I view
started with my own and

28
00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:53.091
then I move over to someone else's as a,

29
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.798
at least a strong professional
read profile, right?

30
00:01:57.798 --> 00:02:02.433
So this is my profile,
this is my legit, this is me, who I am,

31
00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.680
that's my face right there.

32
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.035
Hi, I'm Jerome,
Executive Director of Vets Who Code.

33
00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:11.906
I have a link here from
my Versale project.

34
00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:15.665
It shows how many times people
have looked at my profile.

35
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:19.644
I've also been putting on
another link from this,

36
00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:22.796
if you were to go here and
look at the raw.

37
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:28.788
I'm pulling these links in where
I've attached them to my GitHub,

38
00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:33.727
so that way you can see these
GitHub trophy versale app,

39
00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:39.004
put my username, as well as the label for
my profile views.

40
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.476
Both of those are separate projects.

41
00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:44.776
And I'm pulling in the,
connect it to my GitHub app, so

42
00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:49.176
that people can see now what
I've done in these, right?

43
00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:52.887
So here I am, I have, hey, I jumped up,

44
00:02:52.887 --> 00:02:56.943
a lot of y'all looking, okay, no stress.

45
00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:01.400
Multi language, I guess there might
be some like PHP still in there.

46
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.224
Followers, some hyper celebrity.

47
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.686
I don't know what that
means in GitHub land.

48
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:12.580
[LAUGH] Repositories issues,
pull requests, commits, reviews and stars.

49
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.789
So this is all like the little trophies
that they have out there on that API.

50
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.418
I'm telling people what I'm
currently what I'm working on,

51
00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:25.457
what I'm currently doing,
currently recording Frontend masters,

52
00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:29.167
currently learning Azure AI services,
AWS Amplify, Python.

53
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:33.755
I'm recording nothing next because
I am gonna be potty training duty

54
00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.455
starting next week with my one year old.

55
00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:39.593
Always looking for
help with Vets Who Code.

56
00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:44.318
The things that people have asked me
about is Git, React Next JS, AI tools and

57
00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:49.425
getting a software engineering job which
you all are here for it, yay, all right?

58
00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:54.150
So connect with me, I tend to leave
blank because 8 billion people will

59
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.376
reach out to me in an 8
billion ways all the time,

60
00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:02.053
I have like 40 messages right now
on LinkedIn alone because of this.

61
00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:07.421
So [LAUGH] I'm like, you'll figure out
how to find me, I don't have to say this.

62
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.710
Languages and tools,
these are languages and

63
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.188
tools that I still use to this day,
either teaching or at work.

64
00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.410
So that's why they're all on here.

65
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.182
The only reason Ruby on Rails and
SaaS on here is because I use it.

66
00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:26.195
PHP probably should get off there
cuz I don't wanna get paid for it.

67
00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:31.383
Postgres, MySQL, that's a great hardware

68
00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:36.851
tool that I've used for
the lights at my house.

69
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.446
So basically when the pandemic
started I use if this and that and

70
00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:44.653
Node.js to make a project with Arduino, so

71
00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:49.679
that my lights would have a party
mode that would attach to Spotify and

72
00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.792
our Philips Hughes, and they would
just be like a disco on birthdays,

73
00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:58.894
because it couldn't go anywhere,
we're all at home.

74
00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:01.660
And it was a golfer to kids.

75
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.009
Yes, sir?

76
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.395
&gt;&gt; Do you have any thoughts
on using real photos versus,

77
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:10.226
like Avatar [INAUDIBLE] Github??

78
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:15.811
&gt;&gt; Well, for my pro Gityhub profile,

79
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:19.355
I have my actual face.

80
00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.892
I don't have opinions against it.

81
00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:25.366
I think it's weird unless it's
a part of your personality.

82
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.694
Or maybe you have like a drawn version,
cuz I've seen that and

83
00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:29.854
those are very cool.

84
00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:31.564
And I'm like, yo, that's awesome.

85
00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:34.753
I mean, I don't think people would
think one thing or the other.

86
00:05:34.753 --> 00:05:36.263
It's just it's a part of your brand,
right?

87
00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:40.277
Just don't, so yeah,
I'm not against it, I mean,

88
00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:45.096
I prefer showing my real face
on this this, especially GitHub,

89
00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:48.591
GitHub is not just for
jobs, social, right?

90
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:53.703
You're building relationship on GitHub,
your followers, the people you follow,

91
00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:58.470
GitHub discussions, GitHub issues,
going into these open source projects.

92
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.254
So it helps to know how that person looks
like as they're talking to you, right?

93
00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:06.031
Or you're talking to them.

94
00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:11.213
Here, I have most used languages,
which is Java.

95
00:06:11.213 --> 00:06:14.736
So 9% of my projects, my code is PHP, so

96
00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:20.200
it is still there somewhere,
I haven't gotten rid of all of it.

97
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.047
Ruby on Rails, CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

98
00:06:25.047 --> 00:06:29.601
So I mean, maybe if I was using like those
ratings that you all talking about and

99
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:33.607
say how much of each language I have
written, that would make sense.

100
00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:38.638
But I wouldn't do that,
just don't rate yourself

101
00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:45.784
on your performance on your own code
on your resumes or your portfolios.

102
00:06:45.784 --> 00:06:50.658
My GitHub stats and my total
contributions, that's all a part of

103
00:06:50.658 --> 00:06:55.367
the special profile special
readme call your profile readme.

104
00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:59.151
So for
mines is JeromeHardaway\JeromeHardaway.

105
00:06:59.151 --> 00:06:59.922
For yours,

106
00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:04.789
it will be the name of your GitHub name
backslash your GitHub name, right?

107
00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.916
So I go here,
mine is JeromeHardaway\JeromeHardaway.

108
00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:14.047
So whatever your GitHub profile name is,
that is your GitHub profile,

109
00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:17.820
the backslash of it again
is gonna GoitHub profile.

110
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.832
As you see, it lets you know that it
is a special a special repository.

111
00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:28.505
It's one of two special repos
that you can have that and

112
00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:34.056
the funding, YAML for
if you're being sponsored for

113
00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:39.006
open source projects,
things of that nature.

114
00:07:39.006 --> 00:07:44.500
So I definitely recommend you
look build that look into it.

115
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.730
And they have generators
out there as well,

116
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.706
they can help you expedite building
it out or you can build it out with

117
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:57.529
JS old school HTML CSS,
a little bit of JavaScript and Markdown.
