1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.930
So now let's look at
this portfolio checklist.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.275
Now I really want you all to go,
especially for

3
00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:08.900
those who are looking to push thing
live to the web and back in engineer.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.840
You two over here,
there are some things in here,

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.560
they're very important to you, right?

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.019
So we have the most obvious,
the first one where we're talking about,

7
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.260
I'm using clean code, your code.

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.739
When I say clean code,
what I am referring to,

9
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.131
particularly if you're
using a framework or

10
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:33.682
something is your code needs to be
maintainable, readable, scalable.

11
00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:39.114
What that means is that when I talk about,
when I look at your code,

12
00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:45.710
I'm able to buy the naming conventions to
have some idea of what that code can do.

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.230
Maintainable you're not having all your
code, you're not having a 500 line file,

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.560
of course it does four or
five different things.

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.278
This file has not the code for
it to do one thing and

16
00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:02.294
one thing well and
to be brought into another place.

17
00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:08.490
Be able to be utilized elsewhere in
other parts of your code base, right?

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.596
A maintainable, so
when I say about maintainable, alrl ight,

19
00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:12.987
let's say it's backward.

20
00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:16.740
It needs to be backwards compatible or
it needs to change to some way like that.

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.354
You've written it in a format to
where if I add a console log or

22
00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:27.660
make a change somewhere, it's not gonna
break your entire code piece, right?

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.556
So think of it as conceptualize it in the
format of how React components are done,

24
00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:38.501
but everywhere that ideology that
react has with the components was

25
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:43.290
actually my first time seeing it
was not in React but was in Rails.

26
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.805
They believed a lot of real good
rails devs they believe that

27
00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:52.790
you're code should be small your
code do you wanna be in one file.

28
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.620
They were like, shouldn't you be more than
one program to help me shouldn't be more

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.244
than like 30 lines of code in that file
and that coach only do one thing well, and

30
00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:05.630
then you make those files or
files or CO work together.

31
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.002
Think of this function, does one thing
as all the things supposed to do.

32
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:15.173
Now I can make it do multiple
versions of one thing, but

33
00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:19.347
it still does this one thing
well right versus a 9 I've

34
00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:24.157
seen nightmare codebases where
like is one JavaScript file and

35
00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:27.807
it's 2000 lines of code and you're like.

36
00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:31.062
Wow, does this person not love themself?

37
00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:35.708
[LAUGH]
And now I have to work days, and so

38
00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:39.687
I don't love myself so here we are,
two people that need therapy.

39
00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:42.533
[LAUGH] Yeah, so we helped you.

40
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.925
&gt;&gt; So, kinda segregation of concerns,
yes, separation of concerns.

41
00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:49.560
[INAUDIBLE] log in,
might have one little piece just was

42
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.390
logging into the Program or
&gt;&gt; one thing doing just a little bit of

43
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.830
logic another part so if it's login
let's say for instance you're off and

44
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.729
login section your office section is for
logging in.

45
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.316
And you have you want to use multiple
different ways logging analysts so

46
00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:11.066
you wanna use apple you
wanna use Google and

47
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.905
Facebook I guess those
are big three right?

48
00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:16.925
People use Apple, Google Facebook for
authentication, right?

49
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:22.154
So you have that file, there handles
login, but you also handles those

50
00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:26.961
three they haven't clearly named or
showcase which one it uses.

51
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.425
Here's apple off here is
Google off here is FB off and

52
00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:37.210
which parts of authentication
trailed is that it's focusing on and

53
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:44.026
you're just using those functions as
needed right but that one file does that.

54
00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:48.279
So that's what I mean by clean,
clean code, right?

55
00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:49.109
Yes, Ma'am.

56
00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.175
&gt;&gt; Could you speak about
the scalable piece of that?

57
00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:53.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.

58
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.878
So scalable essentially what I mean by
that is you're able to make you able to

59
00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:00.746
make the work scale,
you're able to make the,

60
00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:04.760
you've written your code in a manner
that where you can expand it,

61
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.925
make it larger, like say
&gt;&gt; He's off once again in his piece of off

62
00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:13.466
code right let's say there is a new
form of authentication he wants to add.

63
00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:17.836
Let's say he wants to add WhatsApp for
to FA or or just or

64
00:04:17.836 --> 00:04:22.967
another two FA authentication format for
his authentication.

65
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:28.639
Now we can scale it, we can extend that
to add this to f a factor for it to sin,

66
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.329
a sin it takes if a user chooses to send
a text message for this piece of code.

67
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:38.420
Here we go right here, but
that's still in its authentication.

68
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.363
But it's two factor like it's a new,

69
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.600
it's a new feature that he's
added within this code, right?

70
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.170
So that's what we were referring
to making it scalable.

71
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.815
Using version control, now,
when it comes to learning how to code,

72
00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:54.320
people use GitHub to just
to store their stuff.

73
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.263
When it comes to learning how
to code professionally to a job,

74
00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:04.111
I want you to think of using
version control as a magnifier and

75
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.410
amplifier for your career.

76
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.370
All right.

77
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.680
So what I'm saying is this is that one,

78
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.301
you should find someone to collaborate
with anyone that you'd be on your level

79
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:20.570
it'd be a little bit higher does matter
but have someone to collaborate with.

80
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.822
Two, what you should be doing is when
you're doing your version control,

81
00:05:24.822 --> 00:05:28.870
you're your primary branch,
anything new you're building.

82
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.460
You're going to check out a new branch and
you're going to build your

83
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.893
feature on that branch Then when
you push that feature branch up and

84
00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:42.564
you're done with that feature,
you're going to have the person that

85
00:05:42.564 --> 00:05:47.631
you're collaborating with do a PR and
They're going to review your code And

86
00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:51.650
then only after they look at that code and
say that is good.

87
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.682
You're going to put that back into your
feature branch I mean to your primary

88
00:05:55.682 --> 00:05:56.940
branch.

89
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.145
Now I know you're thinking that is
a lot of work for free for you know for

90
00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:05.940
free when I'm not doing us on a project
and I'm that I'm not going to pay it off.

91
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.770
See, that's exactly the point.

92
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.969
You want to show that to an employer that
you already have these practices in place,

93
00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:13.500
right?

94
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.990
And you don't have to do
that on every project.

95
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.858
You can do it only on your portfolio
right where that's where they're gonna be

96
00:06:19.858 --> 00:06:24.579
looking at and viewing the most and
you wanna that's where you wanna show all

97
00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:27.920
of this height of like your
work you want to show this.

98
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.694
Project border how I plan this portfolio
you wanna show this form of how I've

99
00:06:32.694 --> 00:06:37.020
done this then the theory,
you wanna show these these PR branches and

100
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.230
all of this like collaboration,
so that way when you say it.

101
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.966
They can see it and, you know,
they you know it, that connection.

102
00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.144
This person did see on their resume,
they collaborated on this and

103
00:06:48.144 --> 00:06:50.890
they've done a lot of PR and
things of this nature.

104
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.321
And they pull tickets and created issues.

105
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:56.669
I'm like, wow, you did,
this person did all this, okay.

106
00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:02.185
So this person actually knows how to
code and as a unit with other people.

107
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:03.740
I like that, that's nice.

108
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.274
I wanna hire this person at least
talk to this person, right?

109
00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:08.670
That's what you want, right?

110
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.560
So, yes.

111
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.670
&gt;&gt; So I'm kind of curious.

112
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.557
Are there any projects that are, like,
it is worse to do them badly than

113
00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:24.120
not at all if you don't check off
all these boxes on, like, good Git.

114
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.317
Good habits or this project is like
a little bit messy in the code base.

115
00:07:29.317 --> 00:07:34.205
&gt;&gt; I don't believe I believe that
there are projects that are meant for

116
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:36.101
different things right.

117
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:41.307
One thing that you see all the time
is a JavaScript calculator JavaScript

118
00:07:41.307 --> 00:07:46.470
calculators teach you good crud,
good fundamentals on JavaScript.

119
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.610
That's what it's focused on.

120
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.560
It is not a project that is designed
to be on your portfolio, though.

121
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.000
That is a skill builder project, right?

122
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.940
Not a portfolio project.

123
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.555
What I would consider a portfolio
project is like making a miniature.

124
00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:06.455
Like,you know, social network or

125
00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:11.490
making a small like Markdown
editor of some sort, right?

126
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.344
Like something like that that people can
use and you can push to the web and people

127
00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:21.416
can use, but I don't view I don't believe
there is such thing as like projects that

128
00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:26.416
are worse than doing it unless you use or
project and inappropriately It right like

129
00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:31.420
me putting a JavaScript calculator on my
portfolio is a portfolio project that's

130
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:37.050
inappropriate format of using that project
because that project is a skill builder.

131
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.934
Everybody is dealing with one
of those at this timeframe.

132
00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.540
Just you know, day and age.

133
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.378
It's not there's only so much you so
many different ways you can do a,

134
00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:50.314
you know, JavaScript calculator
these days, right But

135
00:08:50.314 --> 00:08:55.726
let's say on your portfolio on a project
because we're talking about node and

136
00:08:55.726 --> 00:09:01.340
like, you know, we're doing front end and
back end, and a cloud engineer.

137
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.490
So you're using Azure, you've pushed
a chat bot to your to your website and

138
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:14.750
you have so you have a chat app on your on
your website, you know, using psycho node.

139
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:20.057
And you know Azure or AWS or
ledger gave it a handle on that data so

140
00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:23.963
now that is a project that
you can look small but

141
00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:29.173
you can actually talk about on
your portfolio because You have

142
00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:33.983
its push live,
it's interacting directly with users,

143
00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:38.820
and you're showcasing like
solving a problem, right?

144
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.723
I used to have a chatbot on my first
project using Socket.iloin node

145
00:09:43.723 --> 00:09:47.507
because I wanted to be able
to talk directly to people

146
00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:52.530
that went to my portfolio
when I was like 2015, 2016.

147
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.170
I want to talk to them directly.

148
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.210
If they had questions.

149
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.257
And I knew that if someone saw a chat
bot bubble that clicked that bubble and

150
00:09:59.257 --> 00:10:01.940
if they wanted,
they would see if it would work.

151
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.420
And then I'm like, Hey, how are you doing?

152
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.880
I'm actually doing this.

153
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.398
I would even take pictures and

154
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:09.240
upload it where I was at at
the time just to show people.

155
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.170
so that you know this actually works
right so like that is where you know

156
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.870
that's where the you know the thinking
of projects comes into play
