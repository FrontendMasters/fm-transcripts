1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.175
Okay, so after we get done with putting
our education on, now that's when we

2
00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:10.230
start putting our projects that you
following along on the resume template.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.050
Now, we start putting our achievements,
our projects.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.730
No, I think there's a languages
component as well, right?

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.980
So here we have this, we have our skills.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.720
So this is where keywords play again,
right?

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.001
You have your native
programming language and

8
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.190
then you have what you're also
getting with technical writing, right?

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.171
This is where you want to put those
keywords in if in case you have to

10
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.170
be that person to put all
the different keywords in.

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.920
You wanna have different resumes out
here in these streets, that's cool.

12
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.650
And you have a secondary skill.

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.625
I always have a secondary skill because
I just feel like that really makes you

14
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.410
stand out.

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.486
Secondary skill that isn't as technical
but not technical especially as a junior.

16
00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:03.873
Cuz you need to learn and
writing especially on paper,

17
00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:09.845
that makes it easier for
you to understand things as well as,

18
00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:16.071
is the easiest point of entry for
open source sharing, right?

19
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:18.613
Or putting or
implementing things open source,

20
00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:21.033
joining an open source project and
like that.

21
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.556
The seniors,
they don't wanna document anything, right?

22
00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:28.722
So the juniors going in,
helping with the documentation, that is

23
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:35.289
low hanging fruit on helping bolster your
contributions for open source projects.

24
00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.601
Which is why I always recommend technical
writing, learning about writing

25
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.994
blog posts, things like that to junior
developers because it's very easy.

26
00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:48.142
The higher people get, the less they wanna
write even though the more they should

27
00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:52.537
be writing, so that is something that you
as a junior should definitely be breaking,

28
00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:53.348
running into.

29
00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:00.980
We also have articles and talks, right?

30
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.315
So this is where I put all of my,
it's kinda like my awards and

31
00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:07.730
achievements area, okay?

32
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.096
So I'm talking about,
here's my articles, here's my talks,

33
00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.690
here's everything I've done.

34
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.828
All these are made up.

35
00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:18.698
I had ChatGPT, I said, give me eight
conversations that don't exist,

36
00:02:18.698 --> 00:02:22.270
blog posts that don't exist and
this is it.

37
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.213
I don't even know what Passport.JS is,
don't ask me, I wouldn't know.

38
00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:31.300
I said we've talked about
the education component.

39
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.847
You see I have
a Software Engineering Bootcamp.

40
00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:39.901
I have the bootcamp provider, the city,
country, what you complete it,

41
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:43.523
and those are the type of
bullets that I have for this.

42
00:02:43.523 --> 00:02:48.965
Where I'm saying, where I gained, what
I developed, how I collaborate it, what

43
00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:54.753
did I explore, what did I participate in,
especially if you're in a modern bootcamp.

44
00:02:54.753 --> 00:02:58.160
Participating in code reviews
is very important, right?

45
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.200
They should be having you do that by now.

46
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.974
If you're not, and you're looking for that
experience, you shouldn't be having people

47
00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:08.204
review your code as a part of process and
learning how to code.

48
00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.890
Interviewing your colleagues,
your friends, right?

49
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.661
That's something that if you're not doing
right now, you can add this to your resume

50
00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:19.780
and then start doing it immediately and
just hey, can you review my code?

51
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.170
That's a great way to network, right?

52
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
Hey, I respect going into somebody
that you follow on Twitter.

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.550
I respect your opinion.

54
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.660
I would like it if I could
have you review my code.

55
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.921
Can I give you access to a PR and
have you as an assignee?

56
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.120
It's simple, no one says, you respect me?

57
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.300
Sure, I'll do this.

58
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.070
Let me, I got 10 minutes.

59
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.230
It's cool, I'll do this over lunch.

60
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.297
It's all right, and then they telling
their friends, they're like, yo,

61
00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:53.099
this person hit me up on Twitter and
asked me to review their code, yo.

62
00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.595
Cuz I'm big brain, you little brain,
it's cool cuz that's what programmers,

63
00:03:57.595 --> 00:03:59.300
they talk smack to each other.

64
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.502
&gt;&gt; How about writing skills colon and
then list of skills like JavaScript,

65
00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:10.710
HTML, CSS, TypeScript,
Python, C++ and common node.

66
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.270
&gt;&gt; Essentially just a skill,
where it lists on here, I've seen it.

67
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:24.310
I'm against it cuz I want the language
to flow in resumes, right?

68
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.250
I want to write a resume as
if I'm speaking to a human.

69
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.554
So having human centric language,

70
00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:35.780
it matters to me because I know that
eventually a human's gonna see this.

71
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.106
And I don't want to just have a bunch of,
here's the skills I did, but no,

72
00:04:40.106 --> 00:04:41.830
I'm proficient in this.

73
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.010
I've used this in these type of projects,
right?

74
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.770
I want to make sure that I am
showing the how and the why.

75
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.316
And not just, yeah, I'm proficient
at HTML, and that's a skill of mine.

76
00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:55.288
And I don't even know,
I'm not gonna tell you why.

77
00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:58.293
&gt;&gt; So it might help with the ATS and
the key word thing but

78
00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:02.547
it might be a turn off for a human reader
when it gets past that first level?

79
00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:07.846
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, but also the ATS's
are trained on LLM 's now, right?

80
00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:10.762
So for LLM means Large Language Model, so

81
00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:14.690
its looking at it from
a human centric level, right?

82
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.633
So if you just have the skills out
there just spewed out like that,

83
00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:23.580
what's gonna happen is, it's also looking
for the how and the whys, looking for

84
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.110
the structure coming from that, right?

85
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.357
So you have to think about that.

86
00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:36.549
Well, everybody's adding
LLMs to their processes now.

87
00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:41.661
You just assume that the thing that
you're about to use has ChatGPT,

88
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:45.629
OpenAI competitor baked
into it because that's what

89
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.818
everybody's doing right now as we speak.

90
00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:54.192
Its kinda like the MSBuild is going on
right now, by the end of this workshop and

91
00:05:54.192 --> 00:05:59.580
by the time this gets on air, half of Edge
is gonna be like ChatGPT and Open AI.

92
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.260
So it's gonna be, it's a crazy,
wild new world out there.

93
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.605
So just assume that it's
gonna be human centric,

94
00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:11.199
large language models baked
into these ATS systems.

95
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.220
And 10 points for
bringing up ATS system on in here.

96
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.826
Most of times I bring that up and the
people just, the eyes glaze, you just use

97
00:06:21.826 --> 00:06:26.320
it, you're like, what, no I don't wanna
talk about the hard stuff anymore.

98
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.720
Yeah, bro in here,
at the very tail of my education.

99
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.148
I'm very happy I did this cuz I was
literally thinking about certifications.

100
00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:43.537
Someone asked me about certifications,

101
00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.617
this is exactly what I would
do with a certification.

102
00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:50.538
And these are the types of certifications
that I will look for, AWS,

103
00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:54.620
Google Cloud Platform,
we're talking about cloud computing.

104
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.400
This is what I would do.

105
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.369
This is how I would do it because that's
the only certification that I recommend

106
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.010
being put on your resume.

107
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.120
Those that are in correlation with
direct company toolings, right?

108
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.065
So Cloudflare,
Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure,

109
00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.810
those, they get my blessing.

110
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.680
Some random web development certificate
from, I don't know, Udemy or something.

111
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.537
Not hating, but don't put it on there.

112
00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.823
So, yes.

113
00:07:26.823 --> 00:07:32.086
&gt;&gt; I just wanna echo your secondary
skill on technical writing and

114
00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:34.080
how you put that there.

115
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.200
I think that's incredibly important.

116
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.832
And if you can learn a concept and
then communicate your understanding,

117
00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:47.150
even if there's a million blog
articles about the same thing.

118
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.334
But if you put it up on dev.to or
a Hashnode or something like that,

119
00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:55.970
I guarantee employers are gonna see
that and see that you can actually take

120
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.630
a technical concept and understand it and
then also communicate it.

121
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.355
&gt;&gt; Yes sir.
&gt;&gt; On LinkedIn if I have certifications

122
00:08:03.355 --> 00:08:08.870
from Udemy and stuff like that, should I
remove those, are those making me look?

123
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.626
&gt;&gt; No, let's see LinkedIn.

124
00:08:11.626 --> 00:08:14.287
Here's a secret that I probably,

125
00:08:14.287 --> 00:08:18.892
I'm not gonna get fired cuz they
don't pay me so but [LAUGH].

126
00:08:18.892 --> 00:08:22.536
So, I have this term I've been using for

127
00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:27.901
a few years called LinkedIn
engine optimization, right?

128
00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:34.321
So I treat LinkedIn like its
own search system, right,

129
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:39.796
like I would treat Google,
Bing, any of that.

130
00:08:39.796 --> 00:08:45.461
Now what I have noticed in my
experience with LinkedIn is that when

131
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:52.390
the certifications come from LinkedIn,
your rankings on jobs get higher.

132
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.098
The opportunities go faster
versus the certifications

133
00:08:57.098 --> 00:09:00.410
that don't correlate with LinkedIn.

134
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.037
I've done this myself cuz I
have access to it through as

135
00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:08.760
a veteran where I would
intentionally go and

136
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.692
get certifications from
the LinkedIn Learning courses,

137
00:09:13.692 --> 00:09:20.636
put them on my LinkedIn just to see the
job opportunities raised significantly and

138
00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:27.310
jet the opportunities that are being
approached to me differently, right?

139
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:33.180
So, certifications on LinkedIn,
I'm not gonna say no.

140
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.235
I am gonna say, if you are gonna
put certifications on LinkedIn,

141
00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:41.812
I would recommend you actually use
LinkedIn Learning certifications for

142
00:09:41.812 --> 00:09:46.413
those, just because it's going to
help you rank higher in their system.
