1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.855
Now pinned projects, they're for me,
now I know I'm in a unique position,

2
00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:11.724
I have projects that are actually being
used and that people are using today.

3
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:18.429
My rules for a pinned project is
project has to be operational,

4
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.110
as in,
it has to be running live somewhere or

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.285
someone can view it as a demo.

6
00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:28.651
The markdown has to be manicured, right?

7
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:34.315
So when I say markdown has to be
manicured, if I go to this pin project,

8
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:40.849
I have everything, I have descriptions,
how to get started, pre-quisites.

9
00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:42.910
How to install it, testing,

10
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.537
all of the things needed to
successfully run the project, right?

11
00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:53.626
Also you can customize your pins,

12
00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:58.530
you can add more,
I can add this one to it, right?

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.712
And then, there you go.

14
00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:09.188
Now I have six with it,
which is the highest number you can go.

15
00:01:09.188 --> 00:01:14.663
So now that I have this one,
and I have the OG course,

16
00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:20.014
now I'm gonna use those
images from the OG course,

17
00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:23.761
I will put them on this one, [LAUGH].

18
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:28.375
All right, yeah, so
that is how I always pin those.

19
00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:33.485
Now for me, this is how,
when I look at things, this is how I like

20
00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:38.598
having my view for my reviews and
stuff, because I'm senior and

21
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:43.450
I'm more on a conversational
level when it comes to things.

22
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.101
I've been in the tech industry for
a minute.

23
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:49.875
So, you can't tell the whole story
of my code just by contributions.

24
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:54.288
So when you're looking at,
I like this graph that shows, yeah,

25
00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.870
I've been across three code spaces.

26
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.387
I've contributed to 33 repos, but

27
00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:05.051
these are the ones I've contributed to the
most, where my commits and code reviews,

28
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.871
and issues and pull requests are going,
like, I'm pushing code.

29
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.349
So it looks,
50% of the time he's pushing code,

30
00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.376
30% of the times he's doing code reviews.

31
00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:19.108
So 80% of the time he's either pushing
code or reviewing somebody's code.

32
00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:23.988
And then only 9% is pull requests,
that's because I'm writing code or

33
00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:27.844
pushing code on somebody
else's branch versus mine, and

34
00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:30.617
just showcase problems with solutions.

35
00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:35.701
So 11% is issues, and I'm able to,
it gives my users, so

36
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:41.686
I give people that are reviewing my
stuff a more complete story versus,

37
00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:46.698
hey, you only have 179
contributions in the last year.

38
00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:51.920
Yeah, but that's because, I support almost
100 people a year in getting into tech and

39
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.444
stuff like that, right?

40
00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:57.565
So that's where I am doing the shows,
the work that I've done.

41
00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:02.747
I actually created this,
I wish I had time to show this,

42
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.738
but there's a copilot for PRs.

43
00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:10.805
And it's amazing, I love it,
it automatically makes PRs for

44
00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:14.519
you and
it answers all of your work and stuff.

45
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.006
But it shows the PRs I've created,
the issues I've created for people,

46
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:25.068
where I've done work and
where I have other open issues at, right?

47
00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:28.609
So that is mine, in a nutshell,

48
00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.340
it also shows on the far left, my website.

49
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.880
I usually use Vets Who Code,

50
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.642
because that's what I'm most known for,
where I'm located, and my Twitter handle.

51
00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:44.399
Because that's where people used to find
me even though now I use LinkedIn a lot

52
00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.583
more, so
that's where now you find me on LinkedIn.

53
00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:50.066
I'm scrolling on LinkedIn or
Instagram all the time.

54
00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:53.838
We've been seeing a marked
flip on Instagram or

55
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:57.623
read all my friends
achievements on LinkedIn.

56
00:03:57.623 --> 00:04:02.815
It also has achievements like
Pair Extraordinaire, so, like I say,

57
00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:07.751
I'm always pair programming with
people and coauthoring stuff.

58
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.852
Yolo, you want it, just merge it.

59
00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:14.592
I've done it a time or two,
not proud of it, but I do it.

60
00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:18.279
Starstruck, I created it for repos.

61
00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.906
These are all things that GitHub puts on
it and it helps round out your brand,

62
00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:23.422
right?

63
00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:24.726
It's very cool, and

64
00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:29.583
sometimes they do cool things like this
where the Arctic Code Vault contributor

65
00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:33.653
program that they did where they
put your code in the Arctic Vault.

66
00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:38.158
I have no idea what we're doing with code
in the Arctic Vault, because if the world

67
00:04:38.158 --> 00:04:42.095
comes to that, no one's gonna be
worrying about what code is up there.

68
00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:44.663
They're gonna be where are the seeds, sir?

69
00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:45.736
Thank you.

70
00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:50.067
And Pull Shark, cuz I've opened pull
requests that have been merged,

71
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:55.044
I don't know why they say that but I'm
bronze and silver now, I'm silver, yay,

72
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.004
okay, [LAUGH].

73
00:04:56.004 --> 00:05:02.224
So that's essentially how
your profile should look.

74
00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:07.816
Going back to a separate profile or
a separate repo,

75
00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:11.639
your repos should be descriptive.

76
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.932
I don't believe in having repositories or
projects that have nothing on them,

77
00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:20.331
right, especially if you're
trying to get a job.

78
00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:26.260
You have to program, and do things
the way that you would do at work, right?

79
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.167
You would never have an empty read
me profile on a repo at work, right?

80
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.506
They will always have
how you run the project.

81
00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:37.686
They would always have the code for
it and the information,

82
00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:41.206
the things that they would
always do that at a job.

83
00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:43.724
You wanna show that you're ready for
a job.

84
00:05:43.724 --> 00:05:49.780
Especially if it's a pin repo,
a repo that you want them to look at,

85
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.585
you need to have it as if it's a repo for
a job, right?

86
00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:58.632
That's where we have to start
thinking in concepts of,

87
00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:03.710
from the point of view of, we're
doing our work now not just to learn,

88
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.584
we're doing our work now to obtain a goal,
right, which is to get a job, right?

89
00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:13.230
It's a different type of coding,
a different type of pushing repos and

90
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.459
things of that nature.

91
00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.678
We're not making repos just
to learn how to make a repo,

92
00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:21.600
now we're making repos to showcase
our professionalism, right?

93
00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:29.107
I wanna show another example
of a GitHub profile,

94
00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:33.039
I've shown this before,
it's one of my favorites.

95
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.543
Adrian Grimm started learning
how to code when he was 45.

96
00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:40.481
He is now a software engineer
at Methodist Le Bonheur,

97
00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:45.017
he does programming and
makes products to help make the lives of

98
00:06:45.017 --> 00:06:49.658
parents who have children who
are sick make their lives easier.

99
00:06:49.658 --> 00:06:51.631
So that's what he does for a living now.

100
00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:53.782
It is double whammy of pride for

101
00:06:53.782 --> 00:06:58.593
me because that's one of the children's
hospitals in my hometown.

102
00:06:58.593 --> 00:07:03.491
So to know that one of
my veteran students is

103
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:08.663
doing work that positively
impacts kids back

104
00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:13.712
in my hometown, it's double swish for me.

105
00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:18.566
My mom, she's uber proud,
like hey, yeah, [LAUGH].

106
00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:23.454
But, as you see, he has his profile
picture, he doesn't smile, so

107
00:07:23.454 --> 00:07:27.753
we asked him to put something
more friendly up there as well,

108
00:07:27.753 --> 00:07:31.912
and so he had this GitHub octocat,
which has a Rolex on it.

109
00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:37.089
Don't know why, and his pants is short and
long at the same time,

110
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.057
I can still see the octocat ankle,
but whatever.

111
00:07:41.057 --> 00:07:46.711
He has these GIFs of his name, he has
all his information on how to reach him.

112
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:48.402
He has a hash flag.

113
00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:51.710
He has these collapsible
information parts,

114
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.283
his pieces of code he's
writing that he's done.

115
00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.131
His GitHub stats.

116
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.462
As I said, the dude is an animal.

117
00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:08.457
He codes more than anybody in our work.

118
00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:12.466
I'm like, nah, nah,
I have sleep to catch up on, man.

119
00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:17.358
His trophy collection and
the languages and tools he uses.

120
00:08:17.358 --> 00:08:20.806
As you see, he's kept his a lot
smaller and tighter than mine, but

121
00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:24.082
he's also been coding professionally for
two, three years.

122
00:08:24.082 --> 00:08:27.592
I know for a fact he's been on
the Ruby on Rails train, so

123
00:08:27.592 --> 00:08:30.441
he's probably been doing
a lot more of that.

124
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.609
His pin projects,
he has his portfolio, and

125
00:08:34.609 --> 00:08:39.436
he has this band that paid him to make,
it's weird,

126
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:43.716
I don't know what type,
it's like grunge but

127
00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:48.345
Nordic grunge, and
this band is international.

128
00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:54.848
And they saw his work and asked him to
do all their design and development.

129
00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:59.842
And I have no idea what this stuff
is because, once again, I'm square.

130
00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:06.018
So I was like, okay, the corny person in
me, I can figure out what you're doing.

131
00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:09.860
And, of course,
his contribution lists over the last year.
