1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.727
All right, so we're going to get to
building and optimizing your portfolio for

2
00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:06.580
JavaScript engineers.

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.272
I need you to also have the checklist
pulled up if you don't have it.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.427
Now, make sure it's on the repo.

5
00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:23.624
This is what it is this is also this
is a great opportunity like with

6
00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:29.101
these right here, you this is a great
opportunity where you can go and

7
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:35.080
you can add these as tickets to
a project board for your portfolio.

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.739
Instead of having an on the notion
you could just go to do a project

9
00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.623
board make tickets of these and
then add it straight,

10
00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:47.960
add it to your portfolio and
then follow that flow as you go.

11
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.590
Well crafted portfolio is essential for
a Javascript engineer or

12
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.530
any type of engineer, really,
to showcase your skills, your experience,

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.510
and your projects to potential
employers or clients.

14
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.366
This powerful tool that can help
you stand out in competition and

15
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:13.788
land your dream job those that
I believe that I've seen it so

16
00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:19.103
many times I've seen people
with amazing portfolios what

17
00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:26.170
my one friend her portfolio was so good
that I shared it with a vice president.

18
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.636
And I was like,

19
00:01:29.636 --> 00:01:35.550
I need to ask her first.

20
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.209
I message people all over the weekend
like to my vice president friend

21
00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.269
wants your phone number not gonna do
that like you're gonna have to wait but

22
00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:50.409
I always saw wait till Monday so your
portfolio helps a lot of weight right and

23
00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.861
as I say when it comes to
your highlight real being or

24
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:59.110
your like your like basically your
highlight sheet being your resume.

25
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.968
This is your Picasso this is
the place where you get to really

26
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:09.250
push in play with like everything
like give your all to this.

27
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.810
It is a project and
a product all in itself.

28
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.837
All right which means even if you
do not have a bunch of fleshed out

29
00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:22.958
projects treating it as a project
within itself can be the project

30
00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:27.960
this is a great example of
the portfolio being the project.

31
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.860
This is one of my students.

32
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.730
She actually, I taught her for
a year and she interned with me for

33
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.520
about three months.

34
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.000
Every aspect of her
portfolio is a project.

35
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.050
So she taught herself how to
make gifts and then she taught,

36
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.910
like she decided she's gonna make her
mouse into this little devil horns.

37
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.192
The thing I absolutely loved it I was like
you're a nerd so whatever emojis right

38
00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:58.378
here her name no she could have this very
small blur and for every level of like or

39
00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:03.845
she was was a work she's done she
has where she can be connected with.

40
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:08.241
And most of this portfolio ended
up through her as parts or

41
00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:12.650
components from her codepen
that she put together.

42
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.330
Right?

43
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
So her my role has always been you're
above the fold content needs to

44
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.600
be eye catching that is for
the people in HR, right an HR person.

45
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.700
If your website is boring,
they're gonna go to the next website.

46
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.510
You want them to pause on the website,
right?

47
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.475
People something that a programmer might
find annoying is not something that

48
00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:35.980
a normal person is gonna find annoying,
right?

49
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.750
So when she put the gif up there,
I was, that's perfect.

50
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.260
That people are gonna love it.

51
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.650
They're gonna have fun with it.

52
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.869
That's how they're gonna see
it as fun as they do these

53
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:52.977
now this overlay of colors and
it changes into another

54
00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:57.530
type emoji from the devil
horns to just a point.

55
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.230
I was like, yes,
keep them guessing, keep thinking.

56
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.540
Now here is where the meat
of the projects come from.

57
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.500
User story case studies user stories.

58
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.440
When you're doing your projects, this is
why you have your brand document, right?

59
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.630
When you put your mock-ups and
your things like that in there, right?

60
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.110
So when you're doing those projects and
you're in your portfolio,

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.660
you're able to say, all right,
here's the project that I did.

62
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.180
So this one, the credit education
of a scalable infrastructure.

63
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.270
Branding, graphic design, web development.

64
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.440
She says each what section it is,
read more, I click,

65
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.062
she goes she talks about a sector
that is in, her challenge,

66
00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:43.049
her role, hurt the tools that she used,
what she's calling it,

67
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:48.090
the research as you see for
her projects like why do I need credit.

68
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.666
It helped me understand how site users
navigate what fuels their browsing

69
00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:57.686
purchase decisions arrange meetings with
people that fit the target audience as

70
00:04:57.686 --> 00:05:02.704
to how the poor credit for their current
credit rating affects their lifestyle so

71
00:05:02.704 --> 00:05:07.498
she created this entire project out of
this and then for her results she has her

72
00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:12.770
results and she has how we communicate
resources, process, journey map.

73
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.630
This is where she starts telling her mock
ups of how she was going from mobile

74
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.890
first to now desktop level and
how she architected information.

75
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.830
Form first revision community
commitment and conclusion, right?

76
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.380
That's how you do a project.

77
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.030
Like link right on your portfolio.

78
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.630
You do not just here's
my project that's it.

79
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.260
You're like, here's my project.

80
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.839
Here's the motivation and
project yes research I've done for

81
00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.260
the project here's tools I use for
the project.

82
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.980
Here is how I start to create.

83
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.330
This howls for the process of
creating project for his views.

84
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.760
Now, here's my project.

85
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.590
This is what I've done.

86
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.200
So that's when I say,
hey you need a project page?

87
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.000
That's what I'm referring to.

88
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.490
So, that creates another page altogether
on your website, on your portfolio.

89
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.340
Yes sir.

90
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.539
&gt;&gt; Just want to mention Jen Kramer has a
free getting started with CSS course where

91
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.990
you actually build a portfolio.

92
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.890
That might be a good place to start.

93
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.740
It's a really nicely designed portfolio.

94
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.030
And then that question for
you from Wagner.

95
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.296
If you are more mid level or even senior,

96
00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:28.270
what should you showcase in a portfolio?

97
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.220
&gt;&gt; If you're more mid level or senior you
should showcase the difference between

98
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.230
a junior and a mid level or
singing person is impact right?

99
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.460
So you should showcase.so your projects
and links you showcase should be about.

100
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.440
The impact,
how are you like StackOverflow?

101
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.813
Answering questions on their
mentoring things of that nature,

102
00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:50.930
like where you're volunteering.

103
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.321
Those are when I'm looking at a senior or
junior,

104
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:59.180
I'm looking at how are they passing
information down to other people.

105
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.630
That's when I'm looking at
a person who's Senior MIT.

106
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.932
I'm looking at a junior, I'm not expecting
a junior to have anything on their

107
00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:11.120
portfolio that showcases that they've
been giving back to the community?

108
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.690
If you're men and senior, I am absolutely
expecting like stuff to showcase that

109
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.020
you've been giving back to the community
or you've been finding ways to like

110
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.351
amplify your work to have greater
impact beyond just you and

111
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:27.490
that's what because that's
where I'm looking for.

112
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.430
For a mentioned senior person is, impact.

113
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.470
I'm looking for, hey, how are you
making the tech world tech community,

114
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.760
better for people that are left and
right at you?

115
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.280
All right?

116
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.136
&gt;&gt; Since I'm in this process of
hiring engineer, or senior engineers,

117
00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:50.157
a lot of times I'll look for something
super nerdy, like a blog post that

118
00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:55.480
that shows that you've done deep
thinking and a part of your craft.

119
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.930
&gt;&gt; That's what I would say by giving back
like a blog post or giving back right?

120
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.850
I am flattening the educational curve for
someone else.

121
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.852
Right?
&gt;&gt; When you talk

122
00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:07.860
about like these like super nerdy
blockbuster people In the highlighting of

123
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.010
revenue seniors like we're gonna be
able to select topics usually people do?

124
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a good question
I think if it's specifically

125
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.758
around front end engineering
things cuz like the event loop or

126
00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:27.660
you know design systems leading
a team components whatever something.

127
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.486
&gt;&gt; I like design his front end I want
to talk about design systems wanna

128
00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:37.142
talk about accessibility like
especially in a viewpoint of like

129
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:42.136
Front are how front end has moved
beyond just the front end of the web of

130
00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:47.134
the Computer GUI to like hardware
things of that nature those are like

131
00:08:47.134 --> 00:08:52.085
that's stuff that I'm looking at
when it comes to like mid senior.

132
00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:56.545
Because Front end isn't just front
end has, how it is now, right?

133
00:08:56.545 --> 00:08:58.850
Or even more like DevOps, right?

134
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.824
Justin Kramer,
Jonathan Kramer and Schuster,

135
00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:06.174
they both used to talk to colleagues of
mine they both do a lot of work in or

136
00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:09.020
did a lot of work in like
what they call DevOps.

137
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.159
This was DevOps for the front end, and
they created this whole little term for

138
00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.780
this whole community.

139
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.709
About people who are, that started
with this whole analogy of two

140
00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:23.220
front ends going to a bar, and they
have absolutely nothing to talk about.

141
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.181
Because the UI engineer
has nothing in common with

142
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:30.450
the person who does nothing but
work on Webpac stuff all day, right?

143
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:36.237
And how those two have become a front
end and then a middle of front end and

144
00:09:36.237 --> 00:09:41.730
how that so that divergence of
front end has started to happen.

145
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.730
Like things like that.

146
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.580
That's that's nerding out.

147
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.310
Like that's very nerdy to me, right?

148
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.906
Like, okay, I didn't even think about how
now front end development has become so

149
00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:55.174
big that you can have two front ends or
three front ends in a room, and they have

150
00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:59.529
absolutely nothing to talk about,
because they're doing three different.

151
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.890
Types of running work on the front end,
right?

152
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.847
So- Yeah, definitely when you
get to those senior level roles,

153
00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:12.690
you wanna see something that's
not just about a framework.

154
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.545
It could be some really nerdy aspect
about a framework, but ideally,

155
00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:22.320
it's something more about Universal
like about the browser browser

156
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.013
API's request animation frame
something like that where it's you

157
00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:31.987
know broadly applicable knowledge payment
&gt;&gt; API in the browser things like

158
00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:36.640
that which is I think Chrome It has
a payment API now, and people don't,

159
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.980
have yet
to see very little writing on it, so.

160
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.971
I like how Will's sentence talks
about technical communication,

161
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:48.381
the ability to take a topic and distill
