1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.627
How long do you think it would take for
someone newer to web development to learn

2
00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:08.006
enough to meaningfully hit
every check box on this list?

3
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt; If you've already been coding,

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.638
it should take you about 30 to 45 days.

5
00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:19.996
If you've been coding for
six to nine months already,

6
00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:23.646
which is what I recommended for
people to have this course,

7
00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:27.601
it'd take you 45 days to get your
portfolio up to code on this.

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:32.317
If you're brand new, like three months,
I think it'll take you another

9
00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:36.439
three to six months before you
understand some of these things.

10
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.683
Because there are some things on
here that until you push code live,

11
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.818
you're not going to really understand,
right?

12
00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:46.973
Web performance, or unit testing,

13
00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:52.175
best design practices,
security best practices, right?

14
00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:56.511
You're only gonna understand about
best security stuff when you a,

15
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.693
add a form, so you have to think
about the security of the form, and

16
00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.181
when you're pushing it live, right?

17
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.175
That's when you're starting to
think about, is my site secure?

18
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:11.922
Is someone gonna be able to hack my
website or just cross site hosting or

19
00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:15.471
cross site injections and
stuff like that, right?

20
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:19.891
And you're thinking about the XML and
things of that nature.

21
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:25.573
So that's how I think about it,
or how long I think it'll be,

22
00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:30.731
six to nine months,
this should take 30 to 45 days.

23
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:34.927
If not, this should take you
about three to six months,

24
00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:40.819
especially if you go even further,
you don't have to add everything on here,

25
00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.501
but if you do,
it will highly grow your chances.

26
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:49.011
MySQL, adding a database to this,
that is something you may, or

27
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:53.275
may not want to do,
compared if you're using AWS Amplify, or

28
00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:57.637
using Next as a format of holding data,
things of that nature.

29
00:01:57.637 --> 00:02:02.944
So that's something that I want you to
think about when you're building this.

30
00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:04.376
But when you're doing databases,

31
00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:07.345
you're gonna have to think about
security in databases as well, right?

32
00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:13.331
Cuz how many people's databases get broken
into cuz they haven't changed [LAUGH]

33
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:19.329
the database from what it was when they
first made it, when it was local for prod?

34
00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.646
So that's my thought process on it,
or that's my opinion on it.

35
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:31.341
&gt;&gt; How important do you think Lighthouse
scores are with this kind of stuff?

36
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:35.221
&gt;&gt; If you're gonna be front end,
very important, because I check Lighthouse

37
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:39.234
scores on everybody's, that's the first
thing I check is your Lighthouse.

38
00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:46.325
I wanna see what Lighthouse says,
I'm checking for accessibility especially.

39
00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:51.613
I feel like we're going towards
this that if the component or

40
00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:58.974
the website isn't accessible, the website
is not done mentality on the front end,

41
00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:05.735
which is about time we're starting to
think about accessibility like that.

42
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.913
So for me, it's very important,
I wanna know the web performance,

43
00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:13.602
I wanna know first paint,
if it's sub three seconds or not.

44
00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:20.328
I wanna know how much bloated JavaScript
are or if your images are too big,

45
00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:25.768
I wanna know all that stuff
because of it helps other areas.

46
00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.582
&gt;&gt; Would that be something you'd document
somewhere or just kind of just for

47
00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:33.128
you to know that it's-
&gt;&gt; You don't have to document it because

48
00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:36.018
everybody has access to it,
they have Chrome.

49
00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:40.435
What I would recommend is you
to use that as a part of your

50
00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:43.135
process of building things out.

51
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:48.063
Because you don't want to be the last
person to find out that your

52
00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:51.910
website is troublesome to say the least,
right?

53
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.148
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:54.148 --> 00:04:00.551
&gt;&gt; So what's your opinion on the sort
of complexity of portfolio projects,

55
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.111
like time versus what
you're gonna build meaning?

56
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:10.081
&gt;&gt; That's a very complex question for me.

57
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:14.815
I tell people I personally
feel like the portfolio

58
00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:19.446
should be the project you
spend the most time on.

59
00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:24.711
And you should try to figure out
projects that flow well with

60
00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:29.975
your portfolio that also flow
well with your personality,

61
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:36.101
when it comes to building out your
supplementary projects, right?

62
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:42.932
After that, when it comes to the projects,
every other project should be small,

63
00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:47.396
it should be small enough
to learn one thing, right?

64
00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:48.798
&gt;&gt; Every other project?

65
00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:53.428
&gt;&gt; All right, so, there's trolley
projects, is what I call them,

66
00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:56.169
trolley projects are small projects.

67
00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.923
Those are the projects that
are designed for me to learn one thing.

68
00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:02.810
JavaScript calculator,
that's a trolley project, right?

69
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.170
That's a project that's only designed for
me to learn something about JavaScript,

70
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.964
let me do this.

71
00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:10.938
If I did a project is just
focused on React hook forms,

72
00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:12.997
that's a trolley project, right?

73
00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:17.174
I just wanna learn React hook forms, and
the focus of this for me to learn that so

74
00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:20.467
I can implement it somewhere
larger down the line, but not for

75
00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.582
me to try to use as a portfolio, right?

76
00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:27.236
Now, I have Bravo projects, my Bravo
projects are something that are meatier,

77
00:05:27.236 --> 00:05:31.148
more fleshed out, I can use it,
have it pinned on my repositories.

78
00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:32.511
I can push it live,

79
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:37.551
I can have it as a part of a project
that I am showcasing on my portfolio.

80
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:43.533
Then I have Alpha project,
I view my portfolio is an Alpha project.

81
00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:46.973
This is a project that is
going to be holding or

82
00:05:46.973 --> 00:05:50.692
hosting or
leveraging other projects, right?

83
00:05:50.692 --> 00:05:54.765
This is the big link,
this is the whale, right?

84
00:05:54.765 --> 00:05:58.989
I want everybody to come here and then
they see all the other things that I've

85
00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.234
done while here, like,
this is super cool, right?

86
00:06:02.234 --> 00:06:06.313
It's like, hey,
if I had a really cool landing page, and

87
00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:11.327
I have a blog that's attached to my
website, that's a alpha project.

88
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:16.709
And I can even write about how
I built the blog on the blog,

89
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.658
and probably have that as
part of the use case study.

90
00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:26.988
And then from there, let's say I want
a chat bot as well, so I can communicate

91
00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:31.668
with people like I did with mine,
I can have that as a alpha project.

92
00:06:31.668 --> 00:06:34.552
Because that goes directly into the blog,
and I mean,

93
00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:38.696
directly into my portfolio as well, and
I can communicate with that, right?

94
00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:42.259
Now, if I have an extension or something,
that's a Bravo project, right?

95
00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:47.166
It's a project that's standalone, but it
also helps people, that people can use it,

96
00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:51.100
they can go find it, but I can write
about it and I can share that story.

97
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.523
Now, I can have a Charlie Project as well,
and Charlie projects no one sees them.

98
00:06:57.523 --> 00:07:00.832
They're not designed to be seen,
they're designed to make me better, but

99
00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:01.775
that's it, right?

100
00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:06.796
If I wanted to learn a little, and
I wanted to make the Facebook emoji,

101
00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:11.498
if I press this and five things pop
up with the like, and the heart, and

102
00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:16.643
the angry face and stuff like that,
I want to learn how to make that in React.

103
00:07:16.643 --> 00:07:20.672
That's not something that I'm gonna do and
put on my portfolio,

104
00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:25.579
that's something I'm learning to figure
out how to do that, props up data down

105
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:30.288
type behavior, and then move on with
my life, and use that somewhere else.

106
00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:33.435
&gt;&gt; Do you have any examples like that
middle tier project where it's worth

107
00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:36.901
showing but it's not necessarily-
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] The VS code extension,

108
00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:39.402
that's a middle tier project, right?

109
00:07:39.402 --> 00:07:44.289
It's small enough to where I can
talk about it and people use it,

110
00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:48.360
I can discuss it,
I can write a blog post about it, but

111
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.724
I can't make an entire
portfolio off of it.

112
00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:55.237
It's just a project that's
a piece of a portfolio, but

113
00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:58.750
it's substantial enough that
I had to push it to prod and

114
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.970
people got the opportunity to use and
leverage this tool, right?

115
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.227
So that is a Bravo style project, or

116
00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:11.450
let's say you had an NPM
package of your resume, right?

117
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.714
That would be a Bravo style project,
like, hey,

118
00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:21.024
you should go and NPM install my resume,
you can pull it from there.

119
00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.140
&gt;&gt; MDM?

120
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.767
&gt;&gt; NPM, I keep forgetting your Java,
not JavaScript,

121
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:33.645
so NPM is a package handler that
we use to do all the things

122
00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:39.165
in JavaScript, TypeScript,
React, Node world.

123
00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:40.657
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:45.312
&gt;&gt; With the portfolio project, should we
be building that with the technologies

125
00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:49.345
that we're advertising we're good at,
or it's just HTML, CSS?

126
00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:54.170
&gt;&gt; You can do either,
only I am now at a stage in my career

127
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.900
where I only wanna add when it hurts, but

128
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.967
if I'm going to say Python,
I wanna get a Python expertise on it.

129
00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:09.620
I want to put something with Python,
I'm leveraging Python,

130
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.324
even if I'm telling the story
of something of data.

131
00:09:14.324 --> 00:09:16.805
I wanna create an ETL pipeline and

132
00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:21.501
then use that ETL pipeline to
showcase me moving data around and

133
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:27.544
then doing some data engineering stuff,
that's what I am going to do, and yes.

134
00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:30.577
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess to go back to my
previous question cuz other people

135
00:09:30.577 --> 00:09:31.825
have been chaining on it.

136
00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:35.079
The reason I asked about sort of
the time versus complexity is cuz some

137
00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:37.562
of my projects take three or
four months sometimes.

138
00:09:37.562 --> 00:09:41.986
They're extremely complex and that's,
I don't know, I just really like to make

139
00:09:41.986 --> 00:09:44.390
things that are impressive over-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

140
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.698
&gt;&gt; A lot of things,
I like to make one big thing.

141
00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:50.529
So do you think that's too
long to be spending on things?

142
00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:55.256
&gt;&gt; I think if you had the time and
bandwidth for it, why not?

143
00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.469
I don't see a problem with that.

144
00:09:56.469 --> 00:09:59.932
I don't think any employer
would see a problem with that.

145
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:06.096
But they would be like, now what I would
like to see is your planning of it.

146
00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:09.990
And I think that might be something that
might be cool to see if you approached it

147
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.707
from a planning first process of
planning it out, making the tickets, and

148
00:10:13.707 --> 00:10:15.011
then building the thing.

149
00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:17.307
Would that change your speed from it?

150
00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:21.349
Cuz all right,
you have a complex project, but

151
00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:26.718
could you do a complex project
if I gave you a deadline, right?

152
00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.768
That's a question that you
haven't asked yourself.

153
00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:33.430
You haven't put that constraint on
yourself either yet, all right?

154
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.768
So, all right, I got 30 days,
I gotta make these tickets,

155
00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:41.439
and then I have to knock this
out in a format to where,

156
00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:44.954
