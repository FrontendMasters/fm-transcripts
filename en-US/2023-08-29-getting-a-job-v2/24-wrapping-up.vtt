00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.288
Any thoughts on how Frontend engineers
can best use their time to prepare for

2
00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:05.496
coding interviews?

3
00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:11.380
For example, should we prioritize
projects, algorithms, or system design?

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.502
&gt;&gt; That's a difficult one cuz that depends

5
00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:20.875
on who the programmer is, right?

6
00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:26.668
If you're strong and algorithms you should
shore up your part of the game that's

7
00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:32.479
united strong yet while also lean into
the party game you are strong yet, right?

8
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.579
So first it's just like,
yeah, MMA or something,

9
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.512
you're very weak at grappling, you should
probably be practicing your grappling

10
00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:44.261
while you're keeping the parts
that you're strong at sharp.

11
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.120
So, that's how I view it, at least.

12
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.519
&gt;&gt; I know a lot of what you've been
talking about is in terms of self

13
00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.006
sufficiency, applying for the jobs
yourself, putting the application in.

14
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:02.760
How do you feel about working with
external recruiters, for example?

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.445
&gt;&gt; I don't want to work
with external recruiters,

16
00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:08.660
I wanna work with internal recruiters,
that's my goal.

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.960
My goal is not to work with
recruiters who are just,

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.760
because I asked a friend
of mine I was like, so

19
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.463
what makes the qualification for
external recruiter?

20
00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:26.150
He's like a pulse,
that's all they need like they're you.

21
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.959
Usually called keys, they're usually
collegiate athletes who have a degree and

22
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.840
don't know where else to go so
they end up in tech recruiting.

23
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.880
That's all they need.

24
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.179
They don't know anything about tech, they
don't know the difference between Java and

25
00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.889
JavaScript.

26
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:43.697
So you're trusting your career with
somebody who doesn't care about

27
00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:47.130
your career and
it's just a game of luck for them.

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.517
So after he said that I was like,
okay, sounds like so

29
00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:56.266
how do we judge our recruiters like,
when it comes to things and

30
00:01:56.266 --> 00:02:00.120
he was like beyond a certain
external recruiters,

31
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.165
try to focus on the internal ones or
build a relationship, right?

32
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:09.438
You should always be building relationship
with a recruiter that stuff first thing

33
00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:12.794
that I think a lot of people just go for
a recruiter and like, hey,

34
00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:15.253
I just want whoever's
gonna help me find a job.

35
00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:18.486
I know I want a recruiter to take
the time to get to know me in and out.

36
00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.672
So when he hears of a job,
he's like I got a guy like that.

37
00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.330
I already know, I was like,
we just had coffee like 2 days ago,

38
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.524
we play putt putt together.

39
00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:27.940
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.468
I know exactly who is perfect for
that job.

41
00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:34.137
We talk about the job market all the time,
right?

42
00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:37.580
So, that's how I see it.

43
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.311
&gt;&gt; I had a recruiter with,
I went to a conference and

44
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:45.865
then talked to one guy who was like,
hire up in the company.

45
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:49.287
Then he hooked me up with this internal
recruiter who I worked with, but

46
00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:52.037
they ended up feeling I didn't
have enough experience.

47
00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:57.224
But you seem to keep in touch and
never know if that's kinda just a nice

48
00:02:57.224 --> 00:03:02.080
keep in touch kind of deal or
&gt;&gt; Less they tell you there is a nice keep

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.408
in touch, keep in touch, everyone
the worst thing they can say is no.

50
00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.585
And I know it's just gonna
get you to the closer yes.

51
00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:12.772
Instead of you wondering, shoulda, woulda,

52
00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:16.048
coulda, maybe now is
the time I can talk to them?

53
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:18.404
Is this the job that's gonna get away?

54
00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:21.850
No, keep in touch, reach out,
hey, I've been practicing,

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.778
I've been learning,
I've gotten some new skills,

56
00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:29.223
I would love to talk to you all about what
I've acquired over the last few months.

57
00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:32.498
&gt;&gt; If you know they could also be having
the position that's one level down

58
00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:35.449
that you are qualified for and
might not get the job you wanted but

59
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.825
they have something for you?

60
00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:42.032
&gt;&gt; And we'll networking and
the informational interviews I have seen

61
00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:46.962
on least two occasions where they
will change the rick of a job for

62
00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:50.082
a person cuz they want the person so bad.

63
00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:54.857
And like the person wasn't qualified for
that level, so

64
00:03:54.857 --> 00:04:00.890
they lower the level of the job to make
sure that they could have the person.

65
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.605
So that is a thing that happens,
I have seen it twice.

66
00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:09.910
&gt;&gt; When is an appropriate time to two or
three months kind of deal and

67
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.437
then just check into.

68
00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:14.603
&gt;&gt; 90 days I would say that,
three months, 90 days.

69
00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:20.056
All right, so if you wanna reach out to me
you can find me on @Jerome@vetswhocode.io,

70
00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:24.286
send me your resume, send me anything
you need you want me to look at.

71
00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:29.562
If you wanna set up a one-on-one with
me that's cool too, I'm very happy

72
00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:34.615
to have done this and congratulations
everyone and let's go get paid.

73
00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:41.527
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
