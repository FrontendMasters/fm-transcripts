WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.836
So this one is a thing
that we started doing at

2
00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:08.530
that I've started having my troops
do that I've started doing.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.545
And we call this building
a personal brand database,

4
00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.970
it's a little bit different
from what they usually call it.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.749
I don't know if y'all ever heard
this term brag document, right, so

6
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.450
you've heard this.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.822
So essentially, what this is, this is
a highlight page of all the things you've

8
00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:30.326
built, you've written, all the talks
you've done, and whether you've been at

9
00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:33.992
meetups, things like that,
all the conferences you've been to,

10
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:38.146
all the positive things you've
implemented on projects, all that stuff.

11
00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:40.002
This is the highlight reel of it.

12
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:45.321
Now, that now is a part of our
personal brand database where we

13
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:50.453
also have the assets,
the colors needed for our projects.

14
00:00:50.453 --> 00:00:53.331
No, we're gonna use our projects,
our portfolio head,

15
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:56.180
our biography,
things of that nature, all right?

16
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.000
So I think I have mine.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.160
So yeah, here's my brand database.

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.110
I actually made this into a template for
you as well.

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.830
So you can go on to the reap the repo, get
it, grab it, I use Notion for everything.

20
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.170
So that's just what
I've been using Notion.

21
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.270
Notion is my new Bible,
I put everything in there.

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.840
And it's like my new brain, I love it.

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.120
So this is my brand database.

24
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.480
I have two sections my brag document and
my biography.

25
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.750
So my biography I have the picture
that I use for everything except,

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.050
of course, Frontend Masters they decide
to use like their own photo of me, boo.

27
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.552
All right, I have this very,
very long biography, this intentional, so

28
00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:51.455
that way I can chop it up
based on what's needed.

29
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:56.352
Like, hey, if I want to go to ChatGPT and
like, "hey, can you make this the size

30
00:01:56.352 --> 00:02:01.050
of a tweet, and they will be like,
okay, cool, sure, here you go, right?

31
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.882
I have my preferred web font and
colors in here.

32
00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:08.258
Preferred web font is Gotham,
which became famous during

33
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:13.359
Barack Obama's first campaign,
so that's been my favorite one.

34
00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.049
These three colors,
we call ' they're the hashflag color.

35
00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:22.183
So f6f6f6, hashflag white,
hashflag blue and hashflag red.

36
00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:28.230
So got a little, bam,
right there, that's shareable.

37
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.320
And my brag document,
how the brag document is.

38
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.709
I, of course, start out with here, and

39
00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.080
I make sure every link has
its own home for each one.

40
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.699
So my projects all have a link,
my blogs all have a link,

41
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.710
everything I've written has a link,
every article I've been on has a link.

42
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.599
I just keep this document going so
that way everyone I have this,

43
00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.200
I can grab from regardless of where
I'm planning on going to, right?

44
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.364
This is eight years of work.

45
00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:04.030
One day, you're gonna be there, like, I
started off with nothing, just like y'all.

46
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.620
So, here's your brag document.

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.400
This is how it should look.

48
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.060
You should have everything on here.

49
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.048
Your projects, take it to another level,

50
00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:17.285
make everything searchable on
a different format, right?

51
00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:20.627
The reason why we do this is
that we want to make things,

52
00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:23.620
we want to be able to move
fast in today's world.

53
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.870
Especially when you're building your
portfolio, you have to prepare and

54
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.117
gather this stuff, right?

55
00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:32.097
Cuz you're building your projects first,
building your README profiles out.

56
00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:35.790
You're doing all these other parts
before you're doing a portfolio.

57
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.760
When you need a place to
store all this stuff.

58
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.420
Where's you gonna put your user stories,
right?

59
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.368
Where you gonna put your case studies
that you're doing for your projects,

60
00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:45.980
your mockups, right?

61
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.888
Like you need to be able to store this
stuff in a place that you can quickly grab

62
00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:52.594
it as you're building your portfolio out,
right?

63
00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:57.478
That's the number one job of the database,
right,

64
00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:04.369
is to take everything you have and
be able to help push it to the next level.

65
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.941
So it helps you get
a polished LinkedIn profile.

66
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:13.557
It helps you have a whole list
of things in here for you.

67
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:16.982
So you can identify your brand
new elements, i.e your web fonts,

68
00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:20.895
things of that nature, as we saw with me,
your bio, have your core values,

69
00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:24.584
your unique skills and expertise,
your professional achievements.

70
00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:30.600
And it comes to his passions and
interests, personal professional goals,

71
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.839
relevant information,
the list just goes on and on.

72
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.212
You don't have to use Notion.

73
00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:41.824
I've seen people use Airtable as well and
I've also seen Trello.

74
00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.934
Having the best examples,
I haven't been on Trello, but

75
00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:49.063
Airtable and Notion have been the ones
that I've seen work the best for this.
