>> So when you see a blog you mean something that's like self-hosted not using like medium or depth to-

[00:03:09]

>> Yes, that's what I mean.

And like, welcome to the internet, here we are, and I'm like, so that's how Betsuko looks pixelated, that's great, like, can you get off our website now?
