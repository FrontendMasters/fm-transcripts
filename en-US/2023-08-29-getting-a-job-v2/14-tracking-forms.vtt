00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.520
All right, this is one that's overlooked.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.245
And I yell at people about it all the time
cuz I think it's the most obvious, but

3
00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:12.043
I don't think people just don't look at
themselves the way that companies look

4
00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:14.354
at themselves, so they don't do it.

5
00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:19.814
Add tracking, implement Google Analytics
or a similar tool to track visits,

6
00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:23.550
clicks and
user behavior on your portfolio website.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.117
This the one thing that everybody
at RedCircle has been yelled at

8
00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:31.475
about at least once, because they have
not done this, they're like, well,

9
00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:33.346
I didn't think it was a big deal.

10
00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:38.470
My question to you is, if you do not know
when people are coming to your website,

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.072
how long they're staying on your website,
when they're bouncing off your website.

12
00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:48.053
How are you gonna get
the understanding of what to fix?

13
00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:51.275
You don't know what's going on,
you don't have any data.

14
00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:55.681
We don't have anywhere to start
on the process of where we're

15
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.183
triaging everything else on your
journey to get a job, right?

16
00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:05.248
This is why it's very important for
me like yoh, get tracking, add tracking,

17
00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:09.800
you have a contact form,
add tracking to the Contact Form button.

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.402
Any button they have, I want a tracker on
it because I wanna know when they click

19
00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.560
that button,
I wanna know if they click that button.

20
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.185
I wanna know, do they play with
the dark mode on your portfolio?

21
00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:25.870
I wanna know if they click
your social media links.

22
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.270
We need as much data as we want to,
cuz we wanna know, okay,

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260
why haven't you gotten a job?

24
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.102
I can't answer that question if I
don't know are people even going to

25
00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.000
your website.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.648
I don't know, right?

27
00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:43.058
If I was to look at my GitHub README,
and I was, okay,

28
00:01:43.058 --> 00:01:48.942
you have 2,000 people have looked,
so why aren't you have a job?

29
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.690
Let's see why they haven't done that.

30
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.110
That's why I have tracking even
on my GitHub README profile,

31
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.889
cuz I wanna know how many
people are looking at me?

32
00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.774
Have I done something bad?

33
00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:03.117
Usually when that happens I've done
something popular or I've done something

34
00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:06.888
horrible [LAUGH] and I'm like,
okay, which one have I done, right?

35
00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:11.109
I don't remember doing anything so
let me make sure.

36
00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.822
But that's what I want
first thing you all,

37
00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:19.043
first thing you do your portfolio's add
tracking, that's why I have it up so high.

38
00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:23.645
You have to add tracking
on your portfolios.

39
00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:29.060
Another very, very important thing
that I do not see on portfolios that

40
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.128
everybody gets yelled at by me at
least once cuz it grinds my gears.

41
00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:41.053
Add a form on your portfolios,
I cannot state this enough.

42
00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:44.323
Add a form on your portfolios.

43
00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:49.246
The reason why you wanna add a form
on your portfolios is that you don't

44
00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:54.089
want to lose the information chain
of the potential hiring partner or

45
00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.028
hiring manager that's on your website.

46
00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:01.323
What happens when you have a link or
your email or mail to whatever,

47
00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:05.326
something pops up,
everybody's working remote from home.

48
00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.435
Little kid comes in asks daddy or
mommy to go and

49
00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:11.960
look at a macaroni dinosaur
that they have made.

50
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.489
Next thing you know,
they're looking at the dinosaur,

51
00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.130
they see a mess that the dog has made.

52
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.407
They're cleaning the mess of the dog,

53
00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:19.970
they're looking the clock,
it's almost time to feed the baby.

54
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.957
Now they're making dinner their
significant others came home or

55
00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:25.735
the other kids came home now you
have to deal and triage that.

56
00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:29.876
And guess what, now this person has
forgotten what they're even doing on your

57
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.514
website, why they have this pop up
there of this email on your form and

58
00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:37.302
they're, you know what,
it's 8 o'clock at night, I don't care.

59
00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:41.356
They're gonna close it and
you just lost a potential job, right?

60
00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:44.160
The contact form is right
there on your website.

61
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.050
They can sit it there.

62
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.570
They can fill it out right then and there.

63
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.680
They can go on their lives, someone
interrupts them, it's still right there.

64
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.330
They're like, I was gonna say something
about this, it's always there.

65
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.885
You don't want to send them anywhere
else when you're trying to get that

66
00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:57.650
information.

67
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.520
And you also wanna be able to control it,
because guess what?

68
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.794
If they fill out that form, they're
giving you their email as well, right?

69
00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:10.366
So now, you can control
the communication flow, right?

70
00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:11.719
And it's a piece of data.

71
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.449
Now you have that data that you can
track and even more, all right?

72
00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.872
This is how many people
have hit my website.

73
00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:22.234
It's how many people have actually
gone through the process of finishing

74
00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:24.357
out the contact form of my website.

75
00:04:24.357 --> 00:04:29.345
Now, all right, if I have a week where
I'm like, okay, 175 people have hit

76
00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:34.426
my website, but only 20 people have asked
to my contact form, what am I doing?

77
00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:37.226
I have data now to see
what do I need to do

78
00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:41.958
to get that number from initial
contact on my website to actually

79
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:46.531
filling out my contact form to
reach out to me higher, right?

80
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:50.722
These are data things so
you can start using, I guess,

81
00:04:50.722 --> 00:04:55.105
forensics to start triaging
your own problems, right?

82
00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:58.563
When you're trying to figure out why
you're not getting the call back or

83
00:04:58.563 --> 00:05:02.204
how many people are not getting enough
callbacks, things of that, right?

84
00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:05.694
Yes, sir.

85
00:05:05.694 --> 00:05:07.730
&gt;&gt; I have a couple of
questions on the form.

86
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.670
And it's basically kind of around
spamming and security checks.

87
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.036
What do you kinda recommend for that?

88
00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:23.340
&gt;&gt; Well, Netlify Forms they
do great with their forms and

89
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.530
making sure their forms are protected.
