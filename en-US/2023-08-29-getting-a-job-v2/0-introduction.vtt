00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.730
Hey, how you all doing today?

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm here, I'm excited, I literally came
all the way from Atlanta for this.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.499
So this is my favorite course because,
for me,

4
00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.750
this is the most life-changing work I
get to do, is pass on information and

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.880
help people get the jobs that they're
earning and put the work in for it.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.271
I'm willing to help you
flatten that curve for you so

7
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.825
that you can get to your goals, right?

8
00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.823
Let me tell you all about
me because I'm boring, but

9
00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:27.880
I'm busy at the same time, right?

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.113
I wear many hats, software engineering,
Microsoft, I write for

11
00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:35.290
a Stack Overflow and
GitHub readme project.

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.230
I teach for front end masters and
Vets Who Code.

13
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.940
I'm a startup CTO for
a military startup called My Ruck.

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.896
They just finished a $12
million valuation, so

15
00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:47.830
I'm working with him full time.

16
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.343
I have three dogs and
they all have different personalities and

17
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:58.655
I have four kids and
they're four boys and the dogs are boys.

18
00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:03.089
So I have seven boys in my house and
I'm bald by choice but I'm sure if I let

19
00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.525
it grow all the way back,
there'll be some gray's in there now.

20
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:12.335
And my boys are ranging from 20 to 1.5.

21
00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:18.111
So yeah, my whiskey cabinet is full.

22
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:22.710
So we're sitting to set the tone for this.

23
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.703
This market that you're currently sitting
in is very different from the market

24
00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:32.621
two years ago during the COVID boom,
where you could interview the founders of

25
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.260
Prestige Worldwide and
still get a lucrative job.

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.552
If you all don't remember the movie
Step Brothers, it was pretty,

27
00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:44.865
they went in as a group in tuxedos
to jobs that had nothing to do with.

28
00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:48.867
And in a group, you could literally
interview like that two years ago and

29
00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:50.517
still end up getting the job.

30
00:01:50.517 --> 00:01:52.208
There are so many jobs around.

31
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:53.979
It was like what is going on?

32
00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.300
Now today while the job
our market is still good,

33
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.444
the way that the jobs are being
placed is different, right?

34
00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:04.689
So, you have the big tech
companies shrinking, and

35
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.761
those tech they've been shaking
off the people from their orgs.

36
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.983
And those people have been going
into orgs outside of tech that

37
00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:15.181
are still lucrative tech jobs.

38
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.223
And they are gonna be your managers,
your senior devs,

39
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:24.211
the people sitting next to you when
you're on your first coding job,

40
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:28.615
as well as part of that process
of interviewing you, right?

41
00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:34.536
So now we have to focus more on how
to get the job on top of all the new

42
00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:41.913
things with AI that have been implemented
in HR over the last two to three years.

43
00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:46.912
We have to think about all these new
components when we're getting into the job

44
00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:48.057
market, right?

45
00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:52.139
So it's not harder,
it's just different, right?

46
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.650
So there's no it'll be no great recession,
that was hard.

47
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.808
This is just different, the jobs
are there, it's just the game has changed,

48
00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:01.930
that's it, right?

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.835
So don't freak out but
just we're gonna get there.

50
00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:07.860
We're gonna get the plants ready and
we're gonna get started.

51
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.482
Now I shared a repo in the chat,
that also has three resources that

52
00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:16.026
we're gonna be talking
about as well as the flow.

53
00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:20.687
And most of what I'm gonna be saying,
I made sure I wrote it out, so

54
00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:23.707
that way you'll be able
to keep up with me.

55
00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:28.005
So first without any further ado now,
we've done one intro and

56
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.830
set of the tone,
let's go to what are we going to learn?

57
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.589
We're going to learn
about our three users,

58
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.130
or we can use the term our
three gatekeepers, right?

59
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.246
These are the three obstacles that
we have to learn how to adapt and

60
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:46.920
overcome over, so that we can get our job.

61
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.204
In order to prepare, we have to know
what you're preparing for, right?

62
00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:53.776
A lot of people there you
just start coding and

63
00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.427
you get a resume and
just start interviewing.

64
00:03:56.427 --> 00:04:01.204
Well, who are you preparing an interview
for, who are the three components

65
00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:05.990
that you're gonna have a navigating us
to get to that offer letter, right?

66
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.140
A lot of people don't think about that.

67
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.404
That's what we're going to get into.

68
00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:11.679
Preparing our work.

69
00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.113
Here we're gonna talk about
building your brand database and

70
00:04:15.113 --> 00:04:19.880
brag document, building a resume, and
I'm providing templates for both of those.

71
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.170
And your GitHub portfolios and
networking for newbies, i.e, you all.

72
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.106
We're gonna go over how to
use GitHub to your advantage,

73
00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:36.601
as well review your portfolio for optimal
success, and discuss networking for

74
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:41.500
tech noobs, which is different,
and it has evolved a lot as well.

75
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.864
I have about three techniques that
I've learned with my veterans and

76
00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:50.154
my military spouses that helps them
turn people who they network and

77
00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:53.026
to allies, and those allies into sponsors.

78
00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:57.628
And next thing you know, sometimes those
sponsors and to their manager, right?

79
00:04:57.628 --> 00:05:03.845
Which is now the natural
evolution of networking, right?

80
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:07.060
So those are the things
that we are gonna go over.
