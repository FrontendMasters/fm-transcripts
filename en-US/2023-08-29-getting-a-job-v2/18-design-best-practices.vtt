00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:02.330
All right, design best practices.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.981
I think we've talked about this a little
bit, but we didn't get into it as much.

3
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:12.045
But design best practices,
typography, white space.

4
00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.489
Color theory,
knowing the colors you're gonna use and

5
00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.980
they don't really clash well,
things of that nature.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.125
It's very important to make sure that it's
user friendly and visually appealing.

7
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.612
That handles user two, or gatekeeper two.

8
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:29.221
Those tools,
those practices is what's gonna keep

9
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:34.149
the HR from either bringing
you to the next level or not.

10
00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.434
Cuz HR, they may not have
a technical background, but

11
00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.615
they know an ugly sight when they see it.

12
00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:46.243
You don't have to be a expert to know,
yo, this is hideous and

13
00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:49.547
I don't want to make
anyone else look at it.

14
00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:53.174
I have a saying that
the only people who look and

15
00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:56.690
use the ugly websites are developers.

16
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.057
And then anybody tells me I'm full of it,
I show them Hacker News and

17
00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:05.468
Stack Overflow, and I'm like.

18
00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:12.413
&gt;&gt; Yes, these all are trash
websites that developers only use.

19
00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:16.965
So only people that use ugly websites
are developers, and I stand by that.

20
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:19.830
Everybody else,
they want their websites to look pretty.

21
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.610
So make sure that you use
design best practices.

22
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.114
Now this isn't a mandatory one,
this will greatly help you though,

23
00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:32.396
which is using a database,
particularly if you wanna use a blog.

24
00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:36.539
Now I know there's a lot of
serverless blog options available.

25
00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.125
However, they also don't give you
the level of challenge then when it

26
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:47.151
comes gonna let someone like
automatically respect the blog.

27
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.580
I know blogs just be out there for
information, it's cool.

28
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.395
However, when you're dealing with
an older, more senior dev that's trying to

29
00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:57.160
look at your job,
you're like you use the database.

30
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.000
That's old school, I kinda like that.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.110
All right, you actually went through
the hard work of figuring out SQL.

32
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.572
And doing that, or for me,
I learned SQL and I learned Postgres

33
00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:16.458
because I learned that DARPA had
funded part of creating Postgres.

34
00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:21.266
I'm interested in using Postgres because
I know that has military history

35
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.648
that combined to it.

36
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:27.968
So that is what I want it to do,
and that is literally what

37
00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:34.520
all the things that would have
motivated me from using Postgres.

38
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.634
I highly recommend that,
while it's not mandatory,

39
00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:43.930
if you use a blog you use SQL as a way for
the storage mechanism of it.

40
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.965
So that way you can talk about
that in your interviews.

41
00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:51.150
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.219
&gt;&gt; For the database stuff,

43
00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.653
do you recommend a cloud
provider like PlanetScale or

44
00:02:57.653 --> 00:03:02.568
Supeabase, or would you just wanna use-
&gt;&gt; If you're between the two of them

45
00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:05.210
you just said, I recommend PlanetScale.

46
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.253
So Planet Scale seems, everybody,

47
00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:13.174
all the kids seem to love
PlaneScale from what I've heard.

48
00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:15.319
It seems pretty affordable too,

49
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.002
which is very important when
it comes to storage of data.

50
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:23.590
So between the two you said,
I'll say PlanetScale.

51
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.206
&gt;&gt; Do you think it'd be better to just
write it, spin it up yourself though, and

52
00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.723
not use one of those providers?

53
00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:30.132
&gt;&gt; Why would you do that?

54
00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:31.481
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

55
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; Only to prove that you can.

56
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.737
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

57
00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:36.044
&gt;&gt; I mean, if you like crying, sure.

58
00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:38.467
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I mean, everybody needs a good cry,

59
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.159
go for it, I don't care.
