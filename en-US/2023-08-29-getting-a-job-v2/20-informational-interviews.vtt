1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.407
So we're at the end of the last leg,
and for me, this is one of the most

2
00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:11.004
important ones, I guess because of
the community that I'm in is veterans.

3
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:18.015
Veterans have the worst ability
of being able to ask for help.

4
00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:23.370
I have never seen a culture that's so
ingrained on suffering

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.515
in silence as veterans,
I mean, I'm a veteran, right?

6
00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.414
So I'm part of the guilty party, right?

7
00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:35.515
But once I teach them how to network and
let them know it's okay to ask for help,

8
00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:38.747
and it's okay to talk to people
about a thing you're doing and

9
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.814
your work doesn't have to be
perfect to be out in the wild.

10
00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:46.496
And sucking at something is the first
step of being sort of good at it.

11
00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:49.371
Hashtag adventure time for
those of y'all don't see.

12
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:50.851
You knew, come here, man.

13
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.122
That's what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.338
Somebody grew up watching Cartoon Network.

15
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:59.944
So like are we okay, school?

16
00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:01.186
Parents do not love you.

17
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.071
It's okay.

18
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:03.967
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sometimes very wise.

19
00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:06.292
&gt;&gt; Yes, Jake the Dog was though.

20
00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:07.972
He had it, he was a goat.

21
00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:10.877
So, we're gonna talk about this,
this networking, and

22
00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:14.040
we're gonna talk about in
the manner that makes it impactful.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.754
I've never been one of those people
that wanna go to the meetups of

24
00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:20.397
the bunch people and
pass out cards and stuff.

25
00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:21.710
I've never been that guy.

26
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.376
I've always been a intentional
networker with a focus on

27
00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:31.053
making sure that I met the right
people at the right time.

28
00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:36.481
Even when I went to conferences, I'm known
for being at the conference but not being

29
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:41.846
at the conference because my goal with
a conference is, always have three things.

30
00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:46.205
Learn something,
meet at least one person, and

31
00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:51.627
then make sure I get a resource
that showcases that I've been

32
00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:56.751
there like a picture or
something with someone, right?

33
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:01.628
Those are always the three things
I'm trying to get me one intentional

34
00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:02.627
connection.

35
00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:08.237
Get learn one good, learn, get one
talk that's intentional that was good.

36
00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:12.512
And also get a little piece of media
that showcases, I was here and

37
00:02:12.512 --> 00:02:16.010
stuff like that then I'm
like I'm out I'm like bye,

38
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.492
see you all later I don't even want to be
here no more, smoke pop, smoke I'm gone.

39
00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:24.567
So I that's what I want
to talk to you about.

40
00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:28.580
So you all are new to the tech industry
and it could be networking is powerful,

41
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.967
super powerful tool, right, just like not
even here where you're networking with

42
00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:37.210
each other, getting resources, learn
with each other, learning new things.

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.909
Helping each other with your career
focus stuff like that, very important.

44
00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.414
Skill again establish relationships
with mentors find opportunities and

45
00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:47.422
stay up to date.

46
00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:51.862
I would say that the whole
like in my own career,

47
00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:56.191
networking has helped me
get to the point where

48
00:02:56.191 --> 00:03:00.298
the last two jobs I did
not have to apply for,

49
00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:04.748
I was actually requested to apply for,
right?

50
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:06.220
And that's where you want to get.

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.409
As you as your career progressed,

52
00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.315
you want to go from having to do these
code interviews to being recommended for

53
00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:17.100
these interviews to being
asked to interview, all right?

54
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.992
That's the natural progression,
if you're doing it right, right?

55
00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.302
If you're doing it right and
you're networking well,

56
00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.688
that's a natural progression.

57
00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:28.097
You go from, hey,
I wanna talk to you about my project and

58
00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:32.644
that person becomes the person that
you're talking to you about your work,

59
00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:37.048
to a person that is mentoring you,
to the person that is sponsoring you and

60
00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:40.130
champion you when you're not in the room,
right?

61
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.571
That's what we all aspire to have and
we all aspire to become one day for

62
00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:46.083
someone else, right?

63
00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:53.083
So first, let's begin with what I feel
like if you go to the networking MD repo.

64
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:57.193
What I feel like is the most powerful and

65
00:03:57.193 --> 00:04:01.064
most impactful form of networking.

66
00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:05.943
The informational interview,
that is where I am identifying someone

67
00:04:05.943 --> 00:04:10.574
that I have found something interesting
on or find something that I

68
00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:15.386
wanna mimic in my own career or
even if it's a company I wanna work at.

69
00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:20.785
And I request or find someone I request
and can I have an informational

70
00:04:20.785 --> 00:04:26.853
interview with them so I can pick their
brain and ask them questions, right?

71
00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:30.448
So this is not like hey,
them interviewing me for

72
00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:35.535
a role this is more me interviewing
them asking them about the roles or

73
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:38.957
ask them about something
that they've done,

74
00:04:38.957 --> 00:04:42.219
a great example in my
career I'm Paul Ford.

75
00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.470
He used to work at postflight.

76
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.183
And he now he has a startup@abroad.io.

77
00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:53.279
He wrote an article the turtle into
the entire magazine.com, What Is Code?

78
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.983
First interactive article
that Bloomberg ever did.

79
00:04:55.983 --> 00:05:00.802
If you go there,
it's an amazing article, Paul for

80
00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:04.313
What Is Code, I highly recommend it.

81
00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.521
It's so cool so many easter eggs.

82
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.420
It's the dopest article
I've ever seen in my life.

83
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.098
And of course me being into writing,
I asked him I was like,

84
00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:20.166
hey, I would really like to pick
your brain about this article.

85
00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.677
I absolutely love this article.

86
00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:25.059
So he was like sure,
what you pick my brain, so

87
00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.987
I got an informational interview with him.

88
00:05:27.987 --> 00:05:32.714
Because I looked up to like this level
of eloquence or writing and also this

89
00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:37.672
admission of having a brain that was
code reluctant and still forcing himself

90
00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:42.417
to learn how to code and still getting
to the path where he was a good coder.

91
00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:48.240
Even though he didn't take to it
naturally and things like that I was,

92
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.870
I feel like I'm in this right here
because I was young at the time I was,

93
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.651
okay, there's so much to learn.

94
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.385
Maybe I'm like him.

95
00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:04.843
And just going through this and we kept
having these conversations back and forth.

96
00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:08.325
One day I was like hey,
you wanna join my board for vets who code?

97
00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:10.840
Cuz we're working on trying
to get to the next level.

98
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.465
He was like,
I have a lot of my plate right now, no.

99
00:06:14.465 --> 00:06:19.312
Okay, I was like giant drat, but
then I remember the first lesson,

100
00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:24.432
success is an a no does not mean never,
a no means not right now, right?

101
00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:28.765
So I continue networking with him and
he continued networking with me and he

102
00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:33.389
started recommending me for opportunities
to talk, opportunities to write.

103
00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.283
And then until one day I asked him again,
get about me on a board and he was like,

104
00:06:37.283 --> 00:06:38.051
you know what?

105
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:39.287
Yeah, sure.

106
00:06:39.287 --> 00:06:40.763
And then, I was hey,

107
00:06:40.763 --> 00:06:45.362
I need a serious mentor to help me
get to the next level of my career.

108
00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:46.997
That happened about two years ago.

109
00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:49.005
And he was, all right,
how do you wanna do this?

110
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:50.669
I was, so once a month,
I wanna meet up with you,

111
00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.513
I wanna have these action items and
things like that.

112
00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:54.510
He was wow,
you've really thought about this.

113
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.798
And I was yeah, I have, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:57.798 --> 00:07:00.562
And so that happened,
and for about two years.

115
00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:03.042
Once a month, we met up,
met the action items,

116
00:07:03.042 --> 00:07:05.894
he would give me to-dos to
the point where he was like,

117
00:07:05.894 --> 00:07:09.634
I don't have anything else to tell
you what to do cuz you've done them.

118
00:07:09.634 --> 00:07:13.512
And I'm hoping that I at least helped
you some way cuz it's very rare to be

119
00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:17.538
in this type of situations where people
do what you tell them to do, right?

120
00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:21.916
Which is how what you should do when
you're networking and you're meeting

121
00:07:21.916 --> 00:07:26.237
mentors and stuff when they give you
advice, execute on it immediately.

122
00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:30.095
And let them know that you executed on it
because when you do that that makes them

123
00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:33.374
wanna tell you and give you more
advice on opportunities, right?

124
00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:36.941
And it makes them wanna champion you
in the rooms that you're not in because

125
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:39.048
that's what makes them wanna sponsor you.

126
00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:43.819
Because that you you're building that
feedback loop of trust when you're

127
00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.341
doing things, right?

128
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.497
Like that's what you want to do.

129
00:07:47.497 --> 00:07:51.472
You wanna keep building that
feedback loop of trust, but hey,

130
00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:54.780
dude, if you do this to be better,
hey, I did that.

131
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.074
This was my metrics.

132
00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:59.238
This is what happened and they're
like it took you a week to do that.

133
00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:03.426
Well yeah, it was only one of my to dues
and I was like, I made it mandatory.

134
00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:04.380
Like that's super cool.

135
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:11.620
You put what I said in front of your to
do list and you knocked it out, right?

136
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.845
Informationals.

137
00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:16.291
That's how our relationship started
with the informational interview.

138
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:20.704
I have many troops that we have
what we call slack side chats or

139
00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:24.252
used to call them that,
but now we call it drill,

140
00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:29.389
which is like very famous technologists
come and talk to my veterans.

141
00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:33.616
And I always ensure that sometimes
that I connect one of them to

142
00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:37.940
one of my veterans so
they can have informational interviews.

143
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.833
So that over the course of years of
building these relationships they will

144
00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.678
have these people who can mentor and
sponsor as well.

145
00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:47.618
But that is how the information
interviews work.

146
00:08:47.618 --> 00:08:52.167
You see you're asking about advice,
guidance from an experienced

147
00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:56.477
individual to provide valuable
insights to their career path,

148
00:08:56.477 --> 00:08:59.748
industry in the trends or
job market dynamics and

149
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:04.480
that becomes something bigger over
time if you're doing this right.
