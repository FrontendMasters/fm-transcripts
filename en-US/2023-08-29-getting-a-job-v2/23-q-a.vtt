1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.272
I am done, so
let's start with a general Q&amp;A.

2
00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:10.834
Cuz I know there's a lot of questions
that are in the channel as well.

3
00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:15.071
&gt;&gt; Do you think that there's still a job
market for frontend specialists or

4
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:18.419
are companies more interested
in full stack engineers?

5
00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.594
&gt;&gt; There will always be a job market for
specialists of any kind.

6
00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:28.987
I think this idea,
like we said about the whole full stack

7
00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.200
thing being kind of treated as mythical.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.564
There's a big difference between
generalist and full stack, being good at

9
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:41.352
different, you could be a back end and
be understanding of multiple co languages.

10
00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:44.563
You could be backend and be C# and go.

11
00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:48.701
But it's a little different than
I know the entire stack entirety.

12
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:51.449
So being a full stack generalist,

13
00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.710
meaningful stack specialist
is still very much in demand.

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.037
Being a specialist of any type is
in demand whether it's frontend,

15
00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:07.810
backend, DevOps,
cloud native, iOS, mobile,

16
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.364
being a specialist is
always gonna be in demand.

17
00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.959
&gt;&gt; Another question.

18
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.638
This is about personal websites.

19
00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:25.760
Do you feel very creative websites work
with a lot of animations or a game?

20
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.602
Do you recommend going super creative and
fancy or making it simple and

21
00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:34.965
focused on actual content that
I want to present about myself?

22
00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:39.950
&gt;&gt; As a junior,
I do recommend the content-focused

23
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.352
ones versus the very
fancy ones as a junior.

24
00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:49.745
Cuz your first focus is getting that role.

25
00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:54.052
I tend to see those more fancy ones for
people that have already made a name for

26
00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:57.705
themselves or trying to make
a much bigger name for themselves.

27
00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:01.742
And the portfolio is the show.

28
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:07.519
So I don't recommend but as a junior,
you don't want it to be like that,

29
00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.234
especially when you're
trying to find a job.

30
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:17.400
And you're also risking using technologies
that might break one day out of nowhere.

31
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.649
I'm not a big fan of the super
phaser five WebGL type

32
00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:27.913
websites cuz you never
know what's gonna happen.

33
00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:33.605
&gt;&gt; My question is, for finding these
different open source opportunities,

34
00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:38.573
a lot of the times when I've been
reviewing some of the feature and

35
00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:41.485
pull requests and that kind of thing.

36
00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:43.378
A lot of them are a little
bit too complex for

37
00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:46.383
myself as a beginner to really jump
into and get into the weeds with.

38
00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:51.328
How do I identify the right
opportunities and the right things where

39
00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:55.937
it's not something where
something's deceptively simple.

40
00:02:55.937 --> 00:03:00.732
And then I end up wasting a whole bunch
of time trying to do something that's

41
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:02.950
probably outside of my skill set.

42
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.372
&gt;&gt; I have one better.

43
00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:11.552
What's stopping you from reaching out to
whoever made that ticket or that issue and

44
00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:16.510
see if they could either walk you through
the issue that they're having, or B,

45
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.407
pair with you on an issue
that you're having.

46
00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:24.008
So that way you could be the driver,
they can be the I

47
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:28.930
don't know what y'all call
it in the civilian terms,

48
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.439
we call it a,
shooter-spotter in Vets Who Code.

49
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.273
Because well, we're comfortable with those
terms, but I guess on a civilian term,

50
00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:39.089
you guys call it driver-
&gt;&gt; Co-pilot.

51
00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.402
&gt;&gt; Co-pilot.

52
00:03:41.402 --> 00:03:42.740
&gt;&gt; Driver navigator,.

53
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.119
&gt;&gt; Navigator, who's in that?

54
00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.434
Who uses a navigator?

55
00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.605
Everybody uses a Siri now, right?

56
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:52.127
All right, cool, driver navigator, so-
&gt;&gt; Look at the screen cuz the other person

57
00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:53.584
needs to keep their eyes on the road.

58
00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:57.389
&gt;&gt; No one's doing that [LAUGH].

59
00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.053
Yeah, all right, so
driver navigator, right?

60
00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:05.407
So since you're a junior, you're driving
while the senior person is navigating.

61
00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:12.192
And that way you're understanding the
problems that this open source issue has,

62
00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:17.304
while also taking the opportunity
to learn more than coding,

63
00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:21.551
hard skill coding opportunity
with someone else.

64
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.393
So that's what I would recommend first,
before trying to identify.

65
00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:29.971
Instead of trying to identify a problem
you can do on your own, try identify

66
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:34.490
an opportunity to make it solve two
to three birds with one stone, right?

67
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.386
Now you solved collaboration, you're
pairing, you're learning something new,

68
00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:42.379
someone is getting,
you're networking, right?

69
00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.737
You have all these things
now that you just solved.

70
00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:49.705
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:54.265
&gt;&gt; So I was wondering about there's
constantly new hot technology

72
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:55.791
that's coming out.

73
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:59.674
Like you were saying, Rust is a big new
thing that's supposed to kind of take

74
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.688
over according to Primeagen, right?

75
00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:03.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

76
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.143
&gt;&gt; There's things like Svelte or Tailwind,
and they're really hot on Twitter,

77
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:15.370
but there's not much of a job market for
those skills yet.

78
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.937
Is there a way to kind of
differentiate what's worth

79
00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:22.596
learning skill-wise versus
what's just the talk?

80
00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:24.672
&gt;&gt; Ignore the noise.

81
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:27.710
There used to be a term
called signal versus noise.

82
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.668
And I'm always looking for
the signal versus the noise so

83
00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:34.180
while everybody's on Twitter
talking about something exciting,

84
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.966
I'm gonna pull up the exciting
they're looking at.

85
00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:40.847
I'm either gonna research it on
LinkedIn or Indeed or somewhere, and

86
00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:42.567
I'm gonna look at the market.

87
00:05:42.567 --> 00:05:46.645
And if the market is not
reflecting what the excitement

88
00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:51.430
on the Twitters are saying,
I'm old, it's the Twitters now,

89
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.964
I'm not going to pay any
attention to what they say, right?

90
00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:59.740
&gt;&gt; So unless you're seeing
30,000 open positions for Rust.

91
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.790
&gt;&gt; Not even 30,000, I'm talking closer to
maybe, I'll just do a national search and

92
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.463
I saw 30,000 and wouldn't even be worth
coming having a conversation for it.

93
00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:17.026
Because 50 states,
how many engineering jobs?

94
00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:18.002
Last time I checked,

95
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.484
there's 17 million engineering jobs
opening United States of America.

96
00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:26.869
So 30,000 jobs of a language
on a national search,

97
00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:31.814
I wouldn't even consider that for
a conversation.

98
00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:36.475
I'm looking at it has to have
at least anywhere from 75 to 100

99
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:40.733
before I'm starting to talk
to my troops about it ,right?

100
00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:46.571
So it was a .NET role, .NET,
that's a good one to go.

101
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:53.769
React, Node, if it was Python with Flask,
or maybe Python with Django.

102
00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:58.532
We were talking about Angular,
we were talking about I

103
00:06:58.532 --> 00:07:03.399
would do that even with View,
I don't see enough data to

104
00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.495
make me want to trust giving
people you should learn view.

105
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:13.620
Like you said, if someone asked me about
Java, I'd be like, yes, learn Java.

106
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.030
Cuz Java's been around forever and
pretty much.

107
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.866
If you have a hospital in your town,
that means you have Java.

108
00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:25.869
So that means there's probably people
that have gone in other companies and

109
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:28.004
implemented Java everywhere, right?

110
00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:30.409
Java's a great language to learn.

111
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.445
It has a great ecosystem with main impact
just all the other stuff to learn, right.

112
00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:38.833
That's something that the data shows,
right?

113
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.674
You have a college educational place or

114
00:07:41.674 --> 00:07:47.539
a hospital that's usually built around
the tech sector ecosystem of your city.

115
00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:50.021
You're gonna have C# and Java.

116
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:55.723
So those are two really trustworthy
backends for you to go towards, right?

117
00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:59.764
Whereas we were talking,
like I said, unfortunately, Go and

118
00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:05.197
Rust aren't up there yet when it comes to,
okay, what's the trustworthiness of.

119
00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:09.803
I'm talking to someone who has two
kids and they're putting all their

120
00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:13.951
energy in learning how to code for
a better life for their kids.

121
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:16.813
Am I gonna recommend for
them learn Go or Rust?

122
00:08:16.813 --> 00:08:21.261
And I couldn't do that in good faith,

123
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:26.960
versus C#, .NET, and
Java with Spring Boot.

124
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.271
Yeah, I can do that.

125
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:33.098
Yeah, you should absolutely
learn that your chances

126
00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:36.433
of getting a job is much higher, so.

127
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.932
&gt;&gt; So for someone changing industries,

128
00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:42.450
they don't have a good sense
of what are the options.

129
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.300
What are some indicators for
the new person to see that I

130
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.369
should be pursuing backend,
I should be pursuing APIs.

131
00:08:52.369 --> 00:08:55.865
&gt;&gt; I don't look at it like that,
which you should be pursuing.

132
00:08:55.865 --> 00:09:00.451
First, you should be doing
a research to see where is

133
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.112
the most lucrative for your skill level.

134
00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:07.653
You're going to be entry level, you should
know where entry level jobs are like.

135
00:09:07.653 --> 00:09:13.416
For instance, the chances of going
entry level without any, zero technical

136
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:18.836
experience anywhere in a cloud role or
something, that's very small.

137
00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:23.261
Whereas if you have experience in
something, something some way, shape, or

138
00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:27.295
form of building in scripting or
anything, your chances go up higher.

139
00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:32.934
But it's usually a mid tier job, right?

140
00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:37.323
Versus saying, I want to go backend and
I want to go frontend.

141
00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:39.950
Okay, those both have entry level roles.

142
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.064
But now we're talking about DevOps,
for instance.

143
00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:46.067
When you talk about DevOps,
that's a slightly more senior role,

144
00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:49.652
than entry level and
then when it comes to juniors, right?

145
00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:52.006
So that's like, okay,
your chances are gonna go low.

146
00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:57.033
So that's where we have to have
those type of conversations,

147
00:09:57.033 --> 00:10:00.136
not like which part do we really need?

148
00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:05.171
All right, no, which is the best chances,
and then we go off which part, right?

149
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.697
API design is a part of backend, right?

150
00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:12.748
So you have to know, backend language
in order to build APIs, right?

151
00:10:12.748 --> 00:10:15.093
You have to know Python.

152
00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:18.360
And you could do it with Python or
you could just do Python Flask, right?

153
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.735
You have to do these to
be able to build an API.

154
00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:26.913
You just can't do that solo
by itself whereas just

155
00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:32.600
talking about API design by itself,
that means what?

156
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.681
Anybody can do that.

157
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.610
So, I mean, not anybody can do that but

158
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.192
anybody with any backend
conversation can do that.

159
00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:40.450
So you gotta learn backend first, right?

160
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.936
You wanna do DevOps, you should probably
learn a few backend languages, right?

161
00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:48.863
Because you need to learn about build
pipelines and you probably should learn

162
00:10:48.863 --> 00:10:52.513
a lease AWS or Azure or
maybe a little bit of both, right.

163
00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:57.188
And then from there you need to
learn how to be able to connect

164
00:10:57.188 --> 00:11:01.770
a website to build pipelines
from one of those to GitHub and

165
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.553
so that people can see the builds and
things based upon that.

166
00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:12.775
It's a deeper conversation than just,
hey, where do I learn, where do I start?

167
00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:14.401
And that's why you should research it,
right?

168
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:19.108
And do informationals, ask people,
look for people in your community.

169
00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:22.553
It's not like how it was
when I was growing up

170
00:11:22.553 --> 00:11:27.502
where all the people that know
how to code were hidden, right?

171
00:11:27.502 --> 00:11:31.255
I didn't even know the coding was
a job till I was like 26, 27.

172
00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:34.445
I just thought people got an LLC and
a website popped up.

173
00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:37.131
I was like, okay, that's cool.

174
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:41.711
Now I know the difference,
I know the facts, right?

175
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:44.286
No, people built these things, right?

176
00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:47.394
So like they're not hidden anymore.

177
00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:52.359
So have them do that research to
figure out which path to go once

178
00:11:52.359 --> 00:11:56.092
they get beyond frontend or
backend, right?

179
00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:57.610
What languages should you learn,

180
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.868
that's more important than whether
you should go frontend and backend.

181
00:12:00.868 --> 00:12:03.358
All right,
you can't go wrong with JavaScript.

182
00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:09.732
But which jobs are hiring in your area,
in your region, Angular or React.

183
00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:14.660
Angular used to be very much
a higher tier framework if

184
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.042
you're in hospitals,
colleges in your city,

185
00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:25.850
versus if you're in a more start-up
friendly city, React was, right?

186
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.064
If you're in a city that isn't a tech hub,
but has tech jobs,

187
00:12:30.064 --> 00:12:34.049
then you're gonna have,
like I said, Java Spring Boot.

188
00:12:34.049 --> 00:12:40.170
You're gonna have C# and .NET, and you
might have PHP as to prevalent backends.

189
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.828
So even if you're backend,

190
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.776
you might not want to be like backend
learning TypeScript and Node.

191
00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:48.002
You want to be one of the other ones,
right?

192
00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:52.060
So that's how you should be looking at it,
and framing it, and thinking of it.
