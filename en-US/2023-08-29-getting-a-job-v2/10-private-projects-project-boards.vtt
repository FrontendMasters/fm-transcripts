00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.989
What strategies can you employ that
address the challenge of showcasing your

2
00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:05.070
expertise?

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.473
If what you've done is completed
in private work and repos and

4
00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:09.800
that kind of thing.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.966
&gt;&gt; All right, so that's a very good
question, especially if you're in

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.110
a FinTech company that they're
not sharing a lot of that work.

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.093
So, do portfolio,
that is where the strength is, and

8
00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:24.867
doing your portfolio In a manner
to how you do it professionally.

9
00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:29.583
One thing that I've been telling
people to do that have that is to now

10
00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:34.136
implement GitHub projects as a part
of their portfolio repo, and

11
00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:38.605
from using GitHub projects as
a part of your portfolio repo, and

12
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:44.446
writing tickets out of the steps you're
going to do with your with your portfolio.

13
00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:50.082
And then converting those to issues,
then doing that work, closing that issue.

14
00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:55.181
What that does is shows breadcrumbs
of the work that you're doing in

15
00:00:55.181 --> 00:01:00.817
a professional manner, that helps you,
the user look and showcase,

16
00:01:00.817 --> 00:01:06.093
this is how you work, okay, cuz so
this is how you would work in a job and

17
00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:09.330
you're showcasing that work on your own.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.670
So, there you go, right?

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.020
Cuz that's what you really wanna showcase.

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.110
You don't wanna just showcase
the work that you've done.

21
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.670
You wanna showcase that,
how you do the work, right?

22
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.288
I wrote a ticket,
I moved the ticket from todo to doing,

23
00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:31.295
I converted that ticket to an issue,
I completed that ticket.

24
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:36.912
I asked a friend to review it for me.

25
00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:40.421
Somebody reviewed, and I had Alsike
collaborator review it for me.

26
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:44.938
They said it was good,
I merged it back in,

27
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:49.208
and now I move that ticket to done, yes.

28
00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.981
&gt;&gt; You leveraged a little more
about what projects actually are.

29
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:52.841
&gt;&gt; It's perfect, yeah.

30
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:58.181
So, I'm right here,

31
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.402
what I want to do,

32
00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:08.455
I'll make a new one.

33
00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:13.742
So repos, new,

34
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:19.408
choose an owner,

35
00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:22.817
me, new,

36
00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:32.754
New-jerome-portfolio, right?

37
00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:38.983
I'll make it public, add a read me,

38
00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:44.610
Create a repo, I'm done, right?

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.460
So, first thing I'm gonna do right here.

40
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.190
Now, I have my portfolio
is not start coding.

41
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.620
I'm gonna start planning.

42
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.070
Where do I start planning?

43
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.156
I don't know.

44
00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.230
I go here.

45
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.340
What's this project tap is?

46
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.570
Projects?

47
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.480
Do I link a project?

48
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.680
I don't have a project to link.

49
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.900
I'm gonna go, new project.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.300
Press new project.

51
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.740
Do I want a table?

52
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.340
Do I want a board?

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.294
Do I want a roadmap?

54
00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:21.201
I like Kanban, I'm gonna go use a board.

55
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.540
There you go.

56
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.730
Board, I'm gonna rename it, New portfolio,

57
00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.150
I can give a description later,
that's not important.

58
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.410
I can manage the access,
because I want the users to see it.

59
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.440
I'm gonna make it public, right?

60
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.410
So, because I wanna use this as a tool,
right?

61
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.220
Not just as,
this is just a thing I'm doing.

62
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.370
I wanna use this as a tool
that helps me get jobs.

63
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.340
So now, I made it public, so
people can go to it and view it.

64
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.000
I can even add it as a link in my repo.

65
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.840
They click on it, they see it.

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.189
So now, let's say first thing I

67
00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.331
need to do is, I need a small ticket,

68
00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:26.130
create, I want to

69
00:04:28.859 --> 00:04:32.707
Create folders for projects, for project.

70
00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:38.524
As you know, I have folders of project,
I might just start a plain project, right?

71
00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.612
So, click here.

72
00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:49.250
I have the edit button right here.

73
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.090
I'm edit as a ticket.

74
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.822
I'm gonna create a developer
ticket off of it,

75
00:04:53.822 --> 00:04:58.590
where I'm gonna be like is a blank,
I want blank, right?

76
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.272
So, as a developer,

77
00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:10.270
I need to add the folder

78
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.955
structure where I'm

79
00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:22.268
going to put my my HTML,

80
00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:28.583
CSS, my JavaScript and

81
00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:33.979
my assets, right?

82
00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.780
There you go.

83
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.919
Now that I have edited it,
I can assign to myself.

84
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.300
And I am done.

85
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.080
So now, I have this todo right here.

86
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.680
I can fill this up with all the todos I
need to create debates of my website.

87
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.450
I could do like 10,
10 a week, could do that.

88
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.981
And then every week,
I take it over here to in progress,

89
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.690
go to these three ellipses,
convert to issue,

90
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:28.130
add the repo I want the issue to be
converted to, and now I'm done, right?

91
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.092
Now, that converted it to an issue.

92
00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:34.271
Once I get done with that work.

93
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:37.662
I can go to done but,

94
00:06:40.797 --> 00:06:46.377
I can now go to the issue,
here is the issue, right?

95
00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:51.746
Now, I can sit here,
I have the status of it is done,

96
00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:56.029
a sign right there, labels nothing yet.

97
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:58.626
It was a good first issue,
I guess, for me.

98
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.770
Completed, and then I'm gonna close with
the comment, now closes issue, right?

99
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.600
And that's gonna be a part of my workflow,
using my portfolio.

100
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.965
I'm a project in my new portfolio that
I'll be able to also put in my repo and

101
00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.490
showcase it away.

102
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.320
What does this look like?

103
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.940
Well, if you wanna see more of my statuses
on my portfolio, click this link here and

104
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.120
have like, okay, that's cool.

105
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.758
And they're like, wow,

106
00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:33.150
this person's knocked out like 40
tickets on their portfolio, and

107
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.672
they've been continuously doing that work,
and that's how you build trust, right?

108
00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:44.292
Especially when you have projects that you
work in a silo, like type of environment

109
00:07:44.292 --> 00:07:49.960
where you can't showcase all your work,
but cuz you have to have a portfolio.

110
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.851
Boss can't say you have to have portfolio,
and

111
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:57.836
this is a great way when you want to play
with new technologies and stuff like that,

112
00:07:57.836 --> 00:08:01.159
you build these tickets out
on this project board, and

113
00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:05.783
then from the project board you start
moving in over, creating the issues,

114
00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:10.696
doing the work, moving it over, closing
the issues, and you kind of like say you

115
00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:15.657
create this paper trail of your work
&gt;&gt; As a person online who has a project

116
00:08:15.657 --> 00:08:19.570
that he's done a lot of work on,
on the client and

117
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.730
he's proud of it, but it's not live.

118
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.878
There's instructions for spinning it up
locally, but it's not live out there yet,

119
00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:32.382
so
&gt;&gt; I think his next step after this course

120
00:08:32.382 --> 00:08:39.103
should be to make it live, you want
that tangibility of this is live, right?

121
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:42.237
That's what you want.

122
00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:43.778
If you're trying to get a job,

123
00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:46.520
having a live projects is
the best way to do it, right?

124
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.319
Projects, products, things that people can

125
00:08:51.319 --> 00:08:55.501
use is the best, my friend Ken Wheeler,

126
00:08:55.501 --> 00:09:01.330
he comes from a non-technical background,
right?

127
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.599
He created slick slider,

128
00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:08.762
which was a JQuery slider that
helped pick carousel stuff.

129
00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:11.540
That was his first project.

130
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.760
To him, it was a simple project,
but it changed the tech world.

131
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.070
Everybody was having the same problem.

132
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.240
He made something that
solved that problem.

133
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.960
And that was his big claim to fame in
tech, was like, I created slick carousel.

134
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.100
And I was like, yo, that's super cool.

135
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.930
I met him because of that, that's what
you wanna do, things that people can use,

136
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.490
they are tangible.

137
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.333
That is good especially if you're
coming from a non-traditional path,

138
00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:46.473
a non-computer science path,
that is the stuff that's going

139
00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:50.005
to make people take the chance,
take the risk on you.

140
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:55.053
&gt;&gt; Yeah I echo that sentiment, actually
finishing a project and deploying it.

141
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.738
People think they're further
along a lot of times, and

142
00:09:57.738 --> 00:10:01.063
it's always the last 10% of
a project that's 90% of the work.

143
00:10:01.063 --> 00:10:02.924
So, if you think it's far along,

144
00:10:02.924 --> 00:10:06.210
it's probably less far along
than you actually think it is.

145
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.437
To ship something is much much more
difficult than you would think, and

146
00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:12.762
a lot of times when I'm interviewing,

147
00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:16.580
I want to know that this person
has not just worked on a project.

148
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.676
They've not just put their hands on it,
but they've actually shipped something,

149
00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:25.850
because that is what turns,
&gt;&gt; That's very funny, cuz I have a rule.

150
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.783
I tell people, my troops,
I'm like it's okay,

151
00:10:29.783 --> 00:10:35.310
you're not even a real programmer
until you've shipped something,

152
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.712
then broken it, [LAUGH] and
then brought it back to life,

153
00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:43.110
that's when you're a real programmer.

154
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.920
&gt;&gt; So, what if it's like
a command line interface tool?

155
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.150
&gt;&gt; CLI?

156
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.739
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, first,

157
00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:52.240
you can make it as a node package.

158
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.560
So, things like fig io, I do.

159
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.293
&gt;&gt; I made something for
a friend who was running a game, and

160
00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.063
&gt;&gt; Yeah, or do you have demo video of it.

161
00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:04.764
&gt;&gt; No.

162
00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:09.230
&gt;&gt; Minimum get that, and
I would make it into a package.

163
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.690
So that way, there's somewhere
live where they can pull it.

164
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.478
It isn't on a repo, right?

165
00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:19.239
You'd be amazed how small projects
like that turn impactful for you.
