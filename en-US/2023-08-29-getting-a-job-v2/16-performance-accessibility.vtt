1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.617
Optimize for speed.

2
00:00:01.617 --> 00:00:05.638
In this game, looking good is great,
but speed kills.

3
00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:11.198
If your website is less than sub
three seconds, and it's slow.

4
00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.528
And if it's slow people
are going to leave it.

5
00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:19.491
It is gonna get bad scores on Lighthouse,
it is gonna be considered clunky.

6
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.582
You're not going to get the desired
results if your site is pretty slow.

7
00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:27.645
I literally had an experience of that
personally a few years ago when I was

8
00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:31.456
learning how to code like maybe six
seven years ago on the frontend.

9
00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:37.324
And my website was gorgeous, but
I had an image that was huge.

10
00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:42.408
And I had not properly sized it,
and it was slowing the whole

11
00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:48.013
website down on first paint and
I was getting emails from people.

12
00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:52.767
You know how slow your website has to
be to get emails from people [LAUGH].

13
00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.850
Why is this site so slow?

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.863
And I was, wow,
I'll go check on that now, sir.

15
00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:03.772
So [LAUGH] that is how
like important it is to

16
00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:08.253
make sure that website is optimized for
speed.

17
00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:08.761
Yes.

18
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.599
&gt;&gt; Yep, example about today when you were
showing up sample portfolio earlier.

19
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.936
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You clicked away from the first one

20
00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:15.779
because it wasn't loading.

21
00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.325
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like what's going on,
I'm like, nah, I'm going away.

22
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:21.941
So that's a real thing.

23
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.270
It's happened to me once, and I still
remember cuz I had received three emails

24
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.165
from people, like, okay,
what's going on here?

25
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.850
I was like I'll figure it It out,
I don't know.

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.559
Why you'll calling me,
it's lunch go away [LAUGH].

27
00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:39.025
Well, you can't do that.

28
00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:42.976
Also you know a great way to do that
deliver your stuff over CDN but

29
00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:47.893
I do not recommend that unless you're
having large complex websites, right?

30
00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:52.992
Don't CDN on like your baby SPA, right?

31
00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:57.135
It has to be something meaty,
all right, before you start doing CDN.

32
00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:02.249
And like, before they make sure you have
your images render at the right size,

33
00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.208
make sure that your CSS is minified,
make sure that you don't have a bunch of

34
00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.161
CSS and JavaScript that you're
not using in your code base,

35
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.290
get rid of all that junk
that's not being used.

36
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.887
That's why we have version control.

37
00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:18.026
If you're not going to use it,

38
00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:22.239
don't be that person that has
chunks of code come in and out.

39
00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.542
Just new Git, make a new branch,
a new Git flag and put it back in,

40
00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.614
that's all we have version control, right?

41
00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:34.895
So the code that we deleted, we can go
find it again if we wanted to, all right?

42
00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:37.353
Or maybe even write it better.

43
00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:38.813
But yeah, focus on speed.

44
00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:40.582
Now this one, use testing.

45
00:02:40.582 --> 00:02:45.754
This next one, right after optimize for
speed, is use testing.

46
00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:50.435
I think this one is only if you're like,
not using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

47
00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:54.651
Once you get past that and you're using
React, you need to be using testing.

48
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:57.407
It has to be unit testing
that's being done.

49
00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:00.979
One, that is what a professional would do,
right?

50
00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:06.220
A professional would not put a website out
in the wild that's using framework and

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.618
not test it, right?

52
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.546
That's just not what we do.

53
00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:12.133
We want to be employed, right?

54
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:16.239
And to be employed, you have to do
things that employed people do, right?

55
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.619
They don't put websites out in
the wild without tests on them, right?

56
00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.351
Like that's not what we do,
in these streets, all right?

57
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:27.079
So you're gonna be using,
so you have to add testing,

58
00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.141
if you're using React,
using XJS, using Angular, Vue.

59
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:34.901
If you're using a backend framework,
like Node, or

60
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.673
if you're using .NET,
you need to be adding tests.

61
00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:42.132
If you're making APIs, you're getting
tested those APIs, you need to be adding.

62
00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:45.121
If you're using API's you need
to be adding test to it, right?

63
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:50.003
So you have to be adding a test so that we
can see if the API fails in the console,

64
00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:50.770
all right?

65
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.384
So we have to create the type of
vigilance within our products, right?

66
00:03:57.384 --> 00:04:00.968
So because that's what
a professional does and and

67
00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:03.893
it helps the quality of the application.

68
00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:08.269
&gt;&gt; Does Postman count for testing APIs?

69
00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.505
&gt;&gt; I'll allow it.

70
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:14.415
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes, and no, but I mean, baby steps,

71
00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:16.196
we all started somewhere.

72
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:18.818
So it's cool.

73
00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:22.053
Accessibility, I have a belief,
and a lot of us,

74
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.834
I feel like front end is starting
to get more towards this.

75
00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:31.847
But I have a belief where if a product
is not accessible, it is not done.

76
00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:32.814
What does that mean?

77
00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:38.692
For me,
it means making your foreground background

78
00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:43.509
text to background stuff is 4 to 1 ratio.

79
00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.967
Making sure that your website is tabbable,
right?

80
00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:52.741
If I was to go to, great example would be.

81
00:04:56.733 --> 00:05:01.360
I'm here, you see everything that you
need to be clickable is tabbable.

82
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.581
I can go and press Shift Tab and
go backwards.

83
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:06.843
I can tab and go right here.

84
00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:09.160
I can press here.

85
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.773
Enter, Tab, tab within, go to this Tab.

86
00:05:12.773 --> 00:05:20.613
I can escape those tabs by going this way.

87
00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:24.658
I have a skip to main link, in case I
just don't want to go through any of this

88
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.305
stuff, and
I can press that to go straight here.

89
00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:29.520
That's what I mean by accessible.

90
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.944
I wanna make sure that
the website is accessible.

91
00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:35.481
If it's not accessible, it's not done.

92
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:39.134
So, you have to start thinking
about that as a user,

93
00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:42.885
as a frontend that accessibility
is very important.

94
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:47.153
Around 2018-2019, people were
getting sued millions of dollars for

95
00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:49.261
not having their website accessible.

96
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:50.288
That started.

97
00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:56.134
I remember the first one that we saw
came down a pipeline was like 2019.

98
00:05:56.134 --> 00:06:00.705
It was Domino's Pizza,
they had just been sued for

99
00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:04.013
$23 million for ADA violations.

100
00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:08.878
Because their website did not
have the same accessibility

101
00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:13.454
quality as their on-site stores,
and we were shook.

102
00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:17.520
Everybody was like,
my goodness, $23 million.

103
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.070
For not having accessibility, they took me
off any project I had at work at CBS and

104
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.742
they were like your job now
is accessibility [LAUGH] for

105
00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:28.227
the rest of the year.

106
00:06:28.227 --> 00:06:32.371
Brett put me on accessibility tickets for
the whole year.

107
00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:37.049
And I did them so
well I would go down to Jacksonville and

108
00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:43.151
talking about the work we had did at
our projects, at work, at the HQ for

109
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:49.590
CBS Sports, and they were just like,
wow, you did all this work already?

110
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.756
I was like, yeah, well,

111
00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:53.673
we kinda had to because they were
already talking about suing us.

112
00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:58.420
So it's very serious and
you do not want to be the person who's

113
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.263
like why is our accessibility
trash after the $160 million

114
00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:07.579
lawsuit comes down and
we have to fight for this lawyer.

115
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:08.536
You don't wanna be that person.

116
00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:11.685
You wanna be the person where I didn't
even know this was a problem, but

117
00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:12.273
I can fix it.

118
00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:13.718
You wanna be that person.

119
00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:16.790
So make sure you are using accessibility,
right,

120
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.440
doing your accessibility best practices.

121
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.988
&gt;&gt; Do you recommend test
driven development?

122
00:07:22.988 --> 00:07:28.553
&gt;&gt; I don't recommend test driven
development, but I do see it's value.

123
00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:32.597
I'm one of those people that you
should have rules around testing.

124
00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:37.240
I know that I don't believe
in 100% test coverage.

125
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.129
Why are we testing doing test
coverage on texts, right?

126
00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.553
I believe in test coverage on
things that are important,

127
00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:49.378
or things that are financed or

128
00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:55.035
they impact the wellness of the org or
the website, right?

129
00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:59.201
If it doesn't impact the business or
it doesn't impact the website,

130
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:04.084
like a forum or something like that,
then I don't believe in testing it, right?

131
00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:09.750
So for me, I'm not a big a 100% TDD fan,
but I see it as value,

132
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.398
and I'm not gonna be like
against it as well, right?

133
00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:16.140
Test accordingly, it is all I say.
