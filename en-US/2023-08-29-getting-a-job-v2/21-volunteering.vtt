1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.730
Second one volunteering however it is done
improperly in a lot of places right so

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.876
volunteering at Tech conferences is
a great way to expand your network and

3
00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:18.925
gain valuable industry insights right?

4
00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:24.469
Also offers unique opportunities
to hang out with the speakers and

5
00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.232
the movers and
shakers in the Tech industry.

6
00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:32.340
However, it can be done in a right and
wrong way.

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.421
I have seen people who volunteer and
they're so busy being hanging out with

8
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.450
the cool kids and not making sure
they hang out with the right kids.

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.770
My first rule of volunteering
is I don't want to

10
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.530
volunteer at a cool kids conference.

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.820
Like that's just something I don't
do if I'm trying to get a job.

12
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.770
I don't go to cool kids conferences,
because cool kid conferences

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.360
are usually cool kid confidence because
they're not heavy on the hard stuff.

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.550
And so because they're not
heavy on the hard stuff.

15
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700
The people that have the jobs,
they're usually not there.

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880
So that's been my experience.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.920
Like the party conferences, the people
with the jobs, they're not going there.

18
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.477
They're going to the boring ones that
are talking about the hard stuff this

19
00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:23.399
tightly coupled with the business logic
that's gonna focus how their company is

20
00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.380
gonna make revenue in
the next two to five years.

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.270
So technology, right?

22
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.290
Those are the conferences you wanna be at.

23
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.370
Those are the ones you
wanna be volunteering for.

24
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.187
Those are the ones that you want to have
these have those conversations are like,

25
00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:38.785
The one is talking about how
great if I go to a conference and

26
00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:41.399
I don't think people are telling
us how great the food is.

27
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.780
I'm not gonna be at that conference.

28
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.860
Like I need a conference where
people want to talk about the tech,

29
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.050
talk about how great
the technical talks are.

30
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.320
All I hear about is the music
is the food is how cool.

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.620
How many cool people are there?

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.900
I'm like, yeah, that's cool.

33
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.109
How many people there that could
they could hire you on site

34
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.061
though like wasn't that no one get
hired on site okay you got a DJ and

35
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:16.695
no one else that alright cool
that's fine I'm gonna go home and

36
00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:19.600
no no shave my dog or something.

37
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.210
I don't know.

38
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.770
So like that's how I view it, right?

39
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.850
So when you're thinking about volun-
because this is your time, right?

40
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.010
And time is money.

41
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.460
And time is capacity to make money.

42
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.617
You could be spending your time doing
something better like interviewing,

43
00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:35.318
practicing interviewing skills, building
more substantial projects, anything like

44
00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:38.640
that versus being in a conference is
nothing but a waste of your time.

45
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.192
Right?

46
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:43.376
So when you're thinking
about volunteering,

47
00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:49.070
focus on those conferences
that are going to be boring.

48
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.420
The only exception to that
are if the companies or

49
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.320
if it's a company ran conference.

50
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.710
Usually company ran
conferences are both fun.

51
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.170
And also very insightful
because they only make it fun.

52
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.504
So people will stay but they want you
to spend money on their products so

53
00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:12.059
they're talking about you know really
good products right like Google IO

54
00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.200
that's a fun conference and if you get in.

55
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.689
You're gonna be happy volunteering like
getting those places are super fun so

56
00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.042
that's the only exception to tech
conferences when they're fun is like fun

57
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:28.395
day conferences that are ran by
the companies like AWS Microsoft, Google,

58
00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.749
if you get on any of those conference,
get opportunity to go to any of those go

59
00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:37.579
you're definitely gonna learn something
and you're definitely gonna have fun and

60
00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.853
they don't even need alcohol to do it.

61
00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:44.421
So like that's what I recommend.Make sure
if you are going to volunteer at a tech

62
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:45.750
conference.

63
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.830
You know what experts you're
trying to reach out to.

64
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.630
Or you know what this tech
conference is about for you.

65
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.398
For instance, he wants to go to cloud
computing probably shouldn't be at

66
00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.590
Reactify to thought, right harsh reality.

67
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.270
Cloud computing, edge computing,

68
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.650
he should probably be looking at
Cloud players tech conference.

69
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.829
Views are looking and

70
00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.219
see what the Cloudflare dev developer
advocates where are these people talking

71
00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.020
at right you're back in you talked about
we talked about authentication, right?

72
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.940
So you should be talking and looking
at where's the off guys gonna be yet?

73
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.846
Because those guys mean
they might know more about

74
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:28.880
where's the good conferences are anyway,
like Corey?

75
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.066
I'm forgetting his his name
Cory Weathers okay look up

76
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:40.151
Cory weathers he's in hit of a dead
advocacy it auth I believe and

77
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:44.545
he will help you he does
a lot of backend stuff he

78
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:49.410
definitely does a lot of
talks all over the globe.

79
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.617
He can definitely point you to the right,
like tech conferences if you're like for

80
00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:55.130
back end and stuff like that.

81
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.580
He's a he's a C sharp guy,
so nobody's perfect.

82
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.571
He's cool, but-
&gt;&gt; Java than Microsoft, Java.

83
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:10.629
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I learned one reason I learned
Python is because I don't like C sharp so

84
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.553
bad I told them that for like,
because of machine learning and

85
00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:20.572
like API's and stuff in Python
is becoming big and Microsoft,

86
00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:26.380
I will write Python until my fingers
like fall off before I write C sharp.

87
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.830
That's like I'll write Python all day.

88
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.760
Y'all don't have to ask me no questions.

89
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.140
You want to write Python Jerome?

90
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.690
Yes.
Like I'll do anything right.

91
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.890
I was like,
please don't make me write C-sharp.

92
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.900
Please, I'm like a kid.

93
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.120
Like, don't, please don't ground me and
make me write C-sharp.

94
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.622
Like JavaScript, Python,
I'll write YAML, it won't matter,

95
00:05:42.622 --> 00:05:44.572
like just, don't make me do .NET.

96
00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:45.702
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:49.300
[LAUGH] Whatever I did wrong, I apologize.
