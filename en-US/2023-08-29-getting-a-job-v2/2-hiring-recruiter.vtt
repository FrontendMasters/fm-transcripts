00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:01.850
So, moving on.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.831
Hiring recruiter.

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.045
The second gatekeeper, second user,

4
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:11.282
they play a crucial role as a bridge
between the company and the candidate.

5
00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.959
If you're applying for a software
engineering role, the recruiter will be

6
00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.014
your primary point of contact
in the initial point of process.

7
00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:23.814
They are the first person
that you will interact with.

8
00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:30.028
And that makes them one of
the most important people.

9
00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:35.601
At my current role at Microsoft,
we have a gotcha person,

10
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:40.835
right, which is non-technical but
you will interact

11
00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:46.182
with that based upon how you
interact with this person,

12
00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:51.900
it may be the fail or
pass of whether you get the job, right?

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.146
It's our way of ensuring that our
diversity and inclusion values are met

14
00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:02.141
by seeing how you treat people who
may be different from you, right?

15
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:08.705
So you have to be very aware of where
these people are, I guess, the best way.

16
00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:12.404
Anybody ever seen that meme of
the dude that played Bain and

17
00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:16.643
they were like he treats the janitor
the same way he treats the CEO.

18
00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:20.230
Which can be a good or
bad thing because I know when,

19
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.652
like Mark's a CEO and
I'll take Mark whenever and he's like,

20
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:28.924
Jerome, I'm like a whole
grown-up go- [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE].

21
00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:33.450
So you could take that as good way or
bad way, right?

22
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.210
So like I said, hiring recruiters
is gonna be your initial contact.

23
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.260
Good sign, right?

24
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.738
You want to build rapport with
your hiring recruiter, right?

25
00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:45.522
These person is gonna go to bat for
you, they want to see you win.

26
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:50.725
They are different from every
other gatekeeper on this.

27
00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:52.979
They need you to win cuz guess what?

28
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.608
No one wants to be no tied up in
the hiring process for long, right?

29
00:01:57.608 --> 00:02:00.064
So once you reach this person,

30
00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:05.076
this person's whole job is to
make sure you look good, right?

31
00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:09.611
Your job is to make it look easy, right?

32
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:13.166
When they asked you for your resume,
already have a resume built out,

33
00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.616
the resume is your highlight reel there,
they're just snapshot.

34
00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:20.946
They're not meant to be super long ,is
meant to have just the good stuff and

35
00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:22.810
move on with your life, right?

36
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.180
Your portfolio, that is your Picasso.

37
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.523
Make sure that the above-the-fold
content is nice.

38
00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:32.493
It's processing fast.

39
00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.007
We have an entire checklist.

40
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:38.531
We're gonna go through towards the later
so and I also added it as a resource.

41
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:44.046
So you don't even have to go and wait for
me to tell you that there's about 20, 30

42
00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:49.341
pieces of the checklist for your portfolio
that I wanna make sure you're doing.

43
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:53.727
But those are the two rules that
I always follow, resumes and

44
00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:56.741
snapshot portfolios or Picasa, right?

45
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:01.767
So you always wanna make sure your
portfolio tells the full story of

46
00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:06.879
how good you are and how good you
can be if you're getting this role,

47
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.396
they take this opportunity with you,
right?

48
00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:12.292
And it also is a form of data capture.

49
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.944
There're a lot people don't think of
when it comes to their portfolio.

50
00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:17.893
We're gonna go more into that later.
