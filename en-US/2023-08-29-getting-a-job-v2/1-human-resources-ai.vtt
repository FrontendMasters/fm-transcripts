1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
So let's go over the first user.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.496
If you go and you turn the meeting
to the in your repo to three users,

3
00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.230
I have an HR AI Markdown file.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.110
But this is what we're gonna talk about.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.170
This is our first user.

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.935
This is the invisible user, the user,
the user, you're never gonna see but

7
00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.560
you know they're there.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.776
They have been in HR AI first Gatekeeper
that you're going to encounter,

9
00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:27.584
especially as a new dev,
as a dev that hasn't had their first job,

10
00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:31.324
they're also gonna be the most difficult,
gatekeeper that

11
00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:36.630
you're gonna encounter because you don't
have the advantage of having experience.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.750
Then it can be looked at
as hardcore This was a job,

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.856
let's take in contract work or
volunteer work they're able to like

14
00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:50.962
actually track the way that the use
of these systems look at it is that

15
00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:56.850
they're gonna be able they're gonna
be your hardest adversary, right?

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.107
So AI has been increasingly
integrated into HR operations,

17
00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:06.240
in various aspects of
resource HR management.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.458
Right, few types of AI tools
that we're looking at today and

19
00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:15.682
these days also ATS think of light
workable things of that nature, right?

20
00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:20.557
That handles the recruitment needs,
that handles the primary purpose, but

21
00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:25.140
it's primary purpose is to work
through like all your resumes, right?

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.940
So there's like 10,000 resumes,
it's reading your resumes, looking for

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.390
the keywords, and
you're like, if you don't...

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.589
Have these keywords you're fired
automatically bam thank you I don't know

25
00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:37.868
if you've ever had this happen
where you sent a resume in and

26
00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:42.066
then like almost immediately you've
gotten an email that says thank you but

27
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:46.610
you're not what we're looking for
like wow how did you read that that fast.

28
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.580
They didn't.

29
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.110
ATS did, right?

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.541
Which is why one of the things that you
need to be doing when you're working on

31
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.865
your resumes, things like that,
make sure that you have

32
00:01:56.865 --> 00:02:00.690
the keywords that are in these
job requirements in your resumes.

33
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.880
Because what's going to happen is when
you don't have it, it quickly scans it.

34
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.860
It's scanning for the years, it's scanning
for those languages, for those tools.

35
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.100
And the next thing you know, oyu're
either in or you're out quickly, right?

36
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.210
Your goal is to try to bypass that system,
right?

37
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.063
Chatbots and virtual assistants, how many
of us have encountered having a chat,

38
00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:26.150
use a chatbot on a job site or
anything like that?

39
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.365
No one yet I've encountered it twice so
far and going behind the scenes and

40
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:36.850
being able to like ask about the
information of that those what they do is

41
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.814
they use LOM's and
they're judging based upon your diction,

42
00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:45.601
your punctuation, your lack of
punctuation, the average reading human,

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.985
reading skill level of an American, which
is a seventh grade reading level, average

44
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:56.560
reading level of a programmer, which is
a eighth to 10th grade reading levels.

45
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.052
There they are looking at all of these
little keys of like how you're speaking

46
00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:02.210
and how you're responding to answers.

47
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.322
And they're looking at their
judging by their LOMS,

48
00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:09.960
their language learning models and
data, they're going by this stuff.

49
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.758
And that's what you're getting your
grade off of when it comes to what

50
00:03:14.758 --> 00:03:19.350
you're talking about in regards
to these HR models, right?

51
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.930
So that's another one.

52
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.042
Predictive analytics, these tools
that use AI to analyze patterns for

53
00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:28.740
employee behavior and predict trends.

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.830
Let's say you went to K Bootcamp, X, Y,
Z, and you went to K Bootcamp A, B, C.

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.859
Well, the company has been hiring
bootcamp grad for about 10 years and

56
00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.888
they have the data to showcase between
the two of you which one's gonna be

57
00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:51.590
the most successful within the first two
years of being in their program, right?

58
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.078
They collect this data, so
they know that ABC boot camp,

59
00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:59.920
those grads tend to be
20 to 40 percent less.

60
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.655
Be successful and within the first
two years of being at this job so

61
00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:10.755
what we're gonna do is that we're
gonna take that time and we're gonna

62
00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:16.110
be there be hired they're either gonna
say no to ABC grant or they're gonna

63
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.805
scrutinize ABCs work a lot harder during
the interview process versus xyz's.

64
00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:26.802
Because XYZ has to predictive analytics
the data to support that they

65
00:04:26.802 --> 00:04:31.883
may be able to handle the first two
years at this job or higher chance for

66
00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:36.212
a higher percentage of being
able to support that, right?

67
00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:41.574
So those is, that's how they're
using these tools today,

68
00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:48.210
and going to have three more tools so
you'll be like this is gonna be crazy.

69
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.190
How many of you all have done,
like, hacker rank or.

70
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.250
So I have two.

71
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.312
Anything like that when there's
like a interview, job or

72
00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:02.687
anything like interview tech questions
where you have to fill the code challenge,

73
00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:05.580
they just sent it to you and
you have to bring it back.

74
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.190
&gt;&gt; I know I would do them for fun.

75
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.110
&gt;&gt; You would do them for fun,
like never for an interview.

76
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.015
&gt;&gt; I haven't gotten any interviews yet so
&gt;&gt; All right okay well well they've done

77
00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:19.022
now is a lot of spiritual hacker rank
they've started adding AI to this so

78
00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:23.125
where based upon the education
level that you're saying or

79
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.570
the reposing your GitHub,
they are sending.

80
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.247
They're sending these problems to you and
they're looking at the problems and

81
00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:36.450
generating these questions based upon what
they assume your experience level is.

82
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.831
And if you pass them or
let's say you don't do something,

83
00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:44.110
let's say you do on a senior engineer
role or let's say, great example.

84
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.011
If you're talking about
a cloud engineering role, but

85
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:51.248
you don't set up AWS amplify
as a part of your or

86
00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:57.300
you don't even bring it up as a part of
your, this is what I would do component.

87
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.250
They're looking at this they're
flagging it automatically.

88
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.863
And there's not even a person and
part of the,

89
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:07.130
the initial technical spring that's
even involved is just a robot.

90
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.892
When you and me,
I will train you and them and

91
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:15.380
the final is the employee engagement tool,
right?

92
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.109
So let's say you finally get a you
get a initial conversation on video,

93
00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:27.124
and there's a one on one we're talking
well the AI is a layer between you and

94
00:06:27.124 --> 00:06:29.920
the engagement tool and the user.

95
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.922
And what's happening now is that it's
reading to like how you're acting.

96
00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:39.120
This person seems a little unsure.

97
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.553
This person is looking at not making
a lot of eye contact things that

98
00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.954
the AI is taking notes of you the user,
is you know,

99
00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:50.540
you're being interviewed by someone else,
right?

100
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.565
And it's helping the employer make or
the person is initially contacted and

101
00:06:55.565 --> 00:07:00.560
connected with you is making it
helping them make decisions about you.

102
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.204
Right?
So

103
00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:04.980
it's little this is the world
you all have inherited.

104
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.677
Unfortunately, they're getting a lot more
invasive with their tactics when it comes

105
00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:14.450
to hiring and this is where we're going
if this is where we're at, that's fine.

106
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.779
That is fine like we go further
down on the repo I have,

107
00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:23.976
how to have tips tricks and
how to understand all of these right so

108
00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:28.789
you're in the repo right now
you go towards understanding I

109
00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.510
have how to use how to understand the ATS.

110
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.909
We talked about where you how to use
those keywords when a job description and

111
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:41.306
a resume and a cover letter right as very
very important, we want to be able to

112
00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:45.730
utilize this stuff against them,
right, interacting with the chatbots.

113
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.740
Be sure you're clear and direct whenever
interacting with any HR chatbot.

114
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.156
Any website that you're interested in,
any company you're interested in that has

115
00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:59.220
a chatbot, you wanna be clear and
direct with those chatbots, right?

116
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.100
The chatbot doesn't understand your query?

117
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.869
Try rephrasing.

118
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.160
Preparing for AI based interviews
practice makes perfect.

119
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.410
You're doing a great job.

120
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.235
You're practicing those crazy code
challenges that have absolutely

121
00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:16.686
nothing to do with the code,
you're gonna work.

122
00:08:16.686 --> 00:08:20.175
[LAUGH].
It is the worst way to showcase like what

123
00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:26.720
people are doing, but it is there makes
my head hurt a little bit, but it exists.

124
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.400
Were there, so you keep practicing
those and practice with perfect and

125
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.548
that way you'll be able to be relaxed and
natural when those interviews so when

126
00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:42.280
they're going through those processes,
do you like I've seen this before.

127
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.610
So let me go ahead and run this.

128
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.929
And engagement learning tools make
the most just make the most of that

129
00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:50.830
experience.

130
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.340
When I'm talking to people just like now,
I'm make sure I'm making eye contact.

131
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.200
I am using seventh seventh to
eighth grade speaking language.

132
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.688
I am also focusing on trying to
make sure that I am confident or

133
00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:08.972
I'm being, I'm trying to integrate
myself into their team, right?

134
00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:10.325
What are we doing?

135
00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:14.300
All right, so
this is what we would do as a unit.

136
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.359
This is the why this is why I think of
things I'm speaking out the how I solve

137
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:20.600
problems or how I would solve problems.

138
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.904
I'm even speaking out how if I would
have this problem, how I would ask my

139
00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:29.209
leadership or the senior devs right
like a great example is, all right,

140
00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:34.000
you get stuck at it I don't know if you
have none of you have had interviews yet.

141
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.218
Right?
So you have all right you, okay, so

142
00:09:37.218 --> 00:09:42.413
a question that gets brought up all
the time is okay you're stumped

143
00:09:42.413 --> 00:09:47.480
on a problem how do you approach
your senior dev with this.

144
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.760
Well, this problem that you're having.

145
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.149
Well, what I say is well, first I am going
to make sure that I have tried a, b and

146
00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:59.590
c and I have gone to these websites,
as well as review the documentation.

147
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.688
Then when I approach my senior developer,

148
00:10:01.688 --> 00:10:04.750
I am gonna showcase them
the code I've been working on.

149
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.792
I'm going to tell them the solutions
that I have attempted already and

150
00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:12.765
then the resources I have links to
the resources that I've gone to and

151
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:14.320
already researched.

152
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.546
That way it showcases to your senior
developers that you have already tried,

153
00:10:18.546 --> 00:10:22.576
whether it is a senior dev at work or
a senior dev out in the wild on Twitter or

154
00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:23.690
LinkedIn.

155
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.378
They always respond better
when you have showcased your

156
00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:31.870
work that you've already tried
to solve this and figure it out.

157
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.229
They love, okay, I'm just trying,
I'm helping you get those last 10,

158
00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:41.700
those last 10 inches out of
a hole like 3 meters, right?

159
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.410
I can, I can work with that, right?

160
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.160
So that is the best way.

161
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.223
To when you're answering that problem and

162
00:10:48.223 --> 00:10:53.327
you're speaking through how to how
you're going to first do the work or

163
00:10:53.327 --> 00:10:58.938
try to do the work and then when asked to
help showcase how you try to do the work,

164
00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:04.670
right, so that is how we you know,
circumnavigate, we never get around.

165
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.590
AI but
we know it's not gonna work all the time,

166
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.650
where it's mostly most of
the time I've had so far.

167
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.790
I tried this with three of my students,
three of my veterans and military spouses.

168
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.730
They weren't full time PwC students,
all three of them ended up getting jobs.

169
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.266
And one of them end up getting
a job wasn't even as a software

170
00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:27.810
engineer because she wanted to be a
Product Manager and it they all got jobs.

171
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.720
They all it all worked.

172
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.950
And like, I was like, okay.

173
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.611
So now that we're learning this,

174
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:34.490
let's make sure that everybody
else around us knows this.
