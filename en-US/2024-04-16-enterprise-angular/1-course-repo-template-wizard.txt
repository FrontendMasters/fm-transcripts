>> The other thing that I will just pull up here real quick is I've done my best to create something that I think is representative of the kind of development that you would want to gravitate towards in the real world. At the same time, it's small enough and comprehensible enough that we can talk and talk about it, touch it, feel it, run it, break it, fix it, break it again, all in the course of a single day.

[00:00:36]
And so I would encourage you to first and foremost, just clone the Repo and just make sure that everything is in order, and you can do this by running NPM run wizard. Let me show you what the wizard actually is and how we're going to be using it today.

[00:01:09]
And this will set the stage for us to start talking about domain driven design. But what we have here is a tool that if I go into my IDE here and let me just pick something out. Let's go to, we'll do challenges data. And I'm just gonna navigate over to the service here, and I'm just going to copy this and I'm going back to the wizard.

[00:02:01]
And, I'm going to paste this in. So, now that I have this in, then can anybody tell me, what's the primary domain model or entity that we're working with in this particular service? It's a service for.
>> Challenges.
>> Challenges, yes or specifically a challenge singular. So I'm going to put my base keyword in here, and I'm going to hit Enter.

[00:02:33]
And what it's going to do is it's going to run through the template and look for that particular entity and replace it with a string lid. I have a workshop on rapid application development. I talk about kind of the engines that drive this, but being able to identify an entity on a base keyword.

[00:02:58]
Change that into a string literal. What that allows us to do is then feed additional domain models into it, and pick it up and use it.
