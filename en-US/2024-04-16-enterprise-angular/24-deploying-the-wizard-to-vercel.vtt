00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.616
Now, to just kind of top off
this journey that we've been on,

2
00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:09.834
I want to show you a quick
deployment example.

3
00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:18.053
There are a number of ways to deploy
your applications in your API's.

4
00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:22.294
I would say that if you want
to get more into deployment,

5
00:00:22.294 --> 00:00:25.912
enterprise deployments and infrastructure.

6
00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:31.890
There's a great course, enterprise
cloud infrastructure by Eric Reinhardt.

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.666
Reinhardt and also very good, he helped
and actually generated some terraform for

8
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:44.681
me to reference in this workshop,
which I'll put in the companion site.

9
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:48.262
But for the sake of I think brevity and
quickness,

10
00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:52.950
I'm going to show you the path of
least resistance to getting your

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.995
angular app up into the cloud, and
we're gonna do that with for cell.

12
00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:01.946
So the one thing that we do need to do,

13
00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:07.813
because your deploy will fail,
which is a good thing.

14
00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:11.905
If your application is
outside of some parameters,

15
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:16.555
is in this case, with NX,
we have production budgets, and

16
00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:21.951
it's saying we do not want our,
application to be bigger than a meg.

17
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:25.333
And so if it was bigger than that,
it would throw an error.

18
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:30.060
So what we're gonna do since we kind
of take this off with the wizard,

19
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.806
which I think is amazing, we are going
to kind of end with the wizard.

20
00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:38.351
And so imagine you are going
to a dinner party, and

21
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:42.657
you want to show off the wizard and
how clever you are, well,

22
00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:48.506
you're not gonna take your laptop with
you, that doesn't fit into your pocket.

23
00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:49.458
So what do you do?

24
00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.183
Well, we deploy it.

25
00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:58.411
So the first thing we're gonna do is go
into our project.json in our wizard app,

26
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:03.299
and we just need to scroll
down to production budgets,

27
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.720
and we're gonna bump this up to 10.

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.303
We'll go ahead and save this.

29
00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:15.090
Now, the next thing that we're gonna
do is we're gonna hop over to for

30
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.354
cell, and you can log in using your
GitHub credentials which I recommend.

31
00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:28.098
And then once you're logged in,
we're going to go Add New, Project.

32
00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:33.031
And because I've logged in
using my GitHub credentials and

33
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.695
now has access to my projects and

34
00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:39.654
obviously want to go
with enterprise the apps.

35
00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:47.627
So I'm gonna import, and we're gonna give
this a project name of Workshop Wizard.

36
00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:53.355
Then we need to set a few additional
parameters for this build to work.

37
00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:59.072
So let's go down to Build and
Output Settings.

38
00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:05.299
We're gonna override the build
command in the output directory.

39
00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.290
This is largely in part because
we're dealing with a large monorepo

40
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.875
with many projects.

41
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:16.867
You could actually create a deployment for
each individual project, and

42
00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.210
then connect those all together.

43
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.702
I think kind of at the end of conceptually
where you could go with this is

44
00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:30.382
the talk that we had about microfrontends,
you could absolutely deploy

45
00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:35.707
everything into Vercel or
into the cloud and load those in that way.

46
00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:41.791
So we need to update the build
command to add to NX run,

47
00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:46.661
wizard build, and the output directory,

48
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:52.088
which you can get if you
go back to your project.

49
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:57.026
And you just need to find
where this is located,

50
00:03:57.026 --> 00:04:01.471
and so we'll just copy relative path, and

51
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.809
we'll just paste this in here.

52
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.733
So dist Toulon wizard
browser in this case.

53
00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:15.111
And now we're just going to click Deploy.

54
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.941
So apparently,
I've done this one too many times.

55
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:24.660
So let me just go back real quick and

56
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.844
delete one of these.

57
00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:31.808
I should have brought my credit
card is what should have happened.

58
00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.981
So we'll fill out
enterprisey workshop apps.

59
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.164
So we're just gonna kind of
redo this workshop wizard.

60
00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:44.065
Sounds like a Who song or
whoever did that pinball wizard.

61
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.085
And so now this is going to deploy.

62
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:50.020
This will take just a little bit,

63
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.245
possibly two minutes give or take.

64
00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.581
It just depends on who's streaming or

65
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:02.282
who's mining Bitcoin, if for
sell at any given day.

66
00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:04.963
I'm totally kidding, but

67
00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:09.975
possibly go get a drink of water,
take a bio break,

68
00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:15.456
but this is going to download
all of our dependencies and

69
00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:19.436
then run that build script, all right?

70
00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:23.965
We have a successful build.

71
00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:28.734
So from this dashboard here,
you can actually

72
00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:33.746
just click on the app and
here everything is, and

73
00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:39.003
we now have a wizard deployed
in the cloud to help you

74
00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:46.241
do enterprise angular development,
and I think that is pretty neat.
