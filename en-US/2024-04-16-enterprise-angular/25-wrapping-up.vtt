00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.361
I would challenge every one of you and
everybody online,

2
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:10.830
I love you, I haven't forgot about you,

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.194
that if you were to go
through this application and

4
00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:22.706
start looking it like,
where am I starting to see patterns,

5
00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:27.463
these repeating patterns within the test?

6
00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:30.673
What does that pattern mean?

7
00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:37.756
When I look at the services and
the state management and

8
00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:43.512
the different things,
where are these patterns emerging?

9
00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:47.615
And when you understand the patterns,

10
00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:53.592
then you can apply it to other
things in meaningful ways.

11
00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:57.684
So does anybody here,
somebody last thought,

12
00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:02.401
know what a 12-bars blues progression is,
right?

13
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:07.058
That if you've ever listened to blues,
it's just one of the most,

14
00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:09.113
like I can hear it a mile away.

15
00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:14.352
Is that I don't have to
understand exactly every

16
00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:20.741
note that they're playing,
to know what they're doing,

17
00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:25.852
is that because it is
a conventional pattern and

18
00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:30.964
a form of kind of structured
musical expression

19
00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:36.629
that I don't even need to
know what key they're in.

20
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.686
I just know that if they start
on the one or the tonic,

21
00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:43.857
then in four measures they're going
to the four, then back to the one,

22
00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:46.310
then the five then the fourth and the one.

23
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.146
And if you know how to listen for
that 12-bar blues progression,

24
00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.480
you'll start to hear everywhere.

25
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.252
One of my favorite songs,
I think one of my favorite blues songs,

26
00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:07.079
is What Did I Say by Ray Charles, and
it's got this little funky Rhodes piece.

27
00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.921
It's 12-bar blues and it's awesome,
but that's what he built it on.

28
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:16.857
Is he took something that's
incredibly simplistic and

29
00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:19.126
built something amazing on it.

30
00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:26.912
And in a way, this is what I hope
that we've accomplished today,

31
00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:32.151
is that we start thinking
about simple basic

32
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:38.113
patterns very much like
a 12-bar blues scale.

33
00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:42.097
And we use that to create
amazing things and

34
00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:48.515
express ourselves in code to not
only make a difference in our lives,

35
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:55.377
the companies that we work for, but
ultimately the people that we love and

36
00:02:55.377 --> 00:03:00.155
care for, and that's why,
at least, I program.

37
00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:05.834
And so, this concludes our journey
into Enterprise Angular apps.

38
00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:11.265
I would say, at least for this iteration,
I definitely recommend checking out

39
00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:17.705
the Companion site and continue to check
out everything that's on Frontend Masters.

40
00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:21.903
But just to quickly summarize
what we've learned and

41
00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:25.830
where we've gone and where we're going.

42
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.334
We talked about Angular development
in the context of the enterprise.

43
00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:40.040
And to clarify, that enterprise does not
necessarily mean advanced or complicated.

44
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.731
What it does mean is that you're
developing at scale which informs your

45
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:50.282
decisions about how you organize your code
and your projects, so that a large amount

46
00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:55.745
of people can consume your applications
and a large team can work on them.

47
00:03:55.745 --> 00:04:00.337
And so with that said,
we led off with domain-driven design, and

48
00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:05.011
just understanding the domain that
is absolutely critical that you

49
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.143
have an API contract in place.

50
00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:09.597
Then we talked about monorepos and

51
00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:15.731
how to organize your projects in a way
that there's cohesion without coupling.

52
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.762
And then we discussed micro frontends and
how you can use a host

53
00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:26.859
application to load in a number of
remote applications, which is really,

54
00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:32.859
it's really kinda changed the game
about how we can upgrade legacy apps,

55
00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:38.135
how we can introduce new features
into existing applications.

56
00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:41.051
And it's very, very exciting stuff.

57
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.037
And from there we talked
about reactive architecture,

58
00:04:45.037 --> 00:04:49.617
state management, unit testing,
end-to-end testing, and

59
00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:55.382
measuring kind of performance and
how to do that, and then deployment.

60
00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:59.664
The goal of this entire arch is so
that you have

61
00:04:59.664 --> 00:05:04.735
the tools in a playbook to
conceptualize a feature and

62
00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:09.243
then turn that into an entire application,
and

63
00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:12.722
how to organize that, how to do it.

64
00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:18.440
And so I think everything that we've done
here is the things that I use every day,

65
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.141
and I believe that you can
apply these techniques and

66
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:27.437
possibly go make a billion dollars,
and I support you in that endeavor.

67
00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:30.467
But thank you for being here,
thank you for learning with me.

68
00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:34.249
It means the world to me that
you've spent this time with me.

69
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.452
And with that,
please go build awesome stuff.

70
00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:43.817
