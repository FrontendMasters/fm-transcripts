00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.696
The other thing that I will just
pull up here real quick is I've

2
00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:12.191
done my best to create something that
I think is representative of the kind

3
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:18.819
of development that you would want to
gravitate towards in the real world.

4
00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:25.889
At the same time, it's small enough and
comprehensible enough that we can talk and

5
00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:30.535
talk about it, touch it,
feel it, run it, break it,

6
00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:36.298
fix it, break it again,
all in the course of a single day.

7
00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:41.680
And so I would encourage you to first and

8
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.409
foremost, just clone the Repo and

9
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.932
just make sure that
everything is in order, and

10
00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:59.498
you can do this by running NPM run wizard.

11
00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:04.671
Let me show you what
the wizard actually is and

12
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:09.036
how we're going to be using it today.

13
00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:15.726
And this will set the stage for us to
start talking about domain driven design.

14
00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:21.130
But what we have here is a tool

15
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.758
that if I go into my IDE here and

16
00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:32.846
let me just pick something out.

17
00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:46.123
Let's go to, we'll do challenges data.

18
00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:54.401
And I'm just gonna navigate
over to the service here,

19
00:01:54.401 --> 00:02:01.078
and I'm just going to copy this and
I'm going back to the wizard.

20
00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:03.180
And, I'm going to paste this in.

21
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:10.327
So, now that I have this in,
then can anybody tell me,

22
00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.105
what's the primary domain model or

23
00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:17.939
entity that we're working with
in this particular service?

24
00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.391
It's a service for.

25
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.280
&gt;&gt; Challenges.

26
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.804
&gt;&gt; Challenges, yes or
specifically a challenge singular.

27
00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:32.430
So I'm going to put my base keyword
in here, and I'm going to hit Enter.

28
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.785
And what it's going to do is it's
going to run through the template and

29
00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:43.651
look for that particular entity and
replace it with a string lid.

30
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:48.971
I have a workshop on rapid
application development.

31
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.742
I talk about kind of the engines
that drive this, but

32
00:02:53.742 --> 00:02:58.854
being able to identify
an entity on a base keyword.

33
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.784
Change that into a string literal.

34
00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:06.184
What that allows us to do
is then feed additional

35
00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:11.724
domain models into it,
and pick it up and use it.
