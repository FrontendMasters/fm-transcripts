00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:05.382
One of the most I think
predominant characteristics

2
00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:10.602
of enterprise applications is scale and
with scale,

3
00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:15.708
become size,
which begets performance problems.

4
00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:20.575
And I want to take a quick
moment to just talk about

5
00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:25.560
a tool that the Angular team
released to help get or

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.428
gain insights into how
your app is performing and

7
00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:34.603
to look for possible bottlenecks, etc.

8
00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:40.205
And so you can look on,
if you google Angular DevTools

9
00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:45.945
they have a pretty comprehensive
section about this.

10
00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:51.052
And what this allows you
to do is to want debug your

11
00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:56.169
application if something
that's going wrong.

12
00:00:56.169 --> 00:01:03.195
It also allows you, I think, the other
important part is to do profiling.

13
00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:08.104
And so there's a lot of things
that you can do in this, so

14
00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:13.327
I think probably my to go to
kind of plugins when I'm working

15
00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:18.549
with Angular is the Redux DevTools for
state management but

16
00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.991
also I have found this particular
tool to be valuable as well.

17
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:29.727
So you can just install it from
the Chrome Web Store, which I'm in Chrome,

18
00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:34.385
but they there's other options
depending on your browser.

19
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:39.023
And what you can do is
just load your app up.

20
00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:47.194
Navigate over to
the DevTools tab over here.

21
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:51.942
And let me just create some space in here.

22
00:01:55.418 --> 00:02:00.558
So one of the things that I
like quite a bit is that it's

23
00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:05.358
showing you kind of
the the template hierarchy and

24
00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.670
you're able to kind of drill in and

25
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.140
see properties about
what you are selecting.

26
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.238
So for instance, it's showing you
that on this particular form,

27
00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:23.062
that if I wanted to see what's
actually on it, like the value,

28
00:02:23.062 --> 00:02:27.795
which there's nothing right now,
but if I were to select it,

29
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:32.824
right in the dev tools,
you can inspect the value of this option.

30
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:38.505
So one of the things that I
used to do quite a bit was just

31
00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:45.088
dump the entire kind of an object
onto the page and inspect it.

32
00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:50.940
So I would do something
like this quite a bit,

33
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.235
let's just open up the,
Challenge detail component,

34
00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:03.846
or rather I wanted the template,
but there we go.

35
00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:09.992
And let's say something wasn't happening
with a form that I wanted it to.

36
00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:17.126
So a very, very common technique,
which I still occasionally use,

37
00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:22.784
but I think the dev tools kind
of eliminates the need for

38
00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.966
this is I come in, proper pre tag in, and

39
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:30.662
then I would essentially dump out,

40
00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:38.283
The particular thing that I wanted
to inspect, so very, very common for

41
00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:43.964
me to do something like this,
like the form is not doing what I want,

42
00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:48.570
and now I need to,
like figure out what's happening.

43
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.509
So you can see here it's
kind of at the bottom.

44
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:59.087
Then select it, and you can see it,
which totally fine it's easy but

45
00:03:59.087 --> 00:04:03.530
at the same time now
with the dev tools you

46
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.496
don't really need to do
that anymore because

47
00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:13.612
you have the option to kind of go in and
select.

48
00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:16.272
In this case, I'm looking for the form.

49
00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:19.601
And if you go down you can
see that it has the form and

50
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.259
you can click on the values,
and you can see them here.

51
00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.118
So this is a really nice
way to kind of inspect and

52
00:04:27.118 --> 00:04:30.120
dig into your Angular application.

53
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.678
So I really appreciate
the Angular team doing that.

54
00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:40.929
Another quite interesting piece is that

55
00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:45.561
you can look at the environment hierarchy.

56
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:53.940
And so it's just kind of showing you
how this particular thing is wired up.

57
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.359
But the element hierarchy so
you can actually,

58
00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:04.544
I was hoping that would show the,
but you can kind of scroll down and

59
00:05:04.544 --> 00:05:09.979
see how this is all wired together,
which is pretty neat.

60
00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.509
And the last part that I want
to just show in terms of kind

61
00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:22.364
of performance management and
gaining insight is you can come in and

62
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:28.858
just start to make some changes and
different things like this,

63
00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:33.689
so we're interacting with it, cancel, etc.

64
00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.019
Nothing too fancy.

65
00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:42.878
And then when you're done you have
the ability to kind of step in and

66
00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:49.492
look at when you the particular
like micro actions within that,

67
00:05:49.492 --> 00:05:55.020
like how long did it take and
the details around that.

68
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.700
So if all of a sudden
you're doing something and

69
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.491
it's just blowing up that you can
say well, what was taking so long?

70
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:12.838
Well, it apparently that when we are
interacting with this that the changes for

71
00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:19.197
this took about one tenth of a second
I believe, or almost 0.9 miliseconds.

72
00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:24.823
So very, very fast, but relative to
everything else, that was quite a bit.

73
00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:30.032
But I would say Angular as
a whole is pretty performant.

74
00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:32.553
But occasionally,
there just are things that happen.

75
00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:36.010
Maybe you're not cleaning
up an event listener, or

76
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.474
something is happening
maybe you're not aware of.

77
00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:43.703
And this is a great tool for
debugging, but

78
00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:48.757
also running the application,
profiling it, and

79
00:06:48.757 --> 00:06:54.163
then using that as a starting
point to take that data and

80
00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:58.063
go and optimize your web application.
