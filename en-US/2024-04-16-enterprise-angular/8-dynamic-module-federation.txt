>> Within this federation config, this is essentially hard-coded, and the idea would be, let's make this dynamic. How would we do that? So, thank you for asking, I have some ideas. We're going to delete this, so we're removing essentially this hard coded reference to this micro front end, and so now we've kind of disconnected it.

[00:00:32]
Then what we're gonna do is inside of the assets folder, we're going to create a file, and we're going to call this modul- Federation.
>> Yep, federation, it's F-E-D-E-R.
>> Well that's just how we say it in the South.
>> [LAUGH]
>> Federation, that's how my memo said it.

[00:01:11]
So we are going to add in, I think this also shares port 4201, I'm hoping, this just breaks, I'm going to just go eat and fix after lunch. So we've created a manifest and now we're pointing to an actual, not just a name that's being mapped to something inside of the project is we're actually pointing to a URL, this is important.

[00:01:44]
Then from there, we need to update our main.ts to be dynamic. Right now this is pretty boring. So instead what we're gonna do is, this actually reads pretty well, we are going to go and get the manifest that we just created. And we're gonna then take those definitions, send it into setRemoteDefinitions, which I'm sure does something magical under the hood, and from there, then we're bootstrapping.

[00:02:32]
So we're just adding this exchange kind of from the beginning. We've already removed the static reference, and so we have one last thing that we need to do, and I really hope this works. We need to go back to our remote entry routes. Or actually, sorry, my bad, this is in the workshop routes.

[00:03:10]
I believe, is this right? Yes, all right. So what we're doing here is we need to change this call right here, so we're going to load remote module. This one is just dying, all right. Wait, it was sessions. I do this every time, all right, my apologies. LoadChildren, then there we go, sessions.

[00:04:17]
I think we're almost there. Then, what's this thing so upset about? Come on. All right, I think maybe, just maybe, yes, fingers crossed, I thought you were like, get on the ceiling, all right. All right. The strangest cuts out it didn't work and I rage quit, you should you should actually get the that overlay when they cut a stream off like the old-fashioned television, it's like, Lucas just quit,.

[00:05:40]
Should I? Why am I so scared right now? It's because I'm just desperate for you guys' approval. I busted it, what's happening? 4201, I'm going to spend 30 seconds looking at this, and then, Is it sessions? So, in this case it was a sequencing problem and I'm still working out the handshake on this a little bit.

[00:06:20]
But I am going to start up the remote first, and I really hope this works cuz I would hate to have to disappear for another 10 years. And we just pull this over into another window, so you can see here sessions is deployed independently on port 4205. Hop into another tab, and then I'm going to serve the workshops.

[00:07:05]
This is certainly a case of art imitating life, as I am indeed serving the workshop as I serve the workshop. And so now you can see then I'm able to toggle between the two sessions.
