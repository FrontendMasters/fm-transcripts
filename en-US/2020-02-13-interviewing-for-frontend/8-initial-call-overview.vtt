1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.591
So you put in your application,
you got a call back, or

2
00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:08.073
maybe a recruiter reached out to you
via LinkedIn or email or something, or

3
00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:11.080
you met someone at a meetup,
it doesn't matter.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.212
The application is done.

5
00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.027
It's good.

6
00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:16.500
You have the initial phone call with
the hiring manager or the recruiter.

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.992
So what do you do now?

8
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.614
Again, something you will do,
but we never think about and

9
00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:28.010
this part is actually kind of important.

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.762
Questions that you should be prepared
to answer right off the bat.

11
00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.848
I guarantee it doesn't
matter who the company is,

12
00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:36.930
they're gonna ask these things,
if it's a hiring manager or recruiter.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.106
What do you do currently?

14
00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.892
You should know that like,
top your head you should have a one or

15
00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:44.898
two sentence answer.

16
00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:46.367
Me, I'm Jem.

17
00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:47.732
I'm senior engineer at Netflix.

18
00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:51.480
I work on one of the UI core teams and
I build stuff.

19
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.920
That's fine,
they'll say what sort of stuff?

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.632
I'll be like, I do a lot of Node these
days, but in previous roles in Netflix,

21
00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:01.250
I built a lot of AB tests using
React with the Node back end.

22
00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:03.764
That's they I wanna know.

23
00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:07.920
They talk to a lot of people and
have it down, have you spiel down.

24
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.777
If you've ever done a recruiting
circuit where you've talked to seven or

25
00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:12.848
eight companies at once,
when you look for a new job,

26
00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.770
you know this will come up over and
over and over again, so just hone it now.

27
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.094
Another question you are gonna get asked
is what are some of the projects you've

28
00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:21.723
worked on?

29
00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:23.073
So what they're looking for

30
00:01:23.073 --> 00:01:26.345
here is are you kind of leaning more
towards the backend or frontend?

31
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.358
So Node, that sort of thing.

32
00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:30.382
Are you more full stack-y?

33
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.030
Are you heavy on accessibility?

34
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.682
Are you heavy on performance?

35
00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:39.022
You should have the project you worked on,
what the challenges were, and

36
00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:40.426
how you overcame them.

37
00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:43.354
These questions will come up,
I promise you.

38
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.150
Another one is, what are you looking for
in your next role?

39
00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.091
I want more money.

40
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:53.611
That's probably true,
you wanna get paid a little bit more, but

41
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.110
everybody wants to get
paid a little bit more.

42
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.293
What are you looking for
in your next role?

43
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:04.315
So say something about, I don't know,
maybe you want to learn something.

44
00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:06.223
You want to work with people
that are smarter than you,

45
00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:07.310
which we should all aspire to.

46
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.750
You wanna work with people who are smarter
than you, so I can learn from them.

47
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.002
Or I wanna solve challenging projects.

48
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.165
Or I wanna have a big
impact in my company.

49
00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:17.427
I don't wanna be another cog in the wheel,
things like that.

50
00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:19.741
But have an idea of what you're
looking for in your next role,

51
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:21.890
cuz they're gonna wanna know.

52
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.320
And you'd be surprised the number people
that get vetted out from the first call.

53
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.460
I say, how did so and so
do I mean we don't actually do this, but

54
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.220
hypothetically, I'd be
like how did my friend do?

55
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.828
They kind of mumbled a lot didn't
really seem like they had a direction.

56
00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:37.446
They didn't really know what they want to
do and it's really hard to hire someone

57
00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:39.800
who doesn't know if they
even want to work for you.

58
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.431
Give them a reason to want to hire you.

59
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:45.493
So I'm really passionate, really
enthusiastic, but I don't think I can

60
00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:48.760
learn anymore in my current role, and so
I wanna move onto a different project.

61
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.186
Or I'm tired of, I don't know,
the finance space, and

62
00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:57.350
I wanna move into healthcare,
something like that.

63
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.942
The question really is,
why do you wanna work for x?

64
00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:04.060
Why do you wanna work for
Frontend Masters?

65
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.985
Have a reason, do some research.

66
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.294
Take two minutes, go to their website,
look at what they do and understand

67
00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.680
the kind of projects they have, understand
the challenges they're working on.

68
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.181
And the last one is,
what is your availability for next steps?

69
00:03:17.181 --> 00:03:18.189
Because that means they liked you.

70
00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.090
That means that they wanna move you on
to the next round in the interview.

71
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.434
So what's your availability?

72
00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.619
You should have your calendar open.

73
00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.985
You say like, hey,
every Friday at four o'clock I'm free.

74
00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.424
So we can do a phone screening,
code test, or whatever.

75
00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:32.283
But be prepared.

76
00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:34.704
I've never not had a phone
call with a recruiter or

77
00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:37.600
hiring manager that didn't
have these questions on them.

78
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.030
I just wanna get you ready.

79
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.436
It's not the end of the world if
you're asked to think a little bit but

80
00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:45.930
it's a lot easier if you're just smooth,
got it down like a science.
