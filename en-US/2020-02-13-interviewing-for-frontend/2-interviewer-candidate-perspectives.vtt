1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.130
So we interviewed for front engineers.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.510
This course is to help
lay that groundwork.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.097
I can't guarantee by the end, I will have
answered every single possible interview

4
00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:15.536
question you will ever get in your life,
that is not possible.

5
00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:19.874
But what I can guarantee is you're gonna
have a better understanding of what

6
00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:24.571
interviewing is, and what it should be,
specifically for frontend engineers.

7
00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.570
And this course is a little unusual
because it's told from two parts.

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.570
It's told from
the candidate's perspective.

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.110
That would be the interviewee if you will,
but

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.290
I like candidate cuz
it'll get a little messy.

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.440
And it's told from that perspective
because that's the perspective most of you

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.630
are coming from.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.980
You're saying, I have a lot of
anxiety about interviewing.

14
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.249
It's arbitrary, it's terrible,
it's a long process.

15
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.494
Yeah, I wanna settle that, I wanna say,
here's how you approach these problems

16
00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:54.000
that you're probably gonna see and
here's how to solve them.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.739
And here's how to behave
during the interview and

18
00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.567
these are the things to
expect from an interview but

19
00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:06.655
a little bit more unusual in a twist,
a Jem twist, patent pending.

20
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.940
I'm gonna give the questions from
the perspective of an interviewer.

21
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.459
So I ask you now, you don't have to raise
your hand, you don't have to say anything.

22
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:20.260
But how much time have you spent
studying how to interview people?

23
00:01:23.463 --> 00:01:25.118
Probably not that much.

24
00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:30.658
If at all, does your company give you
a course on how to interview people?

25
00:01:32.212 --> 00:01:34.372
Some do, some don't.

26
00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:39.390
Now contrast that against how many hours
you've spent studying the interview.

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.616
Hm, there's a disconnect somewhere.

28
00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:44.910
I wonder why interviews are so hard.

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.238
Because we focus so
much on passing an interview, but

30
00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:49.994
we never think about when we're
on the other side of the table.

31
00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:51.952
And to create this course,
I talked to a lot of people.

32
00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:54.940
I talk to people at Netflix,
and Google, and Facebook.

33
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.080
And I talk to people who
work at small startups,

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.330
I talk to people who work
at medium-sized startups.

35
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.930
I went out and I interviewed,

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.730
which I agree if we all know it's
a bit unpleasant, but I went on

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.960
an interview because I wanted to find out
what are companies asking these days.

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.340
What are the type of
questions they wanna know?

39
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.637
What are they looking for in an engineer?

40
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.818
But also I wanna know,
how did people treat me?

41
00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:15.854
What did I like?

42
00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:17.293
What did I dislike?

43
00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:18.720
We never think about this.

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.070
I tweeted this out the other day and maybe
I'll share it with you at some point.

45
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.150
But here's a typical
interviewing experience.

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.156
Walk in.

47
00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.893
Someone asked you to implement,
I don't know,

48
00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:35.100
a binary search tree on the whiteboard and
already you're like, [SOUND] but

49
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.936
you did it because you spent three months
studying for this interview, and you pass.

50
00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:41.278
You're like, that was terrible.

51
00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:43.800
[LAUGH] I will never do that,
that was awful.

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310
I'm glad I got through, I got the offer,
now I'm going to eat my free lunch.

53
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.150
And then, six months later,
someone comes in, a little nervous.

54
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.460
They're like, welcome to Acme Corp.

55
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.160
Now you know what I want you to do, I want
you to implement a on the whiteboard.

56
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.730
That's a very fast way of
finding prime numbers.

57
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.780
But you wouldn't know that unless
you study because it's not

58
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.190
something you use every day.

59
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.660
But it's kind of like University hazing.

60
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.790
It all sucks but the cycle just
keeps going and going and going.

61
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.120
Because we forget what it's like to
be on the other side of the table,

62
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.990
we are forgetting that basic empathy.

63
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.500
So I wanna tell this course from the
perspective of the interviewer as well.

64
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.660
Sound good, yeah.

65
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.920
And I wanna challenge you to go
back to your place of work and

66
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.926
say, how come we never study
how to interview people?

67
00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.770
How can we not have this common rubric?

68
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.094
I wanna start that conversation
because interviewing is not great.

69
00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:37.100
I think we can fix it.
