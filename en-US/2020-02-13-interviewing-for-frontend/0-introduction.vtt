00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.310
Welcome to interviewing for
front end engineers.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.940
I chose Comic Sans because that's
what interviews often are.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.140
They're kind of silly, they're arbitrary.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.254
There's no set of standards or rules and
practices that you walk to an interview,

5
00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.161
you say I know exactly
what is gonna happen,

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.048
or I know exactly the type of
questions they're gonna ask.

7
00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.990
No, it's random.

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.940
How many ping pong balls
can fit on a school bus?

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.690
Yeah, we've all been asked
weird questions like that.

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.130
Some of you out there froze up for
a minute.

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.040
You're like, ten ping pong,
no, there's 20 people.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.270
Not a real question.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.750
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask any of
those sort of kinda trivia questions.

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.694
What I really wanna get to is solving this
problem of arbitrary questions during

15
00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.333
front end interviewing.

16
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.215
Or walking into an interview and
not knowing what's gonna happen,

17
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:52.381
what the steps are.

18
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.720
Especially people who have never
interviewed, particularly for

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.070
a front end role,
you don't know what to expect.

20
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.020
We're gonna cover all of that today.

21
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.199
But really, what I wanna set up is a
rubric of how front end interviews should

22
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.440
go, the type of questions
you should be asking.

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.090
Sound good?

24
00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:17.130
All right, my name is Jem Young,
I am a senior software engineer.

25
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.380
Let's see,
my superhero origin story would be

26
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.900
curiosity was how I was
born as an engineer.

27
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.370
Startups were where I was incubated.

28
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.030
Netflix for the past four years,
been my forge.

29
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.850
But teaching is my whetstone.

30
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.422
Keeps me sharp.
Cuz you spend too long at one job,

31
00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.720
you tend to get really good at one thing.

32
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.330
So I like to go out and teach and
try to help others as best I can.

33
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.964
And also,
almost every course I've ever taught,

34
00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.934
I learned something from you all too.

35
00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:58.033
But really, why I wanna teach this
course is so I can go on rants.

36
00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.759
I love rants, I got on a lot of rants on
the podcast I'm on, Front End Happy Hour.

37
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.800
Where we have drinks, we talk about
front end things, and it's pretty good.

38
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.060
But again, it's just a platform for
me going on rants about things.

39
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.150
And what I really wanna go on rants
on is interviewing, because I have so

40
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.030
many good interview rants.

41
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.530
Don't worry, that's coming.

42
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.049
It's gonna be very exciting.

43
00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:26.126
So the first question I wanna ask
everybody, and you don't say it out loud,

44
00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:29.478
just think,
why is interviewing so difficult?

45
00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:31.609
Yes?

46
00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.170
&gt;&gt; It's mostly about fit for both parties.

47
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.024
So even if you have the skills,
it might not be a good fit.

48
00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.078
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

49
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:44.608
Let's go a little broader, though.

50
00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:45.108
Little broader.

51
00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.400
&gt;&gt; You don't really know what to expect
what type of questions are gonna be there.

52
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.240
And it seems like every company
has their own standards,

53
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.070
so you don't really know
how to prepare for it.

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.784
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that one.

55
00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:08.861
I think that's a bit more accurate on
why interviewing is just so difficult.

56
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.320
Because we all have this different
idea about what engineering is.

57
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.800
Thus, we all these different idea
about what engineering should be.

58
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.150
And we all have, honestly, kind of a
dishonest view of ourselves as engineers.

59
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.800
We have this idea of how we build
things and how we solve problems.

60
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.830
And we try to apply that rubric to
everybody else, but we're all different.

61
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.616
That's what makes us all beautiful
is we're all a little bit different.

62
00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:36.366
And that's why you can't really just walk
in and say there's the SATs of interviews,

63
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:37.743
or something like that.

64
00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:41.106
Because we all have just a little bit
of nuances that make us a little bit

65
00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:41.735
different.

66
00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:46.521
But at the end of the day,
I like to think why interviewing is so

67
00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:49.396
difficult is because we're
all a little different and

68
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:53.101
because we all think a little
differently about what engineering is.

69
00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.540
That makes it challenging.

70
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.290
So to break that down a little bit more,
I read this great blog post the other day,

71
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.071
and I encourage you to
read it at some point.

72
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.337
But this person, they broke it down and

73
00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:12.343
they said there is essentially
three different types of engineers.

74
00:04:12.343 --> 00:04:17.040
There are the engineers who
say engineering is just math.

75
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.986
It's all about the algorithm,
it's all about efficiency,

76
00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:23.002
it's all about clever code and
manipulating numbers around.

77
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:25.533
Cuz at the end of the day, that's what
we're doing, we're flipping switches,

78
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:26.058
ones and zeros.

79
00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:31.136
And that's what engineering is all about,
the algorithms, the beauty of it all.

80
00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:38.320
Yeah, and often, that's why we get a lot
of algorithm questions in interviews.

81
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.550
People are trying to say does this
person think like a mathematician?

82
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.730
Does this person think in algorithms?

83
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.952
Do they look at a problem and
say Double sort,

84
00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:51.876
yes, that is a great
algorithm to apply right now.

85
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:59.060
Another type of programmer is programming
is all about hardware performance.

86
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.041
It's all about that low level bit-lipping,
how close to the metal, do you understand?

87
00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:08.683
Anybody know anybody like that,
the hardware people?

88
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.706
They're a different bunch.

89
00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:13.730
They're good, too.
There's those type of people.

90
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.570
They're the hackers, the tinkerers.

91
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.720
Probably writing in assembly.

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.209
Trying to understand do you
understand what a CP register is?

93
00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:24.706
Do you understand what the L1
cache is versus the L2 cache?

94
00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:25.795
Performance questions.

95
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:26.993
That low-level base knowledge.

96
00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:31.220
You get interview questions like that,
that really low level stuff.

97
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.721
And then, there's the third category of
engineers, the tinkerers, the builders,

98
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.480
however you wanna describe them,
that's where most people sit.

99
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.815
In our ideal world, we're like,
I'm all about performance.

100
00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:48.260
Or I'm a math person, that's all I do.

101
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.880
But if you're a front end engineer,
generally, you're building things.

102
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.460
That's about talking to people,

103
00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.100
understanding specs, understanding
different browser compatibilities.

104
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.970
All these edge cases,

105
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.900
all the things that we don't think
of as engineering, like meetings or

106
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.140
efficiently communicating your ideas,
that's the third category of people.

107
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.614
And that's where most of us lie.

108
00:06:14.052 --> 00:06:16.600
But most interviews
aren't like that at all.

109
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.490
There's no interview
where you walk in you say

110
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.300
hey, have a seat, this is our designer.

111
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.600
Nice to meet you.

112
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.150
This is our product manager.

113
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.760
And we're gonna walk through
building a product today.

114
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.670
So we're gonna spec it out.

115
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.110
Gonna have you meet other engineers, and

116
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.060
we're gonna have you build
a product by the end of the day.

117
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.480
That would be closer to what
we do in the real life.

118
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.350
But that's not what happens at all.

119
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.000
So a lot of the disconnect with
interviewing comes from this idea of

120
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.300
we don't know what type
of engineers we are.

121
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.849
And we don't know what type
of engineers we wanna hire.

122
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:53.070
This is just my opinion.

123
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.120
There are many problems with interviewing,

124
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.830
but I think a lot of it comes from
we don't understand ourselves.

125
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.080
We don't understand what engineering is.
