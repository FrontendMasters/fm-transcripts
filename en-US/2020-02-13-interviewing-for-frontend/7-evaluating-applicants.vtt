00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.600
So as the interviewer on an application,
what are you looking for?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.648
Cuz some point in your careers, if you
move up to the place where you're doing

3
00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.028
hiring and probably a lot of you are,
will be there eventually.

4
00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.805
When you look at a resume,
think what sort of roles this person fit,

5
00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:18.330
what sort of experiences they have?

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.513
And then, this one is critical,
what sort of experience do they need?

7
00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:26.382
And be honest,
if someone's building static webpages,

8
00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:28.850
do they need a CS degree and
ten years experience?

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.182
Probably not, lets be honest about this,
I've seen many jobs for

10
00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:39.116
junior intern engineer needing a CS
degree and like four years experience.

11
00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:44.145
Like come on, come on,
[LAUGH] and the real question is,

12
00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.470
is there any bias in your selection?

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.038
Are you only looking at people
that went to Ivy Leagues?

14
00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:53.754
Are you only looking for men?

15
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:57.520
Are you only looking for
people that live in the same place as you?

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.981
Are you only looking for people who
are from the country that you're from?

17
00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:04.890
Is there bias in your selection process?

18
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.510
I guarantee there's some,
we're all human but

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.550
the best thing to do is acknowledge it.

20
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.120
And then say what can
I do to mitigate this?

21
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.928
And this is true of every company, many,

22
00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.390
many hiring managers are like
I only want these criteria.

23
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.920
Jem, I can't find qualified engineers.

24
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.614
What are you looking for?

25
00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:28.302
Well, I'm looking for few that went to
Harvard, and had a 4.0 GPA, and maybe like

26
00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:33.531
a patent or two for their name like,
well, good luck with that, and I move on.

27
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.071
Be honest with yourself about what
sort of engineers you wanna hire and

28
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:37.730
what's your engineers you wanna work with.

29
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.638
Would you fit the criteria
that you're looking for?

30
00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:45.163
These are things to think about
because at some point in your career,

31
00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:48.610
you will probably have to hire somebody
and you're looking at resumes.

32
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.330
So start thinking now about what
sort of things you're looking for.
