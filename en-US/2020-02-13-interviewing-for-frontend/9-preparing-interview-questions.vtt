00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.750
So if you're calling a candidate,
these are questions they're gonna ask you,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.900
or you should be prepared to answer these.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.350
How many steps are in
the interview process?

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.160
I wanna know.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.640
There are companies that I've declined
the interview for, I had a phone call,

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.550
it was nice and cordial, and
I said how many steps in the interview?

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.320
Well there's a phone screening and
then there's another phone screen and

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.620
then seven to eight rounds alongside.

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.170
Let's say I'm pass.

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.940
I'm just doing this for of course anyways,
like I don't really wanna interview.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.690
But I certainly don't wanna take three,
four days of my time.

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.890
But they should know that after that,
if they don't know them,

13
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.230
they don't have a good process and

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.390
that may not be the best
interviewing experience.

15
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.090
And this is funny.

16
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.480
Actually, it's funny to me,
it'll be funny to you in a second.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.330
Would you think it's hard to interview
at the big FAANG companies, so Google,

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.300
Apple, Microsoft, or a startup?

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.003
I think interviewing at the big
companies is a little easier.

20
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.070
Are the challenges harder?

21
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.580
Maybe but you know what you're going to
get at the companies because they've done

22
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.580
this for years, decades even.

23
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.350
They have a process for
the hiring manager talks to you.

24
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.440
And then this person comes on,

25
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.200
they have a whole panel of people,
they have it down to a science.

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.710
Startups could be easy, could be hard.

27
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.100
You don't know what you're going to get.

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.860
Because it's usually some guy like me.

29
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.000
It's like crap, I got an interview today.

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160
Let me Google interview questions for
JavaScript engineers like, yeah,

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.680
this one looks hard, cool.

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.540
That's what you get a lot of time.

33
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.420
So understand the process and

34
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.060
if you're giving the interview,
please have a process.

35
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.890
Like I will say this repeatedly
because it's important.

36
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.022
You are changing someone's life
when you make them a job offer,

37
00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:48.299
when you interview them.

38
00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.020
You are changing the course of their life.

39
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.570
Like, take it seriously.

40
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.890
Don't be arbitrary with your questions.

41
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.640
If I had to start off, I would start and
try to interview at Google or

42
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.330
something like that.

43
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.360
I would fail wildly
probably the first time.

44
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.290
But they have this process and
I know that, okay,

45
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.172
these are the types of questions that
they ask, I can study for these.

46
00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:10.810
A startup,
you don't know what you're going to get.

47
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.734
So as if you're working
in a small company,

48
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.658
like have a process have these
questions you have in front of time.

49
00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:19.074
But above all, have know at least
the number of steps you're going

50
00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:20.880
to be in the interview process.

51
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.730
That's not too unreasonable.

52
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.610
Another question is how big
is your engineering team?

53
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.070
Probably know things like this.

54
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.970
I wanna know, am I working
with 20,000 other engineers or

55
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.580
am I working with five engineers?

56
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.980
It changes the dynamic.

57
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.030
It changes the influence I'm
gonna have on a company.

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.420
Which team would I be interviewing for?

59
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.230
What am I gonna be doing?

60
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.150
This one's pretty straightforward but

61
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.220
you'd be surprised the number of
people that couldn't tell you.

62
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.920
They'll be like, we'll see.

63
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.590
Why are you talking to me?

64
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.600
You clearly have openings.

65
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.480
What are the openings that you have?

66
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.730
What is the culture like at your company?

67
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.040
Is it work hard, play hard?

68
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.690
Is it it's very relaxed and easy going?

69
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.530
Is it we celebrate wins
together as a team?

70
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.074
We go out for dinner every night.

71
00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:07.970
Some of these may vibe with you,
some of them may not.

72
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.230
You should be prepared for
a candidate to ask you these questions.

73
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.030
What I like is, who are your competitors?

74
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.910
That kind of tells you what
sort of company it is.

75
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.330
We're like we're going against
the titans of industry.

76
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.320
How big are you two people?

77
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.740
You're like, cool.

78
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.720
I'm waiting for that challenger.

79
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330
No, I've got a kid on the way.

80
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.196
I really don't want to take
that risk in a small startup.

81
00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:34.060
That's fair, but be prepared that they're
going to ask you these sort of questions

82
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.360
and what sort of projects what I work on.

83
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.507
As a hiring manager recruiter, you should
probably know some of the things they're

84
00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:43.510
probably gonna work on,
especially for hiring someone senior.

85
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.360
I like admittedly, I don't need to do,
I don't want to do database migrations.

86
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.692
I don't want to do them.

87
00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:56.210
And I don't want to do manually converting
data into an Excel spreadsheet.

88
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.550
You might have to do that though.

89
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.990
You might say, hey, you know,
we're going to do some of this and

90
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.550
then we'll do the cool stuff.

91
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.930
That's fine, but have an idea about
the sort of thing they're going to be

92
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.590
working on in the future.
