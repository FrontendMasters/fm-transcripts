1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.350
You made it.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.870
You are as mentally exhausted as you
would be during a real interview,

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.950
except with less judgement
from the interviewer.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.620
Just kidding, I've been secretly
judging you all this entire time.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.985
All right, so what now?

6
00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:19.312
The results.

7
00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.240
These things are binary.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.470
Either you pass, or you didn't pass.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.870
Odds are, you're probably gonna fail.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.950
I still say this, even after this, even
after doing many, many interviews, and

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.610
giving many, many interviews,
I still say interviews are half luck.

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.460
I do, that's just the way it is.

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.598
Sometimes you're just gonna get the right
question on the right day with the right

14
00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:46.526
Interviewer, and you're just in your
groove, feel like, I know this.

15
00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:48.920
I know how to implement a sleep function
because I've thought about this before.

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.444
I know how to implement debounce.

17
00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.120
And you'll just have it.

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.640
You're in your groove and
you know it, and it feels so good.

19
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.991
Sometimes, it's just not your day.

20
00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:58.361
They ask you every
question we didn't cover,

21
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.990
every question that you
couldn't possibly know.

22
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.360
Or it's just a bad question, or
you get up there and you freeze.

23
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.380
It's okay, you're not a failure,
that happens.

24
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.609
I have failed many interviews,

25
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.892
I've probably failed more
interviews than I've passed.

26
00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:14.350
I've tried to get to 500 but
yeah, it's tough.

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.249
It's all right, you're no less of
an engineer, and it's a hard ego blow.

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.636
But it's gonna happen,
just mentally prepare yourself for it.

29
00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:25.198
And if you pass, hey,

30
00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:29.640
maybe I'll do a short course on
how to negotiate your offer.

31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.480
That's always the fun phase.

32
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.260
When you can increase your
salary by like 50 grand,

33
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.840
maybe more if you're good at negotiating,
maybe some stock options.

34
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.440
Maybe some nice vacation time.

35
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.230
That's the good times.

36
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.608
That's what you wanna get to.

37
00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:43.850
You want that positive stress.

38
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.998
Like, what if I could squeeze them for
ten grand more?

39
00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:47.390
That's a good time.

40
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.800
If you failed, that's okay.

41
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.500
What you can try to do is ask for
feedback.

42
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
A lot of companies are cagey with
feedback, I think it's a lawsuit thing,

43
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.950
they don't want to get sued or
something like that.

44
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.370
But hopefully, if the company's good,
they'll give you some feedback.

45
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.751
They'll say, hey, you know what?

46
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.675
You aced CSS, you aced HTML.

47
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.818
Some of your data structure's
though a little weak.

48
00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.590
I would come back and study those.

49
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.527
That's good feedback.

50
00:02:10.527 --> 00:02:13.470
Remember, there's winning and
then there's learning.

51
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.090
Now, if you're the interviewer and
you say, hey, I really like this person.

52
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.920
They were fantastic.

53
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.810
They didn't quite have the depth of
knowledge that we're looking for.

54
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.680
That's gonna happen, too.

55
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710
Not everybody you interview is gonna pass.

56
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.119
That's just the way it goes.

57
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.970
So as the interviewer,
I really encourage you to give feedback.

58
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.790
I definitely encourage you.

59
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.470
If you interview for my team, and you
have the phone screen, I always write up,

60
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.890
it takes a bit of time, but
I always write up, hey,

61
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.580
here's the pros of what this person did.

62
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.520
Here's where they didn't succeed as much,
but

63
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.810
they're welcome to come back and
try again.

64
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.880
And that's helpful,
cuz if I just say no, no what?

65
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.010
What didn't I do right?

66
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.820
That's not helpful to anybody.

67
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.930
If you really like them,
invite them to reapply.

68
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.580
Give them feedback.

69
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.760
Say hey, if you come back and work on, I
don't know, your CSS a bit, I think you'd

70
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.910
be an ace for this position, but we need
you to show a little bit more depth there.

71
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.980
I know someone,
they applied to Netflix three times.

72
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.100
Failed two times,
got through the third time.

73
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.006
Third time, they aced it.

74
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:18.990
That's the kinda people I wanna work with,
people that are dedicated.

75
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.650
And like I said,
you're probably gonna fail at some point.

76
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.040
It's okay.

77
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.550
If you gave a good experience,
a positive experience, and

78
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.710
you were helpful on the way, you helped
them, they didn't get stuck anywhere.

79
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.400
If they did get stuck,
you really helped them out.

80
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.270
You invite them to reapply.

81
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.570
Engineering, especially front engineering,
is a really small world.

82
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.900
I can throw out some names and
you probably all follow them on Twitter or

83
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.150
something like that,
because we all know the same thing.

84
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670
It's a small universe.

85
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.547
So don't be a jerk to people
who are interviewing with you.

86
00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:50.540
You will probably see them again and
they'll remember you.

87
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.440
And stay in touch.

88
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.310
If you really like someone and

89
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.300
you feel like they have a lot of
potential, stay in touch with them.

90
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.510
Reach out every six months to say hey,
you want to reapply?

91
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.480
The worst thing that happens
is you get rejected.

92
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.240
There's no cost.

93
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.940
Other than your ego,
there's no cost to that.

94
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.570
All right.
So that was interviewing for finance.

95
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.025
Great job everyone, you all made it.

96
00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:12.880
We're all a little tired.

97
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.754
I'm a little wired, had my green tea.

98
00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.330
Feeling good.

99
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.020
But you made it through
the end of the day.

100
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.400
Now, again I can't guarantee
that all these questions

101
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.990
you'll see perfectly examples,
you'll see like exact replicas.

102
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.738
But you'll probably see some
similar problems along the way.

103
00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:33.098
And it really helps if you follow along
how to break down that problem and

104
00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.402
try to understand what
are they trying to get at.

105
00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.804
I'm trying to understand this
person understands promises or

106
00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:40.880
they understand like how to
iterate the DOM, things like that.

107
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.440
And don't focus so
much on getting the right answer,

108
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.230
talk about how you got to the solution.

109
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.754
That's probably the most
helpful advice I can give you.

110
00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.285
Thank you.

111
00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:54.673
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
