00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.600
If you're giving a code test,
which probably a lot of you have already.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.430
If you haven't, you probably will
at some point in your career,

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.880
you're gonna give a code test.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.010
These are things you want to do.

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.870
Make the problem straightforward,
as much as possible.

6
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.970
It should be here are the requirements,
bam, bam, bam.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.190
Do they fulfill these requirements?.

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.280
If it takes you 20 minutes to explain
the problem, it's not a good problem.

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.450
[LAUGH] It should take two minutes to
explain what you're trying to do or

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.540
it should be readily apparent.

11
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.850
Have a read me with tips in there.

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.490
If you wanna put in style guidelines,
that's fine too.

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.850
But just make the problem straightforward
and don't over complicate it.

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.279
I once, so my gem stories,
I once interviewed for

15
00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:45.920
or applied for our a role as
a front engineer for a company.

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.680
And they gave me a code test, it was,
given this dot pixel image, so dot pixels,

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.380
a lot of you won't know what that is, but
it's an image made up of tiny little dots.

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.020
They're not so together,
don't @ me on Twitter.

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060
I know all images are made
up of tiny little dots.

20
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.920
But this is made of larger dots.

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.960
And the idea was, you had to parse this
image, which I know nothing about.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.726
You had to parse this image and
then create Conway's game of life so

23
00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:15.699
that in 1000 iterations
it created this image.

24
00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:18.850
Real interview question.

25
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.460
These are skills that I
did not have at the time.

26
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.924
I didn't know how to parse an image, never
read an implementation of Conway's game of

27
00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.780
life, let alone getting
it to run backwards.

28
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.510
That's not necessarily a good code test.

29
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.380
Maybe it was for that company.

30
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.200
It wasn't for me.

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.270
I just didn't even do it.

32
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.440
Nothing wrong with that.

33
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.690
And if you get a challenge that
you're like this isn't good.

34
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.190
I don't agree with this.

35
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.430
You don't have to do it.

36
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.980
You don't have to kill yourself on it.

37
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.030
It's good to take on all challenges.

38
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.730
But if you feel like this is insulting or

39
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.650
this isn't relevant to my skill set,
you don't have to do it.

40
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.600
It's okay.

41
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.890
And give them that feedback.

42
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.246
If you can say like, I don't feel
it's relevant in my skill set,

43
00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.270
be polite about it, but that's fine.

44
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.734
But if you're giving the code test
what I really want people to do and

45
00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:07.380
this is something we don't do at all,
be honest with the time constraints.

46
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.960
Here's a code test,
it's gonna take five to seven hours.

47
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.270
I usually double whatever
they tell me it's gonna take.

48
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.220
If they say it's gonna take ten hours,
it'll probably take 20 hours.

49
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.480
And think about empathy.

50
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.090
Would you wanna be on the other side
of the table, you're looking for a job,

51
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.660
and someone's like hey,

52
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.090
here's a code challenge that's
gonna take eight hours to complete.

53
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.610
That's eight hours of unpaid
labor that you're doing, and

54
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.470
it's gonna take them
more than eight hours.

55
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.880
So try to keep it down to
the two to three hour range,

56
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.620
something you can complete in that.

57
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.810
And if possible, give them the option.

58
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.380
This is one of my favorite things.

59
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.660
Give them the option.

60
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.720
Give them say hey we have a code test
gonna take two, three, four hours.

61
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.250
Or we have a phone screen,
it's gonna take an hour.

62
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.740
Because different people
have different strengths.

63
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.000
Some people, live code wanna get it done,
they're great at that.

64
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.500
Some people, they get anxiety,
they get nervous.

65
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.932
So in that case give them a code test,

66
00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:01.680
give them something they can sit
down research, figure out how to do.

67
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.940
So if possible, give people an option.

68
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.580
I think we should all be doing that

69
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.990
as engineers because
sometimes I'm in a hurry.

70
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.390
I'm like, let's just get this done.

71
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.910
Give me the phone screen.

72
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.560
Sometimes I got time and
this is really important to me.

73
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.770
I'm going to show you what I can do.

74
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.830
I'll do the code tests.

75
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.590
Importantly, have a code review checklist.

76
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.451
It should look something
along these lines.

77
00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:26.320
So as in have a rubric that
you can apply to everybody.

78
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.940
So in doing this, you remove any bias you
have, like, hey, this person's named Jem

79
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.390
too, so I bet they're gonna do
pretty well at this code test.

80
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.320
I already have bias there.

81
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.500
Having a rubric that you can give
to all engineers who are reviewing

82
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.930
this code test means it's more than
one person that can review the tests.

83
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.100
It's not just one engineer and
you can apply it fairly to everybody.

84
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.263
They're exceptional, we wanna bring them
on site immediately and if they pass,

85
00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:56.000
we're gonna give them very high salaries,
they did really well.

86
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.620
Well what makes them exceptional?

87
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.770
What are things you consider
to be an exceptional engineer?

88
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.060
Well if they're average, that's fine too.

89
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.660
Are you looking for average engineers?

90
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.000
Yeah, maybe.

91
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.320
Or maybe you're like I only want top tier,
exceptional or bust.

92
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.980
That's on you.

93
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.303
I'm not gonna tell you how
to hire specifically, but

94
00:04:15.303 --> 00:04:17.160
I can tell you how to the interview.

95
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.940
But doing stuff like this is again
things that larger companies have down,

96
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.400
they've got every company for
something like this where they should.

97
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.020
Start ups, it's a little mixed bag.

98
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.294
And this is a point that has gotten me
before because if I use a say ES2019 or

99
00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:40.002
a ES2020 in my scripts and
the person doesn't understand that,

100
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:44.560
there might be like,
this isn't JavaScripts, fail.

101
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.620
But if you have this rubric of like,
hey, I don't really get this, but

102
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.820
they use advanced features.

103
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.200
That's cool too, put that under good.

104
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.500
Yeah, but you just want a level
playing field, you wanna make it

105
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.690
as predictable as possible when
you give someone a code test.
