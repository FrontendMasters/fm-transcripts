&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The second
part of this exercise,

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.210
as we talked about, is that we want to do
some refactoring of that existing code.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.790
So we're not gonna change the behavior,
but just do some refactoring.

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.620
And we're gonna try to use the pieces
that we have already learned about in

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.390
the course up to this point.

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.246
So you might remember we talked
earlier in our lecture about binary,

7
00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:25.166
we've talked about compose and pipe, we've
talked about point freestyle currying,

8
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.578
and even our list operations like reduce.

9
00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:34.053
So we want to incorporate all of
those pieces into our refactoring.

10
00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:37.654
The code that we're gonna be
refactoring is the code right here,

11
00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:42.560
where we have these three separate calls
to our filter, our math and our reduce.

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.214
What we want to do is refactor
that code the entirety of lines 12

13
00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.896
through 22 To be point freestyle.

14
00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:53.686
This is going to be particularly
challenging, so don't feel bad if you

15
00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.730
need to look over at the solution part
two file to get some sort of hints.

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.520
But think about each one of these pieces,

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.270
like, we have a thing here
that looks like a composition.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.930
So we could represent this function as
a composition of these two functions.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.690
That's what I mean by looking at each one
of these pieces and figuring out piece,

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.980
by piece, by piece, how do I make that
into a point free definition for that?

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.450
And your end result will be that we'll
be able to run this entire operation

22
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.283
in a point free way and
it'll still produce our 3886.

23
00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:30.193
All of the utilities that you're going to
need to do that are already included in

24
00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:31.193
this file.

25
00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:35.623
You have them right here, you have
a curry, a compose, a pipe, and a binary.

26
00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:38.183
So all of the pieces that
you need to accomplish this

27
00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:39.523
are already included in the file.
