&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What I'm getting at
here is that function purity is a level

2
00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:07.730
of confidence,
it's not a binary characteristic.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.498
Over the break I was asked by someone,
what if there was a syntax that we could

4
00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:16.913
say, this thing is definitely pure and
it threw errors, or not?

5
00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:21.050
And that's missing the point of JavaScript
and the point of function purity.

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.130
Because the point of it in JavaScript

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.620
is how confident are we
the reader in its behavior?

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.190
In other words, from here on out in our
discussions, when I ask you the question,

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.850
is this thing a pure function or not?

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.090
The wrong answer is yes or
no cuz it's not a binary question.

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.880
The right answer is I have a high degree
of confidence that it will behave pure.

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.776
Or I don't have very much confidence
that it will behave pure,

13
00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:55.916
that's really what we wanna get.

14
00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.418
So we wanna be able to get
those sunglasses on so

15
00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:01.220
that when we look at our code,
we see that.

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.760
We see the parts where we have
high degree of confidence, and

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.950
we see the parts where we have
low degree of confidence.

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.030
And we wanna shift that balance as much as
possible to the high degree of confidence.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.481
That is the heart of
functional programming,

20
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:19.674
using pure functions as much as possible.

21
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:27.900
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And remember,
these are calls, not function definitions.

22
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.100
What's important is the function call
behaves pure or doesn't behave pure.
