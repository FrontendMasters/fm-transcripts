&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right,

2
00:00:00.924 --> 00:00:05.898
let's do an exercise to practice these
point free refactoring techniques.

3
00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:09.353
In this exercise, you've been
given several different functions.

4
00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:12.940
The README will indicate three of them,
the output function,

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.063
the printIF function and
the isLongEnough function.

6
00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:22.090
Those three functions you need to modify
or refactor them to be defined point free.

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.900
So if you look in the exercise file,
you'll see they're all at the top.

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.350
You have the output function,
the printIf function, and

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.100
the isShortEnough function,
I'm sorry, the isLongEnough function.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.310
Those are the three
functions that you want to

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.599
refactor to be point free using
the techniques that we talked about.

12
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.946
There are listed in
here a number of hints,

13
00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:46.580
and these are important for
you to actually complete the exercise.

14
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.572
So make sure you check out
the hints in the README,

15
00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:52.670
they should help you with
those three factorings.

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.143
Your test cases essentially are that the
first one should print hello, then nothing

17
00:00:57.143 --> 00:01:01.250
should be printed by the next two, and
the last one should print Hello World.
