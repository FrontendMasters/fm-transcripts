00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.470
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now, I've shared with
you this highly scientific graph, okay.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.216
This plots out very specific scientific
data of my journey of learning how

3
00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:14.283
to incorporate declarative
techniques into my programming.

4
00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:22.220
And my ascertation of what impact that
had on the readability of my code, okay?

5
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.120
You notice that at the beginning,

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.920
there's kind of an initial wind
that you start using something.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
Like somebody teaches you something
like math, for filter or reduce, or

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.610
everybody's favorite 4H, which by the way
is not functional programming, sorry.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.070
But somebody teaches stuff like that and
you throw it in the code, and

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220
now you feel like,
my codes, way better now.

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.483
So you started to get these early wins,
this is exactly how it went for

12
00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.579
me as I started to
understand these things.

13
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.502
And for me,
the journey was I'm writing a book so

14
00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:54.939
I just mapped out a whole book
of all these to do comments.

15
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.013
Giant sections with nothing but
to do in them, I gotta go learn this,

16
00:00:58.013 --> 00:00:59.025
I gotta go learn this.

17
00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.733
And I would learn it and then try it and

18
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:04.650
some countdown like, it's a little
easier to understand now, I get it.

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.860
So you get some early wins and

20
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.730
you start to feel like you're
building some momentum.

21
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.060
I'm only sharing this journey because
some of you may go on a similar journey.

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.620
Most everybody that I've talked
to you has been on this journey.

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.635
Okay, that you get these early wins, but

24
00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:23.090
then stuff starts to get a little more
complex, you get a little bit more

25
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.270
sophisticated about the stuff
that you're bringing together.

26
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.640
And eventually,

27
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.720
you get to a point where the winds
are starting to taper off a little bit.

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.720
You're still using functional techniques.

29
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.550
It's not like you've given up on them,
but you're not seeing,

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.500
when you incorporate a new technique,
as big of a difference in the readability.

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.180
Things are slowing down, you're
reaching the top of that first curve.

32
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.873
Then you throw a few more
things in to the mix, and

33
00:01:51.873 --> 00:01:56.900
uh-oh, one time you look at some code and
you're like, what does that do?

34
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.780
And you look at what it used to be,
and you have this thought, and

35
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.840
it was better before,
it was more readable before.

36
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.385
And some of you I can see your smiling
because you've been on this curve,

37
00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.630
you've already know exactly
what i'm talking about.

38
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.887
Maybe it wasn't functional programming,

39
00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:19.550
it maybe something else but
you see this curve it happens, okay?

40
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.950
And it's gonna happen in your
journey on functional programming,

41
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.570
I'm almost certain.

42
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.921
And I'm sharing it with you because I'm
trying to not solve that problem for

43
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.866
you, but make you aware of this effect.

44
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.835
And encourage you and
challenge you not to give up,

45
00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:41.117
because you keep plunging along and
you keep trying new things like I did,

46
00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:45.860
and eventually you get to some point
like that dotted line that's there.

47
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.392
That's about the point where you wanna
give up because, now the code is worse

48
00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:52.779
than it was before you ever started
trying to incorporate this new thing.

49
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.671
Whether it's a new framework, or

50
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.262
whether it's this whole new
paradigm functional programming,

51
00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:02.980
same thing happens, you reach this point
of questioning, why did I even start this?

52
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.270
This existential crisis,
why am I even, am I even a programmer?

53
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.160
What is this?

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.200
Well all go through that, and
that's where many developers give up.

55
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.177
And it's where I almost gave up.

56
00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:22.410
It was about chapter two and
a half of my book.

57
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.200
And I was like, wow,
this is really much worse than I thought.

58
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.394
It's much more complicated than I thought.

59
00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.406
It's gonna take a lot more time for me to
learn and get comfortable with this stuff.

60
00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:37.310
This isn't gonna be like,
I'm done in a few months and then I,

61
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.280
I get my membership card in the mail,
now I can say I'm functional programmer.

62
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.036
That's not how this is gonna be,
there's gonna be like decades.

63
00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.179
Years and decades of me trying
to change the way that I think,

64
00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:48.410
to think and solve problems differently.

65
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.640
But at the same time,
I still got a ship code.

66
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.760
I would imagine most of you, if not all of
you are in the business of being paid to

67
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.720
ship code, I gotta ship code.

68
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.270
Even though I'm a teacher, I got to ship
code because I gotta write libraries and

69
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.000
help support all this stuff I teach.

70
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.560
I have to still ship code, every once
in a while I work on a side project

71
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.930
where I have to ship code,
so it's not good enough.

72
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.950
For me to sit in an ivory tower and
think big thoughts about what

73
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.825
programming could be,
if I can't put that into practice.

74
00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:25.224
It's useless, it's a waste of time.

75
00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:28.190
And I would imagine many of
you are in the same boat.

76
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.310
So you're gonna get to that point where
you're headed towards the pit of despair,

77
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.024
as they call it, I love that,
the pit of despair.

78
00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:39.470
You're gonna be headed towards
the pit of despair and

79
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.330
you're gonna be saying, nope back up.

80
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.030
Go back to what I was doing before,
and I was there.

81
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.940
And what I'm gonna encourage you
to do is keep pushing through,

82
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.130
because I kept pushing through.

83
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.670
I kept saying,
maybe it was from some naivete on my part,

84
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.030
but I kept saying,
one of these days I'm gonna get it.

85
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.150
Maybe I'm just a little thick
headed on this stuff, but

86
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.020
I'm gonna get it, it's gonna start
to click and I kept pushing.

87
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.844
And I kept trying to add new things
onto it, and create new knowledge and

88
00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:09.867
new experiences and
try it on a different piece of code.

89
00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:13.210
And at some point,
the bottom of the curve arrived.

90
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.404
And one day, I looked at a piece
of code that was using a curried

91
00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:20.760
composition or whatever.

92
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.030
And it clicked for me,
that just that one line, not everything.

93
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.690
It's not like you wake up one day and
it all works, but

94
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.439
just that one line actually
made more sense to me.

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.780
And a week later, another line
of code made more sense to me.

96
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.270
And a week later, and a month later,
and six months later.

97
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.981
I'm three years into this journey of, I
wanna learn about functional programming.

98
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:46.799
Book's been out a year and a half, I spent
a year and a half writing the book, so

99
00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:48.778
I've been at this three years.

100
00:05:48.778 --> 00:05:52.780
I'm not the end of the curve, but
it's on a good trend, that's what I'd say.

101
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.730
So it's worth it to keep pushing,

102
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.180
it's worth it to encourage your
co-workers to keep pushing at it.

103
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.090
The ultimate pragmatist as well,

104
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.550
it doesn't really matter
what the code looks like.

105
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.050
Just as long as it ships because
that's what I get my paycheck, and

106
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.730
I am sensitive to the idea of this
pragmatism, this whole courses based

107
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.560
on the idea, that we still have to
ship working executable Java Script.

108
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.850
It's not good enough that it just looks
nice, but it doesn't actually work.

109
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.900
It has to actually work,
it has to do something useful for me,

110
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.210
and it has to be maintainable.

111
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.230
I gotta be able to go back and

112
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.620
understand what the hack I was doing,
otherwise what was the point?

113
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.620
So this look at functional
programming that we're diving into,

114
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.100
is born out of this idea of,
let's not take the theoretical top down.

115
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.850
Let's take the practical and
pragmatic bottom up approach.

116
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.150
Let's start with what we know how to do,
and

117
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.550
try to make it a little bit more
functional, one piece at a time.

118
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.721
Let's look at this pile of
equipment on the ground, and

119
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:00.983
let's just figure out
what a carabiner does.

120
00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:04.871
And then let's just figure out how to tie
a knot, and how to put some rope in, and

121
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.040
how to take our first
step onto the cliff face.

122
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.820
That's it, just one thing at a time, and
if you do and if you keep pushing through

123
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.430
and you keep trying that stuff in it,
I can not make that not a difficult climb.

124
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.539
I don't have the magic to fix that,

125
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.269
I can't make it not a difficult climb,
what I can make it for you.

126
00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:30.886
And this is my hope with the book and
the course, what I can make it for

127
00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:33.680
you is, that it's a manageable climb.

128
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.330
Somebody can tell you how the equipment
works, so that you can start climbing.

129
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.790
That's what we're trying to do here, okay?

130
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.327
Now, there's a tension that
I wanna call out in this.

131
00:07:46.327 --> 00:07:48.970
There's a tension here because I and
you may have missed it.

132
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.750
And that's why I wanna call it out.

133
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.670
Because I said at one time, no,
no, you gotta keep pushing on it.

134
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.080
You gotta keep trying it, and
even though it's more confusing.

135
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.480
And then at the same time,
almost in the same sentence, I said, but

136
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.439
you still got a ship code
that can be maintained.

137
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.530
There's a tension here because, if you
only work with code that is familiar,

138
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.970
and readable, and understandable.

139
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.070
And anything you do
that's not readable and

140
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.530
understandable, you just take the shortcut
out of, well I'm a pragmatist,

141
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.800
I got to go back to what works.

142
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.940
Then you're never gonna
advance along that curve.

143
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.177
And at the same time,
if you advance along the curve and

144
00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:31.187
you never connect it back to
anything practical and pragmatic.

145
00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:32.763
You're going to lose the motivation and

146
00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:35.060
you're gonna bail out
at some point anyway.

147
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.820
So there is a tension here,
and I can't fix the tension.

148
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.690
I can simply call it out for
you and make you aware of and

149
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.380
be prepared for, at every moment that you
take one of these concepts, like what

150
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.860
we're gonna talk about in this course,
and you try to apply it to your code.

151
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.030
It is going to happen, that it's more
confusing at that moment than it was

152
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.450
before, because it's not yet familiar.

153
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.070
So you're going to have to be comfortable
in that gray area where it's uncomfortable

154
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.180
and feels less readable.

155
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.890
And you're gonna have to try it not once,
not twice, ten times, a hundred times,

156
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.560
a thousand times before that
thing becomes familiar.

157
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.040
And at the same time,
you're gonna have to have an eye towards.

158
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.185
If I wanna continue,
if I wanna sustain the journey,

159
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.864
if I wanna make it up the mountain.

160
00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:25.561
It's simple when I got the chip code and

161
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:30.626
I got to make a practical choice that at
this in my code and at this point in my

162
00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:36.540
journey of understanding I don't need that
thing, a four loop will do, you with me?

163
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.170
That tension, it exists, you should be
aware of it, you should meet it face on.
