00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Okay, so during
our break I had a couple quick questions.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.130
One of them is that if
you are finding yourself

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.040
in a situation where you can't
affect your scene by lights,

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.090
some things to try would be to see
what the material is of your mesh.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.670
So in this example here,
we have mesh basic material,

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
which means that the cubes are not going
to be picked up by lighting information.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.040
So actually just by changing that to mesh
standard material, all of a sudden now

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.360
we're going to get lighting
information like shadows and shading.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.940
And then just to make sure that everything
is added to the scene as well, and

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.479
that kind of stuff.

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.542
And then one of the questions that came
up is what's difference between WebGL and

12
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:41.270
Three.js.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.130
And what's the relationship?

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.846
And that's a good question.

15
00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:49.370
So basically WebGL is the technology
underneath the hood of Three.js

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.610
that allows us to create these kind of
3D in interesting graphical scenes.

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.650
And if you were just
to use WebGL directly.

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.625
Then you're gonna have to
use a lot of boiler plate,

19
00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.520
because it doesn't really give
you something like a cube or

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.890
a sphere, it just gives you information
about vertex attributes and

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.840
all these complicated things, and
you have to actually do all the math, and

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.980
you have to do all the sort of set
up in the boiler plate to say okay,

23
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.560
a cube is made up of this many vertices or
spheres made up this many vertices.

24
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.290
And you have to do everything manually.

25
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.130
So most of the time when we work
with WebGL because it's too kind of

26
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.010
tedious to write all that from
scratch every single time,

27
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.630
we end up creating libraries and
frameworks that help us out.

28
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.500
And so there's some libraries that
are based on WebGL, like Three.js.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830
That are really good for 3D stuff, and

30
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.120
then there's some libraries like
PixiJS which is more for 2D.

31
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.923
You can still use it for
3D as well, or like 2.5D.

32
00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:52.275
And then there's others like 2JS which
is another two-dimensional library,

33
00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:54.247
but designed on top of WebGL.

34
00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:58.690
P5JS also has a WebGL
sort of support in it.

35
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.100
So there's always different frameworks.

36
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.970
Quite often they end up using WebGL
because the performance of WebGL is much

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.040
better than canvas 2D.

38
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.800
And so

39
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.820
it's really just a way of interacting
with our GPUs on our machines and

40
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.960
allowing us to get like the most graphical
power out of the computer as possible.

41
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.953
And so, sometimes you can
actually use WebGL for like,

42
00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:22.190
totally non-graphical things as well.

43
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.780
Like, I think some Bitcoin mining
stuff is using WebGL sometimes.

44
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.790
And same with like, audioshares,
and stuff like that.

45
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.865
So yeah, it's a really big ecosystem and

46
00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.160
Three.js is really just
one little part of it.

47
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.150
But it is probably one
of the more standard or

48
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.830
one of the more popular 3D
frameworks in WebGL frameworks.
