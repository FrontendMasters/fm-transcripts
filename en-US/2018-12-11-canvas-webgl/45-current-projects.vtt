00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.772
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What are you working on now?

2
00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:08.546
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So now other than
this workshop which I've been working on,

3
00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:13.767
I just finished a little project,
it was quite small.

4
00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:19.298
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: I don't know if
I can show it on this screen with us

5
00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:21.718
feeding into the live stuff, but

6
00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:26.657
it's basically actually just a cursor
effect kind of on a website.

7
00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:31.272
They've wanted it to be when you visit the
website, they have this really pronounced

8
00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.811
sort of paint-splashing effect
as you move around the website.

9
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:39.042
So it's very much like a classic WebGL,

10
00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.658
using WebGL to enhance a website.

11
00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:44.133
It's a very small project.

12
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:49.162
Before that one, I was working on one that

13
00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:54.912
was a print design campaign for
Nordic Impact,

14
00:00:54.912 --> 00:01:00.964
if I can just find it within
all of my folders here.

15
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:13.614
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Well, this is
originally some of the concept, and

16
00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:19.189
we ended up using WebGL to create a,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Where's

17
00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:19.973
all the outputs?

18
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:23.479
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Yeah,
just go to the website.

19
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.591
You can check out the website
yourself actually.

20
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.664
It's like the project is open,
and the ideas that for

21
00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:35.740
this music festival called
Nordic Impact in France,

22
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.605
you would create a little poster
using some different music or

23
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:45.349
different parametrics or functions.

24
00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.510
And this was a collaboration with a design
studio in Paris who really worked on sort

25
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.620
of the design and the overall aesthetic,

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.923
as well as working with another creative
coder who really worked on the background.

27
00:01:55.923 --> 00:02:03.435
And then this part I was a bit of the sort
of WebGL aspect, the 3D WebGL aspect.

28
00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:07.864
As you can see is using a lot of
the same concepts we talked about.

29
00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:11.346
Probably it looks better on your
own MacBook or your own screens,

30
00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:15.907
your own Windows or whatever computer than
this projector, but it's basically just

31
00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:19.862
tweaking the values, allows the user
to create their own sort of poster.

32
00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:22.462
And then they end up with an image, and

33
00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:25.980
the image is large enough
that they can print it.

34
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.083
And actually this whole project
is using Canvas sketch as well.

35
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:33.870
So it was kind of another test of using,
whoops.

36
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.225
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: It was another
test of using Canvas sketch for

37
00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.455
a client work, and
it turned out really well.

38
00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:44.156
And there's this Hall of Fame,

39
00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:47.940
where you can see all the people who
have generated posters before you.

40
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.032
And so
you can just share the poster online.

41
00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:54.878
And it's just to get people to get
excited about the music festival that

42
00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:55.943
was coming up.

43
00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:00.354
Yeah, just like a general design
sort of project using WebGL.

44
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.157
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: But
sort of my work is all over the map,

45
00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:10.317
it's like sometimes it's more digital with
WebGL and sometimes, like one project that

46
00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:15.465
I'm really happy with,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Is this one,

47
00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:20.591
and I think it sort of shows another
side of creative coding that

48
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:25.911
I didn't know before is using hardware and
using Raspberry Pi and

49
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:30.577
stuff like that to create
an interactive installation.

50
00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.165
And so the idea is that it's this cold,
wintry day in a park, and

51
00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:37.901
you stumble on this sort of warming,
hot-looking-like thing.

52
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.745
You step up to it, and when you step up
to it it captures your body heat, and

53
00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:43.736
it turns red in response to your heat.

54
00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:46.232
And it's using a thermal camera, and

55
00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:51.110
inside it's using a few LED screens
with a frosted painted glass.

56
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.330
And it's actually,
you can't really tell by the inside but

57
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.301
it's using a noise function to create this
undulating pattern of different colors.

58
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.506
So it's basically all the same
stuff we were talking about today.

59
00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:09.350
I'm just using it in LED screens, and
then putting a pane of frosted glass in

60
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.230
front of it to create that nice,
blurry effect.

61
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.603
And that was a really fun project.

62
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:19.793
But yeah, same kind of concepts,
noise functions, and

63
00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:24.962
seeing creative coding ideas, but
applying it in a different space.

64
00:04:24.962 --> 00:04:29.758
Thanks a lot everyone,
that was a lot of fun.

65
00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:32.113
