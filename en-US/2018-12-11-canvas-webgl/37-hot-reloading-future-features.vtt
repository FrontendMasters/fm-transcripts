&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: One other thing I
just wanted to show, and this is kind of

2
00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:08.680
an experimental feature of canvas sketch,
but it's kind of a cool feature.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.925
It starts to show where this tool can go
in the future and how it can be more and

4
00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:18.275
more of a really,
really good workflow for creative coding.

5
00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:23.061
So instead of just running
Canvas sketch on my share file,

6
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:30.109
I'm going to run the same thing, but I'm
going to specify this flag called --hot.

7
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.964
And now when I reload and
when I start coding, and I save my file,

8
00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:41.290
it's going to hot reload all
of the changes into my scene.

9
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.244
And so the result of that is that it's
a much more immediate feedback as you're

10
00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:48.808
coding and as you're saving your file.

11
00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.556
Because the changes in your
code aren't producing this very

12
00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:57.280
bright flash of white as the page reloads.

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.100
It's just taking the new code and
it's rerunning it, and

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.240
it's applying those changes
without changing the time, or

15
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.800
without changing the seconds of
how long your loop is running.

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.630
So that's just something to keep in mind.

17
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.680
It's a bit more of an advanced feature.

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.380
But if you are using this tool,
you could definitely use that.

19
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.900
And it actually works, not just for
the shaders, but with WebGL and with 2DR,

20
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.310
it works as well.

21
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.250
Starts to become really useful as you're
doing more generative art sort of stuff.

22
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.010
But it's not something
we'll do too much today.

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.294
I just wanted to show you
guys that feature and

24
00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:37.090
how sort of the future features of this
tool are gonna get better and better.

25
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.550
Another feature that is gonna come up
eventually with this tool Is parameters,

26
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.510
like little sliders in the top right.

27
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.880
So you can start to really easily,
let's say you wanted to add a color here.

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.600
Instead of specifying your colors with
vec 3s, eventually in this tutorial,

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.390
you're gonna be able to use color
pickers and stuff like that.

30
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.070
But I just haven't built those in yet,
so they're still a work in progress.
