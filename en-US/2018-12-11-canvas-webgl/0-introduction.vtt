00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So hello.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.700
Welcome to creative coding.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.330
My name is Matt.

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.910
I'm a creative coder and a generative
artist, living in London right now, but

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.290
I'm from Canada.

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.540
And yeah, I'm really excited to
be here giving this workshop.

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.990
So just a bit about what
we're gonna be doing.

8
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.055
Today is about creative coding, but
also it's about generative art, and

9
00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.419
we're gonna get into what that is but
it's a passion of mine.

10
00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.289
And it's how I thought could
be interesting to make

11
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.990
this workshop all about generative art,
and creative coding both together.

12
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.370
The idea of this workshop is that
it's designed for beginners but

13
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.210
also if you're experienced,
even if you do this for

14
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.830
living, you should hopefully
gain a lot of the process and

15
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.190
workflow that I've been building myself
for the last two years basically.

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.880
And if we're gonna talk about these
tools and what kind of tools we can use

17
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.550
to really create high quality,
production ready generative art or

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.080
creative code for whatever the application
is that we wanna talk about.

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.020
In the morning,
it's gonna be more around 2D, [COUGH] and

20
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.280
more about creating print artworks.

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.451
And then in the afternoon,
we're gonna be talking more

22
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:17.530
about 3GS, WebGL, 3D, and
more [INAUDIBLE] stuff.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.240
So I keep saying generative art and
I keep saying creative coding,

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.540
I just wanna give us a sense
of what those things are.

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.430
So creative coding is
a really broad term and

26
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.400
it's basically just using code to create
something expressive, artistic, or

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.540
creative really,
rather than just functional.

28
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.770
And so that's really broad, it compasses a
whole bunch of different types of fields.

29
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.990
And really today we are gonna focus
more on the web and focus more on

30
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.310
how do we use this kind of expressive
stuff to create web experiences or

31
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.780
experiences that can be created with
web technology, like a print artwork or

32
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.930
an animation or a video or
something like that.

33
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.030
And then generative art, this is
just how I wanted to look at today.

34
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.512
It's sort of a subset of creative coding,
and

35
00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:09.490
it's creating artworks with an emergent
system or autonomous system.

36
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.850
A system that sort of acts on its own, and
so as the artist, you're not just creating

37
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.960
the art yourself but you're also sort of
dancing and playing with this machine.

38
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.790
And the machine is creating
the art as well as you are.

39
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.700
So you sort of feed these instructions or
rules to a machine,

40
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.610
and it goes on its own and creates
the artwork, along with your own input.

41
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.670
And so
before we get into coding things, and

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.010
before we get into actually
doing some exercises and

43
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.360
stuff like that, just wanted to run
through a few examples that inspired me.

44
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.160
Some different artworks and some different
projects, and hopefully it will give you

45
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.830
a better sense of all the different types
of things you can do with creative code.

46
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.110
So this one is an app that
I thought was really cool.

47
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.180
It's by Zach Lieberman and Zach Lieberman
is definitely somebody worth checking out.

48
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.412
He does a lot of really cool,
creative code projects.

49
00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:10.514
He's a co-founder of open frameworks
which is a library for creative coding.

50
00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:15.098
And he's also a co-founder for the school
for poetic computation in New York which

51
00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:19.309
is a school that really focuses on
creative computing and creative coding.

52
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:23.282
And he created this app that's an
augmented reality app where you just sort

53
00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:26.180
of play with typography in weird and
funky ways.

54
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.360
You can share videos, you can share
images, and so on and so forth.

55
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.240
And I think this is a really good example,

56
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.040
the kind of stuff you can do if you,
after maybe today,

57
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.010
we'll start to know a bit more about 3D
and about shaders and things like that.

58
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.700
And those kind of concepts,

59
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.370
even though we're gonna be looking
at it through a generative art,

60
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.580
they can be applied to create something
like this, which is like a little for fun.

61
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.490
But then,

62
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.380
also there's other artists that are
working more in traditional sort of sense.

63
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.075
In the sense that they're creating
art that you hang on a wall, or

64
00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:01.009
something like that.

65
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:02.950
And they're still creating it with code.

66
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.540
So this is Anders Hoff also
known as inconvergent, and

67
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.110
he creates these very complex emergent
systems that sometimes simulate

68
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.480
nature like differential growth or
something like that.

69
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.339
And then he quite often sends
the output of these programs.

70
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.239
He sends these to
a mechanical pen plotter.

71
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:24.980
This is something that I'm
also really inspired by.

72
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.490
And something that I've
experimented with as well.

73
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.380
So this is a project that is
using the mechanical pen plotter,

74
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.620
which is that device that
you can see in the top left.

75
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.100
And a mechanical pen plotter is basically
just a device that you send it commands,

76
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.140
movement commands, and
you attach a pen to the end of it.

77
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.742
And then it will move exactly
as you programmed it to move.

78
00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:49.630
And so it's a really cool
way to take your code and

79
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.889
actually produce a physical output.

80
00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.087
And the physical output is sort of,
it's robotic, and

81
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:58.966
it's exact and accurate because
it's clearly done by a robot, but

82
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.300
it has these sort of imperfections
where sometimes the pen

83
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.199
will dry up where the pinwheel
caption adds or something like that.

84
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.399
And so yeah, so inconvergent definitely
is one of the coders that sort of really

85
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.830
started this movement of using but
there have been coders in the 60s, and

86
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.590
a long time ago that have been doing the
same sort of stuff just in different ways.

87
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.361
So this isn't exactly new or
anything like that, but

88
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:28.880
it's one exciting way of bringing
your code into a physical space.

89
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.917
And then you can also create physical
installations with the same concepts that

90
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.382
we're talking about today.

91
00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:39.788
So this is a really cool one, I thought,
just cuz it's so simple and so

92
00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:40.920
fun and playful.

93
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.070
And, yeah, so it's basically,
I'll just skip forward a bit.

94
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.800
Basically you just pick up this ball,
and immediately the user or

95
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.320
the audience understands that
they're sort of holding the sun.

96
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.390
And on the left, the projected image
could very much be like a shader or

97
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.820
something, something that
we're gonna be talking about

98
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.080
later in the second part of the workshop.

99
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.970
And inside the ball, it could just be some
specific hardware that sends commands,

100
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.437
accelerometer data, or
something like that to the visual system.

101
00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:22.269
And so, yeah, this is one
application of creative coding.

102
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:27.057
We can totally make these cool,
interactive experiences, sometimes for

103
00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:31.693
museums or for galleries or
art installations, sometimes for events,

104
00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:36.569
like parties or a fundraiser event for
a big company, and so on and so forth.

105
00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.709
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

106
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.437
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And then this one
I thought was a nice one to talk about

107
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:44.940
as well.

108
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.220
This is more of a commercial work, so so

109
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.510
far I've been talking a lot
about artsy projects.

110
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.340
And you might get the sense that you can
only do artsy projects with this kind of

111
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.090
stuff but you can also really
apply this to commercial work.

112
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.350
This is a project by Active Theory, and
I think California they work out of.

113
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.590
And it's a WebGL project and
they partnered with Google basically.

114
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.690
Google was their client.

115
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.410
And so they created this experience where
you send a virtual airplane using your

116
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.230
phone, and you send it to this
sort of virtual 3D world.

117
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.740
It's using WebGL, it's using all the same
stuff we're gonna be talking about today.

118
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.980
And then they actually also
had at the launch party for

119
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.160
whatever the keynote was for Google.

120
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.850
They had everyone actually
interacting with the experience, and

121
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.790
so this is just to show that
it's not all about creating art.

122
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.170
If you wanted to make more of a living
out of it, there's a lot of commercial

123
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.499
applications as well for
brands, and so on and so forth.

124
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.519
And then, one last little thing would
be this company nervous system.

125
00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:48.645
And I just wanted to
highlight them because, so

126
00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:51.100
far, I've been talking
about digital experiences.

127
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.550
But, this is creating more
of a product with code.

128
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.870
And nervous system,

129
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.560
they create a lot of different things
like sometimes ceramics or jewelry or

130
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.980
items for your house, or puzzles in this
case, and quite often it's generative.

131
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.350
It's using sometimes inspired by natural
things, like differential growth,

132
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.980
just like inconvergent and Anders Hoff,
but applying it to 3D printing or CNC.

133
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.160
Or sort of injection moulding type stuff,
and

134
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.010
fabricating actual products out
of the code that they write.

135
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.024
And so that's just to say that creative
code doesn't need to be digital.

136
00:08:29.024 --> 00:08:30.610
It could also be physical.

137
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.970
And there's a lot of
different applications.
