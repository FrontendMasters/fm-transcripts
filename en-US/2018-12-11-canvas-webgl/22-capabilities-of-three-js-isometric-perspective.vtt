00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.110
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So, the first thing
I want to do is make the background not

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.740
black cuz black background, I don't know,
I want it to be a bit brighter.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.220
So, I'm gonna use white, or
you can use maybe an HSL value,

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.230
which stands for hue saturation lightness.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.210
You can set it to zero, and then maybe
something very bright for the lightness.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.360
So 0 hue, 0 saturation,
something bright for

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.860
the lightness and that's just gonna
give us a bit of an off-white color.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.758
And then what we're gonna wanna do is
let's say we get rid of this lighting

9
00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:36.319
stuff.

10
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.082
So these two chunks of code, we have
the ambient light and the point light.

11
00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:44.750
Let's come back to those later, but
let's just delete those for now, and

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.210
you'll notice all of a sudden that
we end up with a black rectangle.

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.850
And that's like I was saying earlier
when you turn the lights off,

14
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.940
you don't have any lighting in the scene,
and so your mesh just becomes black.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.530
But what we can do to fix that
is we can change this material.

16
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.580
So, right now we're using
a mesh standard material.

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.270
That means it's trying to take
the lighting from the scene, but

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.390
there is none.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.660
So we're gonna use a mesh
basic material and

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.120
we're gonna change color
to something else.

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.940
So that's pretty standard stuff so far I'm
just gonna open my console just so I can

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.450
see any error messages in case they come
up, and you'll notice maybe a warning.

23
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.400
This mesh basic material, roughness
is not a property of this material.

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.860
That's because we're passing value
roughness but mesh basic material,

25
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.850
it doesn't need these things.

26
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.310
So we can just delete those two things.

27
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.321
Just end up with the color red.

28
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:47.955
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Okay, so
there's our red cube, and the next thing

29
00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:52.903
I wanna do is I want us to
get rid of our controls.

30
00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:56.306
So maybe we'll come back to doing
controls later but for now,

31
00:01:56.306 --> 00:02:00.628
I wanna do an animation that's looping and
that's seamless and it's going on

32
00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:05.470
its own rather than us having to move
it around in order to see it changing.

33
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.000
So I'm gonna just delete
a couple of lines.

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.630
There's this one, this is the one
where we set up the controller.

35
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.970
We don't need that anymore and
then we just have to make sure that

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.600
the other two places that it controls
are referenced from are also removed.

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.670
So there it is in the render function.

38
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.670
We're removing it and

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.140
then there it is in the unload function
and we're removing that as well.

40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.557
So there's three places in total,
and if that works,

41
00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:35.164
if that works then you should have
the image but you can't control it, and

42
00:02:35.164 --> 00:02:39.917
this is just gonna set us up a bit more
for doing a video loop or a seamless GIF,

43
00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:43.375
rather than having to always
interact with the scene.

44
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.912
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And so the next
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna try

45
00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:54.350
and get back to some of this
style that I was showing here.

46
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.110
And remember how I was saying we had
the difference between a prospective and

47
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.620
orthographic?

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.270
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna try
and learn about how do we do isometric or

49
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.290
orthographic in this case perspective so
it looks a bit more

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.660
like this because we want it be a bit more
artsy, a bit more like monument valley.

51
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.640
So I go back to my code and

52
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.900
what I'm gonna do here is change
perspective camera to be orthographic

53
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.500
camera and we don't need to pass any
arguments yet and it looks like that.

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160
And we're gonna have a couple of errors or

55
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.480
empty scenes for
a few attempts here, so don't worry.

56
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.405
These two lines after that,
let's just remove those,

57
00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:41.580
cuz those are useful for
the perspective, but

58
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.130
we're gonna them a little differently for
isometric or the graphic camera.

59
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.480
So, it just looks like that so far.

60
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.140
And then when we come down
to the resize function,

61
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.000
what we have to do is we have to say okay
every time there is a scene resizes,

62
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.960
we need to set up our camera
to this new scene size and

63
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.870
this part is really just
a bit of a memory game, and

64
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.190
it's such a memory game that I've
actually put it in the cheat sheet.

65
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.050
So if you go to your repo,
if you go to the cheat sheet and

66
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.450
you scroll almost all the way down
you'll see isometric 3GS camera.

67
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.740
And this is something that
I just copy-paste a lot, so

68
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.100
don't feel guilty if
you're copy-pasting it.

69
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.906
I would literally suggest copy pasting
it now, just because it will get

70
00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:32.061
us there a bit quicker and
we can chat about what it's doing.

71
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.170
Usually I don't copy paste stuff,
but in this case,

72
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.200
it's a bit of boilerplate and
sometimes I forget it.

73
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.250
So don't feel too guilty
if you're copy pasting.

74
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.020
So what it's doing it's
just setting the attributes

75
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.220
of our camera using some of the code.

76
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.840
So we're gonna have to just
clean this code up a little bit

77
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.670
because I just copied and pasted it and
I wanna just clean it up a bit.

78
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.500
So the first thing you'll notice is we
have these two lines at the bottom.

79
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.050
You only need one of them, so
I'm just gonna remove that one.

80
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.900
Just make sure you have one.

81
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.670
It doesn't really matter.

82
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.390
The other small issue is that

83
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.450
in our props here we're using something
a little different than width height.

84
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.310
We're using view port width and
view port height.

85
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.460
So width height is gonna air us out so
I'm just gonna change that to be view port

86
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.490
width divided by view port height, and
that's just kind of an internal part

87
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.780
of the 3GS template that it's using view
port width instead of width and height.

88
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.720
And the difference in our case
is kind of nothing at all, but

89
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.970
if you have maybe if you're using
physical units or something like that,

90
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.140
the viewport might not match
exactly the width of your image.

91
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.053
But in our case it's not
really a big difference.

92
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.661
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So if we had
copied that correctly And we save,

93
00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:04.430
we should already end up with what is
an orthographic or asymmetric perspective.

94
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.400
So I don't know.

95
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.100
Maybe you guys managed to get that far.

96
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.880
And then one thing that I don't wanna
do here is I don't wanna just rotate

97
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.580
the mesh.

98
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.220
We'll come back to doing
some animation in a second.

99
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.250
So I'm just gonna delete that line.

100
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.410
And now we have a very
boring looking output, but

101
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.620
let's make it a bit more interesting.

102
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.028
So, instead of just
creating a single mesh,

103
00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:32.482
let's create many meshes, and so
we're gonna wrap this in a FOR

104
00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:38.045
loop, so I just indented it,
I'm just gonna do like ten for now.

105
00:06:45.714 --> 00:06:48.521
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
they're all in the same position so

106
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:53.980
they're all overlapping each other so
it doesn't look any different yet.

107
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.680
So I'm just gonna do this,
I'm gonna set the position.

108
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.650
For now, let's just it's just
do you know what we'll do,

109
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.690
is because what we want to do is we
want to set a random position for

110
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.020
each of these cubes because
we have 10 cubes now.

111
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.980
And so, I mean if you set this position to
a different position you're going to start

112
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.510
to see it moving around the screen.

113
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.040
And we want to use a random value.

114
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.350
So you can do math.random, or what
we're actually going to end up doing is

115
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.090
bringing in the random number
generator that we had before.

116
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.780
We'll do that in a second.

117
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.860
And if you're this far you're
probably gonna get this blob of red.

118
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.587
That's because the cubes are really big
and we need to scale them down a bit.

119
00:07:47.587 --> 00:07:53.301
So what we're gonna do is mesh.scale and

120
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.572
then multiplyScalar.

121
00:07:56.572 --> 00:07:59.996
This is a function that will
multiply the x, y, and z,

122
00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.830
all by the same number
value that you give it.

123
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.960
You can use some number value there.

124
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.550
While you're doing that,
I just want to very quickly try and

125
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.250
explain 3D coordinates
in a very simple way.

126
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.200
This is something that took me a really
long time to wrap my head around, so

127
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.110
don't feel too worried if you're
still trying to pick it up.

128
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.600
But basically when we work in 2-D we have
the top left of the screen which is 00 and

129
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.058
the bottom right of the screen is
the width and the height of the screen.

130
00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:38.080
But in 3-D we don't have those
pixel coordinates anymore.

131
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.200
There's no such thing as top left or
bottom right of the screen,

132
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.540
the only thing we have is this virtual
world with these arbitrary coordinates.

133
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.170
You might be wondering how do I move
this exactly three pixels to the right?

134
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.400
You can't just move this cube
three pixels to the right because

135
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.050
pixels don't exist in this.

136
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.430
The thing that we're working with,
this arbitrary coordinate space, and so

137
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.030
the best way to think about it is to think
of it in terms of real world units like

138
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.090
meters or inches or something like that,

139
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.520
so you would specify a coordinate
space that you want to deal with it.

140
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.050
So, let's say we want everything in
our virtual world to be in meters, and

141
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.240
then you specify an origin and
everything is relative to that origin.

142
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.220
So if I was to say I'm standing at
the center of the world, the center of

143
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.570
the world is always 000, and then every
object that you place in your world

144
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:35.270
is gonna be relative to where you're
standing, where that origin is.

145
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.560
So if I was to place an object to the
right of me, maybe we might say that it's

146
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.420
x along the x axis by one unit,
maybe this is maybe not one full meter.

147
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.140
But imagine it's one meter, it's the same
with going backwards or forwards,

148
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.640
if I was to step forwards that might
be along the zed axis by one meter.

149
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.880
And if I was to be in the air maybe
it would be one meter in the air.

150
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.830
So it's a really hard thing to
sort of wrap your mind around and

151
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.490
it took me a long time but

152
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.150
I just tried to think of it in terms
of just real world positioning.

153
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:12.250
Like if I was to place this 3D mouse
somewhere on the table and move it

154
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:19.390
this way that might be one unit along
the x or along the y or along the zed.

155
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.430
And actually there's a little
trick that I do all the time, and

156
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.040
you guys can try and do it as well to hold
your fingers out like this like a gun

157
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.900
just using your thumb and
your index finger on your right hand.

158
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.810
And you stick it out like
this just in front of you and

159
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.430
then you stick out your middle finger and

160
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.940
you make your little finger perpendicular
to your index finger and this

161
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.010
becomes the three axis X, Y, Z that we're
actually gonna be dealing with in 3D.

162
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.590
And you just have to
remember these three things.

163
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:56.520
You have to remember that your
thumb is the Y axis, and so your

164
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.090
thumb is going up and down just following
the line of your thumb going up and down.

165
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.277
So that's y, so if we actually were
to change, where this is x, y, z,

166
00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:12.588
if we were gonna change this numbers, the
y coordinate, you'll see if I make this 2,

167
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:17.530
or 3, is going up and down because
our thumb is going up and down.

168
00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:22.240
And then for the other finger,
let's say our index finger is zed.

169
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.770
So Zed in this case is gonna
be forward and backwards.

170
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.850
So if we were to change the zed,
which is this third coordinate,

171
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.430
we'll start to see it's going
depending on where our camera is

172
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.590
it's gonna maybe appear to go forwards or
backwards.

173
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.400
But this is this weird concept that we
have to just try and deal with for now.

174
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.740
And if you're ever stuck,
just think of this where your thumb is y,

175
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.100
your index finger is z, and
your middle finger is x.

176
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.670
So you might wanna write that
down just to remember thumb is y,

177
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.730
middle finger is x, index finger is zed,
but it's a really weird thing to try and

178
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.790
wrap your head around, and
even more difficult to try and explain.

179
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.530
Especially because when I started
this kind of creative coding

180
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.480
I wasn't very familiar with
any of these math concepts.

181
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.840
And this is a sort of misconception I
think is that a lot of people think that

182
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.730
to be a programmer, to be a creative coder
you have to know a lot about math, and

183
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.870
I don't know a lot about math, and I have
had to learn it basically myself, but

184
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.940
that's basically just to say that
it's not as scary as it appears.

185
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.970
And definitely with practice and
just trying to memorize things, and

186
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.970
use the ways of memorizing just like the
index finger, you can start to pick it up.

187
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:49.800
So, yeah, just to say you don't need to be
a math wizard to do this kind of stuff.

188
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.010
Okay, going back to our code.

189
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:59.470
I was saying I wanted to position
things randomly in this xyz space.

190
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.328
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to require

191
00:13:04.328 --> 00:13:08.691
our utility that is the random utility and

192
00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:13.190
we have to do canvassketchutil/random.

193
00:13:18.812 --> 00:13:19.653
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So
it just looks like that.

194
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:29.538
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And then here in
our positioning for each of these x, y and

195
00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:35.647
zed coordinates I'm gonna do random.value,
so I'm gonna do this again,

196
00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:42.250
random.range which means I wanna a random
number between a minimum and maximum.

197
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.273
So the minimum is gonna be -1.

198
00:13:45.273 --> 00:13:46.960
We'll just use -1 to 1 for now.

199
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.801
And then the same,
random.range -1 to 1 and

200
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:59.830
the same here, random.range -1 to 1.

201
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.910
So what you should end up with is this,
these three coordinates.

202
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.938
Each of them is going to
be random between -1 and 1,

203
00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:12.333
and our cubes are gonna start
to appear all over the place.

204
00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:17.904
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
one thing I'm gonna do just so

205
00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:20.620
we can visualize this a bit better.

206
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.820
If we scroll down to our orthographic
stuff that we copy-pasted I'm

207
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.190
gonna increase the zoom to
a larger number like 2 or 1.5.

208
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.030
That's gonna just zoom
everything out a little bit so

209
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.890
we can start to see this
scene a bit better.

210
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.250
Does anyone remember what I was
saying earlier about geometries and

211
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:47.250
how we shouldn't be using
this geometry many times?

212
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.780
Well this is one thing where we should
change this because right now I´m creating

213
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:57.730
ten box geometries and so we should
actually just use this BoxGeometry once

214
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.170
outside of our loop, and
then reuse that for each mesh.

215
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:08.270
And this is gonna look no different, it's
just gonna produce a more efficient code,

216
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.390
and it's really important when you
start to do things like animation or

217
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.410
interactivity, especially if you're trying
to give somebody a mobile experience

218
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.040
with this code.
