&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Anyone
running into anything?

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.566
Any questions, comments?

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How does three.js
decide what to do if objects

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.759
are intercepting with each other?

5
00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.982
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: That's
a good question.

6
00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:21.155
So the way it works is that it tries
to replicate real life, basically.

7
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.698
So if you see a cube in
front of another cube, and

8
00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:27.641
then you rotate your camera around it so
that you're doing a full circle,

9
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:31.901
it will know based on the way it's
rendering, it'll be like,oh, this cube is

10
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:36.880
actually positioned in such a way that it
should appear in front of the other cube.

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.453
So it's basically just using these
XYZ positions that you give it.

12
00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:44.311
It's gonna end up placing everything
in this real world space.

13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.317
And then, depending on where your camera
is, the engine will figure out, okay,

14
00:00:48.317 --> 00:00:51.915
this cube is in front of the other one
based on where you're looking from,

15
00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:54.110
where your vantage point is.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.580
And there's ways of getting around that,

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.990
there's actually ways of
kinda hacking with that.

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.050
So sometimes you want an object like,
let's say you're in a game engine and

19
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.150
you're building some cool field
with grass and stuff like that.

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.692
And then you want it to be
when you look at the sun,

21
00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:11.811
you want there to be a lens flare effect.

22
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:14.591
And the lens flare
effect might be a circle

23
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:17.541
that's rendered with some transparency.

24
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.407
And that actually, you have to disable
depth testing, and you have to say that

25
00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:25.480
this circle was always appearing here
no matter where my vantage point is.

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.190
But generally, it will handle it for

27
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.280
you as long as you position
things in the right way.
