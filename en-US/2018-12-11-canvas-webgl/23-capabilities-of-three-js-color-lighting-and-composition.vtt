1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.090
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Okay,
now we can start to play with these values

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.090
a bit more.

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.670
We can start to try and create something
that looks a bit more interesting.

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.160
So the first thing I'm gonna do is just do
the same thing we're doing with position

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.190
and set the scale to three random values.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.826
Just copy pasting.

7
00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:22.987
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
then I'm going to increase the number of

8
00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:27.132
meshes,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: To something

9
00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:27.640
larger.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.488
I'm just going to play
with these values a bit.

11
00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:31.586
Increase the size.

12
00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:35.374
So multiply scale, remember,
is another of way of saying,

13
00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:38.435
I want to multiply the x,
y, z by the same value.

14
00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.069
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And then the other
thing that maybe we can do from this

15
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:51.740
morning, we can just do it again, is to
try and add some random colors to this.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.190
So one way to do that is again to
bring in the random color palettes.

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.050
So we'll just do that now.

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.730
At the very top of our file
require nice color palettes and

19
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.140
this is not the only way to
produce random color palettes.

20
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.590
Another thing we can do is that's really
powerful is to take HSL and produce

21
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.180
random variations of HSL and that's maybe
something to do as an exercise later.

22
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.590
Later on, but for now we'll just use
a random color palette module again.

23
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.160
So we require it up here and

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.010
then somewhere before our four loop
let's just select a single a palette.

25
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.665
So we do random.pick.

26
00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:42.343
Palettes and then again we're gonna select
a single color from that single palette.

27
00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:44.496
So random.pick(palette).

28
00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:51.736
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And we can start to
see things are coming together a little

29
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:52.249
bit more.

30
00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:57.914
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
every time we reload,

31
00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:00.430
we're starting to get
some more interesting.

32
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.130
Results.

33
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.194
And some of them are actually pretty nice.

34
00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.579
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: We can use some
of the same tricks we did this morning,

35
00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.380
we can use Gaussian randoms.

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.940
So maybe instead of always using a range
that produces a uniform randomness,

37
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.310
we can use Gaussian randomness.

38
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.150
We can also do some other stuff like that,
we can.

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.370
Set the rotation maybe of the mesh,
which we'll get into a bit.

40
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.452
But the next thing I wanna
do is add a bit of lighting.

41
00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:31.566
Just so that we have some
of the basics covered, and

42
00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:33.149
then we can work our way through them.

43
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:40.391
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So after we've
done our four loop, lets add a light.

44
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:44.530
And our light is gonna
be a directional light.

45
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.530
And the constructor, just remember at
any point if you're stuck with these

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.790
methods or these classes, three.js
has a really extensive documentation.

47
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.869
So if you go back to the GitHub repo,
you go to three.js and check out the docs,

48
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:08.142
they have docs on all these things so
we can find directional light.

49
00:03:08.142 --> 00:03:12.364
And it gives us what the arguments are for
the constructor, and

50
00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:20.242
it also gives us little examples
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And

51
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.410
so the way it works is
you pass in a color.

52
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.350
Let's just use red.

53
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.900
I like to use red as a test,
just so I can actually see it.

54
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.470
Sometimes if you use white,
it doesn't look that different.

55
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.480
And then the second value is
the intensity of the light.

56
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.770
And then before we see anything we
actually have to add it to our scene

57
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.570
because right now it's
not even in our scene.

58
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.350
So once it's in our scene
this light will get used but

59
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.660
remember what I was saying earlier about
materials is that this particular material

60
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.380
we're using is not gonna respect the
lighting that we're using in our scene.

61
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.378
So we actually have to go up and
change this

62
00:03:56.378 --> 00:04:02.217
MeshBasic(Material) to be
MeshStandard(Material).

63
00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:06.446
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
everything is gonna be very red and

64
00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.469
that's because our light is very red.

65
00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.215
So you can go back to being white and

66
00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:15.392
if it all works you should
have something like this.

67
00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.232
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: You're starting to
get something that it's a bit closer to

68
00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:23.336
this maybe monument
valley type of artwork.

69
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.571
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: One
thing we can also try and

70
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.410
do is place the light in
a different position.

71
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.689
So the way this works is
you do light.position.

72
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.352
And you set the xyz,
I'm gonna set it to maybe be 0,

73
00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:44.520
4, 0, which means that the light is
directly above the center of the world.

74
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.219
So it's perfectly above the center of the
world that it doesn't produce any shadows

75
00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:50.687
on the sides of the cubes.

76
00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:54.719
And if I was to make it maybe
directly to the right or left,

77
00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.678
or forward or backward of the world
using 0, 0 and then some number.

78
00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:02.614
We're gonna see that it's only
lighting up a single side of the cube.

79
00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:06.030
And I think that's kind of interesting for
the image that we're trying to create.

80
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.885
But you might also wanna place it in a way
that lights up all the different sides

81
00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:12.030
of the cube or
most of the sides of the cube.

82
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.868
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And then if you've
gotten this far one last thing we'll do is

83
00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:21.650
just add what's called an ambient light.

84
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.640
So an ambient light and I'll show
you by setting these values to be 0,

85
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.790
0, 4, so that we have a very harsh light
coming from one part of the scene.

86
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.780
And the directional light is just like,
it's a light that comes from one part, and

87
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.240
just sort of acts a bit like the sun, it's
just like blasts light all over your scene

88
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.980
kind of thing, and you'll notice that this
part that isn't lit by a light is black.

89
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.450
And so one thing we can do with an ambient
light, is we can set this color,

90
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.050
instead of being black,
to be a different color.

91
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.230
So you can scene.add{new
THREE.AmbientLight,

92
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.020
and you can set that color
to whatever you want.

93
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.970
And what that's gonna do is when three.js

94
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.170
sees part of your mesh that isn't
very well lit by the lights,

95
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.030
it's gonna use a bit of this blue,
or a bit of whatever color you want.

96
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.730
So quite often I just use like
a really low, really dark color.

97
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.860
So if you use HSL,

98
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.880
you can produce a really dark grey
like 10% light or at 20% light.

99
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.430
And then that's just gonna be so
that it's not perfectly black but

100
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.210
it's a little bit grey.

101
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.470
And that's a really subtle change.

102
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.321
Sometimes you can use a bit of a purpley
color and it looks pretty cool.

103
00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:49.790
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So so far we have
sorta introduced some new stuff here, and

104
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.482
we're still trying to wrap
your heads around how all of

105
00:06:54.482 --> 00:06:59.230
this positioning stuff works,
and that's okay.

106
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.143
But maybe by now you'll have some cubes
being rendered in different colors, and

107
00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:08.551
the next logical step is to see how do
we actually introduce animation and

108
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:11.022
how do we bring this into a bit more life.
