00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.269
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So to do that,

2
00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.949
let's open up our code again,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And

3
00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:08.715
here as you remember we
have this radius value, and

4
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:13.795
instead of just using a gaussian
randomness, we're going to create

5
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:19.240
a new thing here called radius, and
we're gonna use random.noise 2D.

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.615
And we pass in the horizontal and
vertical coordinate for our noise.

7
00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:30.230
You can pass in x and y which is in
indexes, but it's gonna be better to pass

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.150
in u and v because those numbers
are between zero and one.

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.360
So that's just gonna give
us more consistent results.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.263
And this radius,
then we're gonna use that here.

11
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.100
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Whoops,
just like this.

12
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.877
And remember that,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: With Cavas2D if we

13
00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:53.722
try and draw a circle with a negative
radius, we're gonna end up with a bit

14
00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:58.176
of an issue, so what you can do is
either wrap this with Absolute, or

15
00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:02.428
you can, that's maybe what I'll
do right now just to show you.

16
00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:08.983
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And the other thing
to remember is that we had a very small

17
00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:12.700
number, and now this value is between
-1 and 1, which is still small.

18
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.775
But we had before, we had multiplying it
by .01 or .05 or something like that.

19
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:24.261
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So
let's use a small number, like 0.05.

20
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:27.476
And,
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Now when you reload

21
00:01:27.476 --> 00:01:30.470
the page,
you might see something interesting.

22
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.609
One other thing that I wanna do now,
is remove this deterministic randomness.

23
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.870
It was just to show you
deterministic randomness.

24
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.484
But what I wanna do, is I wanna get
back into reloading the page and

25
00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:46.473
getting a random result each time.

26
00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:50.920
And that's what I just did, is I just
deleted that line that said, set seed.

27
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.748
And so
now when I reload the page I end up with,

28
00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:56.165
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Here we go,

29
00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:58.353
this different sort of scene.

30
00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:02.170
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: I'm using maybe,
I can use a smaller number.

31
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.835
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And now we can
start to see that with our noise function,

32
00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.525
it's still producing this randomness, but

33
00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:15.170
the randomness is slowly changing
from one grid position to the next.

34
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.393
And that's gonna be really nice
when we start to do rotation.

35
00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:19.300
That's what we'll do now.
