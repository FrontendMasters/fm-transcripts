&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Okay, the other
thing I wanted to just highlight is

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.070
because I think sometimes when you go
through these kind of exercises of using

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.970
cubes and spheres and toruses and stuff
like that, you get into this sense of

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.670
why am I just using a cube when I
can load any model in the world and

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.100
I can create this like
crazy complicated thing.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.432
But I think there's something
really beautiful and

7
00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:26.613
powerful in working with
really simple shapes.

8
00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:32.680
And so, this is a branding and sort of
design identity for a film festival.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.175
And I'm not even sure if they used code or
if they just used Cinema4D or

10
00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:37.980
something like that.

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.150
But basically, what I wanted to highlight
is that these simple shapes with

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.840
simple lighting information can be really
powerful depending on how you execute it

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.670
and how you present it.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.370
So rather than just looking at your
cube scene and saying it's just cubes,

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.910
it's not that interesting.

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.689
I think there's something
really powerful and

17
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.342
limiting yourself to only work with cubes.

18
00:00:57.342 --> 00:01:01.216
Or limiting yourself to only work
with simple and primitive shapes,

19
00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.484
just like we were doing with the 2D API,

20
00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:07.926
because it sort of forces you into this
different way of presenting your work.

21
00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:11.577
And so, that's just something to say don't
feel too discouraged if you're only able

22
00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:14.340
to create cubes because you can
still do a lot of stuff with cubes.
