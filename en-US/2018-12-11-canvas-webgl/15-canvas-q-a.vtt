00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: But I just wanted
to see if anyone has any questions.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.473
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have any way of,
let's say you're just reloading and

3
00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:12.445
getting a different
random setup every time,

4
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.275
is there any way you could be like,
I really like that.

5
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:17.898
How do you?

6
00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:20.540
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Yeah,
so, good question.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.360
So what I do when I'm doing this
generative art sort of stuff.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.850
Is that I will quite
often at the top of file,

9
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.390
somewhere right after I require random,
I'm gonna set random seed.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.840
And instead of always using
the same value, I'm going to use

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.720
a random number between like 0 and like
1 million, or something like that, and

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.530
the random module has a function
called getRandomSeed.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.980
And that's just gonna give you
back a number between zero and

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.870
something really large.

15
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.300
And then I console.log the seed.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.920
So I do random.getSeed.

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.630
And now in my console, I have all these
random distributions and stuff like that.

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.880
And I see this, you can now either,
in your console,

19
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.600
you can preserve log, so every time you
reload you still have the old values.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.780
That's one way I do it.

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.975
Another thing is just to manually instead

22
00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:29.340
of doing this, so I just have the value 1.

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.362
And I'm like value 2.

24
00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.817
Nah, value 3.

25
00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:34.480
Nah, and I'm like 4.

26
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.500
And I might just be like 4 is really good.

27
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.520
There's other things too like one thing
I do sometimes is I'll create a loop.

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.331
And I'll create a bit of an animation
where each frame is a different seed, and

29
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:48.280
each then each frame actually spits out
a file that is associated with that seed.

30
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.840
That's something else that is
kind of useful with this tool.

31
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.455
So I'm just gonna show
you if I was to move this

32
00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:00.380
random.getRandomSeed again
like I was doing before.

33
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.360
In the settings object, you can
specify a suffix which is a string.

34
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.400
And when you give a string, and
then you save your file, Command S,

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.140
if you look in your downloads, it will
have that suffix on the end of the file.

36
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.500
And so what I tend to do is
I'll use the random seed, so

37
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.950
I just do getSeed which
is the current seed.

38
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.163
And now when I save this file,

39
00:02:25.163 --> 00:02:29.866
I end up with a file that has
the random seed associated with it.

40
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.839
And there's there's even more
technical things that I do to try and

41
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.379
reproduce this artwork.

42
00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.474
Because this is like a thing that I run
into all the time in generative art is I

43
00:02:39.474 --> 00:02:43.962
have a variation that I really enjoy, and
then I lose it and I can't get back to it.

44
00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:48.171
And so,
there's another hotkey in Canvas Sketch,

45
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:54.430
which is Command K, and it doesn't
work unless you're in a Git Repo.

46
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.270
And what that does is it exports.

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.830
But then it also commits all of your code.

48
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.640
And the exported file with have
the git hash on the end of the file.

49
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.770
And so what I do is I'll be
tweaking code and I'll be like,

50
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.630
okay, I like this variation.

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.480
Let's say, this is really cool.

52
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480
I'll do Command K in a Git Repo.

53
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.610
It's gonna commit my
code as it is right now.

54
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.732
And it's gonna give me back a file that
associated with that exact Git hash.

55
00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:24.021
And so later, when I have, let's say,
like 50 or 100 different images,

56
00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:28.309
I can be like this image is really good
and I just wanna go back, change the size,

57
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:32.244
or I just wanna go back to that Git hash,
tweak it, and so you can do that.

58
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:36.534
But yeah, there is definitely a lot of
little things like that that you start to

59
00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:39.660
notice when you do this kind
of thing over and over again.
