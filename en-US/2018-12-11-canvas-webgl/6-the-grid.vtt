00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: I was showing this
earlier, and we're not there yet [LAUGH].

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.049
We're gonna get there, hopefully.

3
00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:11.071
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: But what I wanted
to say is that today, the theme of all

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.120
the work we're gonna try and be creating
is around this idea of the grid.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.995
And so this is one thing I've noticed,
when I'm doing my own sort of creative

6
00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:24.045
projects, is that sometimes,
if I start with an empty canvas or

7
00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.329
an empty just text file with code,
I don't know always where to go.

8
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.666
And so something that I've noticed in my
own process that's really helpful is to

9
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.840
start with a really simple theme that
you can apply throughout your project.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.190
I like to sometimes start
with a basic theme like grid.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.750
There's other types of things you
can do as well, like circles or

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.980
something like that.

13
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.420
And even though it's really basic and

14
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.710
really broad, you can start to
create different images from it.

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.580
And so this would be the most basic
thing we're going to start with,

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.330
just creating a literal grid of circles.

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.090
And then we are going to start
to use a bit of randomness,

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.180
trying to introduce a little bit more
of that generative type of idea.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
Pulling some circles out and
leaving some others in place.

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.350
And then we're gonna introduce some
techniques that I like to use for

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.950
random color pallets.

22
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.220
So this sort of trick that I
do in a lot of my own art, and

23
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.160
it just gives you a way to get really nice
colors through many different images.

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.730
And we're also going to
introduce Gaussian randomness.

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.637
So I would say this is something that I
only sort of started doing more recently,

26
00:01:28.637 --> 00:01:32.535
but it's something that's had
a big impact on my own outputs.

27
00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:37.359
Is instead of just using plain uniform
randomness like Math.random in JavaScript,

28
00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.247
you actually use a gaussian
random distribution.

29
00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:43.932
And that ends up giving you this more
interesting distribution of big numbers,

30
00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.965
and small numbers, and
negative numbers, and stuff like that.

31
00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:50.102
And it just ends up creating this
sort of nice more artsy stuff,

32
00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:52.720
almost like a paintbrush
was flicked on the screen.

33
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.030
This is sort of a little sketch that I
created as I was doing this workshop.

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.690
I just noticed that instead of drawing
circles, you can draw unicode symbols or

35
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.583
you can draw just text symbols.

36
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:09.037
So we're gonna talk a little
bit about how do we use

37
00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:11.730
text in Canvas API to do
this kind of artwork.

38
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.391
This is a Konami code, up down, BA,
whatever it is, up, up, down, down.

39
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.260
And then so, hopefully,
we'll get here eventually.

40
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.950
This is a very similar concept to this,

41
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.270
the only difference is that
there's a lot more shapes here.

42
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.930
There's a lot more randomization and

43
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.550
changes in the distribution
of how they're laid out.

44
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.960
But there's also an affect
that you might notice.

45
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.410
It's this undulating pattern and it's
almost like waves or something like that.

46
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.970
And we're gonna achieve
that with a noise function.

47
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.060
And we're gonna introduce some
concepts like noise as well.

48
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.270
And then just riffing
on the theme of grid.

49
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
This is another thing that when I was
creating these sort of little exercises.

50
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.740
I just like ended up saying what
would happen if I did 10,000 lines or

51
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.850
10,000 circles instead of just the 100 or

52
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.170
whatever, all of a sudden, I started
tweaking it with noise functions.

53
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.293
It started to look a bit more like fur.

54
00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:11.619
So I was like, that's kind of cool.

55
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.580
And then some other things
that you can do is animation,

56
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.010
just like a little simple
animation like this.

57
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.410
Or a little bit more complex but still
basic, still simple, nothing too fancy.

58
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.040
And this is more getting into
my own sort of print artwork.

59
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.160
And the colors on the screen are not
doing it justice, I promise you.

60
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.000
But it's actually a print artwork
that is also based on the grid.

61
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.736
Loosely based on the idea of the grid,
except it's using golden rations and

62
00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:44.225
golden rectangles to create
cells of different sizes.

63
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:48.646
And this is, again, this is just using the
same tools that we're talking about today,

64
00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:51.298
using Canvas Sketch and
it's using the Canvas API.

65
00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:55.104
Except it's actually a print
artwork that I was able to

66
00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:59.004
get printed properly with archival ink,
big A3 size.

67
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.940
And you can hang it up,
you can maybe, one day,

68
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.360
frame it or have it in some exhibition or
something like that.

69
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.320
You can imagine, as well, if you're
doing something like data visualization,

70
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.530
hopefully these techniques
would also be applicable.

71
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.570
Maybe you could do a cool print
series with data visualization or

72
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.900
something like that.

73
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.920
Let's try and get to this stuff that we're
talking about and see how far we can get.

74
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.942
But again, we're just gonna start with the
grid and then we're gonna work our way up.

75
00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:31.633
And you'll see things
will start to increase.

76
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:34.640
So if you're feeling bored, hopefully,
they will start to increase.

77
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.325
And if you're feeling lost,
hopefully you'll manage, we'll see.
