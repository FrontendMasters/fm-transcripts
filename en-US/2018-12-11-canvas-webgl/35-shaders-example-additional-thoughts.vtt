&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
so now we have this circle.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.720
And we're getting there.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.640
We can try a few other things,

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.060
we can start to add random
numbers here and there.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.930
You can start to maybe just randomly
start to throw things around.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.640
So maybe instead of color A, we do color A
assign + Vec three or something like that.

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.070
Sometimes it will be black or white.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.450
And this is where we can just start
to have some fun with the values.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.519
Another this is maybe instead
of using x we can use y,

10
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.890
or we could even use something
like vuv.x plus vuv.y.

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.020
And all of a sudden we're gonna
start to get this gradient

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.040
that's no longer just horizontal or
vertical.

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.220
If you really want to get advanced
with this you can do one direction.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.798
So vuv.y plus another direction
x multiplied by sine of time.

15
00:01:01.798 --> 00:01:05.690
And that's gonna mean that instead of
doing a vertical or horizontal gradient or

16
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.696
instead of doing a diagonal gradient, this
gradient's gonna be sort of moving and

17
00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:12.810
rotating and shifting and
turning around in a sort of weird way.

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.660
And this is sort of one of the things
to keep in mind when we're dealing with

19
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.580
shaders and
when we're dealing with generative code or

20
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.580
just any type of creative coding.

21
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.900
Is you have to really open
to just tweaking values and

22
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.920
sometimes hitting errors, and
if there's an error that's okay,

23
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.690
it'll just pop up in your browser and
your console.

24
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.310
Usually the line number
will be pointed out to you.

25
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.550
But yeah, just be really open to tweaking
numbers and playing with these things.

26
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.426
Sometimes instead of sine you can use cos,
this is another thing to just play with.

27
00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:48.808
This is kind of of the beauty of working
with this code is even if you aren't

28
00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.128
a math expert,
you can still use these functions just to

29
00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:55.039
create different interesting
sort of results.
