00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.368
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So what we're gonna try and
do is we're gonna try and

2
00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:07.264
recreate a branding or
a bit of a generative design branding.

3
00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:12.001
And usually, I wouldn't recommend just
trying to recreate something that already

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.413
exists but this is a really cool branding.

5
00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:18.196
And maybe it's a good exercise for
shaders because it's a very simple and

6
00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:19.120
powerful image.

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.350
And this is actually
done by DIA Studio and

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.170
they do a lot of interesting
computational work.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.950
And in this case, they created
this generative design branding.

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.170
And there's actually a lot of different
images that I don't have in the slides.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.050
But they produce this circle, masked.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.360
And it was animated.

13
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.740
And then they would
export different images,

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.200
different colors,
different states from this animation.

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.220
And those different states would be used
in different brand identities across

16
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.110
this company primary.

17
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.907
So whether it's on a mug or whether
it's on a tote bag or something else,

18
00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:54.290
they would use that
image in different ways.

19
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.470
So I thought that was a really cool
branding, and it seems similar

20
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.945
to some of the same concepts we're
going to be doing around shaders.

21
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.928
And it's a good sort of first
exercise to start with.
