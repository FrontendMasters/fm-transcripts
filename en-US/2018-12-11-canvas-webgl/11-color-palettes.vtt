00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So now we're getting there,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.520
we're starting to really see this sort
of like ink dropping looking like thing.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.300
And what we're gonna do for

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.750
random color palettes is we're
gonna bring in another module.

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.020
This module is gonna
be called palettes and

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.530
it's actually a module
called nice-color-palettes.

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.190
And when you do this,
you're gonna get an error like I am here.

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.722
And so here I am just const palettes
= require, nice-color-palettes,

9
00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:35.790
and that's color without a u, and
palettes like this, P-A-L-E-T-T-E-S.

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.565
And when you save,
you'll get an error, but

11
00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.642
that's because we haven't
installed the module.

12
00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:46.391
So go back to our terminal,
npm install nice-color-palattes.

13
00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.209
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And when it's finished
installing, the page should reload and

14
00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:55.865
it should run properly.

15
00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:05.184
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And so
if you are to look at this package,

16
00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:07.790
let's say nice-color-palettes.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.580
Let's say you do look at the documentation
in the npm module for this package,

18
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.480
you'll see it's just a module that has
a lot of different color palettes.

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.400
And each of them is in an array where
each palette has five different colors,

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.030
and each color is just
specified as a hex code.

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.635
And so the entire thing is between 100 or

22
00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:33.070
1,000 depending on which
you wanna require, but

23
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.600
it's around 1,000 or 100 different
color palettes that looks like this.

24
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.030
And so, what we're gonna do is above
our create grid function, we're

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.240
gonna choose a random palette because
remember there's like 100 palettes here.

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.340
So we just want a single palette,
we're gonna do random.pick,

27
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.935
this is another utility
function that I have.

28
00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:02.020
And you pass in an array and
it gives you a random value in that array.

29
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.080
So we have palette which is the singular,
random.pick palettes.

30
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.710
And then we have now,
if we console log that,

31
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.920
you'll see that we have a single
palette of five different colors.

32
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.369
And so now, when we create our
circle data structures here,

33
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:26.018
instead of using radius and
position like this,

34
00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:30.566
we can also add in another data point,
which would be color.

35
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:34.047
And you can set that to red and
they're all gonna be red, but

36
00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:38.860
we also have to hook that up, cuz if we
set this to blue, nothing's changing yet.

37
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.399
And that's because we're not using that
data point from our data structure.

38
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.783
So there's two things you have to do.

39
00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:50.863
One of them is add it
into this object here and

40
00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:54.036
then also,
you have to destructure it here.

41
00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:55.674
So this is in our render function.

42
00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:02.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then you have to
set the fill style to the color.

43
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.200
And so if you've done that,
then when you tweak the color up here,

44
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.500
it should tweak the color in rendering,
you can try different colors.

45
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.680
And then if you're there,

46
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.610
you're already close enough to just get
a random .pic from your single palette.

47
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.979
And now you're gonna end up with this
random distribution of different colors.

48
00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.203
And each of them is going to be kind of
pleasing because all of these palettes

49
00:03:27.203 --> 00:03:31.630
are actually sourced from a site that
aggregates different color palettes and

50
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.855
ranks them by value.

51
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
this is getting into a bit closer,

52
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.680
some of the generative arts sort
of stuff that I like to do.

53
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.814
There's other things that I like to
do with colors which will just give

54
00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:48.510
us a bit more variety.

55
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.130
One of them is, instead of always using
five different colors which creates this

56
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.970
very almost chaotic palette, we can
slice that down to a smaller number.

57
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.470
So when we choose a random palette,
we can say I want to only take,

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.540
let's say 3 colors, or we can change
that to be 2 colors, or 1 color.

59
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.830
And now every time we reload,

60
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.970
we're just getting one color or
a two different color, a two tone palette.

61
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.140
You can also instead of using hard coded
values, you can use a random value.

62
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.600
So color count, let's say it could
be anywhere between one and five.

63
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.244
So we could actually use
random.rangeFloor, between 1 and 5.

64
00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:41.683
And actually, if you do this, one thing is
that rangeFloor is between the minimum,

65
00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:46.610
which is inclusive and
the maximum which is exclusive.

66
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.010
So if we want a maximum of five,
we have to use a max of six

67
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.820
actually just because it doesn't
ever get to the maximum value.

68
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.130
So now what's happening is every time we
run the code, sometimes we have a palette

69
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.210
that's a single color,
sometimes we have five colors.

70
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.840
One more thing we can do is
before slicing the colors,

71
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.310
because now what's happening is
we're taking a random palette,

72
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.070
we're chopping off a couple, but we're
always chopping off those same couple.

73
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.499
So instead of always slicing it like this,

74
00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:24.888
we can first take a random palette,
shuffle it, and then slice off a couple.

75
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.666
And that's just gonna give
us a bit more variety, and

76
00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:30.023
I'm gonna just do this
in one long line here.

77
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.797
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
now what's happening is I'm saying,

78
00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:40.737
pick a random palette and
then shuffle that palette.

79
00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:44.035
And then once it's shuffled,
chop off a couple of them so

80
00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:48.572
that we end up with a palette that's only
color count long between one and six or

81
00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:50.240
between whatever you want.

82
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.530
Between two and six, whatever you prefer.

83
00:05:57.438 --> 00:06:02.981
And so we're getting closer to this
art work that we want to create,

84
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:05.617
but we're not quite there yet.

85
00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:10.041
I can leave this open for a second,
but again if you are stuck,

86
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:14.994
you can go back to this repo,
the generative artwork workshop repo.

87
00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:19.775
Go through the source folder, check
out the 2D, and go to grid colors and

88
00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:25.196
that's gonna have more or less something
similar to what we have already written.

89
00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:29.490
It might look a little bit different but
more or less, it's the same idea.
