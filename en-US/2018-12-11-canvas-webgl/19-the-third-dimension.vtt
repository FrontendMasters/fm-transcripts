00:00:02.271 --> 00:00:04.937
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: The first
part was all about 2D, and

2
00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:08.230
now I wanna dive into more 3D stuff.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.000
And in one sense this is kind
of maybe more technical, but

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.990
also because we're going to be using
libraries like three.js it might help

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.110
hold our hand through it a bit more.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.820
Whereas in the first part we were
doing a lot of vanilla canvas API,

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.840
which is a bit tricky.

8
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.120
three.js has a lot of utilities built
into it to help us with things like math,

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.850
or things like 3D, things like
rendering and that kind of stuff.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.660
So, I'll just show three.js and
just get you guys familiar with it.

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.421
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So if you go to threejs.org,
you can also find it on the workshop repo,

12
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:54.076
in the links here, it's just linked here,
and then there's a link to the docs.

13
00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:58.282
And the docs is gonna be pretty handy
when we're doing this kind of stuff, but

14
00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:02.050
you'll see three.js is a framework,
it's a library or an engine.

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.778
It's all JavaScript, and

16
00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:08.460
it allows us to create all sorts of
different interesting 3D projects.

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.510
Not all of them are 3D,

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.761
sometimes you can use three.js
to create 2D art works as well.

19
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:18.460
It basically just allows us to
use more technically advanced

20
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.860
features of our computers,
rather than just drawing circles and

21
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.870
squares and shapes,
we can draw all sorts of stuff.

22
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.630
We can create very complex
scenes using 3D models or

23
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.900
using shaders, and
if you actually have some time,

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.935
it's definitely worth looking
through some of these projects.

25
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:41.050
Like this one here, Oat the Goat is
this beautiful animated storybook by I

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.090
think it's New Zealand.

27
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.810
I think it was either the government or
the school board or something like that.

28
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.332
They helped fund this project, and
it's all created with three.js and webGL.

29
00:01:55.332 --> 00:02:00.885
And it's kinda like this interactive
storybook, mostly aimed at kids.

30
00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:04.703
And it's part of a campaign
to avoid against bullying.

31
00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:08.471
But it's just really beautiful animated
story book, all using the web,

32
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:13.150
all using webGL, and using the same
concepts we're going to be chatting about.

33
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.790
So definitely worth looking through some
of these projects in your own time and

34
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.900
getting a sense of the kind of different
projects and things you can do on the web.

35
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.120
And then you'll see in the documentation

36
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.990
there's all sorts of
different classes here.

37
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.758
It's a bit more familiar if you've
come from an object-oriented

38
00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:34.180
programming background.

39
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.230
This API might be more familiar.

40
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.380
It's got classes that you
construct with a new keyword.

41
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.400
And then you set their properties and
you use them like that.

42
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.660
When it actually comes to looking
into geometries and stuff like that,

43
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.640
a lot of their documentation
has these interactive examples.

44
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.090
So, sometimes you'll see geometry, and

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.317
you can compare the different geometry
types and see what they look like.

46
00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:05.134
So this is really handy to go through
these geometries and just compare them,

47
00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:07.443
and you can pop this thing open here.

48
00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:11.746
And you can get a sense of what
these different parameters do,

49
00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:16.795
cause these are just the parameters
into the constructor, so you can set

50
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:22.220
things on a shape like the segments, and
you can see how that is gonna change.

51
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.819
So, this is really handy just to get
a sense of what's in the library.

52
00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.765
So that's under geometries.

53
00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:31.070
And then also,
if you scroll down you'll see materials.

54
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.050
They do something like that as well with
some of the materials, not all of them,

55
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.560
but some of them.

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.530
This is depth, this is normal, and we're
gonna chat about what all of these mean,

57
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.730
and what they sort of look like, and
why you would use one or the other.

58
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.800
Before I get too far, I just wanted to
point out a cool thing that happened today

59
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.350
before I get into the rest
of the three.js stuff.

60
00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.680
So this is the first time in AI artwork,
and AI being artificial intelligence.

61
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.760
I forgot to mention this earlier, but
it just happened a couple hours ago.

62
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.550
It sold for $432,000 at Christie's.

63
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.830
So in terms of generative art, in terms
of computer art, in terms of any art

64
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.740
that has to do with computation and code,
and in this case, AI or machine learning,

65
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.190
or deep learning, this is a huge
sort of pivotal step forward for,

66
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.500
I would say like, computer artists
that are interested in computer art.

67
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.070
Because all the sudden, it's being taken
a bit more seriously by the art world.

68
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.530
The whole story around this is really
interesting too, so if you want to read

69
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.600
about AI, it's actually an unfortunate
story because the people that created this

70
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.580
particular portrait, they basically
just cloned a GitHub repo, and they

71
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.370
ended up re running the code and producing
this image, and then printing it.

72
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.910
And they ended up selling it at
Christie's Auction House for 400K.

73
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.800
So, I just wanted to bring that in before
we start getting too far into the stuff,

74
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.630
because it's a really pivotal moment,
and it just happened like an hour or

75
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.630
two ago or something like that.

76
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.246
And it's just, it's gonna be important for
creative computing in the future.
