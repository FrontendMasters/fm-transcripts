00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:03.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's just try and

2
00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:09.028
add a bit of animation,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

3
00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:12.732
then once we do some animation
we'll just export it as a GIF.

4
00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:15.561
And then we can move a little
bit into shaders and

5
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:20.300
we'll try and sort of take a bit more
chill in the rest of the afternoon.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.783
Just cuz I'm sure it's like a lot of

7
00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:29.122
knowledge to absorb all in one go.

8
00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:35.112
So what I'm gonna do is just
remember this settings here.

9
00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:38.616
We have it set to true, which means
starts it up with a random loop.

10
00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.377
So actually right now even
if though looks the same,

11
00:00:41.377 --> 00:00:46.460
it's rendering 60 time a second and
it's rendering the scene many, many times.

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.740
And what we can do is just rotate
our entire scene just to produce

13
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.860
some animation.

14
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.332
So we can do scene, which is, remember
it's something we defined up there.

15
00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:01.625
We can do scene.rotation.y = time.

16
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:06.098
And this is where our thumb trick
gets really, really useful.

17
00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.642
So I'm saying rotation.y = time.

18
00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:13.732
You can change this to be
a different coordinate, like x or z.

19
00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:17.472
And you'll start to see
it looks a bit different.

20
00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:19.560
And so going back to our thumb trick.

21
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.520
If you go back to doing
this finger pointing and

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.700
you remember that the thumb is the y-axis,

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.260
that means we're actually rotating
our entire scene around that axis.

24
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.470
And it's the same if we
were to set this to be x.

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.420
Imagine you take your middle finger and

26
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.170
you're just cranking it like you would a
motorcycle handle or something like that.

27
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.888
And it's rotating the entire object
like that, it's the same with zed.

28
00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:46.674
So I am totally guilty of constantly
when I'm doing creative coding,

29
00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:49.892
you'll see me sometimes just
with my hand there like this.

30
00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:55.625
And I'll be trying to visualize what
I'm trying to do based on my thumbs and

31
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:56.448
fingers.

32
00:01:56.448 --> 00:02:00.168
So now we have a loop, basically, and

33
00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:04.135
we can make this a bit more complicated.

34
00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:09.163
But before we do that, I just wanna
talk about how do we export loops and

35
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:10.793
how do we create a GIF?

36
00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:14.118
Because quite often,
when you're showing a client something,

37
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:15.698
you can show them the website.

38
00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:19.465
Or if you're sharing something over
Twitter, or if you're showing something

39
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:23.353
over email, maybe you wanna show them a
GIF, or maybe you wanna show them an MP4.

40
00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:27.166
And generally speaking,
I've been doing a lot more GIFs and

41
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.045
a lot more animation lately.

42
00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:33.199
And it's kind of opened me up into this
new world of motion graphics, where a lot

43
00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.540
of clients, they might see a web page
even though the web page is real time.

44
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.260
They might not really think of
it as real-time motion graphics.

45
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.330
And for some reason, when you show them
a GIF, or when you show them an MP4,

46
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.730
they start to realize that they can
use that in their own branding.

47
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.680
Whether it's for a commercial, or whether
it's for something that they're projecting

48
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.940
on a wall, or showing at a screen at
a client event or something like that.
