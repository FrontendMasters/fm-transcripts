00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.692
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So, if you guys
would all open up your terminal or

2
00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:10.620
your command line application, and
we'll try and all install this together.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.600
First thing would be to just
make sure that you have

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.180
the right version of Node and
the right version of npm.

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.700
I'm not gonna make that bigger.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:30.150
It doesn't need to be six,
it can five for npm.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.300
And then we're gonna install
the command line tool globally.

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.830
So we're gonna use npm
install canvas-sketch-cli,

9
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.100
which stands for command line interface,
then we can do -g or --global.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.420
It just means let's install
the tool globally so

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.910
that we can use it again
from our command line.

12
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.520
And it's gonna take a little while
to install cuz it has a whole ton of

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
dependencies in it, and
I went kinda liberal on the dependencies.

14
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.107
I'm still working to make it a bit faster.

15
00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:00.717
Hey what's up?

16
00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.359
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They just need
node over Version 8, right?

17
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.047
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Yes,
8 or above, that's all.

18
00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:13.310
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And hopefully
it will all install for you guys.

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.370
And just, it might take a minute or two,
but once it installs, I think the best way

20
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.970
for us to test it out and to start using
it is just to go to somewhere like your

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.010
desktop or your documents and
I'm just going to go to my desktop.

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.958
I'm going to create a new
folder using rmkdir and

23
00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:40.210
when we work with the Canvas Sketch tool,
we generally want

24
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.420
to start in an empty folder because it
will scaffold some stuff in that folder.

25
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.861
So I'm just gonna call it shaders, or you
can call it whatever you want, genart, or

26
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:49.788
something like that.

27
00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:54.048
Maybe I'll call it genart and
then we move into the folder.

28
00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.819
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
here, to test the tool out,

29
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.871
you can just type in canvas sketch.

30
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.492
So the tools is canvas-sketch-cli, but

31
00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:07.050
It will set you up with
a command called canvas-sketch.

32
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.830
When you run it without any arguments,
it's gonna give you an error,

33
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.800
because the idea of the tool is you
pass in a file name like sketch.js,

34
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.040
and it's a JavaScript file and
it will run on that file.

35
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.100
But because we don't have
a sketch.js file in our folder, and

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.780
I'll just open the folder here in Mac.

37
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.520
So you can see it's empty.

38
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.390
It's gonna give us an error as well.

39
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.460
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a new file.

40
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.910
And if you use the flag --new,
that's gonna scaffold out

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.760
a new JavaScript file using a template for
this kinda stuff.

42
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.450
And then we're also gonna
use the flag --open and

43
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.310
that's gonna launch the browser
immediately when we do that.

44
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.150
So what it'll do is it's gonna write this
new file, there's a whole bunch of things.

45
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.490
It writes this file that
we're saying is scaffolded.

46
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.490
It also creates a package JSON which
is gonna hold the dependencies that our

47
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.830
project needs and as we go today, we're
gonna start to install more dependencies.

48
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.930
It has this package-lock json, which is
just gonna lock down all the versions

49
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.960
of our dependencies, and
has node modules, which is actually

50
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.850
just all the dependencies we need for
our project today.

51
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.983
So, if everyone could try doing that and
if there's any issues.

52
00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:27.230
If you guys run into any problems,
just raise your hand.

53
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.053
Yep?

54
00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Was that a NPM module?

55
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.909
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Yeah, so what you
can do is I'm gonna sorta restart here.

56
00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.642
Did you run NPM install canvas-cla?

57
00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:41.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Okay, no worries.

58
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.560
And you'll notice that there's
this sort of server running.

59
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.800
It should be running on your local IP.

60
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.000
So you could actually type in
localhost and then 9966 in

61
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.770
your browser, and
you should see a sort of white box.

62
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.550
And it's very hard to see on this screen,
but on your own laptop,

63
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.930
you might notice a bit of a drop shadow.

64
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.749
That's basically just the border of the
canvas that we're gonna be working with.

65
00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.738
And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this folder up in my editor and

66
00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:19.066
I'm just gonna make sure
that it's working and

67
00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:22.987
that we have the development
server running properly.

68
00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:30.992
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So generally when
I'm doing this kind of creative code stuff

69
00:04:30.992 --> 00:04:35.290
I just I have one window which is the
browser and the other which is the editor.

70
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.140
And you'll see this is the file that
got created the sketch touch s file and

71
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.910
if you open it up in your editor and
you try changing some code like for

72
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.630
example changing white to red as soon
as you save it should immediately

73
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.580
update within the browser as well.

74
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.290
And you can just test that by
changing it to some other color.

75
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.399
This is just like a CSS color string.

76
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.269
And if that's all working, then you should
be getting different colors every time.
