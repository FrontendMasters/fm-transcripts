00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.762
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And
then in the terms of the tool we're using,

2
00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:07.580
you might be wondering so far why we´re
using canvasSketch and what´s the purpose.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.739
Well one thing you can do if you select
your canvas, maybe just click on

4
00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.900
the canvas just to make sure it´s
in focus, just clicking on it once,

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.081
and then hit command S, or if you´re
in Windows you can hit control S.

6
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:27.867
And what's gonna happen is you should
actually have a little message in your

7
00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.970
console, in your dev tools console.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.380
And it should say that
it's exported an image.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.270
And if the tool that I
created works properly

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.070
then it should export an image
in your downloads folder.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.320
And you'll notice that the image that's
been exported is exactly 248 pixels

12
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.860
by 248 pixels.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
And it's exactly,
basically what you're seeing in your code.

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.950
And so far, we're still maybe
thinking okay, that's okay, but

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.500
like what's the real point?

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.020
And this is where it starts to get
a bit more interesting, this tool.

17
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.120
So instead of saying 2048 by 2048 pixels,
we can use a paper size preset, like A4.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.310
And this will change the dimensions and
aspect ratio.

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.800
And A4 is sort of a standard paper size,
preset.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.492
I think in the states you
guys uses letter paper.

21
00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:22.407
You can use letter, you can also use A3,

22
00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:26.831
there's postcard,
there's some other paper sizes as well.

23
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:30.659
I'm going to just stay with A4 because
that's a very common print size for

24
00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.542
doing a posters and stuff like that,

25
00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:36.360
as well as small art that you
might want to hang on wall.

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120
And that's just going
to set the dimensions.

27
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.700
And now, when we export, if you see the
save dialogue, it just means the canvas.

28
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.780
Isn't in focus so just click the canvas
before you hit command S or control S.

29
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.060
But now when we export we should see an
image that's a bit more sized correctly.

30
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.020
One other thing though to keep in mind is
that, if we're doing a print artwork and

31
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.860
we try and print this image it's
gonna end up really blurry.

32
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.970
And that's because the resolution by
default is 72 cause by default we

33
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.670
assumed that we're just doing some visual
stuff for the web or for digital screens.

34
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330
So we're gonna wanna maybe
exploit at a higher resolution.

35
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.260
So here's where you can say pixels per
inch is 300 and it's a very common size.

36
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.780
For print artworks or for print design,
just to make sure that you get all

37
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.460
the right stuff on that screen, and
it ends up looking much better.

38
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.320
And now you'll notice this new file
that's exported is much larger.

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.180
And it's actually sized exactly so that
if you were bring this file into a PDF or

40
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.570
use Photoshop or something like that and
you try and send that to a print studio.

41
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.520
They will give you back the exact a for
print exactly as you see on screen.

42
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.940
So that's kind of my motivation for
building these tools is cuz

43
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.810
I started doing a lot more print and
I started doing a lot more stuff.

44
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.090
That wasn't just working on the web.

45
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.250
But also I wanted my code to.

46
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.970
Work across the web as well as print,
and this is where it starts to,

47
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.900
you start to need a bit of a tool
around that kind of work flow.

48
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.910
Just a couple other things before we
get into sorta doing our own art,

49
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.470
around this tool.

50
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.923
So, so far you'll notice, you'll probably
notice that the circle's been changing

51
00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:29.224
sizes every time we change
the resolutions and stuff like that.

52
00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:33.659
And that's not really good because,
let's say a client asks for

53
00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.319
you to change the size of your artwork,

54
00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.912
you wanna make sure that it looks
the same regardless of the size, so

55
00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:44.730
instead of using pixel sizes
here in our circle radius.

56
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.990
We can change this to be relative to
the width of the screen for example.

57
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.860
Let's say width times 0.2 and
the same with the line width.

58
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.420
So you can say width times 0.05 or
something like that and

59
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.990
then no matter what the resolution is,
whether it's 72 or

60
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.500
whether it's 300 the circle
should look the same.

61
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.224
So that's one way of making sure that we
have resolution-independent shapes and

62
00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:10.940
outputs and stuff like that.

63
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.894
And then another thing here is that
we're still working in pixel units.

64
00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:21.530
And that's fine if you're
doing resolution-independent

65
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.590
fractions like this, like fractions of
the width or height of the surface.

66
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.570
But let's say we wanted to make a certain
circle exactly one centimeter wide.

67
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.130
Or let's say we wanted to create a margin
around the page that's two inches exactly.

68
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.177
How do we get from pixels to inches?

69
00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:44.730
And so, one way of doing that is to
use different units in our settings.

70
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.360
And so here we can say units.

71
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.830
And the units can be in inches,
in, or it can be in centimeters,

72
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.120
cm, or other units as well like ft for
feet and so on.

73
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.460
And now we can use this unit,
centimeters, through our entire code.

74
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.406
So actually just to prove what's going
on is I'm just gonna console.log

75
00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:10.170
the width and the height.

76
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.930
And you'll see that instead
of giving us a pixel value,

77
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.161
it's giving us a very small
value of 21 and 29.7.

78
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:25.672
And if you're actually to look
up the size of an A4 print,

79
00:05:25.672 --> 00:05:29.750
it's gonna be 21 centimeters
by 29.7 centimeters.

80
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.490
So the idea is that all of the units you
would be using in your render function,

81
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.200
including things like a radius,

82
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.100
instead of being in pixels it's
going to be in centimeters.

83
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.600
So when we say two, where as before
two pixels would be really small,

84
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.880
now two centimeters is a pretty
big circle on our art work.

85
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.090
So that's some of the benefits of
CanvasSketch and why we are using it.

86
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.440
For this workshop.

87
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.801
And there's a lot of other things too
around animation and around exploiting

88
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:00.437
MP4s, and GIFs, and stuff like that that
we're gonna get into in the afternoon.

89
00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:03.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
a question from online.

90
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.550
Can you change the orientation?

91
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.210
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: Yes.

92
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.870
Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

93
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.810
It's a good question though.

94
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.490
You would specify orientation and
then a string which is either landscape or

95
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.110
portrait, and
that's gonna flip this dimension.

96
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.700
So you can say landscape here for
orientation,

97
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.829
and you should end up with a wide artwork.

98
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.780
And then here the other thing to mention
is that right now we're doing A4, but

99
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.920
let's say you wanted something that's
exactly 16 centimeters by 10 centimeters.

100
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.140
16 centimeters wide by 10 centimeters.

101
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.870
That's gonna just use an array where the
first thing in the array is the width and

102
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.530
the second thing is the height.

103
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.010
And just to keep in mind, these values
are in centimeters because we said

104
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.490
our units for artwork is in centimeters.

105
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.992
And so that´s kind of the work
space units that we´re gonna be

106
00:06:57.992 --> 00:07:03.027
working with in our dimensions, but
also in all of our artwork code.

107
00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:05.320
Yeah, so.

108
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.668
I like to generally work with digital
sizes first when I'm doing my stuff,

109
00:07:10.668 --> 00:07:13.650
so I can, just generally,
I comment everything out.

110
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.339
And I work usually with like a square,
or with some sort of thing in this

111
00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:23.700
kind of size range of 2048 by 2048,
especially for Instagram.

112
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.520
If your goal is to make like an Instagram
gallery of interesting stuff,

113
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.020
I find the square works really well.

114
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.980
Whereas different sort of portrait
sizes don´t always work as well.
