00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I wanted to take like take
us back a bit because we've just been

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.830
coding this whole time.

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.477
I want to talk a bit more
about some of the theory and

4
00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:08.378
some of the stuff that inspires me.

5
00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:12.661
And this is one artist that was really,
really came to fame I guess in

6
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.432
the '60s and '70s for
his wall murals and Sol LeWitt.

7
00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:19.673
And the murals, they look a bit like this.

8
00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:23.540
They're huge and they're in museums and
galleries, and he's done hundreds of them.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.850
And he simply just numbers them
like to 60 or 120 or something.

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.000
And when you look at his work you
start to maybe see that it looks

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.690
a bit reminiscent of generative stuff that
you might be seeing today with code and

12
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.330
with creative coding.

13
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.245
And especially when you look at something
like this you think maybe this is done

14
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:42.145
with a computer.

15
00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.300
But he was doing all of this
work without a computer.

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.330
I don't really think he was
using computers or code,

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.320
and this was certainly done at a time
where those tools weren't very accessible.

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.775
And the way he would do this kind
of artwork is that he would have

19
00:00:58.775 --> 00:00:59.713
instructions.

20
00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:04.250
And his instructions, this is a bit blurry
but I transcribed a couple of them.

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.260
But his instructions would very
much just be like do this, do this,

22
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.350
do this and
then you end up with the artwork.

23
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.920
And so, just to give you an idea for this
Wall Drawing 273, one of his wall drawings

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.860
in the San Francisco MoMA, he says, his
instructions that he gave his builders and

25
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.620
his draftsman is to create a six inch grid
covering the walls, lines from corners,

26
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.410
sides and center of the walls
to random points on the grid.

27
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.682
And he has different instructions for
different walls.

28
00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:36.980
And on the 7th wall you do red lines
from the midpoints of the four sides.

29
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.260
Blue lines from four corners,
yellow lines from the center.

30
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.930
And so, that was kind of,
his art wasn't actually creating the work

31
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.070
because he wouldn't go there and paint it
and sketch it or draw it or draft it out.

32
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.750
He would just create these instructions.

33
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.390
Sometimes he'd also create a little
drawing that's just on paper with pencil

34
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.040
or something like that,
that he would give to the builders.

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.371
And the result of that
looks a bit like this.

36
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.390
And so this is actually what it
turned out to be in SF MoMA.

37
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.450
And the kinda interesting thing is
that every time he would give the same

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.874
instructions to different people,
they would end up with different results.

39
00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:16.328
And that's because there's this
element of chance and randomness,

40
00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:17.743
as well as interpretation.

41
00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:20.311
How do you interpret the line width or
line length?

42
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:24.361
Is it a thick line or is a thin line,
what exact colors are you using?

43
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:28.390
And so, if we were to look at this
through the lens of creative coding and

44
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.092
generative art, we can actually take his
instructions just as they are exactly and

45
00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:36.800
we can try and
re-implement as a bit of an exercise.

46
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.640
So this is what I did here.

47
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.170
And it looks a bit like
a bunch of random lines.

48
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.890
It's maybe not the most
impressive looking image.

49
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.680
But in the context of a virtual space, or

50
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.550
in his case a real mural
that's 100 feet wide or

51
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.699
however many feet it is wide,
it starts to look at lot more impressive.

52
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.940
And so I thought as I was doing this,
I was looking, and

53
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.050
I thought it was a kind of cool idea.

54
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.797
But it turns out it's not new.

55
00:03:06.797 --> 00:03:10.960
Other people have been trying to create
his work with JavaScript before.

56
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.710
And I found this really interesting site,
GitHub Repo.

57
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.934
You can just go to their site,
solvingsol.com.

58
00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:23.934
And it has a lot of different examples
of actual instructions that Sol LeWitt,

59
00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:28.010
back in the '60's or
'70's would have written.

60
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.382
Like this one is squares divided
horizontally and vertically into equal

61
00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:34.873
parts, each with lines in four
directions superimposed progressively.

62
00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:39.215
And somebody has tried to re-implement
that instruction with JavaScript and

63
00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:40.450
with code.

64
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.268
And so, it's kind of an interesting thing,
because at his time he was giving

65
00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:48.230
it builders and giving it to draftsmen
engineers to build the mural.

66
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.900
But now,
we're taking the same instructions and

67
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.930
we're giving it to a computer and we end
up with this sort of generative machine

68
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.960
that produces an image
that can be used as mural.

69
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.422
And if you go to this site,
there's a lot of them.

70
00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:01.630
So if you just GitHub button.

71
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.050
It's a really cool resource.

72
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.020
They have all the instructions
in this JSON file, and so

73
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.470
it's actually a great way if you're lost
to come back to this and just remind

74
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.332
yourself that simple instructions like
this can be really powerful as an image.

75
00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:21.930
And these simple instructions, they're
not always super hard to come up with.

76
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.910
But they can still create powerful images.
