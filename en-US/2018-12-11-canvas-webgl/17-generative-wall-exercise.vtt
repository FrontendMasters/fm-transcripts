00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.780
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So
I thought that was really cool and

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.072
I thought there's just
a really good analogy here.

3
00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:07.722
And a really good common
theme with generative art and

4
00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:12.600
with creative coding and
with creating artworks using instructions.

5
00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.238
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: And I actually,
as an exercise, take a set of instructions

6
00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:26.260
that I created In the same sort of theme
as just using some basic constructions.

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.010
Mine are probably a little
more detailed than but

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.170
the same idea is just to come up
with a grid of evenly spaced points.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.920
I drew a little thing here on the side and
to select two points and

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.840
connect them to form
a line between two points.

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.910
And then with those two points
you just draw lines down,

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.110
you end up creating a trapezoid.

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.800
And with that trapezoid you can
fill it with the different color,

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.290
maybe using some of the same
stuff we were doing already.

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.870
You can stroke it with the same
color as the background.

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.030
And then again, you do that same thing
in a loop or in a while function,

17
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.110
just selecting another two points at
random that haven't been selected yet.

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.220
And you end up doing that over and
over again and

19
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.880
you create many different shapes.

20
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.350
I've only done it here twice, but
in your artwork, you could do that

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.300
through the entire grid and you'd end up
with many different overlapping images.

22
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.050
And then one thing is, if you do that,

23
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.620
you'll notice maybe there's a random
assortment, a random arrangement.

24
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.860
And you can sort them all by the average
Y position of the two grid points.

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.172
And you end up with
this nice distribution,

26
00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:33.306
almost like a city skyline or
something like that, where.

27
00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.039
The smaller ones are a little
bit closer to the front and

28
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.190
the bigger ones are a bit
closer to the end.

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.854
And so I wanted this to be an exercise for
us to try and work on.

30
00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:46.482
Also, if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed,
you can just continue working and

31
00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.150
remixing and
tweaking some of what we're doing already.

32
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.730
Maybe using some different
unicode symbols.

33
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.490
Or just chill out, that's okay too.

34
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.268
But if you're feeling ambitious,

35
00:01:56.268 --> 00:01:59.670
if you wanna start from something,
this is what I would recommend.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.560
This is something that I
also did in my own time.

37
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.550
And after the break, I'll show you my
results and we can start to compare and

38
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.390
see and just like we saw Louie's work.

39
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.800
Everyone is gonna end up with different
results depending on how they interpret

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.960
the instructions and depending on
the colors they choose, and so on.
