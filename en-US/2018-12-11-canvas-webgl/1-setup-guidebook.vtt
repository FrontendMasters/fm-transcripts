00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt; Mathew DesLauriers: So
that's sort of the setup of

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.890
some things that I'm inspired by,
hopefully it'll inspire you a bit.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.787
And now we wanna get into how do we
actually make some art with code?

4
00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:15.106
How do we make some cool, creative-looking
outputs using just JavaScript and

5
00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:19.561
using some of the concepts that you might
already be familiar with with frontend.

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.448
So this is one of the sorta
pieces we're gonna try and

7
00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:24.754
create in the first part of the workshop.

8
00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:29.308
And I call it Unicode compositions because
these are all little tiny brush strokes

9
00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:30.899
are actually just symbols.

10
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.090
They're just like an equal sign, or
a plus sign, or a period or a comma, or

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.010
something like that.

12
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.824
So this is what we're gonna be aiming for
and we'll talk about how to get there.

13
00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:46.625
We'll probably have to work our way up to
it starting with something much more basic

14
00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.630
and then we'll get there in a sec.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.213
So for those of you who've already
opened the repo, you can open it again.

16
00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:58.132
This is the repository for
the workshop and

17
00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:02.281
it holds basically all of
the information we need for today.

18
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.269
So it's got some of the tools
we're gonna be using.

19
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.000
It has links to documentation, all of
the prerequisite sorta tools we need.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.478
Make sure you're on node eight and
npm05 or above.

21
00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:18.036
If you are having trouble
installing anything,

22
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.960
there's a much more in-depth
installation guide.

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.600
And then we're gonna be installing some of
these tools, I'm gonna talk about them.

24
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.350
If you're new to the command line, I've
also included a few tips and suggestions,

25
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.140
sometimes you'll see me when
I'm using the command line.

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.390
You'll see me using autocompletion,
or the up and down arrows so

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.910
just be familiar with those.

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.370
And then we don't need
to clone this repo yet.

29
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.690
I'm gonna try and
have us create it from scratch.

30
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.305
So we create our own sorta folder
structure and stuff like that.

31
00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:54.520
But if you wanted to clone it for whatever
reason, you can do that with this link.

32
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.290
I've also included a bit of a cheat sheet,

33
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.840
cuz when I started doing creative coding,
I realized that there's a lot of like,

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.240
little patterns and recipes that
you just have to memorize them.

35
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.320
And once you memorized them, you can
really reuse them in many different ways.

36
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.372
And when I was starting, I kinda wished
that I had a cheat sheet to refer to.

37
00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.889
So I decided to set you guys
up with like a cheat sheet.

38
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.941
And this talks about a few different
tricks that I use in a lot of my different

39
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.497
creative coding projects.

40
00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:24.012
Whether it's an artwork or whether
it's an actual client project, like

41
00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:28.740
a webGL experience or something like that,
they tend to appear in most of my code.

42
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.250
So you can use that as a reference.

43
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.296
And then I've included a few
of my favorite NPM modules.

44
00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:40.250
We're gonna be talking about npm, and how
do we bring in some cool code from npm.

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.933
And some further reading, which includes
more details and more advanced stuff.

46
00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.340
You can use this after the workshop.

47
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.230
So in terms of tools,
obviously we need a code editor.

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.065
I'm gonna be using VS code.

49
00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.009
And it includes some nice extensions,
which we'll get into for

50
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.063
things like shaders and GLSL within a
template stream, kind of things like that.

51
00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:06.438
But sublime text also works or
whatever you like.

52
00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:11.046
Browser, I would say Chrome, and mainly
because the tools we're gonna be using

53
00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:14.505
are gonna be exporting really
high-res images sometimes or

54
00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.900
exporting hundreds of frames for video.

55
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.880
And Chrome, I found,
is really good for that.

56
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.709
But Firefox should work as well,
or Safari, or whatever.

57
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.982
Canvas, this is not actually
something we need to install,

58
00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:30.690
it's just built into browsers,
the Canvas tag.

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.220
You can check out the docs here.

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.090
And then obviously command
line we're gonna be using,

61
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.830
hopefully it's Unix compatible.

62
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.315
So if you're on Windows,
I would suggest commander, but

63
00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.246
you can also use command.exe.

64
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:46.078
We have node and npm so
when you install the latest node,

65
00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:50.550
it should come with the latest npm
as well, that should be good enough.

66
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.490
And then we're gonna get into some
of the more core specific tools.

67
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.011
So Canvas Sketch is a tool that I've been
building and I've been building it now for

68
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:00.537
a while.

69
00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:04.318
Really, I started this tool,
I guess, years ago technically,

70
00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:07.499
because I've been just
iterating it on it ever since.

71
00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.634
And now it's the tool that I use in
almost all of my client projects and

72
00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:13.786
all of my generative art projects.

73
00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:17.560
It's still very experimental and
it's still a work in progress.

74
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.904
And it might show some bugs
today when we go to use it,

75
00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:26.230
but hopefully, it'll be stable enough for
us to really dive into things.

76
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.130
And it's basically, it's a mix of things,
it's a development environment.

77
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.850
So for
those of you who have used BrowserSync or

78
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.630
something like that,
this is sort of an alternative.

79
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.690
It's also an alternative to using Webpack
or those kind of tools, like parcel.

80
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.410
It is specifically designed for
this kind of creative coding and

81
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.870
generative art and
we'll see why in a little bit.

82
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.909
So it is a development environment and
a command line interface.

83
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.808
It's also a set of a library, like a set
of JavaScript libraries to do some common

84
00:04:56.808 --> 00:05:01.706
things like manipulating the Canvas, or
working with paper sizes like A4, and

85
00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:05.340
A3, if you wanted to export or
print artwork.

86
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.050
And then it's also just
a set of resources.

87
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.336
I spent a lot of time trying to
get the documentation really rich,

88
00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:15.460
because I think that's one of the things
that is generally lacking in these sort of

89
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.716
generative art things,

90
00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:20.469
is that there's not always a lot of
instruction on how do you go from A to B.

91
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.194
And so hopefully, that will be all there.

92
00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:26.692
If there's really anything through
the workshop where you wanted to dive into

93
00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:29.293
something in more depth,
you should probably look here.

94
00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:33.880
Because this is gonna have a bit more info
on things like using physical units like

95
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.806
inches and centimeters, which is something
that without a tool like this, it might be

96
00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:42.922
kinda tricky to use that to create code
that is working on centimeters and

97
00:05:42.922 --> 00:05:45.510
inches, but
this tool makes it pretty easy.

98
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.313
So that's that.

99
00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:52.770
And then you'll notice in the repo, I have
another thing called canvas-sketch-util.

100
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.698
That's just a third-party library
that includes some really opinionated

101
00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:01.856
math functions and
pseudorandom number generator functions,

102
00:06:01.856 --> 00:06:05.634
as well as some utilities for
shaders and stuff like that.

103
00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:07.640
And we're gonna install
those in a little bit.

104
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.710
And then, lastly,

105
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.680
in the second part of the workshop
we're gonna be talking about three.js.

106
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.220
We don't really need to
talk about that yet,

107
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.320
cuz we're gonna focus on more of the 2D
canvas API stuff for the morning.
