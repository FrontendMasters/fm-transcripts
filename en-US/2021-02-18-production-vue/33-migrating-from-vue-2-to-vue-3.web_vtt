1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.390
And so
one question that has probably come up and

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.940
is asked a lot right now is regarding
the migration of Vue 2 to Vue 3.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.286
And so as it stands right now,
Vue 3 as a whole, the too long,

4
00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:16.632
didn't read, the TLDR is that
if you have a legacy Vue 2 app,

5
00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:23.100
you probably should be waiting to migrate
to Vue 3, and for the following reasons.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.460
One, Vue 3 at this point
doesn't support IE 11.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.773
So if that is any part of your user base,
and you need the support, and you haven't

8
00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:37.390
basically deprecated it on your side,
then yes, 100% Vue 3 is a no-go for you.

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.792
That's not to say it's not coming,
in fact,

10
00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.195
they're currently working on the polyfill,

11
00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:46.026
basically the legacy bundle that will
then backfill the support to that.

12
00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.962
But that is not happening until,
I believe, later this year.

13
00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:52.773
And then, of course,
sometimes deadlines can push back, so

14
00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:54.950
it might even be early next year for
all we know.

15
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.373
And if it does take like that, that is
definitely gonna be a showstopper for

16
00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:01.060
people who need to migrate.

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.256
The other thing as well is that if
you have a lot of dependencies,

18
00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:10.910
the general advice is please wait
until those are officially migrated.

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.104
Two key examples of this are if
you have a component library

20
00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:21.198
that you're relying on,
like beautify, for example.

21
00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:25.988
Then checking out their roadmap to see
when exactly their release date is

22
00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:27.881
to support Vue 3 features.

23
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.265
And to integrate properly into
the Vue 3 architecture is gonna

24
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:37.840
basically be your milestone for
waiting until it's ready to upgrade.

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.998
And similarly, a lot of people using
Vue 2 are also using Knucks for many,

26
00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:46.156
many great reasons that I sort of
referred to earlier, Knucks is awesome.

27
00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:52.930
But if you're using nuxt, this does mean
that you want to wait till Knucks 3,

28
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.280
which I have confirmation
is actively in development.

29
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.160
So I'm really excited to see
when Knucks 3 comes out.

30
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.372
But wait for Knucks 3, right, and so

31
00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:08.930
that's the other thing I forgot to
mention before I move on to this piece.

32
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.350
The other thing too with migration is
that for those who weren't here for

33
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.222
the Vue 1 to Vue 2 major upgrade.

34
00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:20.726
There actually is going to be a migration
tool to help analyze your code bundle and

35
00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:24.870
provide basically recommendations for
the best path to upgrade.

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.123
And on top of that, right,
similar to the Vue ethos, if anything,

37
00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:30.421
we know that we can go ahead and
swap out for you.

38
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:34.124
Cuz we know that it's just a programmatic
thing from if this API changed to

39
00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:36.154
something that can just be swapped out,

40
00:02:36.154 --> 00:02:39.760
the migration tool will help
you do that automatically.

41
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.048
And so for a lot of people,
especially if you have a large code base,

42
00:02:43.048 --> 00:02:45.150
this will save you a ton of time.

43
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.282
And so in this regard,
go ahead and wait, wait for

44
00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:52.995
the migration tool to come out,
the IE combat build, go ahead and update.

45
00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:58.930
Then it will be worth the effort to go
ahead and upgrade your app at that point.

46
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.821
The other thing I wanna bring up too
is that I know a lot of people here,

47
00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:05.317
when we talk about major version upgrades.

48
00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:09.479
Typically, it comes with some thing
that you really wanna use and

49
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.669
you can't use until you
have that major upgrade.

50
00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:18.779
And the idea with Vue 2 to Vue 3 was to
really keep a lot of the core features and

51
00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:20.572
ideas that Vue 2 has.

52
00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:24.761
And then basically make it smaller, make
it faster, to make it more performant, and

53
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.920
then make it more compatible with
typescript and those things.

54
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.272
But we talked about types of earlier
regarding don't worry about migrating

55
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:33.164
those things.

56
00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:37.655
But more importantly, the number one
feature that everyone really wants with

57
00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:39.435
Vue 3 is the composition API.

58
00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:43.960
And so as I mentioned earlier, you don't
have to wait till Vue 3 to use that.

59
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.177
You can integrate that
directly into your Vue 2 app,

60
00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:52.040
and start playing with it, and
leveraging it for your applications.

61
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.610
And so hopefully, this helps to
mitigate a little of the FOMO effect,

62
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.621
also known as fear of missing out,
like we need to hurry up and be on Vue 3.

63
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.005
Don't worry about it,
I assure you, your app will come

64
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:07.044
to a point where the ecosystem is
ready and you can migrate safely.

65
00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:09.542
And then the team will be really happy,
so.

66
00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:10.042
