00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.238
So in terms of resources, I've mentioned
it before, but I does as a final,

2
00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:10.390
really big thank you to Chris Fritz's
vue enterprise boilerplate.

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.296
In this a huge hat tip to him for

4
00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:18.310
doing a lot of the incredible
work that he's done.

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.732
So in case for those who don't know,
Chris used to be on the vue core team on

6
00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:29.765
glass team and basically helped to pioneer
a lot of what we know as the docks today,

7
00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:34.850
and has been an absolute incredible
contributor to the ecosystem.

8
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.734
And so for him to not only do
all that work on the docks, but

9
00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:41.520
then to also open source all his
consulting knowledge in this way.

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.150
Again, biggest thank you to Chris for
all his work in the ecosystem.

11
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.397
We're very lucky to have you in it.

12
00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:57.849
When it comes to enterprise level apps,
as we sort of talked about one of

13
00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:02.526
the things that I think is a misconception
with vue apps a lot of times is that

14
00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:06.230
it doesn't have a lot of
opinions on how you do things.

15
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.937
And this is true by default
because what we really want is for

16
00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.250
you to choose what's best for you.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.287
However, similar to the question we have
earlier, sometimes it makes sense to

18
00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:17.160
actually have a starting point and
not start from scratch.

19
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.516
And so, if you haven't checked it out
already vue does have an opinionated style

20
00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:24.950
guide that is categorized
into different rule sets.

21
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.790
That, basically are,
think of it like ES, lint rules.

22
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.181
And what's nice about this is,

23
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.370
this gives you an opinion in a way
to start structuring your app.

24
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.096
So for example, like in the essential one,
enforcing multi-component names

25
00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:43.500
ensuring that prompt definitions are
written correctly that every v4 has a key.

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.456
But then going forward,

27
00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.508
right there are then some more call it
strongly recommended rules which you'll

28
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:50.410
probably recognize in some of
the things we talked about today.

29
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.500
And so the if you include these rule sets
in your ES lint, it will go ahead and

30
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.440
make sure that you're actually
following these principles.

31
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.646
Again, following as we talked about
before automating this piece of these

32
00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:01.870
conventions.

33
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.043
And so, in case you're wondering you can
a hundred percent just like any other

34
00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:05.680
ES lint rule.

35
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.910
You can say, I like this set a lot,
but I want to disable this one thing.

36
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.510
It's still entirely configurable.

37
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.890
I think it was Sarah Drasner
who said this best.

38
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.269
What I love about vue is the fact
that it gives me what I want and

39
00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.350
then it gets out of my way.

40
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.083
And so, I think the fact that
when it comes to vue and

41
00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:28.280
things like the style guide, the fact
that you can start with some opinions.

42
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.576
And then have escape hatches
out of it is a great way for

43
00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:35.140
people to formulate what is best for
them and their team.

44
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.920
So definitely keep an eye
on the style guide.

45
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.737
In view three, there will probably be new
rules added because with the new code base

46
00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:42.609
and new features,

47
00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.730
there probably will be new best practices
that are established as time goes on.

48
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.442
So keep an eye on those,

49
00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:52.820
but this is the v2 one that we
have screenshotted right now.

50
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.580
And of course,
v3 is a big topic right now.

51
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.180
So in the event you're like,
okay, I I get it out.

52
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.746
I'm going to go ahead and
wait for view three, but

53
00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:03.190
I'd really love to learn about
what's coming down the pipe.

54
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.020
Please check out the official
view three migration guide.

55
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.125
In there we've gone ahead and tried to
document any like what breaking changes

56
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.921
there are and
what basically new things are coming and

57
00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:17.690
things you'll probably have to keep in
mind as you prepare for that migration.

58
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.154
So definitely be sure to check that
out if you're interested in what

59
00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:23.786
the migration path might
look like from v2 to v3.

60
00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:31.661
All right, well, thank you everyone for
joining a huge congratulations for

61
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:33.590
all of you for sticking around.

62
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.388
I know it's been a long day remote
workshops can be a little bit challenging,

63
00:03:37.388 --> 00:03:41.620
but I really appreciate you all spending
the time with me to chat about view.

64
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.360
And so
I could share this knowledge with you.

65
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.960
Again, a big thanks to everyone involved
for making this production happen.

66
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.370
In case you're wondering,
I'm the dinosaur on the left.

67
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.550
This is one view con for us.

68
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.450
This was the last in person conference
I went to earlier this year.

69
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.422
And so, we were the MCs and
doing the pink dinosaur thing, so

70
00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:03.380
that is a cherished memory.

71
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.100
And yeah, it's been a lot of fun,
so thanks everyone for watching and

72
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.200
guess I'll see you around and, yeah.

73
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.424
And if you have any other questions,
please go ahead and hit me out again

74
00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.134
Ben Cruising on the internet of things I'm
happy to chat further if you find things

75
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:21.578
and documentation confusing, we love
getting feedback about that because

76
00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.680
we always want to make our Doc's
better and find ways to clarify it.

77
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.010
So please, yeah, stay in touch and I guess
I'll see you around the vue community.
