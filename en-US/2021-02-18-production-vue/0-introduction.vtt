00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Welcome everyone to Production-Grade Vue
hosted by Frontend Masters.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.807
I'm really excited to be here with
you all today fun fact about me is I

3
00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:11.669
really love going to amusement parks.

4
00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.638
If you can't find me, here's me on
the Jurassic Park River Adventure ride

5
00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:17.466
at the Universal Orlando Studio.

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.537
So yeah, so I'm the the guy up
here in the upper right, but

7
00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:25.142
in case you're wondering, don't worry,
this photo was taken way back in 2017.

8
00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:29.487
So, still practising safe distancing and
all but

9
00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:34.465
man definitely missed those
adventure rides yeah cool.

10
00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:36.408
So, for those who don't know me,

11
00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:40.564
my name is Ben Hong you might know some
of my work through the Vue JS Doc's.

12
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.757
I'm a member of the core team and
do a lot of work through the docs teams.

13
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:46.564
As well as helped to lead other
projects like view press and

14
00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:49.274
just help out with around
the community just as a whole.

15
00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:52.080
I'm also a senior developer
experience engineer at metla phi and

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.333
if you're looking for
me on the internet of things.

17
00:00:54.333 --> 00:01:00.320
You can find me under the moniker Ben
code Zen basically everywhere so, yeah.

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.398
So as far as a big question about this is,

19
00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:05.652
will the stuff I'd be talking
will be applicable to V2 or V3.

20
00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:08.179
Basically across the board
all the principles and

21
00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.961
ideas we're talking about
applied to both V2 and 3.

22
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.532
If there's anything really specific that
I'm doing that's going to be different in

23
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.226
Vue 3 from Vue 2 such as tote examples.

24
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.717
We'll be signifying with this
little Vue themes one Piece logo so

25
00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:20.931
that's what that is.

26
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:24.156
So yeah, fun trivia if you didn't know
the release names of Vue are usually named

27
00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:24.736
after anime.

28
00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:29.485
So Vue 3 is named after one piece
that's the little origin story behind

29
00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:31.002
the logo right there.

30
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:31.727
And finally,

31
00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:35.420
the important thing to understand
here is that all code is compromised.

32
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.472
So a lot of the ideas I'm going to be
sharing today are things that I've

33
00:01:38.472 --> 00:01:40.191
encountered through different apps.

34
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:43.503
And ideas that I've discussed
with the core team about but

35
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:48.490
it is up to you please feel free to agree
and or and or disagree with certain ideas.

36
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.056
Because a lot of times when it comes to
the ideas that we're gonna be discussing,

37
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:54.004
it's about the context that are involved.

38
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:58.159
And what may work for a lot of teams
may not be great at all for your team.

39
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.641
So, your opinion and your experience
matters and what What your team's

40
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.654
preferences are the key thing is that you
choose what's best for you and your team.

41
00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:08.778
And as long as you do that,
we'll be good to go so

42
00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.228
just keep that in mind as
we go through the material.
