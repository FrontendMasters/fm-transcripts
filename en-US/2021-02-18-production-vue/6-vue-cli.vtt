WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.357
So let's dive into the next piece that is
the core foundation of most production

2
00:00:04.357 --> 00:00:05.592
grade level Vue apps,

3
00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:09.910
especially when it comes to fact
that it's taken over the entire app.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.270
The Vue CLI is at the core of everything.

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.313
So let's go ahead and
start by giving an overview of Vue CLI for

6
00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:18.340
those that haven't used it before.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.792
Basically what it does is it is a command
line tool that allows you to build out or

8
00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:27.242
scaffold out a view app with all the
webpack stuff already configured for you,

9
00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.550
so that there's less work for you to do.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.800
And you can focus on building things.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.130
And so if you jump into our VS code so
let me switch and then open the file.

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.964
So what we have here inside of VS code,
which is the production grade

13
00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:47.650
view app that you will download
it from the GitHub repo.

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.518
This is actually an example of basically
the bare minimum that Vue CLI does for

15
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.110
you out of the box.

16
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.160
So as you can see here, it's already
configured bubble Is gone ahead and make

17
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.961
sure you have all the various dependencies
that you need to get view up and

18
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.197
running hot module reloading, whatever it
is, it's a tries to do all of that for

19
00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.920
you out of the box with
very little configuration.

20
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.038
You didn't go to the point of,
if you're configuring es lint,

21
00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:15.671
try to include some of the rules and
these sort of things browser lists, again,

22
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:19.000
the goal is to get you up and
running as quickly as possible.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.010
And so, this is super beneficial when it
comes to having this enforced structure.

24
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.249
And so,
as far as like the directory structure,

25
00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.018
here we see this is very standard amongst
most single page application frameworks

26
00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.857
these days where you have your
source directory that contains

27
00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:36.280
like the assets that might need
to be run through Webpack.

28
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.987
The various components that comprise of
your application, as well as we saw before

29
00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:44.430
our app.view, which is our
Global Entry into our view app.

30
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.684
And then there's this main.js file that
simply is boilerplate for saying, hey,

31
00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:52.571
when the page startups go ahead and
mount our application to the page, and so

32
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:56.459
most of the time, you're never ever
going to touch this page because this is

33
00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.130
a fairly standard entry point.

34
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.140
This is what Vue CLI does out of the box.

35
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.439
And so as far as what that experience is
like locally, so I'm going to go ahead and

36
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.810
switch over here to my terminal.

37
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.483
Once you've installed Vue CLI, which
you can, again as far as the ducks go,

38
00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:18.763
let me switch this Vue CLI you
can check out the Vue CLI for

39
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.600
the full features of the docs.

40
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.728
But as far as getting started with it,

41
00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:29.250
once you've installed it locally on your
machine, using, NPM install globe Vue CLI.

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.760
It has a really nice experience for
creating apps.

43
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.089
So in case we're creating, again,
let's say a base, in case we're creating,

44
00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.790
creating a basic to do MVC, for example.

45
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.842
What it does is it actually
allows you to prompt you for

46
00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:42.880
the various things that you care about.

47
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.560
So in this case, let's go down
to the menu and select features.

48
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.463
And so here there's a nice interface as
far as checking out what you're interested

49
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:51.030
in, right?

50
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.270
What do you wanna configure?

51
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.510
We wanna choose what version we
want whether or not we want Babel.

52
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.430
And so when we hit spacebar, you'll see
that actually toggle things on and off.

53
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.998
And so going through this allows
you to actually basically pick

54
00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:05.260
the various configurations that you
want inside of your applications.

55
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.851
Which is really nice because again,
I don't know about you, but

56
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:11.008
reading through documentation to figure
out how to make things work is probably

57
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.190
one of the lowest things on my list when
it comes to building the next cool thing.

58
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.566
So being able to just come here and
go, yeah,

59
00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.830
I'd be interested in a CSS preprocessor.

60
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.250
And yep, I want, view router, for example.

61
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.095
And then as you go through, you can then
choose the various things, you know,

62
00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:28.658
I want three configure whether or
not I want router,

63
00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:31.440
choose which version of
preprocessor I want.

64
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.865
And then you can go through and

65
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:37.210
just basically configure things as
you would want, which is super nice.

66
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.300
And so CLI are fairly standard when it
comes to a build tools going forward.

67
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.050
But what many of you might not know
about It's that Vue CLI- GUI mode.

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.372
And so for those who aren't familiar
with what GUI is, it stands for

69
00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:52.410
a Graphical User Interface.

70
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.640
And so what I'm gonna do right now is
I'm gonna run the command view UI.

71
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.734
And so what this does is let me zoom
out a little bit Is that this actually

72
00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:12.000
is as you can see a web app that's built
around the command-line interface.

73
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.969
And so it is basically designed to make
our lives a lot easier when it comes to

74
00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.545
managing configurations and

75
00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:21.848
doing things that we might normally have
to memorize inside the command-line.

76
00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.230
For example, I don't know about you.

77
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.700
I've had plenty of times where node failed
to properly kill off certain ports.

78
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.680
This here is right here.

79
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.000
So if you know that something's on 3000,
you would hit 3000 hit kill.

80
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.810
You would take care of it for you.

81
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.420
No more Googling to see if it's
is it like killed dash L L S O F.

82
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.050
None of that.

83
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.170
It's there.
You can just use it.

84
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.260
On top of that, you can go in and
see what kind of plugins there are.

85
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.090
Easily seeing the versions whether it's
the latest, you can see if it's official,

86
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.280
get more info on it.

87
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.228
You can even install plugins from here.

88
00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:59.150
Inside of Vue CLI, tracking dependencies
becomes a heck of a lot easier, right?

89
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.579
It's so much easier to see what's going
on because package JSON is nice, but

90
00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.340
you lose a lot of this meta info.

91
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.140
That could be that really should
be automated and provided for you.

92
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.391
And one of my favorite things with the
Vue CLI is that configuration becomes so

93
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.780
much easier.

94
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.031
So in here you can see that you can
configure where your public path is where

95
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:18.510
the output directory is.

96
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.344
You don't have to go into documentation to
figure out what options inside of the JSON

97
00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:23.320
match to this thing.

98
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.096
And so particularly this is
particularly true, at least for

99
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.910
me when it comes to things like ESlint.

100
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.139
So if we're to, we're looking at rules,
you can go through and actually check off,

101
00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.390
I don't want this rule.

102
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.660
I only want the warning.

103
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.470
I want the error and
less, is it too first?

104
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.920
Is it error first?

105
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.260
Gosh, I can't remember.

106
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.447
And so this is one of my favorite things
about UI is this abstracting these

107
00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:52.313
things away, so that I can focus on what's
important, which is solving problems, and

108
00:05:52.313 --> 00:05:54.351
then moving on,
rather than sitting there and

109
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.260
figuring out how to configure something.

110
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.749
On top of that, Vue CLI does really well
is that when you run something basically

111
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:07.692
yaden or your surf command,
whichever you prefer One of the things it

112
00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:10.461
does here you'll see that it has basically
a bunch of statistics for you so

113
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.664
I'm gonna blow this up a little bit so
it's easier to see.

114
00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:17.257
It'll actually tell you how
big everything is from assets,

115
00:06:17.257 --> 00:06:21.571
modules dependencies you can see some
basic speed stats that it like basically

116
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:26.870
the algorithm determines how long it
takes based on different network speeds.

117
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.222
You can even see also how big your
apps are in relation to one another.

118
00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:31.296
And so whether it's,

119
00:06:31.296 --> 00:06:34.854
the view dependencies what have you
installed this is how you can tell the,

120
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:38.130
I'm importing all of low dash when
I only needed one function, right

121
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.998
because it'll tell you by the way you're
built chunk is going to look like this.

122
00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:45.506
And in case you're yeah,
I don't want to read don't worry,

123
00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:49.200
Vue CLI has got you there too,
because we have an analyzer too.

124
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.160
So the team of Vue CLI even had
the foresight to go ahead and

125
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.060
then just visualize for you just really
quickly where everything's coming from.

126
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.874
And then you can go ahead and
jump down and figure out like,

127
00:06:59.874 --> 00:07:03.130
what exactly within that is,
taking up what space.

128
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.124
And so this is a again, it's a primarily
a developer experience improving but

129
00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.470
I think it's a pretty important one.

130
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.557
From just allowing us to get
to the root of our problems,

131
00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:17.219
which is trying to solve things and build
new features, rather than simply just sort

132
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.355
of all the configuration details,
and so in, in case you're wondering,

133
00:07:21.355 --> 00:07:25.620
so this is basically a dashboard,
you can import various projects into it.

134
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.293
You can even create new
applications from here and so

135
00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:31.760
you can see it actually sees
my entire folder directory.

136
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.216
So again, we can actually create
a brand new project from here using and

137
00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:37.070
then using the GUI instead of the CLI.

138
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.780
To configure things like that,
I prefer yarn that it's to do MVC.

139
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.990
And then to even go through and then say
that, hey, like which presets do I want?

140
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.787
How do I want to configure and,

141
00:07:47.787 --> 00:07:50.910
I know my experience has
been really nice using this.

142
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.214
So something I want you to keep in
mind when sort of not only creating

143
00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:58.462
new applications, but when you're actually
running your apps to leverage view UI to

144
00:07:58.462 --> 00:08:01.510
allow you better insight
into your application.

145
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.775
Here is a pro tip that a lot
of people might not realise,

146
00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:07.500
especially if you have some legacy app
that's been on view for a little while.

147
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.930
Vue CLI has something called modern mode.

148
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.630
And so what is modern mode.

149
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.766
So as we all know right one of the great
things about Babel when it comes to

150
00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:21.148
JavaScript, it allows us to
transpile use the latest features of

151
00:08:21.148 --> 00:08:25.143
es six right we like arrow functions we
conflict and those sort of things, and

152
00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:29.080
that it transpiled it down so that
basically even if browsers don't support

153
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.030
basically the essex functionality,
we have the polyfills we're good to go.

154
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.060
But traditionally though, this often meant
with traditional bundling methodologies

155
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.190
that users were shipped at the entire
code base, even if they needed it or not.

156
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.850
So meaning they were getting larger bundle
sizes, even though they did not need it.

157
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.788
With Vue CLI as long as
you enable modern mode,

158
00:08:49.788 --> 00:08:54.960
what this does is this enables Vue CLI to
build two different versions of your app.

159
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.110
So one is it allows you to build a modern
bundle that target browsers that supports

160
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.420
ES modules.

161
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.597
And then it splits off
the legacy bundles so

162
00:09:02.597 --> 00:09:04.843
that it targets older
browsers that do not.

163
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:10.816
And so
if you were to run this in the terminal,

164
00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:14.064
the way you would do this is you
have your Vue CLI build command,

165
00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:18.900
you simply tack on the dash dash modern
flag in order to enable this to happen.

166
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.040
And believe it or not, once you've done
that there's no additional steps needed.

167
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.359
You don't need to go into like
the server to configure something,

168
00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:29.400
there is more information on the Vue CLI
doc's site as far as how they do it.

169
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.958
But at a high level, basically, there
are different script blocks that HTML can

170
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.850
recognize as far as, if it's es,
ES modules, use this, otherwise use this.

171
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.320
And so Vue CLI will automatically
do all that configuration for you.

172
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.520
And so you'll get that performance
boost just by simply enabling the flag.

173
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.790
And so if you're wondering, okay,
can you also do this from the UI?

174
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.510
Absolutely you can.

175
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:59.400
So here, you'll let me go back to the yep,
clear product creation.

176
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.434
So in here, we'll see that
inside of our configuration, or

177
00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:04.630
sorry, inside of our tasks.

178
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.250
When we look at our build,
we can check out the configuration, right?

179
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.450
The parameters that go
into our build process.

180
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.544
And you'll see that modern mode here is
an option as well to allow app to targets

181
00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:16.320
modern browsers with
that automatic fallback.

182
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.617
And so
looks like going forward in view three.

183
00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.292
It is enabled by default, but

184
00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:24.714
I would definitely recommend checking
your app to make sure that that is turned

185
00:10:24.714 --> 00:10:27.867
on because it's such a huge
win from a performance piece
