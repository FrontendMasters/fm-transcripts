00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.397
So I think what we're gonna do here is I
want you all because again, this is it's

2
00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:10.600
important for I think, for people to get
their hands sort of, into like the code.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.840
So what we're gonna do is inside of
your code repo, right, the production.

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.582
Sorry, the production rate view repo,
I want you to go ahead and

5
00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:22.570
try to replicate this.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.640
Go through the effort of basically
configuring your own counter.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
And then to enhance that,
go ahead and have a text input

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.290
that's going to customize how
much like it should increment by.

9
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.207
And then add like a decrement function and

10
00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:45.350
then practice doing that just with the
composition API just to see how it feels.

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.914
And then I'll go ahead and
do those enhancements here in about,

12
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:53.402
let's say ten minutes, I would say for
this exercise, so, see what you can do to

13
00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:58.220
get started because there's not very much
boilerplate, but the intention here is for

14
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.312
you to really get in there and try to
basically look up the docs and see how it

15
00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:06.800
feels and then that way, we'll talk about
questions regarding this afterwards
