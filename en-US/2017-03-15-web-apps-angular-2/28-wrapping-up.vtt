00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.140
&gt;&gt; Luke Ruebbelke: All right,
so let's wrap this up.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.350
We can revisit routers
a little bit more tomorrow.

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.480
We're gonna have a bonus challenge,
not a bonus challenge, but

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.670
a review challenge in the morning.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.670
One of the first things we're gonna do,

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.950
we're gonna just get back in, we're
gonna review everything that we've done.

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.890
So it's gonna be kind of
a light version of this and

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.619
then we're gonna get into
component driven architecture.

9
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.732
But do we feel like we at
least have an idea of how

10
00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:29.617
to create a component in Angular 2?

11
00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:33.940
Because if you understand that, and
you understand how to navigate to it.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.560
So in a sense, this is a website.

13
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.510
You could generate very quickly

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.950
a really simple Angular 2 website and
we know how to do this.

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.910
And this is actually useful functionality.

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.029
So I recommend everybody go have
something delicious for dinner.

17
00:00:56.029 --> 00:01:01.129
Just think about the patterns, think about
one at a high level master detail and

18
00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.640
what that means, because literally,

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.840
every line of business app I've
ever seen is a variation of this.

20
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780
Even if you go to like Pinterest or
like this crazy for

21
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.810
things, you're still looking at
a collection of object that you

22
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.120
want to manipulate whether I want to pin
this, I wanna favorite it, whatever.

23
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.892
You go to Facebook, same thing,
it's a collection of objects, whether it's

24
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:30.970
status updates or whatever, that are you
seeing, that you can then interact with.

25
00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.720
&gt;&gt; Luke Ruebbelke: Slack, Gmail,
everything, it's a list of something, or

26
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.380
a collection of objects that you need
to interact with in a meaningful way.

27
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.210
Start there, look at some of
the projects you're working.

28
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.490
Think of how you could apply it, and then,
really break it down to the essence of

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.570
a basic component and how you would
start to express it in those terms.
