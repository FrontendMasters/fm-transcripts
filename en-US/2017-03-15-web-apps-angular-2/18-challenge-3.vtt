00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So the challenge is
essentially what I did with the gadgets,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.730
create a file structure for
a new widgets feature.

3
00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:09.120
Hold on.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.550
Let me just make one check out the,
is it start?

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.420
What is the branch?

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Start, 00-start.

7
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.135
&gt;&gt; Lukas: Start branch.

8
00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:29.310
&gt;&gt; Lukas: There we go.

9
00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:34.496
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And from there, and so
probably what I would do is even to check

10
00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:38.220
out the start branch and then even,
then create a new branch off of that.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.227
So I did get checkout-b, workshop.

12
00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.645
And so that's,
create a new branch off of that.

13
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.760
And that's what I tested
these challenges on.

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.780
But, from there, create a new widgets
feature using the file structure.

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.502
Think about the class, the modules you
need to import, how to decorate it,

16
00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:01.790
how to use the widgets template.

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.544
And so this doesn't need to say
anything other than, hello widgets.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.970
And then we need to figure out how
to display the widgets component

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.650
in the app component, somehow, someway.

20
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.470
Think about that.

21
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.710
And then, for a bonus create a simple
route to view widgets component by itself.
