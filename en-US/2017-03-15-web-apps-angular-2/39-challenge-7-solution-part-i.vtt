WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's get started.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.960
Going into web store and
let's go into our widgets component.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.746
I'm just gonna close all of this and,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's

4
00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:18.860
just got all kinds of stuff in here.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.150
All right, so first things first.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.810
This is kind of a two phase challenge
as I was telling the people here.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.210
Let's break this into tiny steps.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.857
The first thing we need to do is
just create the components and

9
00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:37.002
get them rendering and from there,

10
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:42.333
then we can worry about wiring them up.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

11
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:50.636
we'll go new.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: widgets-list.

12
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.130
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: TS.

13
00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:17.404
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I create the HTML.

14
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.182
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And let's go ahead and

15
00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:27.393
do the CSS as well.

16
00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.040
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
let me just drag this down a bit.

17
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.620
I feel like I can speed this up.

18
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.831
Let me just try something real quick.

19
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:10.746
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hang on.

20
00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:23.632
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Trying to see if this

21
00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:24.942
is going to save me any time.

22
00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:42.429
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Maybe,
yeah, all right.

23
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.670
Touch for the win.

24
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.990
So far so good.

25
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.223
I've simply just stubbed out the files and
the directory structure.

26
00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:55.868
So let's be about this.

27
00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:20.764
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I know that order

28
00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:26.280
in Cider is class, import,
decorate, but with autocomplete.

29
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.430
Sometimes it's easier to just let
the autocomplete do the imports for you.

30
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.380
I'm trying to figure
out why is this angry?

31
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.210
Yes.

32
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.705
Okay, what we need here, selector.

33
00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:53.883
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hold on, list and

34
00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:58.156
template URL.

35
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.971
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Realizing now this is

36
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:33.235
plural.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

37
00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.586
then let's go into our component.

38
00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:46.085
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widgets list,

39
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:53.268
okay.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Man,

40
00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:57.428
I was being so clever and
I broke the convention.

41
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.522
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is the part where

42
00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:13.220
you, in excruciating detail,
prove that you are yet a human.

43
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.113
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So does this look

44
00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:30.302
okay, widget-list.component?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It should be detailed.

45
00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:33.294
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [NOISE] You guys

46
00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:36.289
are amazing.

47
00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.549
If I wasn't hanging out with
100 of my best friends,

48
00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:40.108
I'd be super embarrassed right now.

49
00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:43.036
How's that?

50
00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:44.210
Good?

51
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.210
Good, all right.

52
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.458
And on live television no less.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: WidgetDetail.

53
00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:13.121
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, selector.

54
00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:18.442
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Detail.

55
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:52.994
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay,

56
00:06:52.994 --> 00:06:55.010
so we've created them.

57
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.700
Let's expose them.

58
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.346
So let's go to our module here.

59
00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're getting closer.

60
00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:09.220
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

61
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:20.628
So now,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just going to,

62
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.985
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Get back

63
00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:36.075
here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

64
00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:40.612
if I want to put the list or
the widget list into our component,

65
00:08:40.612 --> 00:08:41.930
how do we do that?

66
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Selector app.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The

67
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.020
selector.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Widget.

68
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.163
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widget-list,

69
00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:54.063
there we go, and then let's go here.

70
00:09:02.578 --> 00:09:03.341
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think I did this

71
00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:07.836
right.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then for

72
00:09:07.836 --> 00:09:13.085
the detail.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,

73
00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.486
let's see what we're up against here so

74
00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:19.100
this would be kind of what I
consider the first, increment.

75
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.810
Boom.
