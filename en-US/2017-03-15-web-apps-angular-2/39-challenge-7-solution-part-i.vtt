WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's get started.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.960
Going into web store and
let's go into our widgets component.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.746
I'm just gonna close all of this and,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's

4
00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:18.860
just got all kinds of stuff in here.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.150
All right, so first things first.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.810
This is kind of a two phase challenge
as I was telling the people here.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.210
Let's break this into tiny steps.

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.857
The first thing we need to do is
just create the components and

9
00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:39.375
get them rendering and from there,
then we can worry about wiring them up.

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.266
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So we'll go new.

11
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.636
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: widgets-list.

12
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.130
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: TS.

13
00:01:15.057 --> 00:01:17.404
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I create the HTML.

14
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.393
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
let's go ahead and do the CSS as well.

15
00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.040
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
let me just drag this down a bit.

16
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.620
I feel like I can speed this up.

17
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.831
Let me just try something real quick.

18
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:10.746
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hang on.

19
00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:24.942
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Trying to see if
this is going to save me any time.

20
00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:42.429
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Maybe,
yeah, all right.

21
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.670
Touch for the win.

22
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.990
So far so good.

23
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.223
I've simply just stubbed out the files and
the directory structure.

24
00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:55.868
So let's be about this.

25
00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:23.638
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I know that order
in Cider is class, import, decorate,

26
00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:26.280
but with autocomplete.

27
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.430
Sometimes it's easier to just let
the autocomplete do the imports for you.

28
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.380
I'm trying to figure
out why is this angry?

29
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.210
Yes.

30
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.705
Okay, what we need here, selector.

31
00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:53.883
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hold on, list and

32
00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:58.156
template URL.

33
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.493
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Realizing
now this is plural.

34
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.586
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
then let's go into our component.

35
00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:47.271
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widgets list, okay.

36
00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:57.428
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Man, I was being so
clever and I broke the convention.

37
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is the part
where you, in excruciating detail,

38
00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:13.220
prove that you are yet a human.

39
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.829
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So does this
look okay, widget-list.component?

40
00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:30.302
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It should be detailed.

41
00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:36.289
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [NOISE]
You guys are amazing.

42
00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.549
If I wasn't hanging out with
100 of my best friends,

43
00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:40.108
I'd be super embarrassed right now.

44
00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:43.036
How's that?

45
00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:44.210
Good?

46
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.210
Good, all right.

47
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.898
And on live television no less.

48
00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.458
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: WidgetDetail.

49
00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:13.121
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, selector.

50
00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:18.442
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Detail.

51
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:55.010
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay,
so we've created them.

52
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.700
Let's expose them.

53
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.346
So let's go to our module here.

54
00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're getting closer.

55
00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:09.220
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

56
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:20.628
So now,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just going to,

57
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.438
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Get back here.

58
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.906
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
if I want to put the list or

59
00:08:37.906 --> 00:08:41.930
the widget list into our component,
how do we do that?

60
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Selector app.

61
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.740
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The selector.

62
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Widget.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Widget-list,

63
00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:54.063
there we go, and then let's go here.

64
00:09:02.578 --> 00:09:03.727
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I
think I did this right.

65
00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:08.361
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then for the detail.

66
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:15.486
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
let's see what we're up against here so

67
00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:19.100
this would be kind of what I
consider the first, increment.

68
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.810
Boom.
