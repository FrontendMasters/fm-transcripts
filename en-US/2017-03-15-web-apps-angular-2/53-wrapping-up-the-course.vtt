&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Everybody,
honestly thank you so much.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.330
Actually I love the experience
of teaching workshops,

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.160
because as of yesterday morning we were
total strangers, and there's always that,

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.170
ooh, getting to know each other.

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.550
It's kind of,
it's always interesting that dynamic.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.672
And then now after two
days I feel like you would

7
00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.690
probably save my life in Vietnam
if we were in the trenches.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.020
I feel like we're that close.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.260
And so honestly, thank you so much.

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.770
This is my passion and I love to

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.230
just geek out on things that are amazing,
that we can build amazing things with.

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.210
And so for me it's just the greatest
privilege and honor to share two days with

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.250
not only you in person, but to everybody
that was online for the workshop.

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.804
I appreciate this opportunity,
thank you so much.

15
00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:56.640
And one thing I will say is
if you have any questions or

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.140
you get stuck, you can,
skipping all the way to the back.

17
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.910
So it is true, I love you.

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.720
Thank you, but more so,
you can catch me on Twitter @simpulton.

19
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.840
And I try to be as responsive as possible,
time permitting.

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.820
So I do like to eat, I do have kids.

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.310
I occasionally like to sleep.

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.140
So, I might help where I can, but
please, if you run into any problems or

23
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.750
if you any questions,
feel free to direct them my way.
