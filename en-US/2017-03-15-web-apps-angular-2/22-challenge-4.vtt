00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.490
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's do a challenge.

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.980
What I am going to show you though,
cuz there is some styling or

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.220
we're going to be building out some stuff
to start to look like the item's feature.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.095
So I went ahead and
created a snippet, or rather a gist,

5
00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:23.224
at this link that you can use
to save on some of your typing.

6
00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:28.949
So, we're using Material Design Lite for
some of the styling.

7
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.223
So if you just paste this in, as well
as the initial structure for the HTML.

8
00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:38.140
You could pull this from items and
then paste it in and pull it out.

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.570
I just went ahead and did this for you.

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.249
As well as I've started a widgets,
essentially a collection,

11
00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.988
that you can use to seed
your widget's component.

12
00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.771
So, with that in mind.

13
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.479
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go back here,
and let's talk about this challenge.

14
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.750
So what I like to do, is create a widgets
collection in the widgets component.

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.980
And you can just copy that snippet
from the gist and just paste that in.

16
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.050
Also, create a selectedWidget
property in the widgets component.

17
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.960
Then what I would like for

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.660
you to do is display the widget's
collection in the template using ngFor.

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.590
Then use event binding to
set a selected widget.

20
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.520
From there, display the widgets
property using property binding and

21
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.570
interpolation binding.

22
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.660
So, something off of that object,
use property binding and

23
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.020
interpolation binding to display that.

24
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.740
So I'll give you a hint, name would
be good for interpolation binding.

25
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.260
There's an image property.

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.000
This would be a good place
to use property binding.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.239
And then use nglf to show an element or

28
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.426
an alternate message if
no widget is selected.

29
00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.223
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Any questions?

30
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.035
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question from Kaitlin.

31
00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:13.960
As far as styling, are you using any
Angular UI frameworks like PrimeNG,

32
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.923
for example?

33
00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:17.578
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
in terms of styling,

34
00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:21.091
I am a huge fan of Material Design.

35
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.262
And when I'm in Angular 1,
I just use Angular Material.

36
00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:30.143
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Angular Material 2
has gotten much better and there's still

37
00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:34.320
some components occasionally I'll run
into that just hasn't been developed.

38
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.810
For whatever reason, the select component
is, nobody wants to touch that.

39
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.982
And so for basic styling I would
generally use like Material Design Lite,

40
00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:54.880
but I really do like Angular Material too,
and I use that quite often.

41
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.892
But even as of two, three months ago
there was maybe five, six components.

42
00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:00.962
And so, their building up a lot more.

43
00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:06.057
But I'm really excited to see where
that'll be in a year from now.
