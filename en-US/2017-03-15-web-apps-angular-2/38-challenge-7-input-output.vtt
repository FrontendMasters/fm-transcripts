00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.332
&gt;&gt; Lukas: So what we wanna do is create
a presentational widgets-list and

2
00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:11.330
widgets-detail component using inputs and
outputs.

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.570
So on our widgets-list, we wanna pass in,
essentially, the widgets.

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.019
And we also wanna capture
a selected event.

5
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:28.732
And then, in our widget-detail component,
display the selected widget,

6
00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:35.122
and then we also want to fire up a delete,
save, and cancel output.

7
00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.240
Now these don't actually have to
do anything other than just log

8
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.720
to the console in the browser.

9
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.040
So we simply wanna capture the event and
fire the output, and then

10
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.190
our parent component, maybe just log it
out, and then we'll wire it up from there.

11
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.900
And feel free, in terms of template,

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.000
if you need to borrow anything from
the items component, go ahead.

13
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.710
What I would do is when you display
the selected widget, just do a JSON dump

14
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.100
as we're doing, because in the next
lesson we're gonna talk about forms.

15
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.680
All right, for the challenge,
the idea is to take

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.620
our existing widgets work
that we have done, in kind

17
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.190
of an over-aching widgets component and
start to break it out into sub components.

18
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.740
So to create a widgets-list component and
a widgets-detail component, or a widget,

19
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.880
singular, component, and we want to
wire these up using input and output.

20
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.119
So for
the list we wanna pass in the widgets.

21
00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.046
And then we wanna capture a selected event
or, output, and then we wanna pass or

22
00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:47.530
handle that and then pass in the selected
widget into the widget-details component.

23
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.320
And then we're just going to stub out some
additional outputs that we'll hook up

24
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.590
in the next module.
