&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We are going to look
at how to have a strong grasp on how

2
00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:09.022
to construct a single
feature in Angular 2.

3
00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:10.225
And then tomorrow,

4
00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:14.510
we'll look at how to actually
compose multiple features together.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.577
But today, we're gonna start
out real slow, real gentle.

6
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:22.943
And we're just just gonna incrementally
build to the point where we can

7
00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:26.450
understand how to build
an single feature in Angular 2.

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.550
And so this is the agenda,
time permitting.

9
00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.940
So we're just gonna real quick
talk about the demo application,

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.900
then we're going to get
into the big picture.

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.310
So this is just for me when I look
at a book, I like to go right to

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.890
the Table of Contents, and
be like, what am I gonna learn?

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.220
Okay, I have a pretty good idea and
then go and fill in the gaps.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.580
So we're gonna do the Angular 2 big
picture, we'll talk about the Angular CLI,

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.310
then we'll get into components,
templates, services, and routing.
