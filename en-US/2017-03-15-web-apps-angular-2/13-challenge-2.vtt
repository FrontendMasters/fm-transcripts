&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I want
everybody to do, using the CLI,

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:10.310
scaffold out a gizmo component,
scaffold out a gizmo service.

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.054
I'd like everybody to run the test,
build the application,

4
00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:21.083
and for a bonus create a gizmo route.

5
00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:30.390
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So that if you go to
/gizmo, that you'll see your component.
