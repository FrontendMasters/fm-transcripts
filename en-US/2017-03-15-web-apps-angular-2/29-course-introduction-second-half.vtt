00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.292
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, welcome to
day two of learn to build awesome

2
00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:07.600
apps with Angular 2.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.163
Our goal today is to have a strong
grasp on how to construct and

4
00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:19.950
compose features in Angular 2.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.880
So, yesterday we focused on building
a single feature, which was when you

6
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.730
break it down, essentially, a component
with the ability to talk to a service.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.999
Today we are going to learn how
to kind of compose multiple

8
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.354
features together and
what that would look like.

9
00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:45.100
At the core of this is I'm talking
about component driven architecture.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.925
So, how do you actually
compose your components so

11
00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:49.707
that they fit nicely together?

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.373
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: As well as yesterday,
so.

13
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.640
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I
offer a half apology.

14
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.848
But we started out with
a ton of information.

15
00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:06.048
So, that first module was
here's everything and

16
00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:10.769
then we started to work through and write
code to where by the end of the day I

17
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:15.540
think some of these fuzzy theoretical
things started to make sense.

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.150
Well, today we're going to
slow this down even more.

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.260
And we have actually fewer modules.

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.860
And we're just going to take our time and
write as much code as possible.

21
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.150
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hold on one second.

22
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.100
My chat went away.

23
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.403
There we go.

24
00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:42.986
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So here's the agenda.

25
00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:44.330
We're gonna do a review challenge.

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.949
So, this may take an hour
it may take 90 minutes but

27
00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:51.173
we'll spend as much time
on this as we need to.

28
00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:54.136
Then we're going to get into
my all favorite module ever,

29
00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.950
component driven architecture and

30
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
we're gonna talk about template
driven forms server communication.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.064
And time permitting, we'll see,
we'll talk about observable fundamentals.

32
00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:12.691
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So just real quick for
anyone who was not here yesterday,

33
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:17.140
if you go to this URL,
you can pull down the app.

34
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.920
And then there are branches for
every module that we're in.

35
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.590
The branches contain the solution for
the challenge for that module.

36
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.730
So, for instance,

37
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.360
we're jumping into component driven
architecture after the review.

38
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.458
So, being that that is,
I believe, branch five,

39
00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.774
you would want to jump to branch four.

40
00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:38.129
And you would essentially
be caught up to us.

41
00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
again, master detail view.

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.230
A master list of items.

43
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.260
And then we are able to select an item and

44
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.550
see the details of that item and
modify it.

45
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.620
So, this is the foundation of
every line of business app ever.

46
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150
The items feature has been built out and

47
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.460
we will continue building
out the widget's feature.

48
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.290
So, this is just a summary.

49
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.510
So, items is there.

50
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.965
We're building out the widgets.

51
00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.375
By now,
I hope everybody can run the application.

52
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:18.560
If not, then let us know in chats.

53
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.996
Everybody here can run the application.

54
00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:22.225
And let's go.
