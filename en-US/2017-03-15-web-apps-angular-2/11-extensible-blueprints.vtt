00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.230
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Extensible Blueprints
coming soon, so

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.350
eventually you'll be able to
write kind of your own generator.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.900
So if you for
instance have an internal style guide for

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.930
your team, you'll be able to
create custom generators.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.570
So again, I like generators,
don't use them as a crutch.

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.570
Once you know what you're doing then for
instance I have Typinator

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.900
on my computer because I don't like typing
my emails over and over, or my addresses,

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
or my phone, or credit card numbers,
just kidding, those are not in there.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
The only thing that's not in here
is routes, the reason being,

10
00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.930
I was talking to Mike Brokey and.

11
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.901
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's debatable whether
routes will actually ever go in there

12
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.891
because by the time you factor
in the super custom DSL,

13
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.670
to actually make that work it's easier
just to define your routes yourself.

14
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.460
Cuz really, adding a route definition is,
I don't know one,

15
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.140
two, three lines of code, so
I think generating routes,

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.950
I think they're realizing it may
be better just to do it by hand.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.895
But we'll see, if they change it,
I'll be back here for

18
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.720
another refresh of the work shop.

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.610
Again I'm kidding.
