&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I'd like you
to do is take your widgets detail

2
00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:10.317
component and
convert that JSON dump into a form.

3
00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:11.537
Then what I'd like you to do is.

4
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.725
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Essentially create
a button to save the edited widget,

5
00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.700
a button to cancel editing the widget,
and then using ngForm,

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.890
perform some kind of validation.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.660
And for the markup, by all means, you can
reference the item's detail component

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.380
to save some of your
typing on the HTML itself.
