00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.840
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Are we
starting to see how this is

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.470
kind of starting to fit together?

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.430
Classes, metadata,
they stack on each other.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.550
We use, essentially,
modules to kind of bind this together.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.419
So again, classes, modules, they're
just organizational mechanisms that

6
00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.470
allow us to expose properties and methods.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.999
The metadatas will be used to really,
kind of,

8
00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.168
bind it together, and
tell Angular like this what we wanna do.

9
00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:40.870
And from there we use kind
of modules to organize it.

10
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.240
And then we can use routes to kind
of separate high level features.

11
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.056
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, I think we
are going to do a code challenge and

12
00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:54.362
then we will see how far we get.

13
00:00:54.362 --> 00:00:55.962
And then we'll decide our next steps.

14
00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:59.122
I may just take a moment and
actually talk about change detection.

15
00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:03.982
And we'll pick up router in the morning,
we'll see.

16
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:04.662
All right,

17
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.540
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: My this is basically
almost exactly what I just did.

18
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.510
So you have the widgets collection,
I like for

19
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.100
you to extract it out to a widget service.

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.780
Then expose the widgets service and
consume the widgets service.

21
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.230
And then make sure you can
display the collection.

22
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.450
So essentially it will
work like it always did.

23
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.790
But maybe update the collection and
the service so

24
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.011
you can verify that it is loading.
