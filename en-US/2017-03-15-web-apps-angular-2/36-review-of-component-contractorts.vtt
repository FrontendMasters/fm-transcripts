00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This
is a bit mind-bending.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.540
And I do not want to rush this at all.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.420
Because I think our success
as Angular 2 developers,

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.963
is really contingent on us having a firm
grasp of this concept, right here.

5
00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:22.200
And so, first and foremost,
I want to open up the floor.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.110
I mean, I would imagine everyone
sitting here with questions.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.029
Even, conceptually, you may grasp it, but

8
00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.796
I'd like to get your take on it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I can't see them, but

9
00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:37.978
I'm sure there are thousands of
question marks happening in Chat World.

10
00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:38.828
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right.

11
00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:43.606
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So what do you guys

12
00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:44.940
think about this?

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.770
Is it cool?

14
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.874
Does it make sense?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

15
00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:57.179
let's just back this up just a bit,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Cuz the secret,

16
00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.090
I believe, is,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.770
me figure out where my slides went.

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.276
Just wanna really go back and

19
00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:11.200
ask you revisit,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.122
my keynotes just totally calmed down.

21
00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:20.310
There it is.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.634
go back to this.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

23
00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:32.030
we have a pretty good grasp on how to
capture events with event binding.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.820
So up to this point,
any DOM event we were able to capture

25
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.370
primarily click is and
kind of our favorite one.

26
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.087
And then when we want to pass data
from the class to the template,

27
00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:52.772
we use property binding.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well,

28
00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:57.841
taking these, or
this concept we can extend

29
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:03.220
it to communicate with child components.

30
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.540
And so really when I think of inputs and

31
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.170
outputs, I just think of custom
property and event binding.

32
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.960
That is at the core what you're doing.

33
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.990
Is you're simply saying at the child
component with an input I am creating

34
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.470
a property that is going to get it's
value from the parent component.

35
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.590
When I create an output,
I am creating an event

36
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.270
that's going to be handled
by the parent component.

37
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.699
And so think of this as really,

38
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.690
your parent component or
lord overseer component.

39
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.900
Simply saying, this is what you're gonna
display, and if anything happens, come and

40
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.880
tell me and I'll handle it.

41
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.070
Which, really on the surface,
essentially frees up

42
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.940
your child component from
really any responsibility.

43
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.960
How convenient it would be if

44
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.060
everything I needed to survive
was just provided for me.

45
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.760
And any conflict in my life or
anything that happened to me,

46
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.600
I'm just like, hey this thing happened,
go deal with it.

47
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.510
And that's why you have these really small

48
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.840
presentational components because
they get everything they need and

49
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.020
if anything happens, they just tell their
dad or their mom or their parents, okay?

50
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.620
So, in theory, I think we can kind
of wrap our minds around that.

51
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.710
I think that what we should do.

52
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.710
How much time do we have?

53
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.670
What do we have for lunch, Mark?
&gt;&gt; Mark: Mediterranean.

54
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.340
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Mediterranean.

55
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.595
&gt;&gt; Mark: Euros, I think.

56
00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:42.162
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Euros,

57
00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:47.675
I'm trying to see if I have enough time to
do a quick demonstration, before I turn

58
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:52.108
everybody loose for lunch and a challenge.
&gt;&gt; Mark: That's fine with me.

59
00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:52.657
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay,

60
00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:59.503
let's just do an easy one.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Granted, this is a bit

61
00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:03.880
of a heavy concept, I think, mentally,
we're wrapping our minds around it.

62
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.910
Now we just have to do
it a thousand times.

63
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.200
But even to that, every time I have
an opportunity, it's like, well,

64
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.650
I can use the practice.

65
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.220
Yes, Tamara.
&gt;&gt; Tamara: David has a question about how

66
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.240
did your click on an item
as opposed to hover or

67
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.850
any other event get tied to select it.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.

68
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.120
&gt;&gt; Tamara: I think you've covered it, but-

69
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.890
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I have, but

70
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:30.481
let me just go back and, let's revisit it.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What is going on here?

71
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:31.906
It was weird.

72
00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:35.380
Okay, pair component.

73
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.820
So I'm in the items.component.html.

74
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.750
And we have a selected event.

75
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.491
How is that hitting fired?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If we go to our

76
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:51.791
items-list.components, so this is the
template for the child component, we have

77
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:57.920
a click right here on the ngrepeat.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

78
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.916
so let's actually do something here.

79
00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:06.346
Well, first and foremost,
what I can do, so this is click and

80
00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:11.647
then that's what I'm using the DOM
event to actually trigger my output.

81
00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:20.907
Let's think of another I think I can do.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's

82
00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:24.480
just pick another DOM event,
so mouse center.

83
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.550
So now we have a DOM event with a child
component, hey, this thing happened,

84
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.854
let's tell our parents.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go back

85
00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:37.448
here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

86
00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:43.910
now as I just mouse over,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm

87
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.850
capturing the mouse center events and
I'm using that to trigger my output.

88
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.620
Make sense?

89
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.521
So it's just whatever your output is,
which is an instance of a you just

90
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:58.440
call output.omit and then you pass
in whatever information you want.
