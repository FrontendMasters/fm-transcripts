00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so really what
I want you to do is within the sample

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.130
application, go through, identify all kind
of the major pieces that I talked about.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.670
So, where are the modules, where
are the services, where are the routes?

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.740
And then what I'd like you to
do is just add a new property

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.730
to your items component,
and bind to it in the view.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.210
And then, also,
add a new property to the ItemsService and

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.660
consume it in the component.

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.024
And if you're feeling
really ambitious then,

9
00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:39.743
using TouchScript you can create
an interface for a new property.

10
00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.370
And then type it in the ItemsService.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.300
So this is something that we
really haven't talked about.

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.632
But if you are resourceful,
you can look into the application and

13
00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:57.639
there are examples of this,
of us doing this, okay.

14
00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Should you be doing this
off the master branch of your project?

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.270
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I recommend.

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.646
So I went through these earlier last night
to just kind of make sure these were

17
00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:08.900
kind of coherent.

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.315
And I what I did was I
created a new branch.

19
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.642
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Called workshop
that I just kind of work off of that.

20
00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.781
And so, what I would actually recommend.

21
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.280
So for this one, definitely do it off the
master, you're not gonna break anything.

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.190
But then once we get started,
I'll have you actually,

23
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.490
we'll check out the 00 start here branch,
then we'll kind of build off of that.

24
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.810
So this, just master,
we're gonna throw it away anyways.

25
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.496
And so just, I want you to kind of just
orient yourself to where the pieces are,

26
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:48.700
how everything fits together,
look for bindings, services, etc.

27
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.140
And then just kind of play around
with some of the data bindings.
