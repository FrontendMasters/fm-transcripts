00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.880
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I believe
everybody has went through this,

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.260
but this is how this works.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.890
We're installing cli,
we do a new project, and we run it.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.195
So far, so good I think, but then,

5
00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:18.940
if we want to generate a component
you can use ng g or generate.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.339
Told that you want to generate
the component and give it a name.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.390
You can also use paths, so
if you need to do like relative to, so

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.390
if you do it from the root is
going to put it in resource.app.

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.719
It is a very specific place that it goes,
but as an additional parameter you can

10
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.931
kind of tell it where to go
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

11
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:41.860
generating the service.

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.400
Does the pattern make sense?

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.750
ng g service.

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.960
My new service, and
if we wanna generate a build, ng build.

15
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.412
Test, you wanna do end n test.

16
00:00:57.412 --> 00:01:00.151
We wanna lint.

17
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.995
I haven't done this, but
I believe I'll take their word for it,

18
00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:09.060
if you wanna deploy, and
here we are, at a challenge.

19
00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:15.330
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, let me actually,
I'm gonna do a quick demonstration.

20
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.540
Scaffolding out the service.

21
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.168
There's a little gotcha there.

22
00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:24.706
I'm gonna see if I can protect you guys

23
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:29.728
from,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,

24
00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:31.582
so I'm in the root.

25
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:39.886
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go ng g
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Component

26
00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:44.379
let's think of something, I don't know.

27
00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:50.724
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll go students.

28
00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:56.085
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right so
you noticed that by

29
00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.482
default source app students, and then
it kind of just put everything in here.

30
00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:05.600
So convenient, but
also if I go down to if I'm not

31
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.310
mistaken, yes it also added it to
the app module, so pretty handy.

32
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.400
So it imported it, and
it added it in as declarations.

33
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.090
Now if we wanted to do a service I
found the way to do that is to go into

34
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.270
the actual directory you wanna generate it
or just dump it like right into the root.

35
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.384
So in this case,

36
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.397
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Shared ng g service,

37
00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:46.700
let's go like this.

38
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.730
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's generated,
but we haven't actually hooked it up.

39
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.100
There we go, so you can see,
so that's the caveat,

40
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.690
that you have to go into the folder
when you're generating a service.

41
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.900
And then what we have to do is,
we'll do a couple things.

42
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.619
So what we have here is an index.ts file,
and so this is essentially a bucket that

43
00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:24.870
you can export other things, so
that you can import them all in one place.

44
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.350
So if I go here,
I'll show the alternates here.

45
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.418
So we'll go widgets.service, or not,
sorry, I guess we're on students.service.

46
00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.042
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
we're using this essentially as a,

47
00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:40.380
this is what you call a barrel roll.

48
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.557
So we're basically rolling these up, and

49
00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.744
then from here,
I can do one of two things.

50
00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.660
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Because
invariably this is going to come up.

51
00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:57.277
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I can
import this directly.

52
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.413
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

53
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.201
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Or
what I can do is because by default,

54
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.460
because this is a note convention.

55
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.810
When you go to a folder it will look for
the index.ts,

56
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.110
and anything that's been exported
in the index.ts is now available.

57
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.680
So now we can go, Student service.

58
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.915
Then we'll just go down

59
00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:34.730
here in our providers like so.

60
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.010
So now we're just gently kind
of acquainting ourselves

61
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.810
with kind of the shapes of
an Angular 2 application.

62
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.662
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, and so
just to reiterate, I generated,

63
00:04:55.662 --> 00:05:01.860
hold on real quick let me
just clean some of this out.

64
00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.593
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I generated
a student's component right here,

65
00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:12.450
which automatically got
added to the module.

66
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.520
Then I generated a StudentsService
which I then added to

67
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.840
the index.ts file in the shared directory.

68
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.810
So what this does is now you can just
import everything, from one place.

69
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.580
And then within the app module TS here you

70
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.580
can see that I was able to
import all of these, and

71
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.320
share cuz it's actually doing ./shared,
and it's looking for index.ts.

72
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.580
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not a question,

73
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.890
just a comment.

74
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.700
It's hard to tell what files
you're jumping between.

75
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.980
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's kind of

76
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.630
hard to read the file name.

77
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.850
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah, I'll try
to verbalize, sorry about that, so

78
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.810
if I'm jumping to a file, I will say,

79
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.540
I'm now jumping to this file,
and we can go from there.
