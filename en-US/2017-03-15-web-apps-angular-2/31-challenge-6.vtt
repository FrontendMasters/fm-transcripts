00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
we have some challenges, and

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.006
we're really gonna take our time on this.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.170
So this is, I think an opportunity for

4
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.090
us to just reiterate, and
reinforce what we did yesterday.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.360
And so
we're gonna kind of do this challenge, and

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.440
you can do it in your working
branch that you're on.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.530
And this is, really for all intents and

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.010
purposes, just kind of,
it'll live in parallel.

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.010
And you can just leave it, or at the end
of the review, we can just throw it away.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.754
But, what I need is in
your working example,

11
00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:37.511
we're going to create
a new review feature.

12
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:38.970
And so what does that mean?

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.870
File structure, a component class,
and a template.

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.090
So you can do tablet URL,
you can do it in line.

15
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.370
It's up to you.

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.440
And then, I think this is where
some people are a little fuzzy.

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.750
And so, this is good practice.

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.850
Make it available to the rest
of your application.

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.620
Then, what I'd like,

20
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.519
is for you to display the review component
in the application via its HTML selector.

21
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.480
Also, display the review component
in the application via a route.

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.930
And from there, I'd like to do
some binding within that template.

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.831
So simple property,
as well as just create a simple array,

24
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:21.416
and display the array in the template.

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.108
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so, I'm fairly
ambivalent about what the array looks,

26
00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.010
like or whatever, so
you guys can use whatever you want.

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.540
But I want us to take a moment,
review what we've learned yesterday,

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.760
and put it into action by
creating a review component.
