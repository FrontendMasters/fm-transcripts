2
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:39.697
&gt;&gt; Lukas: All right everybody.

3
00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:45.650
Welcome to Learn to
Build Awesome Apps with Angular 2.

4
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.400
So what this is,
is actually an update to a previous

5
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.800
version of this workshop that
we did a few months ago.

6
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
But whereas with the previous version,
there were still things kind of in flux.

7
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.360
So for instance, the router as we knew
it then, has now been completely redone.

8
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.530
The forms API is different,
and with ngModel,

9
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.570
when I actually saw that I kind
of just cried a little tear,

10
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.016
because I realized that actually at
that point, the previous Angular 2

11
00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:22.550
Frontend Masters workshop was a little
bit I think, broken at that point.

12
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.740
That was a very breaking change.

13
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.511
And so Mark, thankfully, has agreed to
let me come back and update the workshop.

14
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.734
And I'm of the opinion that Angular 2,
as it gets stable,

15
00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.370
just gets better and better.

16
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.570
The Angular core team is
actually really really responsive

17
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.660
to listening to the development community.

18
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.790
And these are the things that we need.

19
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.350
These are the problems that we need.

20
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.530
Weighing it across all the use cases and
implementing it.

21
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.680
So I'm gonna make actually,
I'm gonna go off script a bit,

22
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.210
just a little commentary real quick.

23
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.820
So this is I believe, as Mark said,
my fifth front-end masters.

24
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.170
And I think that we are in one of the best
communities in the world as developers,

25
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.400
that we have, I don't know,
almost 140 people around the world.

26
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.110
And as I'm traveling different places,
it's phenomenal to me.

27
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.130
I'm always just completely humbled
when somebody comes up and

28
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.130
says, hey I learned Angular 2 or
I learned Angular, rather,

29
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.340
from your fun in Masters workshop, and
this is what I'm doing now for a living.

30
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.490
And so when I was actually in
London a few weeks ago for

31
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.840
Angular Connect,
a young man from Ukraine came up.

32
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
His name was Roman, he said hey,
if MiÅ¡ko is the godfather of Angular,

33
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.460
you are the godfather or my career because
I basically sit, I watch Frontend Masters,

34
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.260
and basically I learned Angular and
now this is what I do for a living.

35
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.000
And so when you kind of hear that, and
so right now we're kind of in this space

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.590
where we're just hanging out and talking
about something that I really like.

37
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.830
But when you hear these stories about
actually changing people's careers,

38
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.460
their lives.

39
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.290
That to me is what it's really all about.

40
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.970
I think when you do workshops, when you
kind of put yourself out there a bit,

41
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.730
to get in front of people and talk about
things, it's always a bit unnerving.

42
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.910
But then when that value comes
back when somebody says hey,

43
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.500
I found this valuable and
I was able to use the same information,

44
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.010
then you know that to me
makes it all worth it.

45
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.070
So Roman if you're listening,
I love you buddy.

46
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.480
And on top of that

47
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.780
speaking of value I'll just say this,
this may end up on a new promo video,

48
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.170
is that when we equate the value of
knowledge, especially in this field,

49
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.870
that what is one good technique
that helps do your job better.

50
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
And I was talking to John Lindquist,
we were out there doing some training and

51
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.840
talking about how people put value of
different things, and I made the statement

52
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.910
I said John, if somebody offer me $10,000
in cash or the opportunity to spend

53
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.770
one day learning from you, Well I
would spend the day learning with you.

54
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.510
Because then I could take that knowledge,
make $10,000 over and over and over.

55
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.430
And so when I look at Mark
with your basic MBM member,

56
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.130
for basically your monthly membership.

57
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.530
But then you have all the workshops.

58
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.660
And really what that means, so
he told me I'm like my goodness, $40 for

59
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.700
all the workshops,
just the live workshops?

60
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.890
That's pretty incredible.

61
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.620
And so, thumbs up for that, Mark.

62
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.220
I know it's courageous.

63
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.690
I'm super excited.

64
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.947
And so
I can't wait to finish these workshops, so

65
00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.860
that I can start attending
other live workshops.

66
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.320
Jaafar Hussein in particular, I love you.
