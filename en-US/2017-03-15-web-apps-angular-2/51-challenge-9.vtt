00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I would
like you to do at your convenience

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.940
is essentially what I have done.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.740
So I'd like you to actually load
your widgets via an async call.

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.337
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then from there,
continue with that pattern,

5
00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:21.600
flesh out CRUD functionality using
the ItemsServices reference.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.433
What I'd recommend is to
set the image bit aside.

7
00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.651
I wouldn't worry about that.

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.181
I would take a first pass and
just display, for instance, item and

9
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.010
description.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.130
And I recommend using subscribe.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.410
That would be kind of the bonus reach, but
if you must, use promise, or to promise.

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.140
In fact I'd even try them both and
see how they feel, and

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.130
I think you'll find that .subscribe
is just as easy or if not more so.
