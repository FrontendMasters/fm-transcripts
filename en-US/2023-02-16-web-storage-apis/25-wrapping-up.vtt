00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.981
We'll go over the state of browser
storage, the APIs available,

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:10.940
which API should be used in your PWAs and
which one you shouldn't be using?

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.209
Debugging tools, everything about quotas,

4
00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.440
persistance, how to request,
persistance storage.

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.502
Remember, if you don't request
explicitly persistance storage,

6
00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:24.450
you are under best effort.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.560
So your data might be evicted at any time.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.780
And then we've covered with code
web storage, try to not use it.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.440
IndexedDB with the proper at least,
Cache Storage and the FileSystem API.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.534
In the companion website,
you have the last chapter,

11
00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:50.260
some ideas of what else you can do
as homework, like bonus, next steps.

12
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.659
So things that you can do to improve this
PWA, such as separate categories and

13
00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.550
products in different data
storage in the same database.

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.680
Caching the menu using a transaction.

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.670
For example, right now, when we
are caching the menu, we are using a for

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.080
each and we are caching one by one.

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.220
We are adding to a database one by one.

18
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.510
But what happens if the third one fails?

19
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.970
We ended up with a menu
that is half of the menu.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.680
So it's better to use a transaction.

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.870
So if you wanna play with transactions on
IndexedDB, that's a nice sample, okay?

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.035
Try to increase the whole UI performance,

23
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:29.370
replacing innerHTML with
different techniques.

24
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.155
InnerHTML was the easiest way here
to just focus on the data part and

25
00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:38.830
not other parts of performance
in user interface.

26
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.000
Let the user know the current offline and
storage status.

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.554
You can create settings or some part
of the website saying you're online,

28
00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:48.200
you're offline.

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.602
Okay, this is your quota, you are okay,
you are green, you are yellow,

30
00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.500
you're red, okay?

31
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.496
And by the way in Chrome,

32
00:01:56.496 --> 00:02:02.600
you can simulate in the latest version
of Chrome's a custom storage quota.

33
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.105
So you can say, you know what,
you have one megabyte, and

34
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:14.320
this is pretty interesting to test your
errors, how you're handling errors.

35
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.640
So you can say you have
only one megabyte now.

36
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.469
So when you try to save
data in the indexedDB or

37
00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.792
cache storage more than one megabyte,
it will trigger exceptions.

38
00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:25.498
Are you handling that situation?

39
00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:31.783
Okay, that's in the latest
version of Chrome only.

40
00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.613
Simulating custom storage port.

41
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:38.415
So you can play with that, okay?

42
00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:42.340
You can update assets in the cache when
there is no connection to the server.

43
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.217
And increase the PWA installability
experience, such as the first time you get

44
00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.730
into PWA, you can offer the user
a way to install the app.

45
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.608
Different things that you can play
as a bonus over this coffee masters

46
00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:59.150
PWA that now works completely offline.

47
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.310
Well, okay, thank you.

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.814
That's all I have for you today.

49
00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:06.114
