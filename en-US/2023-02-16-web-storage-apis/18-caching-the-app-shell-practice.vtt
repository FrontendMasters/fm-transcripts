1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.514
Is my app offline capable right now,
what do you think?

2
00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:09.988
Can we try that?

3
00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:13.893
I can't try to to turn off my server,
turned off my Wi-Fi,

4
00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:16.551
but also within application in Chrome,

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:21.109
within application service workers,
I have an offline simulator.

6
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.139
I'm not sure if you knew that.

7
00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.413
So I can click offline simulator.

8
00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:29.619
This update and reload probably,
I don't need it.

9
00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.338
This update on reload will actually try to
force a service worker reload, but anyway.

10
00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:41.650
So if I refresh now,
I can see if my app works offline.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.255
And yeah, it's not, why?

12
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.746
Because yeah, I have the images,
I have the IndexedDB database,

13
00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:55.642
but I don't have In the assets of my app,
what is known as the app shell.

14
00:00:55.642 --> 00:01:02.133
The app shell is all the assets that I
need to render the whole app, the HTML,

15
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:08.535
the JavaScript file, the CSS file,
the form files and everything I need.

16
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.431
So let's try to do that.

17
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:11.058
Can we do that?

18
00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:12.530
Yes.
Where?

19
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.876
Well, I could do that in the page load,
or something like that, but

20
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.337
a better place is the service worker.

21
00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:24.474
The service worker has
another event called install.

22
00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:30.134
By the way, we are not covering in this
course service workers in details.

23
00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:35.084
Here at Frontend Masters you have in the
library many courses that you can find.

24
00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:39.432
There is one from Kai system,
another one for me, for myself on PWAs,

25
00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:44.684
in case you want to get more about service
workers, the lifecycle and what happens.

26
00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:50.356
So when the server worker installs,
here I can actually go and

27
00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:55.592
try to let's move this function
into an async function,

28
00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:58.884
because I'm going to open a cache.

29
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:07.216
And I can call this app shell for
Coffee Masters, I can open a cache.

30
00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:12.299
And what I need to do with that
cache is I'm going to add all URLs.

31
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.921
So here I will pass an array
of all the assets that I need.

32
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:25.056
So which assets do I need, what's
the first one, the most important one?

33
00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:25.727
&gt;&gt; HTML file.

34
00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.983
&gt;&gt; HTML, should I write index.html,
what do you think?

35
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.911
So, am I in the server or in the client?

36
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:41.932
The service worker runs in the client,
right?

37
00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:48.677
Is the client seeing index.html anywhere?

38
00:02:48.677 --> 00:02:55.121
So if I'm going here, well let's go back
to online, so let me turn off offline.

39
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.650
So if I go to the network,
do I see index.html here somewhere?

40
00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:06.072
Because I read, the document,
but it doesn't say index html.

41
00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:08.671
So this is a tricky one.

42
00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:10.364
So the answer is no.

43
00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:16.393
But we should cache, forward slash,
or dot forward slash,

44
00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:22.189
the default document, but
not the request index.html,

45
00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.882
because that's not what the browser sees,
make sense?

46
00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:32.740
Well, then I need one by one
all the resources like style,

47
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.133
CSS, then all the scripts.

48
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:41.449
The forward slash at the beginning
is not actually necessary.

49
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.782
So scripts/API.js,

50
00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:51.983
Scripts/app.js, and so on.

51
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:55.182
You have the list to copy and
paste if you want, okay?

52
00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:02.028
Order.js in the companion website,
you have it ready.

53
00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:06.138
OrderRouter.js.

54
00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:11.791
On images,
I think we need at least the logo.svg.

55
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:18.523
My images, at least that's mandatory, and
how do I know if I'm missing someone?

56
00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:19.598
I will tell you.

57
00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:26.088
Okay, so this is going to
precache all these assets, right?

58
00:04:26.088 --> 00:04:30.892
It's going to precache all these assets
when the service worker is installed, but

59
00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:31.929
I have a problem.

60
00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:38.572
My service worker is already installed,
how can I solve the issue?

61
00:04:38.572 --> 00:04:42.285
While I'm developing my app,
update and reload, so

62
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:47.567
I've been really weird reinstall
the service worker every time I refresh,

63
00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:50.798
but that's not the normal operation, okay?

64
00:04:50.798 --> 00:04:54.992
So if I refresh again,
how do I know if this is working?

65
00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:58.570
I can look into my cache storage, and

66
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.350
I can see now I have another
cache with all the files, okay?

67
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.628
Now, what am I up work offline now?

68
00:05:09.422 --> 00:05:13.369
That's right, so
I will mark this as offline,

69
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.527
I will refresh, and
it's kind of there, right?

70
00:05:17.527 --> 00:05:24.221
So I'm seeing something, not an error, but
it seems like something is missing, okay?

71
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:28.599
So if I go to the console,
typically you will find what's wrong,

72
00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.236
can you spot what's wrong, quickly?

73
00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:35.376
&gt;&gt; All, all the remote files
from the up shell, right?

74
00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.626
&gt;&gt; But which one is the first one that
is giving me all the [INAUDIBLE].

75
00:05:38.626 --> 00:05:39.352
&gt;&gt; IDV library.

76
00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:46.532
&gt;&gt; IDV library, my wrapper,
I didn't cash my wrapper.

77
00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:51.843
Can I cache a wrapper that is
not actually from my domain?

78
00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:56.041
Because if we look at the index.html,
it's this one.

79
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:59.482
Can I cache from cdn, js,
delivr, blah, blah, blah?

80
00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:00.463
Yes, I can.

81
00:06:00.463 --> 00:06:06.122
My service worker can cache and
serve cross-domain assets only for

82
00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:09.403
my PWA, not for other PWA, for my PWA.

83
00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:12.986
So I need to also add that one.

84
00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:17.546
And now that I did this, and you were
looking at HTML, probably you have

85
00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:22.576
realized that also we have, for example,
some CSS coming from Google Fonts.

86
00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:26.432
From here, I have these fonts, Google,

87
00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:30.961
blah,blah,blah, that
it seems like we need.

88
00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:34.402
And there is another one for icons,
that is using material icons,

89
00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:36.135
that's an open source library.

90
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:40.712
So you find open HTML I have another one.

91
00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:44.266
By the way I'm not saying
that I'm ready yet,

92
00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:49.202
but I am showing you how you can
go one by one with your resources.

93
00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:50.999
So let's try now.

94
00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:56.054
Again, I'm going back to the browser
application service worker,

95
00:06:56.054 --> 00:07:02.081
I'm turning off offline, I'm turning
on update and reload, I'm refreshing.

96
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:05.436
I can check if I want
in my cache storage if

97
00:07:05.436 --> 00:07:10.092
the cross platform resources
are here they are, okay?

98
00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:13.884
So they will be served probably.

99
00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:19.550
So now if I'm going to
application service worker,

100
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:26.390
and I swap these options, again,
I refresh and kind of there.

101
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.302
So It's kind of working, well,

102
00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:37.446
I'm not seeing the logo it seems there,
and also the icons.

103
00:07:37.446 --> 00:07:38.920
Does anyone spot why?

104
00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:49.609
First I'm using icon PNG, I think I
served icon SVG, so I should change that.

105
00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:55.043
But also, what's the problem
with fonts and web fonts?

106
00:07:57.222 --> 00:07:59.417
Have you ever used web fonts before?

107
00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:06.489
So you insert a CSS, but that CSS,
this is the CSS from Google,

108
00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:11.702
that's the CSS file,
we can actually see it.

109
00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:15.572
The CSS file points to other files,

110
00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:20.218
to the actual font file, their work file.

111
00:08:20.218 --> 00:08:24.233
So I also need to cache those files.

112
00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:28.783
At this point someone will say,
hey, is there any way to just say,

113
00:08:28.783 --> 00:08:30.827
check all the files you need?

114
00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:35.041
Well, you can cache on the file,
that's one way.

115
00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:40.026
And if not, the other way is like
a tool that you put with a web pack,

116
00:08:40.026 --> 00:08:44.769
or something that checks everything
you have and makes a list.

117
00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:49.448
On HTTP there is no other way to
know all the assets that the website

118
00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:50.735
will need later.

119
00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:51.851
We don't know, right?

120
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:54.014
So it's a manual list.

121
00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:58.316
So anyway, here we can take advantage
of what we see in the console, and

122
00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:02.784
I think that there are two [INAUDIBLE]
files we need, this one and this one.

123
00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:09.404
So, That one,

124
00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:12.146
and the other one.

125
00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:15.642
Their solution is instead
of using the CDM for

126
00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:21.622
fonts is to download all the files, and
serve everything from your project,

127
00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:25.958
so you can have more control okay,
of what's going on.

128
00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.910
And images logo PNG,
that wasn't available for

129
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.940
some reason, let me see why?

130
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:40.057
Your images and the icon, since like
there is an image icons, icon PNG.

131
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:45.106
Also there is requesting,
Icons, icon PNG, and

132
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:51.779
I think this is logo SVG, the one I'm
using a non PNG, that's why wasn't there.

133
00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:56.227
So one more time, we swap these settings,

134
00:09:56.227 --> 00:10:01.293
refresh, and now we do that again,
I'm going to

135
00:10:01.293 --> 00:10:06.498
offline refreshing and
ooh what happened there?

136
00:10:06.498 --> 00:10:08.358
It seems like we have an error.

137
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:11.259
So, go to the console,

138
00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:17.217
it failed to fetch the service worker,
see why?

139
00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.664
I will try again.

140
00:10:19.664 --> 00:10:23.638
They didn't reload, we have an error?

141
00:10:23.638 --> 00:10:28.341
No, I'm not saving a slash order.

142
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:33.624
Because this is a single page application,
I'm saying me not only forward slash.

143
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.902
Make sense?

144
00:10:37.902 --> 00:10:45.856
So be honest do I need
to serve all my routes?

145
00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:50.282
Typically you can add that
behavior in the service worker.

146
00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:54.729
So, I'm talking about this,
in the fetch, okay?

147
00:10:54.729 --> 00:10:57.801
When you are here, you check the URL.

148
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:06.711
If the URL is order,
you know you need to return forward slash.

149
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.845
Okay?

150
00:11:09.845 --> 00:11:15.081
So then you respond with
a fetch to forward slash, or

151
00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:22.230
you go to the cache and search for
forward slash, not for order, okay?

152
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.247
That's how you solve the problem.

153
00:11:24.247 --> 00:11:28.571
But anyway, in my case,
let's try forward slash, and

154
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:33.358
let's see, we are offline,
we will refresh, and it works.

155
00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:36.020
So now our app, it works.

156
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.877
And I can install the app,
I need to be online for that?

157
00:11:41.877 --> 00:11:49.150
If I install my app, my PWA,
I now have a full screen app for

158
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:55.103
Coffee Masters on my Mac,
that look like this.

159
00:11:55.103 --> 00:11:59.396
And it appears in the Alt tab as
Coffee Masters, and it works offline.

160
00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:04.268
And it works on Android.

161
00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:09.125
It works on iOS as well,
even if you're offline.

162
00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:14.846
So we used IndexedDB to store the menu,
and also the order.

163
00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:20.040
And we use the cache storage to store
all the assets from the app shell,

164
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.782
and also to store the images, okay?

165
00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.894
And they're being served
from the service worker.
