00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.373
My name is Maximiliano, I can go by Max.

2
00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:04.866
This is going to be browser data storage.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:09.238
So we have a full day talking
about how to store, retrieve and

4
00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:12.347
manage data client-side in the browser.

5
00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:15.739
So that's for websites, web apps, PWAs,

6
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.624
even hybrid apps in case you are doing
still phone gap apps, electron apps.

7
00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:26.992
So we're going to cover the modern
APIs available for that.

8
00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:29.210
So really quickly,
I'm a mobile web developer.

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.363
So I have been doing web
development since forever and

10
00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:37.922
mobile apps since 2001,okay?

11
00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:38.970
I'm from Argentina.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.559
So I came from Buenos Aires,
that's my home.

13
00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.266
And in this topic, so
I've been as I was saying, since forever,

14
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:52.061
since 1996 I started doing websites,
designing websites and

15
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.420
of course JavaScript
like almost after that.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.601
I authored 13 books on the topic, okay?

17
00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:02.209
And the latest one is available for

18
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:06.569
free at web.dev/learn/learn/pwa.

19
00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:13.897
In terms of web apps, so
I published around 160 different web apps.

20
00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:19.709
I'm talking about a whole range
of web apps across two decades.

21
00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.759
I'm talking about web apps for
mobile devices such as Blackberry,

22
00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.313
Symbian, if you have heard about that,
okay?

23
00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:30.138
But also for iOS, for iPads, so

24
00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:33.721
talking about web apps that
are published on the web today, but

25
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:38.673
also web apps that were actually published
on different stores, even 15 years ago.

26
00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:43.522
I'm saying this because I have been
playing with data storage since then.

27
00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:51.238
Because doing web apps was actually
a way to use these API's a lot.

28
00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:56.396
So I have all that experience to talk
about what happened with those APIs,

29
00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:01.732
which APIs are still useful and
which API's we shouldn't be using, okay?

30
00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:05.972
So, today we are not going to
cover all the APIs available, but

31
00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:08.779
the APIs that you should be using, okay?

32
00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.638
And we will see why also.

33
00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:14.057
So, directly into the topic.

34
00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:17.142
We're going to cover first
the state of browser storage.

35
00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:21.871
So we're going to see right now,
which APIs are actually not

36
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:26.242
a good idea to use,
even if they are still there, okay?

37
00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:28.593
So we're going to talk
about debugging tools.

38
00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:33.578
So all the tools that we have available
today on browsers to work with data

39
00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:34.321
storage.

40
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:39.216
But lets talk about something that
typically we don't think too much about or

41
00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.335
we don't know what's going on.

42
00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:44.372
It seems like a mystery, that's Quotas.

43
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:49.013
So, how does that work in
terms of how much data is

44
00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:52.647
possible to store in a web app, okay?

45
00:02:52.647 --> 00:02:55.194
Client-side, we are always
talking about client-side here.

46
00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:58.838
Of course in the cloud you can do
wherever you want because you don't have

47
00:02:58.838 --> 00:02:59.804
any restriction.

48
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.656
We'll talk about persistence as well.

49
00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.785
So, what happens with our data,

50
00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.676
what's the life cycle of the data
that we are going to store?

51
00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.572
And in terms of workshop and
playing with the real app,

52
00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:16.890
adding some code on it,
we are going to talk a little bit about

53
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.231
web storage that probably you
know as local storage, okay?

54
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:26.233
IndexedDB, the caches storage API,
and the file system API.

55
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:31.427
So those are the four APIs that
we will cover deeply, okay?

56
00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:32.885
So, pre-requisites.

57
00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:37.533
So I think I'm assuming that
you know JavaScript, so

58
00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.543
plain JavaScript with promises.

59
00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:45.188
So ES 2017 kind of if you are there,
that's okay.

60
00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:47.944
We are not going to use any library or
any framework,

61
00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:50.143
we are not going to use any package share.

62
00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:53.962
We are just going to write plain
JavaScript so you can actually apply

63
00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:58.530
everything that we are going to learn to
any library, to TypeScript if you want.

64
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.350
So everything will be
compatible with just the web.

65
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.511
So whatever library you're using,

66
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:07.146
you can still apply what we're
going to learn today, right?

67
00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:14.437
And on that URL, firtman, that's my
last name, .github.io/browser-storage,

68
00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:20.062
you have a step by step instructions
of what we are going to do today.

69
00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:24.515
Including a PDF version of the slides that
I have here in case you wanna download

70
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.768
the slides and follow along,
you have the slides there.

71
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.763
And also the project that I will give you
in a second, you have the link there to

72
00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:35.038
clone the repo and then we will
start coding with that project.
