00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.950
We have an exercise here.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.630
This one starts to get
a little bit harder.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.086
So if folks are struggling with it,
there's like absolutely no problem with

4
00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:13.620
just waiting until we go over
the whole thing together.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.460
But this is like a really
cool opportunity.

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.106
I would just suggest to at least play
around with the Performance tab and

7
00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:21.505
start looking at it.

8
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:23.980
So the [LAUGH] idea is it's
about layout thrashing.

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.890
Well, we've been talking about it's
about page jank, and things like that.

10
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.005
So you can see right now, we've got these
ten little Frontend Masters logos, and

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.759
they're just animating around,
on the screen here.

12
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:35.740
And they're really smooth,
at least for my screen.

13
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.390
They're very smooth.

14
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.282
And as you start adding more,
and more, and more,

15
00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:45.010
I have a very new laptop, but, it gets to
the point where they're very not smooth.

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.291
I'm not sure how it's coming in, but like
on my screen, they're like very jittery.

17
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.210
And so,
this is a kind of a multi part task.

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.670
I'm going to remove
some sort of back down.

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.064
So the first one is to make it jittery,
keep adding 10 or

20
00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.190
100 until it gets jittery.

21
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.330
And when it's jittery,
like we'll add a couple like this,

22
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.150
we'll open up the dev tools.

23
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.377
We'll go to performance and we'll
record like just one second, let's say.

24
00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:09.626
So another like tip for

25
00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:14.048
when you're doing the recordings is
there's a lot of information to process.

26
00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:17.769
So the shorter that you can keep
your recordings to the better.

27
00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:22.278
If you try to record like 10 or
15 seconds of stuff, you'll just have way

28
00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:26.869
too much data it'll take too long to
parse, and it'll be too much to look at.

29
00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.390
So the exercise here is to get
it to the point where it's

30
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.142
janking to do a performance
recording on it.

31
00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:39.520
And then we'll want to one, look at
all the ways that Dev Tools tells you.

32
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.984
There's page jank, which I'm sort of kind
of giving away here with like these big

33
00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:45.673
red bars and things like that.

34
00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.980
So that's one,
see if we can figure that out.

35
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.145
And then the other thing is, can you
figure out from just the main thread view,

36
00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:55.815
what function is causing the page jank?

37
00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.310
Just to look at, read through it,
scroll up and down.

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.770
One thing I should mention is
navigating is a little bit tricky here.

39
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.781
So let me go back and record again.

40
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.230
So I'll just record for
one second and stop it.

41
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.019
So we're just gonna be
looking in the main thread.

42
00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.680
But navigating is really hard to do.

43
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.569
So if you scroll like up and down,

44
00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.030
you'll see that it doesn't
actually move you up and down.

45
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.183
It moves you like you're zooming in.

46
00:02:19.183 --> 00:02:21.030
I don't know if you can
see these bars up here.

47
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.435
So as what I would think would
scroll me down actually zooms in and

48
00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.750
zooms out over a specific section of time.

49
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.943
And so what you'll wanna do if you wanna
actually scroll up and down, like here or

50
00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:36.582
something like that, you'll wanna
hold Shift while you scroll, and

51
00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:39.870
that'll allow you to actually move up and
down the call stack.

52
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.020
So you can see this whole thing,
this is the whole second of me running.

53
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.403
You can zoom in on a little bit.

54
00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:51.150
We should be able to see what
type of stuff was happening here.

55
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.640
This is on the optimized example still,
but there's only ten of them.

56
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.400
But you can see that the frames per second
are high, they're looking pretty good.

57
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.915
You can see that there's a lot of free
time, that's those slashes through, and

58
00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:03.398
the time that is spent it
looks like it's spent between,

59
00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:05.800
if we go back to this summary,
and drag it up.

60
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.699
Between scripting and rendering
looks like it's pretty evenly spent.

61
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.734
So the idea here will be to
do the exact same thing, but

62
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:16.523
after you've hit add 100 enough times so
that there's actual jank happening and

63
00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:18.960
take a look at how different it looks.

64
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.308
How you can identify that there's
definitely a problem here and

65
00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:26.214
see if you can kind of figure out just
by peeking around in this main thread,

66
00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:29.688
what tasks are happening when
the page jank is starting to happen?
