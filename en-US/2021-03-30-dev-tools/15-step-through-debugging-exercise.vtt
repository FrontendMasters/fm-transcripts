00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me walk through the exercise itself.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:12.940
So there's an unordered list here on this
exercise debugging called ul ID catfacts.

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.928
So if we inspect the DOM and
we go to elements and

4
00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:18.650
we go inside the article inside div.

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.912
We can see here this
ul of ID of catfacts.

6
00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:26.776
And what's supposed to be happening,
we have this file public

7
00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.630
exercises debugging.js in our
repo exercises debugging.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.660
So here it is.

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.890
So what's supposed to be happening is
it's fetching this API of catfacts.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.050
It's calling to JSON on,
then it's taking the results.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.810
It's going through each of them.

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.250
And it's making a new list item and
appending it, but something's wrong.

13
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.307
So what we're supposed to be seeing here
under here is a list of facts about cats

14
00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:53.850
is a list of facts about cats.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.110
But something's going wrong with it.

16
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.954
And so the idea is to start with
the console, see if there's any errors and

17
00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:02.496
then from there,
put a step through debugger and

18
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.940
and figure out what's going wrong and
and how to fix it.

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.770
And so that's the exercise.

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.330
Before we get started do we
have any other questions on it?

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.540
And again, we'll meet back afterwards and
we'll go through the whole thing together.

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.560
So the question is, you use the debugger
and you end up with a lot of breakpoints,

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.190
how can you get rid of a bunch of them,
I don't know off the top of my head.

24
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.150
So let me let me get in this console
log here and see if I can find it.

25
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.020
So let us see we have a bunch of them.

26
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.620
So it is so you have them all in
multiple files, everything like that.

27
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.550
So you can't do it from here.

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.400
You can come over to the sidebar
with the break points over here.

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.833
Then you can right click on one and remove
all breakpoints, and that'll get rid of

30
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.766
all of them from all the files and
then you just hit play one more time and

31
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.790
it'll play through with
no more breakpoints.
