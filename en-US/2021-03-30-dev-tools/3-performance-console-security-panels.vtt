WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.888
All right, performance.

2
00:00:01.888 --> 00:00:05.936
So, I [LAUGH] had sent out a tweet
a while ago about what people would love

3
00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:09.986
to learn more about web dev tools and
like pretty much across the board I

4
00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:13.050
got that people are scared
of the performance tab.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.140
That's like a very [LAUGH] common
response that I found from people.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.620
But it's really not that scary,
but it is very, very powerful.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.960
For a little bit of context,
it used to be two different tabs.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.170
They've kind of combined into one,
and it has a lot of data.

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.688
And so, the kind of high level view of how
to use this is you go to the Performance

10
00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:33.959
tab, you click on this record button.

11
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:37.655
You interact with the site, doing anything
you want, and then you click stop.

12
00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:42.125
Some top level advice is to keep your
recordings as small as possible so

13
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.842
they keep you from being overwhelmed
with like ten seconds worth of data.

14
00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:51.042
So, I usually, if I'm nervous about like
filling in a form, I'll click Record,

15
00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.230
fill in the form quickly and click stop.

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.640
Try to keep it contained
as much as possible.

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.980
You can also deselect things
depending on what you're looking at.

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.080
So, right now I have memory
showing down in this section.

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.780
Let's say I'm not concerned with
memory right now, I can just hide it.

20
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.480
I also have the same screenshots from the
Network tab, which can be really useful.

21
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.267
You're seeing how your JavaScript
causes stuff to render, but

22
00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.218
if you're not looking for it at the time,
you can just deselect it.

23
00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:18.944
And so, what you'll kind of be left
with here is a little bit of showing how

24
00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:21.470
the website painted itself over time.

25
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.280
So, this is your frames per
second across the very top.

26
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.030
And this is the CPU
usage across the bottom.

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.930
And then, you'll see all these
different frames down here.

28
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.480
So, you can see almost everything
is gonna happen in the main thread.

29
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.679
But you can see stuff like when it's
rasterizing, when it's using the GPU,

30
00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.480
all those different things.

31
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.850
We'll have a full lesson on performance
auditing and stuff like that.

32
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.921
But the basic idea is you hit Record, you
do something that you're worried about,

33
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:47.300
and then you hit Stop.

34
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.050
And you can come in here and
you can look for like, is there page jank?

35
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.660
Like is it lagging?

36
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.740
What's the main thread doing?

37
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.659
How busy is it?

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.880
What's the memory usage?

39
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.100
Or what's my CPU usage?

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.460
Is it getting too high?

41
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.180
All sorts of things like that.

42
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.383
I think it's best to come in here
with a specific question in mind,

43
00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:06.850
that also helps reduce how
overwhelming it can be.

44
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.920
So, it'd be like, I really wanna
know if I have a memory leak.

45
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.100
That's what I care about.

46
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.580
So, you can turn on the memory,
you can do your thing and you can look for

47
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.720
a memory leak and we'll do that
in the appropriate section too.

48
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.450
Console, probably the most popular one.

49
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.450
It's really cool, it's a JavaScript grepl.

50
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.010
So, you can type stuff like
console.log('hi'), and it'll type hi.

51
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.730
You could do var foo = 'foo',
and it'll save that.

52
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.773
And then later, you can do foo.

53
00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:37.750
That's pretty straightforward.

54
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.300
Anytime you put a console log in
your code, it'll log out here.

55
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.890
But there's also some really
other cool things you can do.

56
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.783
Like for an example,
you can go into the elements tab, and

57
00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:51.990
you can find an element like let's say
this article, you can click on it.

58
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.960
Then you go back into the console tab and
you can do dollar sign zero.

59
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.931
And dollar sign zero is a shortcode for

60
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:00.670
whatever I last clicked
on in the elements tab.

61
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.840
So, if you hit enter, you can see it
brings this article into the console.

62
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.576
So, now if I wanted to manipulate it,
like I could do,

63
00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:12.166
addEventListener, click or
something like that.

64
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.529
You can take an element from the elements
tab, you can bring it into the console,

65
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.620
you can mess with it there,
which is pretty cool.

66
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800
All right, next is the Security tab.

67
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.250
Again, this one's pretty straightforward.

68
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.840
It just gives you an overview
on the security for your page.

69
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.722
So, it is the de facto standard these days
that all sites should load over HTTPS.

70
00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:36.306
There's all these really cool resources,
like Let's Encrypt,

71
00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:39.080
which gives you Just
free SSL certificates.

72
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.470
And so if you go to any website and
you click any open dev tools and

73
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.980
click on the security,
it'll give you an overview.

74
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.883
And the reason that there's
an overview is one, it'll tell you

75
00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:50.506
if the actual index dot HTML file, like
the main request was served over HTTPS.

76
00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:54.569
But it'll also tell you if any subsequent
requests were served over HTTP,

77
00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.240
which can be insecure.

78
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.022
So, you could have a fully secure site,
and then you add like an embed for

79
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.710
a video or something like that.

80
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.150
And that might be over HTTP,
which still leaves you vulnerable.

81
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.650
So this is cool.

82
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.630
Basically, on the high level, you want
to open it and you want to see green.

83
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.690
That's what you want.

84
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.930
If you open it and you see green,
everything's good.

85
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.564
If you see any orange or red, it'll
give you appropriate instructions for

86
00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:17.040
why it's doing that.

87
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.480
It also lets you view the SSL certificate
itself if you have any reason to be

88
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.420
viewing that.
