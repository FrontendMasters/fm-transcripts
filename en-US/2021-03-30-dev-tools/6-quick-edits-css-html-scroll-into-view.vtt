WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.603
It's worth noting that there's a really
cool feature that the DevTools offer.

2
00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:08.075
Which is if you own an Android device like
an Android tablet or an Android phone,

3
00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.677
you can actually plug it
into your computer and

4
00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.632
you can test your local apps
on that Android device.

5
00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:15.465
It's not covered in this course but

6
00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.957
I do have a link to a really good doc
on how to get that set up and going.

7
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:22.899
That can be really good because, I think
we've all seen it before where we use

8
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.980
an emulator or like we control the screen
to the right size and it looks perfect.

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.168
And then it actually gets out on a user's
device and it's not quite the same,

10
00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.150
they render a little bit differently.

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.200
So being able to render your web
app on a real android phone or

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.281
Android device can be really valuable.

13
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:40.400
And a lot of big companies will
have device labs of some sort.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.640
Well, they have a bunch of old phones and
stuff like that.

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.810
So that can be really good.

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.780
So quick edits, I'm going to go ahead and
open my DevTools again.

17
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.020
And this time, I'm gonna pin them
back down to the bottom of my screen.

18
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.450
So we've kind of seen this one already.

19
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.150
We can go ahead and
we can edit any CSS we want.

20
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.760
So if we wanna change like
the font color to red,

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.579
or if we want to change the font family.

22
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.876
Let me change this back to black so
you can read it,

23
00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:12.310
I'm gonna change the font family
to Arial or something like that.

24
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.190
Anything we do over here
will get reflected here.

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.310
We can add new CSS rules.

26
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.872
So I did show this already a little bit,
but you can click this plus and

27
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.540
you can make any rule you want.

28
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.250
So you could do body nav or
something like that.

29
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.040
Or you could do a new ID of foo or
a class of foo.

30
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.350
You can do anything like that.

31
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.040
You can edit the HTML.

32
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.821
So we saw in the beginning that you
can edit the tags by double clicking,

33
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.250
you can edit the ID by double clicking.

34
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.350
You can even edit the content
here though by double clicking.

35
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.522
So if we scroll up to the top here,
I can change, Hello world, and

36
00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:50.340
I can hit enter on that,
and that'll change.

37
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.875
You can even for sometimes because
you'll have a lot of content,

38
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.300
you can right click on it and
you can click Edit as HTML.

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.120
And that will take the current element and

40
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.360
it will give you this like
really nice text editor.

41
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.096
So maybe that's more comfortable and
you can move around, add new lines,

42
00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:04.800
things like that.

43
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.933
Depending on what you wanna do.

44
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:12.410
Scroll into view is one
of my favorite ones.

45
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.970
So I work on a lot of infinite
scrolling applications, right?

46
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940
And they get really long.

47
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.194
And sometimes we'll have a bug, I'll be
able to use the DevTools to figure out

48
00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:28.740
which, let's say we're working on Twitter,
or we've got 100 tweets on the screen.

49
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.360
And I can figure out the ID of the tweet.

50
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.460
That's a problem, but
I don't know where it is yet.

51
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.428
So for an example,
I'll use this inspector and

52
00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:39.380
I'll click on the Scroll into view,
list item.

53
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.030
And so here I have it in DevTools.

54
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.316
So if I was to scroll all way down and
I really wanted to mess with it,

55
00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:49.223
I can hover on it and I know this is
subtle unfortunately can't make it larger.

56
00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:55.360
But, let me move to a clear area,
when you hover on it, it will either show.

57
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.099
If you put your eye up here,
where my mouse is,

58
00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.262
it will show either a little arrow
saying the items above where we are.

59
00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:04.521
Or if I was to go too far and hover on it,

60
00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:09.540
you'll get another little arrow here
saying the items below where we are.

61
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.311
So this used to be the best way we had
to deal with it as you would hover it in

62
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:14.360
DevTools and
you would listen to the instructions.

63
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.958
You scroll a little bit.

64
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.980
It's still low, you'd scroll
a little bit like I went too far.

65
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.360
It's high now, all that.

66
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.443
But now what we can do, let's say we're
all the way at the bottom of the page is

67
00:03:22.443 --> 00:03:24.720
we can right click on a DevTool.

68
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.220
And then click Scroll into view.

69
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.665
And it'll actually move the view part
right around the element that we have,

70
00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:31.210
which can be really helpful.

71
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.505
Again, if you work on either just long or
infinite scrolling websites.

72
00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:40.060
Console shortcuts, so
I did cover $0 already.

73
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.630
So if you click on an item and
you go into the Console New $0,

74
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.320
it also keeps some history.

75
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.690
So we clicked on article,
then we'll click on nav.

76
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.131
So if we go back to the console
$0 has now become nav,

77
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:54.220
that's the thing that we
clicked on most recently.

78
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.990
But $1 will stay article.

79
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.148
So it goes back through three so

80
00:03:57.148 --> 00:04:00.320
you can kind of keep some history of the
different elements that you're working on.

81
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.910
You can hide and show elements,
which is kind of cool.

82
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.330
So if I scroll up to this, Hello World,
and I hit h it will hide or

83
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.800
show the element, this can be really nice
when you're kind of doing some design.

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.730
You wanna move some stuff around, but the
text is in the way or something like that.

85
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.350
You can hide it.

86
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.214
You can also, there's just times
where you can just right click and

87
00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.960
just delete the item, right?

88
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.330
And that will actually
take it out of the DOM.

89
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.360
So you notice the difference.

90
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.750
Let me refresh the page.

91
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.531
When I go to this h1, and
I hit h, it sets it to display or

92
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:34.560
visibility hidden, which means it stays so
the space around it stays.

93
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.530
But when I either hit the delete key or
right click delete,

94
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.329
it actually plucks it from the DOM and
the DOM adjusts.

95
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.170
Refresh again.

96
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.900
You can simulate state.

97
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.960
This is another cool one.

98
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.186
So if we take this and we go find one
of my links like this Quick Edits, so

99
00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:51.110
we've got Quick Edits down here.

100
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.301
You can click this colon hov and

101
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:59.570
you can simulate a lot of different state
like hover active focus, all these things.

102
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.989
This is really funny because
I pair program a lot and

103
00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.830
sometimes I'll be pairing with someone
who's working on a hover state.

104
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.810
And they'll be like doing like this,
like they'll be hovering over it.

105
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.390
And then they'll be looking down here
in the style section trying to see

106
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.130
what's changing.

107
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.600
So you can really just put
the hover state on it.

108
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.869
And now I can fully see what hover
CSS is applied and I can edit it.
