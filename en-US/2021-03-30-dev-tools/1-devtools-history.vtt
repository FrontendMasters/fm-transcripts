1
00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:04.604
So this is the first section
called the introduction.

2
00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:07.596
And what we're gonna learn in this is
the history of the browser DevTools.

3
00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:11.566
We're gonna take a little bit of a walk
down memory lane or maybe not for

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.451
the younger folks watching, but

5
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.831
what it was like interacting
with the DOM in the early days.

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.633
And then we're gonna kind of cover the
groups that I think this course is really

7
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:22.735
best to benefit.

8
00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.611
So again,
this is an introduction course, so

9
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.728
we assume very little
knowledge of the DevTools.

10
00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.408
So if we start at the very beginning,
the way to open the DevTools,

11
00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:36.375
you have kind of two options,
keyboard shortcuts or using your mouse.

12
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:40.185
And so you can right click on any website,
and you can click Inspect,

13
00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.745
and it'll open this, typically,
it starts as a bottom panel.

14
00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:47.265
You can also use keyboard shortcuts,
I've got two of them here,

15
00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:49.953
so you can use Command+Option+C
on your Mac, or

16
00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:53.859
Control+Option+C does the exact
same thing, it opens the DevTools.

17
00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.528
So we get these open and we have this
thing that we're looking at, typically,

18
00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:02.235
depending on the keyboard shortcut
user on the elements tab.

19
00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:05.778
And one of the ways that I like to start
this off is by having people just think

20
00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:08.984
for a second about, if you had to
describe what are you seeing here,

21
00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.408
how would you describe that?

22
00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:13.825
And it's interesting because I feel
like a lot of people, and this is not

23
00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:17.925
a wrong answer, but a lot of people say,
you're looking at HTML and CSS, right?

24
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.611
I mean,
that's kind of what you're looking at.

25
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:21.543
But the reason that I think it's so

26
00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:24.751
interesting is cuz it's not
necessarily true, right?

27
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.663
It is HTML and CSS for sure,
I'm not gonna argue that,

28
00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:31.826
margin zero is CSS so
that a body tag is HTML.

29
00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:37.729
But you're really looking at this fully
parsed browser rendered DOM, right?

30
00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.662
If you think about looking at raw HTML,
you would have a very hard time clicking

31
00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:46.864
on the body and learning that it
had background color of this gray.

32
00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:49.414
Because you'd have to look at the body,

33
00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:52.870
then you'd have to search
your code base for some CSS.

34
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.951
And you'd have to look at see if
there was any body tags and all that.

35
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.679
So this is not source code, this is after
the source code has been sent down,

36
00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.294
the browser has done all its work and
we're gonna get into what that work is

37
00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:05.243
later, and this fully interactive
DOM is what we get here.

38
00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:10.364
And that's an important distinction
because, back in the day, we didn't have

39
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:15.351
this cool fully interactive DOM, we
literally did have just the HTML and CSS.

40
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.667
And so, this screen still exists,
if you right click on your browser, and

41
00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:22.695
instead of going to Inspect,
you View Page Source.

42
00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:24.724
And so, if you view the page source,

43
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:28.466
you actually get the text content
that gets sent down with the page.

44
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:32.495
So here's my CSS which is in line,
and then here's my HTML down here.

45
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:36.552
And so, this is interesting, you could
still kind of poke around at it or

46
00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:40.158
you could copy it all and
put it into an ID or something like that.

47
00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:43.800
But, one of the big things that used
to be super painful back in the day,

48
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.136
was like let's say that you wanna check
something's value in JavaScript, right?

49
00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:51.516
That's something we all do, probably all
the time, we're like, wait a minute,

50
00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:54.921
this link isn't working, what's the value
of link right now or what is foo equal.

51
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.592
So what we used to do back in the day
was with a lot of stuff [LAUGH], and

52
00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.554
some people haven't even
messed with alert before.

53
00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:06.248
So, if I right click and open up the
DevTools, and I go to the Console tab, and

54
00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:10.891
I type alert, hi, this used to be the
thing back in the day, and I hit Enter.

55
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:14.544
You'll see you get this browser rendered
thing at the top of your screen that

56
00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:15.127
says, hi.

57
00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.967
So this is pretty cool and at first
it kinda looks like, okay, I get it,

58
00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:23.145
it's like Console log, but it comes on
the top of the screen, that's fine.

59
00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.433
But alert has a lot of limitations,
for an example,

60
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:30.392
if you are to go back in the DevTools
again, and go to console and

61
00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:35.511
you were try alert anything that's not
a primitive, like let's say an object.

62
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:40.461
So I do name, and we make this a little
bigger, name, Jon, and I tried to alert

63
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:45.791
that you'll see I don't get named Jon, I
get this two string version of the object.

64
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.219
So, it says alert Object Object.

65
00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.986
And so, the thing that we used to have to
do back in the day if we wanted to read

66
00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:56.625
the values of an object, was we would
put them in a loop, like a for loop.

67
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:59.377
And then we would log out each key and
value, and we'd alert each one of those.

68
00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:03.182
And so, then you'd reload the site and it
would get like an alert, and you click OK,

69
00:04:03.182 --> 00:04:05.281
OK, OK,
until the whole thing went through.

70
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:08.961
And so, the DevTools offering
this interactive DOM,

71
00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:13.521
this ability to console log complex
statements and complex types,

72
00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:17.687
like objects and arrays,
is a really gigantic improvement.

73
00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:22.151
So, yeah, back in the day we're working,
we have view page source, we have alert,

74
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.383
those are kind of our tools for debugging.

75
00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:28.310
And then this really cool tool comes
out Hexie's Live Dom Viewer, so

76
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.419
I'm gonna open this in another tab.

77
00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.036
So this was like, you can kind of
see it's actually quite similar,

78
00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:35.505
in a sense to the DevTools.

79
00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:40.295
But this was this really great tool,
we're able to do things, like make an h1

80
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:48.667
Hello world, and we're able to see not
only the markup, but we're able to see

81
00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:52.983
what the DOM is, and we're able to see
a preview of it, all in real time.

82
00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:56.217
It was like [LAUGH] this is really mind
blowing tooI, I know it's something that

83
00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:58.668
we take for granted nowadays,
but it was this great thing.

84
00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:01.575
So you could grab that view source,
and you could put it in here, and

85
00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:05.048
then you could actually start looking at
the DOM structure, what it looks like.

86
00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:07.533
All these different things you can mess
with it and see updates in real time.

87
00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:11.883
So that was great, and then and
this is like a very old school,

88
00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:14.654
this tool came out, Firefox Firebug.

89
00:05:14.654 --> 00:05:20.020
And it was the very first built in
browser extension that was a DevTool.

90
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.975
And one of the things I always
like to point out is that,

91
00:05:22.975 --> 00:05:27.281
if you use your imagination a little bit,
this thing that came out, whatever,

92
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:29.677
20 plus years ago or something like that.

93
00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:31.981
It doesn't look too different
than what we have today, right?

94
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.118
I mean, if you look at this, you've
got your HTML structure over here and

95
00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:38.738
you've got the corresponding
CSS over here.

96
00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.878
We've kind of moved things around and
all that but, essentially,

97
00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:47.540
Firebug comes out and sets this gold
standard for development experience.

98
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.485
There's a ton of stuff I can't do,
of course, cuz it's a long time ago, but

99
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:55.465
this was a giant change in how people
built and edited and debugged websites.

100
00:05:55.465 --> 00:06:00.226
And so, Firebug was this incredible tool,
kind of first of its kind,

101
00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:04.922
and a few years ago back in 2016,
they officially sunsetted it.

102
00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:07.362
A lot of the core got
moved into Firefox itself,

103
00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:11.576
Firefox comes with its own DevTools now,
but it was sort of this big moment for us.

104
00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:15.262
Where we had all of a sudden
our efficiency sped up,

105
00:06:15.262 --> 00:06:19.225
like a hundredfold and
we could debug complex things.

106
00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.618
And we could just do,
all this stuff that we couldn't do before,

107
00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:22.673
that's a really cool tool.

108
00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:26.240
And I was very sad when it got sunset
just cuz it's kind of the end of an era.
