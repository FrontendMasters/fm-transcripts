00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.560
We're gonna move right
into another exercise.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.650
This one's on workspaces.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.294
Again, we'll take like 15 minutes to
work on it or, but I'll be here for

4
00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:11.380
any questions that people have.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.750
So, the idea here,
there's full instructions.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.355
So you'll want and let me go
through the instructions live and

7
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.160
then you all can try it.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.526
So the idea here is I'm
gonna go to my node app,

9
00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.360
which is running this local thing.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.330
I'm going to kill it for now.

11
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.070
And then what we have let me open
my finder to my Dev Tools repo.

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.932
So we have this workspace folder here, and

13
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:39.620
this just very simply has an HTML,
JavaScript and CSS file.

14
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.090
And so we want to do two things.

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.250
One, I wanna open the index.html
file with Google Chrome.

16
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.200
So I right clicked on it and clicked open.

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.050
And that you can see it's
opening like a file, not a HTTP.

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.060
So it's opening this file and it should
look like this, this little to do list.

19
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.000
And then the second thing we'll wanna do
is we'll want to open up the Dev tools,

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.440
inspect here, go to sources.

21
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.360
And again, these are all
written down step by step here.

22
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.510
So we want to go to source and then I'll
go back to my finder my file system.

23
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.280
I'll grab this whole
workspace folder here.

24
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.863
And I'm just gonna drag
it on to the sources, and

25
00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:17.580
it should change into this thing.

26
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.991
And so the two things we're doing are one,
we're opening the index file in Chrome,

27
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.950
and then we're dragging our source
code for it onto the sources tab.

28
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.199
And that should prompt this little
warning up at the top saying hey,

29
00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:31.600
Dev Tools wants to access
your local file system.

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.120
Is that what you really want?

31
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.600
And we'll say yes allow.

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.730
And when those steps are done, you should
see that the workspace is synced by over

33
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.390
here in the left, you should see these
little green icons next to each one.

34
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.730
So again, so kill the current node app.

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.931
Go to your sources panel,
go to your Windows Explorer or

36
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.247
your finder if you're on Mac and get
the project and open its index.html and

37
00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:58.552
then go back a level and
grab the whole workspace folder and

38
00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:02.220
drag it into the sources panel
here should prompt you with this.

39
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.420
Do you want to allow you say yes and then
you should see these things all green.

40
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.700
And if you have any questions,
let me know when it is set up.

41
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.792
I have a couple of little things these
little To Do List tasks that you can do

42
00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:16.720
and what you should be able to see.

43
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.334
For example,
if I go into my style.CSS, and

44
00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:26.200
at the same time I go into my Real ID,
and I open my workspace style.CSS.

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.157
So these are the same file wrapper you can
see, I should be able to make a change

46
00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:35.885
here, like height 100 pixels and
then hit Command S to save or Ctrl S and

47
00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:40.870
then go back here and actually see the
real file has changed on my file system.

48
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.070
That's what we're going for there.

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.015
So again, the setup is kind of
the part that I really want you to get

50
00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:48.900
the experience with.

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.590
So, yeah, opening that new file,
then taking the folder and dragging

52
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.463
it into the Sources tab, and if you
want to play around with the exercises,

53
00:02:56.463 --> 00:03:00.900
awesome, but the setup and getting it
to actually persist is the big thing.

54
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.860
&gt;&gt; Can we save the changes in
Sources panel html.css.javascript?

55
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.580
Sometimes it doesn't work.

56
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.302
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if it's sinking,
like if it's green, and

57
00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:15.080
it says that it's linked,
then it should absolutely work.

58
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.898
But yes, sometimes they can get into,
I've seen him get into a weird

59
00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:23.380
state before I used to be
a lot more problematic.

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.972
So, if you run into any problems, what
I would do is I would on the left here,

61
00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.710
go to the File System tab.

62
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.040
Then I would right click on the folder and
remove it from the workspace entirely.

63
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.093
Say Yes, I'd like to get rid of it and

64
00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:40.401
then I would just start over again just
take the thing and drag it back in here,

65
00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:44.810
click Allow over here and
it should go all all green like that.

66
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.960
So you can see here I got into a weird
state because I had an existing at it.

67
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.930
Saved when I deleted it and
grabbed it all over again.

68
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.910
And so again,
like I would just go in here, remove it.

69
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.280
Okay close this out so it's not still with
active changes, drag it back in here.

70
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.410
Allow, and now they're all green again so
if they're green they're persisting.
