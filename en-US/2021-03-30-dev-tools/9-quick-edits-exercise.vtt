1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.090
This is the first exercise.

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.420
And this is all about the quick
edits that we just learned.

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.880
So it's to take this actual page here.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.750
And can you change this from
an ordered list to an unordered list?

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.590
Clicking on this link
,makes a pop up here.

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.019
But can you find the JavaScript that
calls this event, and then the third,

7
00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.210
one's like a little bit of a quiz,
but there's a way to cheat.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910
And like I said,
dev tools helps you level up.

9
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.333
So I have a button and
when you click the button,

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.850
this block quote gets rendered, right?

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.813
And it gets rendered with this class,
this ID and this inline style and

12
00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:38.312
I also have CSS on the page, which has
an element selector, a class selector and

13
00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.600
an ID selector with important.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.920
And so the question on CSS specificity
is can you guess what color it will be?

15
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.888
But the dev tools cheat is let's say
you forgotten all the specificity stuff

16
00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:50.630
already.

17
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.669
Can you use dev tools that actually
view what color it'll be before it gets

18
00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:54.610
rendered to the DOM?

19
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.550
And then the last one is there's
a whole big list full of cards here.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.251
And when we wanna do is we wanna find
the border color of the one with an ID of

21
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:04.652
12345678.

22
00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:07.891
And so can you use the dev
tools to put in that ID and

23
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:11.380
actually get to that card and
view the border color.
