1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.066
Then we'll cover the Lighthouse tab.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.880
This one's great.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.593
This has been kind of
a cool story to watch.

4
00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:08.190
So years ago, Chrome came out
with this idea of Lighthouse.

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.694
It used to have an audit tab,

6
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:13.606
which kind of did similar things that
came out of this idea of Lighthouse.

7
00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.490
It's like fully open source.

8
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.576
It's contributed to by all these great
people and it's just cool rules for,

9
00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:23.904
your site should have a first
paint in this much time.

10
00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:28.360
Or if you say it's a progressive web app,
it should work offline.

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.957
Or if it should be accessible for
people with disabilities or

12
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:36.979
you should be taking advantage of Google's
SEO recommendations, all this stuff.

13
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.328
So they came out with this
idea of Lighthouse and

14
00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:41.043
it used to live on its own website.

15
00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:44.021
And so
in my last time teaching this course,

16
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.970
I was use the audit if it's a local site.

17
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.632
And if it's not a local site,
go to Lighthouse and use Lighthouse.

18
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.580
Lighthouse is awesome.

19
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.139
But now Lighthouse is fully integrated
with the dev tools itself, which is great.

20
00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.470
So you can do it all on a local site.

21
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.210
Just to explain what I mean by that.

22
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.185
If you have a great site like web page
test is one of the best ways of like

23
00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:05.770
analyzing your site, but
you have to a URL and hid it, right?

24
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.706
So if you haven't published your app yet,
you can't use that website to measure it.

25
00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:13.941
So the dev tools are great, cuz even like
we are if you're just on a local host,

26
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:14.837
you can still run it.

27
00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:17.540
So I haven't published yet, but
I wanna know how it's doing.

28
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.144
So Lighthouse is this full page audits,

29
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:21.087
we'll talk about all these
great stuff its get.

30
00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:25.588
It's the place I'll always recommend
starting if you're trying to gauge

31
00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:27.166
performance of a new app.

32
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.672
Come here, it'll give you so

33
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.480
much feedback before you have to dive
into the weeds of network memory CPU.

34
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.051
And also it can do other cool things,
it can emulate devices.

35
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:41.626
So this little button over here to
the left,, you can click it and

36
00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:45.413
it will give you all these different
options for exact screen sizes.

37
00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:49.060
So for folks that do a lot of front-end
work and design, you can see exactly what

38
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.350
your site will look like on a pixel two or
something like that.

39
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.114
And more than just shrinking your screen,

40
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.221
this will actually send
the appropriate headers.

41
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:59.245
So if you have a server that
reads in the request header and

42
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:01.640
says, it's a mobile device, go here.

43
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.121
Otherwise, send this.

44
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.840
This will convince you that
it is a mobile device.

45
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.718
You can zoom in and
you can actually test out.

46
00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:12.750
I hope you can see, but my mouse cursor
is turned into a little touch circle.

47
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.084
And so you can test out touch events too,
which is which is really nice.

48
00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:21.685
Click that to go back and the last thing
is this nice little element Finder.

49
00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:24.137
I use this a lot and
I see people not using this a lot.

50
00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:27.209
So if you're looking for
a specific element like this emoji or

51
00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.985
something like that rather
than going into elements and

52
00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:33.290
trying to like drill down into it
this way, you can click on this and

53
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.858
then you can start moving around and
it'll hover on different things.

54
00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:40.714
And whatever your click on,
whatever it's hovering, it'll focus that.

55
00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:43.386
So I click on elements and
it clicks it in here, and

56
00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:45.432
I can find that emoji really quickly.

57
00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.217
At the end, we'll go into a bunch
of different settings and

58
00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:51.600
some experiments and some really cool
stuff that you can do over here.

59
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.611
But that's kind of the cover for
the most part.

60
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.242
The other thing that's important is
you can choose where it's docked.

61
00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.190
So you can go to the right,
to the left or pop it out.

62
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.150
And one thing that's kind of interesting
when we did the network tab, right,

63
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.754
we did screenshots, but the screenshots
you can see are really minor.

64
00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.869
And the reason is since we
have the dev tools open here,

65
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.460
Chrome only has to render this
exposed part of the screen.

66
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.141
So you won't get a full screenshot
of your app, unless you go here.

67
00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:20.970
Pop them out and then you refresh.

68
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.776
And now that Chrome actually
has to render the full site,

69
00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:25.594
you'll get full size screenshots.

70
00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.444
So that's kind of the high-level
view of each panel.

71
00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.190
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time in each one.

72
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.496
But just so when you see them,
you can be, I know what that one's for.

73
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.776
That one does memory stuff for
that one checks HTTPS or

74
00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:38.370
that was the step through debugger,
those kinds of things.
