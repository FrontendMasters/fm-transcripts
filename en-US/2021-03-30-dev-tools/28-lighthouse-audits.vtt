WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.250
This is really, really cool.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.140
So, Lighthouse is the last tab
we're gonna kinda cover here.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.341
When I did this talk last time,
Lighthouse wasn't in the panel, and

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.690
was it's own separate website.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.410
It's a open source initiative
that came out of Google.

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.900
It's really well maintained with all these
rulesets and tests for web performance.

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.279
And I used to have this advice where I
was like, if you're doing a local app,

8
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.480
you got to use Audit.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.250
But if you have an app on production,
go check out lighthouse.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.340
It's like the best.

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.014
And now Lighthouse is here in the tabs,
which I'm like,

12
00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:38.770
just very giddy over because it's just so
good.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.650
All the rules are open source and online
and a ton of people contribute to it.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.230
And it has all these different categories,
which are somewhat self explanatory.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.426
They're maybe a little complicated, but so

16
00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:53.316
performance is going to be
initial page load performance,

17
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:57.410
very similar to what we've been doing
manually with the network stuff.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.279
Progressive Web App is going to check,

19
00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:01.840
does it service worker
does it work offline.

20
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.118
Does it have a manifest?

21
00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:08.614
All these great things for progressive web
apps which we're not building right now,

22
00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:12.361
best practices is gonna be just a lot
of normal stuff about the images and

23
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.200
compression and
all those different things.

24
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.329
Accessibility is hugely valuable,
I have an accessibility course on front of

25
00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.581
masters but making sure that interactive
elements can be done via the keyboard,

26
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.020
making sure that color
contrast works well for

27
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.420
people with different vision impairments.

28
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.766
All sort of things like that making
sure screen readers are going to have

29
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.414
an easy time reading your content,
to non sighted users.

30
00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:39.280
And then SEO, just making sure that you're
doing kind of the basic things for Google

31
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.440
to be able to track your website well and
for other search engines to track as well.

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.320
So I think for now, let's just go through,
let's just generate a mega report.

33
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.360
And this is keeping in mind that we know
that we're not a progressive web app.

34
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.950
We know we don't have
any of those features.

35
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.395
So, you click what you want, and
then you click Generate Report and

36
00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:57.949
it's gonna do a bunch of
stuff in the background.

37
00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:00.520
It's going to refresh the page and
stuff like that.

38
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.142
And so you get this very,
very nice easy to parse,

39
00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:08.810
0 through 100 score on all
the different categories.

40
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.000
So you can see it's pretty cool.

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.134
I found that we're not
a progressive web app and

42
00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:16.720
instead of giving you a bad read score,
it's just kind of grayed it out.

43
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.638
We get 100 number Performance,
90 on Accessibility, 93 on Best Practices,

44
00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:22.402
78 on SEO.

45
00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:23.532
So let's just start looking through.

46
00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:28.375
These are like, sometimes I think about
things that I'm like, you could probably

47
00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:32.458
just make money just by offering
people who have business websites and

48
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:36.749
aren't super tech savvy, probably
just honestly like run Lighthouse,

49
00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.124
print it out and go talk to them about it.

50
00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:43.449
It's so valuable even though it's free,
it's just so cool to be able to see.

51
00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.666
So on the Performance tab,
that's the onload performance.

52
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.661
We can see all these great
things like how long it took for

53
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:53.950
the first contentful paint, how long it
took before the site was interactive.

54
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.494
For those of us that work at big
companies, we probably have a few of

55
00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:02.940
these metrics that are mandated, like time
to first byte or first contentful paint.

56
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.750
Those will be things that we need
to keep the app on a certain time.

57
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.841
So first contentful paint is like we
talked about on there when the page

58
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:14.000
renders the first time and
time to interactive.

59
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.149
I've seen this on some slower sites where
it's loading that is blocking the main

60
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.557
thread where you can't click on things,
you can't scroll,

61
00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:20.800
you can't click on a button.

62
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440
So that's time to interactive before.

63
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.010
The main thread is free enough
that you can do stuff again.

64
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.350
Largest contentful, paint, layout shift,
all these different metrics.

65
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.802
And what's really cool with these is if
you get one red or yellow, it'll flag you

66
00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:38.795
with a page for each and every one of
them where you can click on the page and

67
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:43.280
go to this really nicely maintained dock
for like, well, why am I getting that?

68
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.340
What can I do?

69
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.373
What's the problem here?

70
00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:49.460
I know I'm gushing over it,
but it's just so awesome.

71
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.710
Lighthouse is such, such a great resource.

72
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.398
Cool, so kinda scrolling down.

73
00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:56.650
You can also see,
I know these are all mini.

74
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.878
Remember I said that if you have
the Dev tools not popped out,

75
00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:01.914
the screenshots will be really tiny.

76
00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:06.360
So here is just little tiny screenshots
of what's going on up there.

77
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.440
And then it has suggestions.

78
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.759
So here it can says the only suggestion
normally you get a lot is that you could

79
00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:17.487
save 100 milliseconds or something like
that if you eliminated render blocking

80
00:04:17.487 --> 00:04:22.280
resources, and specifically if I extend
that it's the custom font that I use.

81
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.470
So I have a custom font.

82
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.600
It's pretty small.

83
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080
But if I got rid of it,
then I could speed things up a lot.

84
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.396
The other thing you could do is,
you can do that.

85
00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:33.868
Have you ever loaded a site and
it loads with a system font and

86
00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:36.720
then it changes into being a custom font.

87
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.500
You guys do that.

88
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.312
I mean, it's gonna be a lot faster or
not maybe a lot, but

89
00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:43.200
it'll be somewhat faster but
at a worse user experience.

90
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.970
So kinda your choice.

91
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.570
And then here's all the things that,
these are not marked red.

92
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.130
So, if they were I could go and read into
those more, if I was messed something up.

93
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.360
And then here are the ones
that are passed audit.

94
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.520
So you can see these two.

95
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.783
These are all the things that would flag,
if you're on a production site, and

96
00:04:59.783 --> 00:05:01.870
it had any of these issues.

97
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.240
Next one accessibility.

98
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.330
Same thing, it just gives you
immediately useful, very helpful stuff.

99
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.740
So it's like, this HTML element
doesn't have a Lang attribute.

100
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.028
And it has this whole important
thing about screen readers.

101
00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:16.655
If you don't set a language
on the HTML element,

102
00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:19.100
they will use the user's default language.

103
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.577
So if you are a Spanish speaking
user on a Spanish screen reader, and

104
00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:25.322
I have an English website,
but I don't set the Lang,

105
00:05:25.322 --> 00:05:29.000
it's going to try to read it in Spanish
because I haven't set the Lang.

106
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.591
So, immediately very, very useful
stuff that you honestly could just go,

107
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:37.680
just follow along and
kind of fix all these things.

108
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.630
Then again choose all
the passed audits that we got.

109
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.480
I will give a caveat here.

110
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.229
Accessibility testing like automated
testing has come such a long way.

111
00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.029
And I know that sounds a little cliche,
but

112
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.745
it's especially true with accessibility,
like really nothing beats the real thing.

113
00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:56.782
Nothing beats actually getting a user on
and trying to tab around and make sure,

114
00:05:56.782 --> 00:06:01.295
because things might have tab index, but
they might be unintuitive or clunky.

115
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.045
And Chrome Dev Tools won't
be able to catch that.

116
00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:05.539
So this is a really good starting point.

117
00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.650
These are easy things to fix, but
accessibility is very subjective.

118
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.145
For making a good experience,
it's a little bit harder to Lindt and

119
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:18.006
better to have somebody on your team that
knows how to use a screen reader and

120
00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:20.980
knows how to tab around and
make sure that it feels good.

121
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.888
That feels nice.

122
00:06:24.078 --> 00:06:28.370
Another thing, best practices,
missing one where there's no doctype set.

123
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.012
So again, on the HTML, you might how you
usually do like doctype HTML, or whatever,

124
00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:36.492
sort of a relic back to the old
days where we had, before HTML5,

125
00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:40.962
we had all these specific doctypes and
these specific modes that browsers would.

126
00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:43.183
But again,
you can go to the Learn More and

127
00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:46.560
it'll just tell you to put doctype
HTML at the top of your page.

128
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.401
And then here are the audits I passed.

129
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.120
Coming to SEO,
I don't have a meta viewport tag.

130
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.113
And so this helps mobile
devices know how to scale so

131
00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:58.140
they don't have to pinch to zoom.

132
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.374
Have you ever loaded a site on your mobile
device and it's like super mini, and

133
00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:02.708
you're trying to zoom into it?

134
00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:04.830
So this meta viewport can help with that.

135
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.210
And there's no meta description.

136
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.041
Again, not an SEO class, but these are
things that help the search engine know

137
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.610
more about the page so
that they can index it better.

138
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.748
Cool, and then PWA.

139
00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:19.221
I failed a bunch of things,
but it's not a PWA.

140
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:20.170
That's okay.

141
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.930
So it said, hey, we went offline and
we expected to 200, we didn't get one.

142
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.650
It doesn't have any
service workers at all.

143
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.910
There's no web app manifest.

144
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.110
I mean, these are things we know
because it's not a progressive web app.

145
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.145
But if you do have one working on
mobile@twitter.com, and you want it in

146
00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:39.590
the App Store and you want to, make sure
that you pass all these PWA tests as well.

147
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.377
Cool, and
then it's got a bunch of meta information,

148
00:07:43.377 --> 00:07:47.577
just about what slowed down at use, what
site it was, all these kinda great stuff.
