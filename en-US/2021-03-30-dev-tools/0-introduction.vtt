00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.498
Hey everybody, welcome to this course,
I'm really excited about it.

2
00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.537
This is my third time
doing a DevTools course.

3
00:00:06.537 --> 00:00:09.884
But this is a brand new format,
which I'm really excited about.

4
00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.036
The DevTools have added a lot of
new cool things over the last year,

5
00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:14.340
which I'm excited about.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.999
And this one's gonna be a little bit
differently paced in that we're going for

7
00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.613
a nice introduction to DevTools.

8
00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:23.290
So we'll kind of cover it later,
but I'm hoping this course will be

9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.032
a really good tool for people
whether you're absolutely brand new,

10
00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:31.095
been using them a little bit for a little
while or are pretty comfortable and

11
00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:35.261
just looking for cool kind of tips and
tricks and ways to be more productive.

12
00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:40.857
This whole course is one single
repo that repo it's a link here for

13
00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:45.147
https://github.com/jkup/mastering-chrome-devtools.

14
00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:51.340
Or if you're not able to click on that,
you can just go to github.com/jkup.

15
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.586
Let me close this.

16
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:56.710
And you'll see it's right on my home page,
this mastering devtools link.

17
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.224
And it should be,
I've tried to make it as easy as possible.

18
00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:01.539
So it's got instructions on it.

19
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.755
You just clone the repo, CD into it,
npm install and npm start.

20
00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.530
And the only requirement is Node,
which comes with npm.

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.990
So kinda the way that the course works is
these pages which you can have locally

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.144
if you have the repo,
I'm just running the repo here so

23
00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:19.392
you can kind of see,
I have mastering Chrome DevTools.

24
00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:20.708
I did my npm install.

25
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:24.365
And now I can just do my npm start,
and it'll load up the server.

26
00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.302
Then I go to localhost :3000, and

27
00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.016
this should be the exact same
course that you all have.

28
00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:31.343
Just some important links
to kind of refer back to.

29
00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:34.279
This is the course repository
where this course is hosted.

30
00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:38.391
The official docs to Chrome DevTools are
always a really good place they've been

31
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:40.458
especially over the last couple years.

32
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:42.172
They've put a lot of
good content on there.

33
00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:45.190
They've got cool demos themselves.

34
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.673
When they do updates, they mark
them in there which is really good.

35
00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:52.291
And if anybody needs to get ahold of me,
this is my Twitter handle,

36
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.788
Jkup and my email address.

37
00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:59.880
And I love talking about DevTools and the
course so please feel free to message me.

38
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.597
That'd be kind of an interesting to
start because I feel like DevTools

39
00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:07.188
are an interesting topic where
I'm really passionate about them.

40
00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:10.002
I feel like a lot of people
find a lot of value in them but

41
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.322
they're a little bit of an interesting
topic because you won't necessarily find

42
00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.342
them on the job application, right?

43
00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.443
It wouldn't be like needs
Chrome DevTools experience.

44
00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:24.295
So I thought it'd be kind of cool to
talk about why I think it's important to

45
00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:25.460
learn DevTools.

46
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.254
I do think it's just a level up in
general, like it's a really cool way to

47
00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:33.439
better understand code, better understand
performance, all those things.

48
00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.891
It's a great tool for
finding bugs quickly.

49
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:40.022
I think that if you're somebody who's
really comfortable with the stuff that

50
00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:44.214
we'll go over today, so like using
the console, using a step through debugger,

51
00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:46.843
using the audit tools,
performance, all that,

52
00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.057
you'll be able to find bugs at work and
fix them a lot faster.

53
00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:53.976
It's a really cool way to start
your journey down web performance.

54
00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:56.667
This is not a web performance class, but

55
00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.241
it really touches on a lot
of web performance topics.

56
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:04.679
So it helps you learn network requests,
CPU, memory, all these things.

57
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.866
And if you are a web performance expert,
you will come back to DevTools a lot and

58
00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:12.821
use them when you're auditing sites
when you're finding bugs or issues.

59
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.289
And then one of my favorite things about
them is it's like when I got started doing

60
00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.573
web development,
my favorite thing was to browse the web,

61
00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:23.680
find a really cool website and
then learn how it worked.

62
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.474
That was what I did when I was beginning.

63
00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:30.666
And I feel like the DevTools are a really
incredible way to still do that.

64
00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:33.972
I'll visit a website, and
it'll have a really cool animation, and

65
00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:35.804
I'll really wanna know how it works.

66
00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:39.462
And of course back in the day,
it was probably just like a single HTML,

67
00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:41.824
a single CSS, and
a single JavaScript file.

68
00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:44.448
So I could download the whole site and
play with it.

69
00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:46.938
But these days sites are a lot
more complicated but

70
00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:50.029
DevTools make the complicated
site very easy to understand.

71
00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.289
Like how an animation happens, what CSS
they're using for a cool piece that you

72
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.944
see, or how they're getting things to load
so quickly, all sorts of stuff like that.

73
00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:04.017
So I think they can be really fun for
just playing, exploring, learning too.

74
00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:08.814
I also kind of wanted to make a note if
you look around, there's all these great

75
00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:13.190
courses that exist all over the web,
especially on frontend masters.

76
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.142
And a lot of them come down to
this idea of creating, right?

77
00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:18.784
There are about how to
create react applications or

78
00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:20.760
how to create angular applications.

79
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.527
But there's not a lot of courses out there
that teach you what to do, congrats,

80
00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:27.070
you have an app and
it's launched and you have users.

81
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.460
What do you do now?

82
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.872
And I find that a lot of people for their
day-to-day job are in that situation where

83
00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.583
they're debugging things
that the users find, or

84
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:38.420
they're dealing with user
complaints about speed or

85
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.095
they're trying to make the site
load faster, something like that.

86
00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:46.150
And so I think this is cool because
it works across all platforms,

87
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.720
whether you have an angular site,
react site, a node site, a Java site,

88
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.614
whatever, you can really learn a lot and
get a lot of value out of the DevTools.

89
00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:56.242
Cool.

90
00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:59.182
So kind of a general high
level course outline.

91
00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:03.266
So we'll start with a little bit of
history on how DevTools came to be and

92
00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:06.000
kind of leading from where
we started up to now.

93
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.912
Then we'll do a walk through the panels.

94
00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:10.186
I kind of like it so
we'll open the DevTools together.

95
00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:13.972
We'll click on each panel and
we'll do not necessarily a high level,

96
00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:18.077
a medium level view of each panel,
what it's good for, what we can use it for

97
00:05:18.077 --> 00:05:20.606
all these kind of
different things like that.

98
00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:22.877
So we'll walk through those.

99
00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:24.736
And then I break the course
into different sections.

100
00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:28.895
So we'll do a section on editing websites,
one on debugging websites,

101
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:33.684
one on network performance, one on CPU
performance, one on memory performance.

102
00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.022
And then we'll wrap up
with doing full audits.

103
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:38.659
If you were coming into a brand new site,
or

104
00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:43.592
you're looking at an old site with fresh
eyes, how would we do a top down audit.

105
00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:45.355
A little bit about me.

106
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:50.047
I'm John Kuperman, an engineer at Adobe
and I work on the Creative Cloud.

107
00:05:50.047 --> 00:05:54.418
Before that I worked on the brave
browser and I worked on twitter.com.

108
00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:56.433
I blog over at JohnKuperman.com and

109
00:05:56.433 --> 00:06:00.077
I really like teaching workshops
on DevTools and accessibility.
