1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.250
So now we're kinda moving
into the sources tab.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.302
And the thing that I always like I
have these two screenshots here,

3
00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.591
like when you really think
about the sources tab,

4
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.040
it's sort of like your customer,
your ID built into the dev tools.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.955
So, here's like the exact same file open
in my dev tools and then open in my ID,

6
00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:18.230
which I use VS code.

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.897
So you have like the center panel,
which has the code in it line numbers and

8
00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:22.900
everything.

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.120
You got the left sidebar,

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.580
which is like a tree that you can
kinda walk just like this one here.

11
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.797
And the difference is you got all these
great debugging things on the right,

12
00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.170
which will play within
the debugging section.

13
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.490
But you can even hide those and then just
deal with this so you can really just use

14
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.220
it as your ID Which is what we're
gonna do in the next exercise.

15
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.038
It's got a lot of your favorite things in
it like so for example, if I open up dev

16
00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:51.075
tools here, and I go to sources, and let
me get rid of this little console Jordan,

17
00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:55.730
if anybody's wondering about this,
you can go to the data dot here.

18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.050
And you can do show console door or
you can use the Escape key.

19
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.480
And that'll give you a console
overlaid on any non console panel.

20
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.924
So you can be on the elements with the
console or the network with a console or

21
00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:11.160
sources with a console and
then you can just XOR escape to hide it.

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.390
That's really useful sometimes if you
just wanna log something out and see it.

23
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.720
So if I go here, you get a lot of
the things that work in your current ID.

24
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.614
So for example, if I do a command P which
in VS code will open a fuzzy search on

25
00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.985
the files,
I get the exact same fuzzy search here.

26
00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.685
I can bring up any file like that.

27
00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:34.285
A lot of the same shortcuts for
commenting and all that stuff will work.

28
00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:38.260
So I'd really encourage you to when you're
in sources just to try whatever feels

29
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.605
natural and
see if it just happens to work here.

30
00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:42.465
Cool.

31
00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:44.782
So yeah, it's like your full ID and

32
00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:48.738
we're gonna play with that a lot
as we play with workspaces.

33
00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:51.090
So workspaces are super, super cool.

34
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.933
They're what let you persist
your changes to disk, but

35
00:01:54.933 --> 00:02:00.520
it wouldn't be super cool thing without
some super serious limitations on it.

36
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.253
So before we get too far
excited with workspaces,

37
00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:06.490
let's talk about what it can and
what it can't do.

38
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.897
And so the limitation if
you think about apps, and

39
00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:14.522
you think about kinda what we're
doing here, if there is a one to one

40
00:02:14.522 --> 00:02:19.151
correspondence between what you
kinda send down over the server and

41
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:24.700
what you author on the server and what you
author and what you view in the website.

42
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.939
And what I mean by that is like
If you make an index at HTML,

43
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.259
then when I hit your website, the same
index HTML that you hand wrote is gonna

44
00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:37.370
come to me, right like it's the same
file just automatically transferred.

45
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.578
If you write a node app, and you use
a templating language like moustache and

46
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.933
you hand write a moustache file,
the templating language,

47
00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.570
we'll turn that into an index dot HTML and
send it to me, right?

48
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.600
That's kinda how that's working.

49
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.550
So in the first example,
you write HTML, it sends HTML.

50
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.930
There's a one to one example that'll
work great with a workspace no problem.

51
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.639
And the second example,
we're using a templating language.

52
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.563
That won't work with a workspace because
if I update my index dot HTML on my

53
00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:07.552
laptop inside the workspace,

54
00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:12.910
your server doesn't really have a way of
knowing which template file to update.

55
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.170
It's it's that would be too complex.

56
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.763
So in those situations,
you can still persist your CSS and

57
00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:21.210
your JavaScript changes to disk.

58
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.863
But you cannot persist your HTML
changes to this because you're not

59
00:03:24.863 --> 00:03:26.720
actually writing HTML.

60
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.260
And this is also sadly true.

61
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.516
With tools like react where again,
you're not writing the HTML,

62
00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:37.020
you're writing JSX and
react is turning it into HTML.

63
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.100
So, in the dev tools,
you'll see index HTML.

64
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.510
But there as you know, there really
isn't an index dot HTML on the server.

65
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.120
It's like an index.js or like 20 js file.

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.410
So there is a limitation there.

67
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.518
Sometimes it's confusing,
but it's basically,

68
00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:54.341
like if the thing that's
on my dev tool laptop is

69
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.930
the exact same thing that is in my code,
then it's easy to persist.

70
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.160
If it's not, then it's not gonna persist.

71
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.402
So oftentimes,

72
00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:08.540
the sad reality is with like the current
tech stacks are very pill chain heavy.

73
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.680
Like I'm sure a lot of you at work or
like, you use react and you use bubble and

74
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.788
use a templating engine and
all these different things or

75
00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.163
use a CSS preprocessor.

76
00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:20.890
That will mean that the workspace
idea won't work for you.

77
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.418
But if you are working with vanilla CSS,
or vanilla JavaScript, or vanilla HTML,

78
00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.410
then workspaces will be awesome.

79
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.680
So does that make sense?

80
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.569
I'm gonna pause if anybody has questions,
and I know that's like a very good,

81
00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:34.972
kinda a confusing concept.

82
00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:37.530
So let me just pause for a sec if
anybody has any questions on that.

83
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.956
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have.

84
00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:45.715
Can we just save the changes and
for example from the website

85
00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:51.013
google.com and save the changes and
reload the page so

86
00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:57.136
we can just load the external
JavaScript but with our changes?

87
00:04:57.136 --> 00:04:58.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can.

88
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.270
That's a great question.

89
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.352
So it's like, can we,
instead of like saving to disk,

90
00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:05.764
let's say and updating actual source code,
can we set it up so

91
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:09.360
that we can persist changes
through a refresh basically.

92
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.140
And we will cover that in another section.

93
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.500
The short answer is yes,
there are still some limitations.

94
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.820
Some things we can't save.

95
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.317
But for the most part,
yeah, you can set it up so

96
00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:22.188
that like you can change the JavaScript
and it'll survive a refresh, but

97
00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.830
it won't actually write to your local,
the code bases file system.

98
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.640
But yeah, we will be able to do that.

99
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.227
And that's not using workspaces
that's just built in with

100
00:05:31.227 --> 00:05:34.290
the dev tools networking tool, but
we can do it there, which is cool.
