00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.540
HTML breakpoints,
these are another really, cool thing.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.149
So this is like an anecdote, but

3
00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.730
I had this job once where
I was working on a tool.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.426
And the tool was essentially this giant
table that was populated with data

5
00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:15.760
in real time.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400
So like little cells of the table
table would always change and

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.170
I was really new on this team.

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.896
And we had a bug where when one would
change, sometimes it would go blank,

9
00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:27.716
it would like update and
it would go white and

10
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:31.440
the bug was to figure out
why that was happening.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.249
And so this is like back to the very
first slide of like dev tools can kind

12
00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.025
of help you level up If I
was not good with dev tools,

13
00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.950
I would have done what
everyone else would have done.

14
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.492
I would have either asked around,
or open the code and

15
00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:47.150
start trying to find what code
populates the table, stuff like that.

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.415
But knowing Dev tools,
you can do these really cool things.

17
00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:54.831
So, just like we'll learn how to set break
points in our JavaScript code in the next

18
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:58.325
section, you can set break
points on your HTML code.

19
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.594
So, if I go to like the HTML element
way up here, and I right click it,

20
00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.635
I'll get this break on drop down.

21
00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:11.650
And so, what this is doing is it says when
one of these three things next happens,

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.210
I want you to pause JavaScript execution.

23
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.218
And I want you to show me what
JavaScript caused the HTML to change,

24
00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:21.560
which is really very powerful.

25
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.468
So you have three options, which is
whenever the subtree is modified, and

26
00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.004
if you think about the DOM being a tree,
so elements have children,

27
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.280
elements of children elements
all the way down, right?

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.894
And so if you go to the HTML,
which is the top element, and

29
00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.540
you say when the subtree is modified,
that will mean anything on the app.

30
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.603
But if you had a table like in my
anecdote, you'd go to the table and

31
00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:42.710
do it there.

32
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.125
You could also do when
attributes are modified.

33
00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.935
So that would be if we did it,
let's say on this h1.

34
00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:49.997
It wouldn't change if the text changed,
but

35
00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:52.645
it would change if the ID
changed like an attribute.

36
00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:56.275
And then the third option is
break when a node is removed.

37
00:01:56.275 --> 00:02:01.246
Again, this can be really helpful, so as
a little contrived example, I'll do break

38
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:06.520
on for the HTML subtree modification, so
anything changes in the subtree break?

39
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.900
I think I have an old one clicking
around here, which I'll get rid of.

40
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.930
Okay, so now you can see this
little blue breakpoint on the HTML.

41
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.240
So then I can go into console, and
I can do like document, get element by ID.

42
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.020
Let me find one that exists idea main,
so go back here.

43
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.880
Grab this main, and I'll do main dot inner
text equals high, something like that.

44
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.477
So I changed the articles
inner text to be high and

45
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.390
before it even processed, I get this.

46
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.730
I get this breakpoint here and
my DOM where everything is, is paused.

47
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.570
And if I click on the call stack,
again, we'll get into debugging later.

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.068
I just want people to be aware that they
can do this cool thing it'll actually,

49
00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:52.620
show me the line that
changed that bit of HTML.

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.308
So I think this is one of those
things that is really powerful for

51
00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.340
ultra specific situations.

52
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.400
Like you'll be in a situation where
the website is behaving strangely.

53
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.430
And you have no real idea what's
doing it in the JavaScript.

54
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.364
Being able to figure out exactly what line
of JavaScript is altering the HTML can be

55
00:03:08.364 --> 00:03:09.880
really useful.

56
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.760
So I'll go ahead and play through here and
go back to elements.

57
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.050
As you can see the whole site
turned into the word Hi.

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.979
&gt;&gt; I followed along with the debugger
example and mine is just stuck

59
00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.621
on when I updated the inner text to Hi,
&gt;&gt; Do you see up at the top of the screen

60
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:30.180
a little I think it's like a yellow
bar with a play button on it.

61
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; You can hit that to play through.

62
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.114
And I think it'll, get you there one
more time and you hit play again and

63
00:03:36.114 --> 00:03:38.100
then it should go through.

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

65
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.670
&gt;&gt; Yep, and then the other way to do it.

66
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.370
Yeah, that button should always be there.

67
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.305
I think there's me we do this again, so
you should have this play button up here.

68
00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:52.606
I think there's also a way to just like
deactivate back here on the sources tab,

69
00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:56.005
you can deactivate all break points,
and then if you hit play,

70
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:58.930
it just won't stop again,
which can be nice.

71
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.420
So you can kind of leave them on,

72
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.900
you can also then at any time go back to
elements and right click breakout and

73
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.080
then remove the thing and
then the blue circle should go away.

74
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.995
So then we have a finding event listeners
to this is like very much in common

75
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:16.992
with the HTML break points where we can
see something going on with our app,

76
00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:21.470
but we're not exactly sure
where it's coming from.

77
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.506
So, like for example, you click on
a button and it does something and

78
00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:28.960
you want to know where that
JavaScript comes from.

79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.380
So that's what this third tab
over here event listeners is for.

80
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.980
And so
you can see this is a static HTML site.

81
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.698
So there is not really any
event listeners except for

82
00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:40.150
this one that my code highlighter uses.

83
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.026
But if you were to do some code like make
a button and then add event listener,

84
00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:46.995
click to it or something like that or
if you're in react and

85
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:51.070
you did an unclick event or anything
like that, those will all show up here.

86
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.052
When you click on the items you could
like click on different items and

87
00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:56.070
see if they have any
event listeners this way.

88
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.302
Color formats is another cool one,
this one was added a few years ago,

89
00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.140
but I really like it.

90
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.880
So you can see over here we've got border
top and then it's like this reddish color.

91
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.732
So we can pretty easily edit
the hex codes, right, but

92
00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:13.956
another thing you can do is you
can click on the color itself and

93
00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.730
it opens this like really
nice color palette.

94
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.830
You can drag it all around, so let's do
something like, let me close this and

95
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.670
let's take like the body and we'll do
background color and we'll click on that.

96
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.549
So now you can kind of
drag it all around and

97
00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:32.500
really find the exact color
that you're looking for.

98
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.562
You can change all the kind of hue and
saturation and transparency and

99
00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:40.010
all that stuff, and
it'll give you the hex code.

100
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.860
Another really cool thing is
this section down here as

101
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.621
the lower half which
populates like colors themes.

102
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.485
So for example is material UI,
you can again,

103
00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:59.035
you can click on an element click
on the actual square of the color,

104
00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:05.310
click on these this little toggle here,
and then click on material UI.

105
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.020
And now it'll populate this
nice little section here.

106
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.011
So as we're doing stuff, like we can
choose the body background from material

107
00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:16.362
UI colors, which is Google's color theme,
but the thing I use it for more than that,

108
00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:20.660
and let me refresh real quick, so I get
rid of that yellow is I'll go to here.

109
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.450
Click on this and
then I'll click on page colors.

110
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.628
And what this does is it's dynamically
reading the colors on the current page and

111
00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:29.970
then generating a color
scheme out of those.

112
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.520
So this is like the actual
blue that I use up here.

113
00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:36.423
You can also see that when
you scroll off of this modal,

114
00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:39.335
it turns into one of those
really cool like zoom things.

115
00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:43.403
And so you can like hover over if you
wanted to get the hex for this blue, or

116
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.965
this white or this red or
anything like that.

117
00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:49.725
So these are all really cool,
so it's got like an eyedropper.

118
00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:54.514
It's got all the kinda Hue Saturation
stuff, it has multiple different formats

119
00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:58.824
RGBA, HSLA, hex and then it's got
this really cool theme picker here.

120
00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.010
So there's like a lot here for
when you're designing stuff.

121
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.584
There's also a cool little Dev tools
trick, which is you can go back to body

122
00:07:06.584 --> 00:07:09.552
and hover,
you can shift click on any color box,

123
00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:13.200
and it'll instantly convert
it between the color format.

124
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.035
So I know some people at their jobs like
we all use HSLA or we all use RGB or

125
00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:18.270
something like that.

126
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.387
So you could just like Set it to
a thing that you know like a hex, and

127
00:07:21.387 --> 00:07:25.130
then you can shift click on it to turn it
into RGB other stuff that does it has this

128
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.920
accessibility panel.

129
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.812
The accessibility panel is really nice for
when you're doing stuff like,

130
00:07:30.812 --> 00:07:34.920
we do a lot of stuff at work with
making our sites keyboard accessible.

131
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.888
So everything that you can do with a mouse
you should be able to do by tabbing around

132
00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:39.050
with the keyboard.

133
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.890
And so this can be really nice where
it shows this accessibility tree.

134
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.520
And you can see like what
items have tab indexes or

135
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.329
which ones have any kind of ARIA.

136
00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.329
Attributes on anything
like that will be in here.

137
00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:53.838
And it can be really helpful when
you're just trying to look at like,

138
00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:57.347
is this getting tap index or does this
have my Aria label that I put on or

139
00:07:57.347 --> 00:07:59.419
anything like that will be in this tree.
