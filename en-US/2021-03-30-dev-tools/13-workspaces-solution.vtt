00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.800
We had a couple of really
good questions and comments.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.080
Important one was that, folks are finding,
they open the dev tools.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.811
So I'm on my Mac and
the the workspace is actually on my Mac.

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.906
And so, when I do things if I
do body back ground blue, or

5
00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:20.756
something like that,
it live reloads in real time.

6
00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:24.419
But a couple of folks were doing
things either via remote workspace or

7
00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.170
via windows subsystem Linux, and they're
finding that the changes, they do persist.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.323
So if you go and you type stuff and
you hit save, and

9
00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.530
then you look in your editor,
it'll be there.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.366
But the live reloading
won't happen over and WSL.

11
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.179
Let me go through the kind of solving
these and then we'll do pause for

12
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.953
any questions that anybody
had going through it.

13
00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:47.714
So yeah, so I kind of got everything
all set up and got my green dots here.

14
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.140
And then so the first thing
was centering the page title.

15
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.075
So I'll go and grab that and
the elements over here.

16
00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.198
I can either do it there, or
I can go into sources, the CSS,

17
00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:02.630
and I can do something like I'll
add a new selector for h1s.

18
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.060
And I'll do text align center.

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.221
So I'll do that.

20
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:14.091
Change the background color so I can kind
of go into elements and grab the body.

21
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:20.079
Maybe add a new selector or
something like that,

22
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.445
background color 333.

23
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:25.410
That looks real bad, eee looks better.

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.400
And then the last thing
was some JavaScript.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.838
So what I was hoping was you would type
in a new item, and you'd hit Enter, and

26
00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:34.900
it should add it to the list.

27
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.050
So if we type in a new item,
we hit Enter, nothing happens.

28
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.080
We go to the console, and
it's logging it, but nothing's happening.

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.322
So we can go into the sources tab and we
can look at the JavaScript and we can see,

30
00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:50.780
it's grabbing the form field,
it's grabbing the list of items.

31
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.853
It's pre-populating with
these three items, and

32
00:01:54.853 --> 00:02:00.900
it calls this render function which
will set the, HTML the list to empty.

33
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.000
Then we'll go through each one of these
items and it will create a new item and

34
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.277
set the inner text to or create a new list
item and set the inner text to the item.

35
00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:16.184
And so what we really want to do is when
on the form when you add an event listener

36
00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:20.712
and you type something in, we check
the key to see if the key is entered,

37
00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.624
which I already have in here.

38
00:02:22.624 --> 00:02:27.057
And we are logging the form value but
we really wanna do is we wanna just push

39
00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.714
that form value on to
the list of items here.

40
00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:36.040
And so we should be able to do something
just like items, push and save that.

41
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.960
And now when we come here and
we hit Enter, I'm gonna close these,

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.350
you can see you know,
hello, something like that.

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.816
It will add the item.

44
00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.504
So yeah, again not super important
getting these things right but

45
00:02:45.504 --> 00:02:47.424
more important getting
the workspace set up and

46
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:50.894
actually playing around with the elements
panel seeing what works, what doesn't.

47
00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:53.405
Playing around with the sources and

48
00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:58.934
then seeing that it actually updates
your if I do workspace index or main.js.

49
00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.900
We can see my new items push code
has made it to my file system.

50
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.210
So that is workspaces.

51
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.550
Again, the kind of TLDR there is it
won't work for a lot of situations.

52
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.952
But if you are in a situation where it'll
work, it can be a really nice way of

53
00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:15.040
editing things really quickly and
seeing the changes right there.
