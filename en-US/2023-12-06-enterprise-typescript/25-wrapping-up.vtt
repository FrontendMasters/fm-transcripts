00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.670
Thanks for joining us for
Enterprise Scale Typescript.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.810
I hope you learned some things that will
help you maintain large projects with lots

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.310
of contributors.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.817
And I hope, in particular,
you picked up some tips and

5
00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.337
we had good discussions
about modular architecture.

6
00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:21.102
How you can make large typescript
projects feel small and

7
00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:25.092
give you some good tools
to manage complexity.
