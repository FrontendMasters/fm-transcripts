00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.036
One of the benefits you get working with
yarn workspaces is the ability to zoom in

2
00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:08.390
and focus on a particular
sub part of your project.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.601
So if we look at our node modules folder,
we have probably,

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.410
well over 1,000 different things in here.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.665
You can see PostCSS,
all this PostCSS stuff

6
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:26.170
that's specific to the chat app itself,
right?

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.769
We've got Redux in here for some reason,

8
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.530
some transitive dependency somehow,
tons and tons and tons of stuff here.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.400
So, and I think the PostCSS stuff is
a good thing for us to keep our eye on.

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.460
What we can do is run
the following command.

11
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.002
I'm gonna go to the root of
the project and run yarn workspaces,

12
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:56.136
Focus chat-stdlib.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.532
And what we're actually seeing,
you see how we're going to the use,

14
00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:04.971
it's everything's scrolled up.

15
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:09.220
We're seeing a lot of stuff getting
removed from our node modules folder.

16
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.370
And if we keep going up,
there's no PostCSS stuff in here.

17
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.390
So what's happened is we have
stripped down our dependencies.

18
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.614
So we only have in this folder now,

19
00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.923
things that are needed in
order to run chat stdlib.

20
00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:28.802
So, if you did a git sparse checkout
to minimize the code you had to

21
00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:33.347
checkout from git, and
then you ran yarn workspaces focus.

22
00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:38.686
You get pretty close to the small project
feel where you can kind of run into,

23
00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:45.300
if we go into packages/chat stdlib,
We could run yarn build.

24
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.060
Everything will work fine, right?

25
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.230
Everything that's needed for this part
of the project is fine, yarn lint.

26
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.370
There's es lint running.

27
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.188
Now if we were to go out to chat and
run yarn lint,

28
00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:06.620
couldn't find a script named es lint.

29
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.170
So it's not really wired up.

30
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.120
This chat project is not wired up,
but the smaller one is.

31
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.700
So when you're working on a large scale
with team and you decide to approach.

32
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.532
You decide to take this modular
architecture approach where we're

33
00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:27.615
not necessarily shipping a bunch of
libraries here, but we can say here

34
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:32.952
are modular pieces of code like maybe
this is the admin section of our app and

35
00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:38.075
this is our data layer and
this is our UI tool, our UI component kit.

36
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:42.580
Fix it up however it makes sense to you.

37
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.441
But this lets you kind of, if you're gonna
operate in one part of the project, zoom

38
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:52.730
in on that, get your updated dependencies
just for that one piece of the project.

39
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.179
You can build, you can test, do whatever
you gotta do, open your pull request, and

40
00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.312
you don't have to pay the cost
of the fact that there are a lot

41
00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:04.402
of things going on in this rebuilt with
many, many different dependencies.

42
00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:08.510
One more thing.

43
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.600
If we want to zoom back out and see
the whole project again, just run yarn.

44
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.120
Now we're gonna watch this get enormous.

45
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.491
So see how we're going backwards
in the alphabet up to the Js,

46
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:27.100
up to the Is, the Gs, or
into the Es and the Ds.

47
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.310
This is just this file is getting longer,
and longer, and longer, and longer.

48
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.500
We heard from halfway through
the alphabet and now we're at the Cs.

49
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.526
That isn't a scroll position with
all this other stuff below it.

50
00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:43.796
So big difference.
