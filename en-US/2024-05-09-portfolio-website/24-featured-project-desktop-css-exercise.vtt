00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.887
We are on to Chapter 5.

2
00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:10.030
And in Chapter 5, you get to do
this all by yourself, all right?

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.393
So what you are gonna do here in Chapter
5 is you are going to create the featured

4
00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:16.660
section.

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.092
And this is the way the featured
section is going to look.

6
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:25.449
There is a background that's got these
little lines behind it here, okay?

7
00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.542
And you have a great big,
huge giant picture.

8
00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:34.348
You have some of these particular
elements here in place again, and

9
00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:38.652
they're overlapping that
image by a little bit.

10
00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:40.159
Kinda sounds like grid.

11
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.319
Baby figures, grid, that kind of thing.

12
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:48.689
We also have a big black box down here
at the bottom with a button, okay?

13
00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:54.957
There is no tablet breakpoint for this
one, there is only a mobile breakpoint

14
00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:59.720
at the mobile breakpoint instead
of individual boxes for HTML, CSS,

15
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.634
JavaScript, and SVG, you're going to have
one giant mega box for all of those items.

16
00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.354
You're gonna have to think
about how that happens.

17
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.127
And then you'll have your
big black box here for

18
00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:14.744
the practical CSS layouts with
the button here at the bottom.

19
00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:22.789
So, as always, I'm recommending that
you work through the steps in order.

20
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.632
You have a starting CodePen here.

21
00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:29.769
Okay, and all the things are in place.

22
00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.428
We have a title, we have images here for
you, we have all the blah, blah,

23
00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:35.399
we have the link in place.

24
00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.488
So what you're gonna need to do
is mark this up appropriately,

25
00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:40.428
that's where you would always start.

26
00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:44.248
It, and then you're going to
add some styling to this.

27
00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:49.315
I would recommend making a layer
called featured, and you can put

28
00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:55.348
all of your styles inside a featured and
that is going to style this page.

29
00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:59.641
Start it for desktop and
then work on the mobile display,

30
00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:14.539
All right, so

31
00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.483
I hope you did well putting together
the featured part of this website.

32
00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:22.332
Let's go Go through how I went
about putting together this code.

33
00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:27.852
So we're gonna start with as we
have throughout this course.

34
00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:31.932
We're going to start with the section
with a class of featured.

35
00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:35.552
And inside of that,
we are going to put our container.

36
00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:39.092
So that's the way we're building all
of the sections of this website.

37
00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.574
So we just You just continue on
with that same pattern here.

38
00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:47.354
Then inside of that container,
we are going to have our featured project.

39
00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:48.918
We're going to mark that up with an H2,

40
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.644
because that's the most important
part of this particular section.

41
00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:55.285
Then I decided to make this an article,

42
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:59.366
because it's kind of a story here
about my featured project and

43
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:03.615
The title of that particular
project is Practical CSS Layouts.

44
00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:07.819
I did a really fun thing
here where I move that word

45
00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.305
practical CSS layouts way
down here to the black box.

46
00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:18.765
The order here goes from
our featured project.

47
00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:24.569
We go to our practical CSS layouts, and
then there's the image that's here, okay?

48
00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.794
And then, of course, we have our skill
set that should be marked up as a list,

49
00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:30.419
just like we had done before.

50
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:36.671
And then down here in the black box,
I made a div with a class of black box,

51
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.848
put inside of that our paragraph of text.

52
00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:42.284
Post and put in our button here and

53
00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:47.504
using the same old class of button
that we've been using all along, and

54
00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:52.898
then ended that div and the article and
and the container and my section.

55
00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:55.298
So that's the HTML piece of this.

56
00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:59.278
Okay, so for the CSS what we
have is as you would expect,

57
00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:04.108
we still Start with our background
image on the section itself, and

58
00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:07.952
that is the striped background image here.

59
00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:10.772
And this time we are going
to ask it to repeat.

60
00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:14.022
We do in fact want this image
to repeat over and over again.

61
00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:15.654
If you looked at the image itself,

62
00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:18.502
it's kinda this tiny little
skinny image like this.

63
00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:22.706
It's designed to repeat Over and over
again in both the x and the y direction.

64
00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:28.919
I have set it to display in the center of
the image, in the center of the page and

65
00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.326
I put some padding on the top and
bottom of our section.

66
00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:40.017
I reduce the size of my h2,
you've seen me do that before And

67
00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:44.695
then for my section featured h three,
I've actually set

68
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:49.666
that up with some margin on it
padding set the color to white,

69
00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:54.732
and the font size to H4, and
the background color to black and

70
00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.880
let me just fix this white right here.

71
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.151
It's a shouldn't be var one White
&gt;&gt; Okay,

72
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:09.972
the black box down here will have a little
bit of padding associated with it.

73
00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:14.972
The color of white background color and
no border radius.

74
00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:17.813
So just going to have pointy corners and

75
00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:22.788
then the tricky part How did I get
that H3 to move down the page?

76
00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:26.348
That is done with displaying this as grid.

77
00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:30.809
I am using grids features that allow me
to reorder things within grid in order to

78
00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.238
move some of these elements
around on the page.

79
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:41.192
What I have here inside of my article is
where I've declared the A grid to go.

80
00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:46.062
And I've said just set up
as many rows as you need.

81
00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:50.395
So what will happen here is that each
one of these items will each go to its

82
00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:50.982
own row.

83
00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:55.542
So h three will be a row image will
be a row, the UL will be a row.

84
00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.116
The div with a class of
black box will be a row and

85
00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:00.559
paragraph Down here that holds the button.

86
00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.149
All of those will be individual rows.

87
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:07.116
Then we just reorder the rows in order to
get them to display where you want them

88
00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:08.319
to display.

89
00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.809
So I indicated the image should
display first up at the top.

90
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:17.715
The ul, once again,
we've set that to go horizontal

91
00:06:17.715 --> 00:06:21.977
on the page I Walk through that
kind of example with you before.

92
00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:27.667
And I used a little bit of negative margin
on the top to move this up over top

93
00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:28.967
of the image.

94
00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:30.413
So that's what's going on there.

95
00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:37.609
And then in these li's, each li is going
to have a background color of white,

96
00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:40.712
a little bit of padding And
a border around it.

97
00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:46.132
So each li winds up having its own little
display here for this part of the page.

98
00:06:47.572 --> 00:06:50.412
And that'll hold until we
get the screen smaller.

99
00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:54.998
So, I think I changed the size
of my featured project

100
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:58.972
here at a slightly
smaller size right there.

101
00:06:58.972 --> 00:06:59.543
That's the only thing.

102
00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:00.473
Thing that changed.

103
00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:02.863
And then I changed everything
again when I go to mobile.

104
00:07:02.863 --> 00:07:06.654
So if you were wondering
how I got this to happen,

105
00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:10.909
what I did besides reducing
the size of a bunch of text,

106
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:15.809
here when I get to my UL,
what I did was I set the whole background

107
00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:20.961
of the UL rather than each LI
having a white White background.

108
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:25.131
I set the background of the whole ul to
be white and put the border on the ul.

109
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:29.371
And so that makes these things look
like they're all together in one unit as

110
00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:32.276
opposed to before where
they were separate units.
