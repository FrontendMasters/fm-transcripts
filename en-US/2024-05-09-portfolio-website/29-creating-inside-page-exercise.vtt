1
00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:04.797
&gt;&gt; So congratulations everybody,
you have finished the homepage for

2
00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:09.105
your portfolio website, and
it looks absolutely fabulous.

3
00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.563
So the next thing that you
may be wondering about is,

4
00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:17.527
how do we go about creating an inside
page for the next part of this website.

5
00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:22.427
And I am going to get you started on that,
and then let you go through and

6
00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:27.095
see if you can figure out how to
create the rest of this inside page.

7
00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:28.813
So let's get started.

8
00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:33.483
Inside of VS code, you have a file that
you should have downloaded back in

9
00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:38.615
chapter six when you downloaded all of
the images from GitHub, there was an HTML

10
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:43.459
file that was available to you that's
It's called projectstart.html.

11
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:47.655
If you open up projectstart.html,
this is most of

12
00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:52.836
the information that you need for
the header of this document.

13
00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:57.534
The content here for the header is
not marked up, you're gonna need to

14
00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:02.483
mark that up, change the background
image from the comment to the Stars.

15
00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:04.849
And then in the section featured here,

16
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.576
we have a lot of the resources
here that you're going to need to

17
00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:12.677
lay out this section of the webpage,
including the YouTube video.

18
00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:17.181
We have three images that are here and
some text, more images, more text, and

19
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:21.908
then the footer down here on the bottom is
all set, you don't need to do anything.

20
00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:27.250
So, what I am going to
recommend that you do here

21
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.142
at Project Start,
we're gonna do a File, Save As.

22
00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:40.761
And I'm gonna call this lime.html,
as in magenta lime.

23
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:45.416
And then we, what I'd like for
you to do now is I'd like for

24
00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:50.167
you to take a look at Lime.HTML and
see if you can make it look

25
00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:54.467
just like the page that we
have on the course website.

26
00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.158
So, this is the way this
page is going to look.

27
00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.216
In other words,

28
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:02.756
we need to swap out a different
background image up appear on the intro.

29
00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:08.055
You gonna need to mark up the code here,
markup the text to do something else.

30
00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:11.427
And then you're going to need
to work on your Flexbox and

31
00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:13.948
grid skills to lay out this web page here.

32
00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:17.849
So we will need to make the video nice and
big.

33
00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.193
Three images across two columns of text,
another nice big image,

34
00:02:24.193 --> 00:02:30.098
and then a little bit of text and
the image next to it like this.

35
00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:32.818
So that is my challenge to you.

36
00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:37.181
See if you can go through and
create the Magenta Lime webpage.

37
00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:42.233
All right?

38
00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.988
So I hope you enjoyed that
inside page challenge.

39
00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:52.365
That is a wonderful way to expand your
skills and really dig into HTML and

40
00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:56.836
CSS and see if you can make
the work all on your own.

41
00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.436
So I'm going to walk through
what my answers were for this.

42
00:02:59.436 --> 00:03:02.638
As always,
we're gonna start with HTML markup.

43
00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:06.478
So I am going to scroll
down here on my page.

44
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:09.170
The nav bar is all set and ready to go.

45
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.325
I'm going to scroll down here to
the first part of the text here,

46
00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:19.490
which is inside of around line
85 to 88 where we get started.

47
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.657
I am going to turn on the word wrapping.

48
00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:27.267
So If I go to view, word wrap,
this is gonna turn on the word wrap so

49
00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:31.049
that I can better see
what's going on here.

50
00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.679
So inside of my header,

51
00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:37.814
then I'm gonna add an article because
this seems kind of like a story to me.

52
00:03:37.814 --> 00:03:42.859
I'm gonna wrap that all
the way around my text.

53
00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.017
And I am going to set Magenta Lime,
that is, the name of this project.

54
00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:53.668
So this is going to become my h2,

55
00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:56.667
Magenta Lime,h2.

56
00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:00.729
And then of course this is
just a paragraph of text here.

57
00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:06.858
So here is the attack text, on my screen.

58
00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:07.553
Okay, great.

59
00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.084
So that's the first thing here.

60
00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:12.433
Pretty simple to do,
right here in the header of the document.

61
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:15.771
We just add an article,
an h2, and a paragraph.

62
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:17.579
All set.

63
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.343
Now I'm going to scroll
down to the website tour.

64
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:24.333
This is where we have the Stripe
Background and we have the video and

65
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.482
all the rest of it.

66
00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:29.563
So the website tour is

67
00:04:29.563 --> 00:04:34.557
going to get an h2/h2.

68
00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.868
And then I have these images,
I have three images, and

69
00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:42.451
then I have a whole bunch
of text underneath.

70
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.734
This actually lends itself to a figure
once again, believe it or not,

71
00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:50.379
you can have a figure that has
multiple images inside of it.

72
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.279
So this is the way that I marked it up.

73
00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.301
You may have marked it up differently and
that's okay.

74
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:57.472
Some people may have
preferred to use divs or

75
00:04:57.472 --> 00:05:02.798
actually maybe very little markup at all,
but I like it with the figures.

76
00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:07.414
So I'm going to put in my figure
element here to start with.

77
00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:13.456
And then we're going to have three
images underneath, which is great.

78
00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:20.044
And then of course this text here will
be our figure caption, figcaption.

79
00:05:20.044 --> 00:05:27.378
And that's end at the end of all over
blah blah, &lt;/Figcaption and &lt;/figure.

80
00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:34.841
Okay, so each of the images is all set and
ready to go.

81
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:39.354
It already has the source for each of
those images that already has alt text for

82
00:05:39.354 --> 00:05:40.680
each of those images.

83
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.032
And so for the Figure caption, all that
we need to do is put in a paragraph.

84
00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:50.704
Cuz that's what that is,
the big long paragraph.

85
00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:54.430
Okay, then I have this image here,

86
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.914
which is the image with the diamond grids.

87
00:05:58.914 --> 00:06:03.307
So that's gonna hang out here all by
itself we can throw in a return here to

88
00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:06.489
sorta indicate that it's
just gonna hang out here.

89
00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:11.405
And then we have another image that
has text along with it lends itself

90
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:12.774
again to a figure.

91
00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:17.855
So let's put in our figure and
we'll put in our &lt;/figure.

92
00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:21.866
And our &lt;figcaption.

93
00:06:28.397 --> 00:06:32.924
&lt;/Figcaption and then of course,
all of the text here.

94
00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:42.685
Looks like I lost a word there.

95
00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:44.971
Let's put it in a paragraph,
and this is this.

96
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.681
This track list flies in and out on click.

97
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:49.433
Okay.

98
00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:53.404
And then &lt;/p down here at the bottom.

99
00:06:53.404 --> 00:06:57.545
Okay, cool.

100
00:06:57.545 --> 00:07:01.216
So that is the HTML,
that's all that we needed to do.

101
00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:05.284
Just two sections,
a little bit of HTML in the intro section,

102
00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:09.442
a lot more HTML down in the featured
section, for the website.

103
00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:14.159
So once that's all in place,
then we're on to styling all of that text.

104
00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.610
And, so I am going to go to, first of all,

105
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.576
let's just take a quick
peek at how this looks.

106
00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:22.364
Okay?

107
00:07:22.364 --> 00:07:26.609
So this is the magenta line page,
that's the wrong image in the background,

108
00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:28.122
there should be stars now.

109
00:07:28.122 --> 00:07:31.865
And you'll see that we
have the videos too small,

110
00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:35.888
the pictures are too big,
all absolutely fabulous.

111
00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.572
And what's going on here?

112
00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:40.530
Does anybody have any idea
what's going on here?

113
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.344
We mark these up as figures.

114
00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:47.958
What is that weird black thing
that's there on top of the images?

115
00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.709
&gt;&gt; The styling we set up before.

116
00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:53.445
&gt;&gt; It's the styling we set up before for
the homepage.

117
00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:59.753
-huh, so, yes CSS is doing what CSS does,
this is called featured.

118
00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:03.373
So it's pulling in all of those featured
styles and applying it here, So

119
00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:05.908
it's gonna look kinda odd.

120
00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:07.619
All right.

121
00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:11.886
We have captions trying to overlap the
image, and none of the styling is right.

122
00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:14.067
So we just have a bunch of
things that we need to fix.
