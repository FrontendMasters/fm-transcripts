00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:04.765
Now that you've seen how you can get
an SVG from a site like Font Awesome and

2
00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.533
include it in your webpage, make it
accessible, and you of course already

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:13.491
know how to work with text and
background images on a webpage.

4
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:17.921
It's time for
you to take a stab at this next exercise.

5
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.442
So the last thing I'd like for
you to do here in chapter three,

6
00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:24.099
is to try building
the footer here on your own.

7
00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.467
So starting with the opening CodePen.

8
00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:33.271
Make sure you put in your information,
your name and

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.935
the title that you're going to have,
add your icons for LinkedIn, GitHub,

10
00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.254
email, whatever else you wanna add.

11
00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:43.674
And then mark it up, add your styling, and

12
00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:49.565
see if you can make your footer look
like the footer that I am showing here.

13
00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:54.539
And I anticipate this is gonna take you
somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes, so

14
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.818
give it a try and
I'll give you my answer momentarily.

15
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:06.073
All right, so I hope that that went well
for you and that you now have a footer

16
00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:09.785
that looks awesome and
kind of like the one that I have here.

17
00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:14.102
So let me go through what I've got for
code and so forth.

18
00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:16.891
So this is the footer of the web page.

19
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.221
So a great way to mark the data
is with the footer element.

20
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.255
So there we are,
there's the footer element.

21
00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:26.590
Inside of that we have a div
with a class of container.

22
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.430
So this is just like we have been doing
throughout the course where we had that

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.350
outside section except in this case,

24
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.237
it happens to be the footer
instead of a section element.

25
00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:38.200
And then we have a div
with a class of container.

26
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.017
The name, Jen Kramer, plus my title
seem to be pretty important down here in

27
00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.124
the footer, so
I've marked that up with an h2.

28
00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:49.259
Then I have my list of links.

29
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.153
So here's all the ways that
you can contact me, and

30
00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:55.735
you'll see here that these are set
up pretty much the same way.

31
00:01:55.735 --> 00:02:00.210
So here's the LinkedIn1,
with a link to my LinkedIn page and

32
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.792
then the aria-label of LinkedIn so

33
00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:07.279
that people who are using screen
readers will know what it is.

34
00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.048
And then of course in the SVG itself,
we want to set the aria hidden to true so

35
00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:16.772
that we skip over those SVGs and
the screen reader doesn't try to read it.

36
00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:22.076
Okay, so
we repeat that same process with GitHub.

37
00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:27.386
And then with email, remember, again, the
email link is slightly different that's

38
00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:32.424
going to be mailed to colon with your
email address, and an aria-label of email.

39
00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:35.381
You'll have to go to Font Awesome
to go download that SVG but

40
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.164
I showed you how to do that earlier.

41
00:02:37.164 --> 00:02:40.572
And then finally at the very end
of everything here I have my

42
00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:41.971
copyright statement.

43
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.932
And what the way that I've marked
that up is with a paragraph and

44
00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.787
I've actually used the small HTML element.

45
00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:53.734
Now, the small element was something
that was frowned upon for a really long

46
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:59.083
period of time, of course was invented
back when small meant make the text small.

47
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:04.037
Today that small has now been repurposed
into a meaning that means this is like

48
00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:05.112
the fine print.

49
00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:09.073
So this would be the legalese at
the bottom of your web page or

50
00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:10.906
the copyright statement.

51
00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.929
Something that's not necessarily
all that important but

52
00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.651
legally we've got to put it there,
so there you go.

53
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:18.317
There's my copyright statement.

54
00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:20.413
So that's why I use the small element for
that.

55
00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:24.877
If you didn't use the small element for
yours, absolutely fine,

56
00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:27.196
it's fine with just a paragraph.

57
00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.585
Notice that as I make my page bigger and
smaller,

58
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.486
that image does change a little bit here.

59
00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:37.713
I have a little trick in the CSS that's
going on that shows you different

60
00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.909
parts of the image as I changed this.

61
00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.473
So let's look at the CSS for
that piece of it.

62
00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:52.134
Okay, so here in the footer I have my
layer of footer that's set up here

63
00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:56.542
automatically and then inside
of that we have my footer style,

64
00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.807
very similar to the other
sections that we've seen before.

65
00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.220
I'm centering my text,
I've added some padding.

66
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.507
I gave it a background color of black
just in case, for whatever reason,

67
00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:09.562
the image doesn't load quickly.

68
00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:14.480
Then we have the image itself,
don't repeat it, center it on the page.

69
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.442
The line of code that makes it do this
thing where, it's showing different

70
00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:24.114
parts of the image is this line right
here, background size of cover.

71
00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:29.637
And so what that's going to do is
basically take the image that's here and

72
00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:34.999
resize it such that it's filling in
the space that's available to it.

73
00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.821
Because the dimensions of the viewport
here are changing different,

74
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.507
it needs different amounts
of image in order to show.

75
00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:46.501
And that's why like when
it gets small like this,

76
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:50.708
you can actually see the island and
the sunset down here at the bottom,

77
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:54.799
as opposed to when it is wide,
when you see just the stars on the top.

78
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:57.944
If you didn't have that line of code,
that's not the end of the world.

79
00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:03.155
What it would look like is this instead,
you would see the stars swirling around,

80
00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:06.417
and it would pretty much
be the same no matter what.

81
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.475
You would just have the swirl kind of
scrolling off the side of the screen, and

82
00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:12.422
that works absolutely fine as well.

83
00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:14.972
There's nothing wrong with that, but

84
00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:19.992
I just really like the sunset down at
the bottom, so I added that line of code,

85
00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:24.416
which dealt with the layout of that
image a little bit differently.

86
00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:28.852
Then finally down here at the bottom,
we have our footer, ul, so

87
00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:32.009
of course I had all of my
icons inside of a list.

88
00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.118
So we did all the same things that we
did before with the navigation bar.

89
00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:40.725
We've turned off the padding and I guess
I've left a little bit of margin on

90
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.737
the top and bottom so
that those icons stand out.

91
00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:46.770
We've set them up with Flexbox,
they show up in a row.

92
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.378
They have a little bit of a gap in between
them so that we have plenty of room for

93
00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:52.613
for clickability.

94
00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:57.042
We have made our SVG is turned white and
they are green when you hover over them.

95
00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:01.960
And that pretty much takes Care
of the footer for the web page.

96
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.843
It's a lot.

97
00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:07.456
It's a lot, but we've talked about
all those lines of code before.
