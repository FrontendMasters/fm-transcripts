00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:04.161
The next thing to do here,
if you scroll on Chapter 2 and

2
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:08.699
you scroll past the comment,
we are at Chapter 2, you try it.

3
00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.999
That means you try it, okay?

4
00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.488
So what I want you to do is I
want you to code the contact

5
00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:20.171
me portion of this
webpage all on your own.

6
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.683
You can do this.

7
00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:24.504
So we're gonna go through
that same exact strategy.

8
00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:29.914
Look at the text in the HTML block,
change the text to reflect your own life.

9
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.677
Then you're gonna mark up
all that text with HTML,

10
00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:38.664
adding a section in a container
around the text, make an at layer for

11
00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:44.637
your contact styles, okay, and then
you're gonna add the styling to the page.

12
00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:48.678
And I've given you here the Aurora
background image URL is right there.

13
00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:52.994
So you can have this background image,
sound good?

14
00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:57.661
So if you take a look at
the beginning code pen here right,

15
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:02.341
all this stuff styles that we
already wrote are in there.

16
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:06.234
Change the contact me in
whatever way you wanna change it.

17
00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:08.597
And then you're gonna have
to mark it up with HTML and

18
00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:10.056
then you're ready to style it.

19
00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:17.576
Let's take a quick look at
how I solve this problem.

20
00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:21.319
So if we scroll on down
here to our ENDING CODEPEN.

21
00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.750
This is the way that I wound
up putting this together.

22
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.394
So first of all,
always start up in the HTML and

23
00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:31.330
make any changes to this
text that you wanna make.

24
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.622
So if that didn't sound like you talking,

25
00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:37.837
you wanted to change these words in
whatever way, you're welcome to do that.

26
00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:39.254
Remember that we had to wrap it.

27
00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:40.828
A section around the whole thing.

28
00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:44.722
So I gave that a class of section
contact because it's a section and

29
00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:46.404
it's the contact section.

30
00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:51.607
I wrap my container around that that
will consistently keep this section to

31
00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:57.406
1200 pixels or less, and it will be
centered on the page when it's big enough.

32
00:01:57.406 --> 00:01:59.067
Right now I've got it kind of small.

33
00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:01.055
So you won't see that.

34
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:04.509
Contact me were the most important
words in this particular section.

35
00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.442
So those got the h2 and
the other two items, get a paragraph.

36
00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:14.140
And then the last part of this that you
may not be familiar with is making that

37
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.214
button, when you click it,
go email somebody.

38
00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:19.376
So this is kind of an old
school way of doing it.

39
00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:21.204
But it works just fine.

40
00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:25.373
You say a href,
just like you would for a link, and

41
00:02:25.373 --> 00:02:31.344
then you put the word mailto all one
word colon with your email address.

42
00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:36.390
And I gave that a class of button because
I want this to be styled differently.

43
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.349
So when I roll my mouse over it, okay,

44
00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.088
it's styled differently than the other
links that I have on the webpage.

45
00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:47.770
So that's my HTML markup.

46
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.915
Flatten this all up here.

47
00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:54.609
I added a layer with the name
of contact because that is

48
00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.064
the name of where we're working here.

49
00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:01.282
I set up my client class for
section of contact.

50
00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:04.195
I set all of the text
inside of this to center.

51
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:08.261
Remember, centering text is a little
bit different than centering a box.

52
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:10.380
If we wanna center a box in space,

53
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.998
we can use that margin 0 auto to center
that box in space, but with text,

54
00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:19.049
we use text align center in order
to center the text on the page.

55
00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.492
I gave it some padding.

56
00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.777
I used six rems.

57
00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.499
If you used a different number,
it's not a big deal.

58
00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.069
But basically you wanted a lot
of breathing room on the top and

59
00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.543
the bottom of the words.

60
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.733
And then for the background,

61
00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:37.522
this time it looks like I wrote all of
my properties in one single declaration.

62
00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:42.244
Remember just the word background
as a property, is shorthand for

63
00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:44.026
a bunch of CSS property.

64
00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:46.990
So, in this case, a background color,

65
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.664
a background image, and
a background position.

66
00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:52.445
All of those things I lumped together.

67
00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:55.701
So if you have a background
image with a URL,

68
00:03:55.701 --> 00:04:00.191
you have a background color maybe,
that would be optional.

69
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.922
Add a background position
of something on the page.

70
00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:05.108
Maybe you use percents for that.

71
00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:09.126
I use center and center so
that centered it left and

72
00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:14.880
right centered it up and down,
all that would be just fine for answers.

73
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.287
And then I set my color here for
the text to white.

74
00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:23.385
Then I did a little bit of
magic here at the very end,

75
00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:30.036
P last child, that is kind of
a wacky looking thing there, right?

76
00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:34.258
So, P, obviously is a paragraph,
right, section contact,

77
00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:37.540
that's the section that
we're talking about.

78
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.453
What would last child mean?

79
00:04:40.453 --> 00:04:43.336
It sounds very sad [LAUGH].

80
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:47.691
It's the last child,
lost little child paragraph.

81
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:49.491
What do we mean by that?

82
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:55.448
Okay, so if we take a look at our
various children that we have here,

83
00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:58.897
remember our HTML nests as we go in, and

84
00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:03.201
we're looking at the last
child of all of these.

85
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:06.899
This would be the last
paragraph child here.

86
00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:11.311
And for that, then we're going to
apply this style, margin-top 3rem;.

87
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.498
That gives us a little bit of space
between the paragraph and the button.

88
00:05:14.498 --> 00:05:17.135
So that's what that is doing.

89
00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:19.749
You could have done that
by creating a class for

90
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.246
that particular paragraph as well,
that would be just fine.

91
00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:25.203
So then we have the button styling.

92
00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:28.898
And you could put the button in
the contact part of your CSS here,

93
00:05:28.898 --> 00:05:33.554
but if you ever wanted to change that
button later, that particular button style

94
00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:37.886
is probably something that we're gonna
use a lot of places on the website.

95
00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:42.989
So I happen to probably put mine
here in the base part of our layers.

96
00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.430
If you put it in the contact,
it's absolutely fine.

97
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.236
This is just a matter of finding our code.

98
00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:52.122
So we scroll on down here.

99
00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:56.009
All right, so our button has a whole
bunch of styles associated with it.

100
00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.715
First of all, I've given a display
of something called Inline block.

101
00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:04.181
My goodness,
what do we mean by inline block?

102
00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:05.808
We have inline.

103
00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:07.308
We've talked about inline.

104
00:06:07.308 --> 00:06:10.766
What is that again?

105
00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:13.794
In line means it is as wide as?

106
00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:14.720
&gt;&gt; It's content.

107
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.850
&gt;&gt; It's content, right?

108
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.587
We have block which means It's as

109
00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:26.162
wide as the container, right?

110
00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:28.756
Then we have this weird
thing called inline block.

111
00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:33.790
We put those two things together and
what inline block says is it's gonna be as

112
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.671
wide as the content, but it also gives
us the ability to add some padding and

113
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:43.805
margin on the top and the bottom, which
inline elements do not permit us to do.

114
00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:46.979
So that's why that weird
inline block thing is there.

115
00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.232
If we were to take that out, I don't,

116
00:06:50.232 --> 00:06:54.625
I'm not sure that this
would be totally a tragedy.

117
00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:57.164
Yeah, it didn't really
change a whole lot there.

118
00:06:57.164 --> 00:07:00.532
But generally speaking inline block is
something that you're gonna see added to

119
00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:02.423
a lot of buttons for
that particular reason.

120
00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:06.583
You see Twitch a little bit there that
has to do with some of the spacing.

121
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:08.720
I gave it a background color of green.

122
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.645
I gave it a color of black.

123
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:14.329
Those are the standard colors here for
our button.

124
00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:18.887
I gave it a little bit of padding around
the edges I happen to use 0.8 rem.

125
00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:22.084
If you use one rem or
some other number, that's fine.

126
00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:25.386
I rounded the corners at
five pixels of radius.

127
00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:29.133
I turned off the underlying
text decoration of none.

128
00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:33.130
I gave it a font family
of the headline family,

129
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.243
the Josephin Sans, so
it should be uppercase.

130
00:07:37.243 --> 00:07:40.293
In fact, this table Text transform
of uppercase I probably really don't

131
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:40.992
actually need.

132
00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:42.844
I could get rid of that.

133
00:07:42.844 --> 00:07:44.619
I gave it a font weight of 600.

134
00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:50.395
I reduced its line height to only 1,
and I skipped right over our font size.

135
00:07:50.395 --> 00:07:51.413
I'm gonna come back to that.

136
00:07:51.413 --> 00:07:55.225
So you notice here for the font size,
I gave it a variable of small.

137
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.291
That means I had to set
up a new variable and

138
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.423
I'll walk you through that just a moment.

139
00:07:59.423 --> 00:08:02.518
And then on hover, all we're doing
is changing the background color.

140
00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:07.364
So when I roll my mouse over it, the
background color is gonna change to tan,

141
00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:10.186
everything else will stay the same, okay?

142
00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:13.221
So if you don't have all
that many properties and

143
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.597
your button still looks pretty good.

144
00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:19.881
It's a green button with black letters,
it kinda breeze has a little bit of

145
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:22.541
breathing room around it,
you did just fine.

146
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.048
That is absolutely great.

147
00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:27.925
You don't have to have everything like I
have perfectly because I haven't given you

148
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:28.701
a perfect spec.

149
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.162
I just sort of said make
it look kind of like this.

150
00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:38.449
So the font size with a very variable
of small, where does that come from?

151
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:45.234
Well, back up here in the root where I
have all of my variable declarations.

152
00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:49.162
You'll see here that I added
a new font size course.

153
00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.541
This is the size of small.

154
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:55.538
And so what I did here was I
calculated the base font size and

155
00:08:55.538 --> 00:09:00.190
instead of multiplying it by scale
which obviously makes it bigger I

156
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.554
divided by the scale which
will make it smaller.

157
00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:08.549
And I just set that up as a new variable
and assign that size to the button.

158
00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:11.936
&gt;&gt; Could you explain again
how text align works.

159
00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:18.257
&gt;&gt; Text align, so this is the question
of aligning text inside of a box.

160
00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:22.780
So this is not gonna align
other boxes inside of boxes.

161
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.948
So if you're doing flex box, if you're
doing grid, aligning those boxes and

162
00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:28.664
space is going to be different.

163
00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:33.222
But we are just talking about
the actual text itself.

164
00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:37.852
And let me go back to my style here.

165
00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:42.544
So this text align center is
going to align this actual text

166
00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:45.233
here in the center of the screen.

167
00:09:45.233 --> 00:09:46.685
If I changed it to right,

168
00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:50.223
this is gonna put my text over
on the right side of the screen.

169
00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:56.005
If I said left, it's gonna put it over on
the left side of the screen, make sense?

170
00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:59.766
And because I'm putting it
on the section itself, and

171
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:04.590
because this happens to be an inherited
property, the text align is,

172
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.686
it will affect everything inside of
this particular box, just the text.
