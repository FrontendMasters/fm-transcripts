WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.210
Now that we have our basic styling
setup for the whole website,

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.360
we are ready to move on to
working with some text.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.970
We've written a lot of styles
that pertain to text, so

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.930
let's get some styling in place.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.808
So here in chapter 2,
working with text what we are going to do

6
00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:19.000
is work on just this first
part of the web page.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.443
Just the common part of the webpage.

8
00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:26.011
So your name is your name,
you do something and there's some details

9
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:30.683
associated with that, and we need
to put a comment in the background.

10
00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:33.753
That is what we're going to be
doing in this next chapter.

11
00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:37.443
And you can refer to this picture
at any point in time along the way.

12
00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:40.655
So we're going to start here
with our beginning codepen.

13
00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.219
If you click on the link here at the top.

14
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.251
And you can fork it to your account.

15
00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:56.185
And let's start up here at
the very top of the document.

16
00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:01.067
So this is gonna follow a pattern that
you're going to see over and over and

17
00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:01.949
over again.

18
00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.087
The first thing that we always do is
we write our content for the website.

19
00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.706
We actually don't care
what this looks like.

20
00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:13.043
We're just going to have this
open to our HTML window and

21
00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:15.888
we are going to write in
here what we want to say.

22
00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:17.429
That is always our first step.

23
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.157
Second step, we mark up this
text once we've actually written

24
00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:26.165
what we want to say with
the appropriate HTML.

25
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:29.545
And then the third part is
that we style it with CSS.

26
00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:33.902
Now, in reality, you'll wind up going back
and forth a little bit between HTML and

27
00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:34.906
CSS as you do this.

28
00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:39.857
But this is a good basic pattern
that you can use on any website or

29
00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:44.436
anything else you ever build,
write your content first,

30
00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:48.432
then mark it up with HTML,
then style it with CSS.

31
00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:52.381
And by the way, then you add on
all the JavaScript to make it do

32
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.072
anything that's beyond what HTML and
CSS can do.

33
00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.512
That is the appropriate way to
put these web pages together.

34
00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:02.923
So if you take a look at
what you've got here.

35
00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:06.533
It just says, hi, my name is, your name.

36
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.828
I, whatever you happen to be doing for
work, you're teaching something,

37
00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:14.787
you're coding something, you are doing
whatever it is that you do for

38
00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:19.223
whomever you're doing it or
perhaps you're looking for a job.

39
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:23.069
So I'm gonna give you two minutes,
go through here and

40
00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.509
fill out this with your own information,
okay?

41
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:31.589
Just take out the things that are in the
brackets and put in your own information.

42
00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:36.405
Let's take a look then,
just I'm gonna refer here once

43
00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:40.822
again to my design,
that is in the course website.

44
00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:44.499
You can take a look at that at any
point in time to see what it is that we

45
00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.706
are going to be coding here.

46
00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.116
And let's look at our text again.

47
00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:53.769
So what is the most important
part of all of the stuff that

48
00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.186
we have here on the screen?

49
00:02:56.186 --> 00:03:00.865
What would you consider to be the the text
that is the most important and

50
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.225
the biggest focus?

51
00:03:03.465 --> 00:03:04.855
&gt;&gt; The first line?

52
00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:05.545
&gt;&gt; Could be the first line.

53
00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:11.424
Anybody else have any other opinions?

54
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.367
What do you think, Lia?

55
00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.131
&gt;&gt; Probably the second line.

56
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.803
&gt;&gt; You like the second line.

57
00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.976
Okay, so this depends,
honestly this depends,

58
00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:30.291
what is it that you wanna emphasize
about your particular website.

59
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:34.734
This doesn't have anything to do
with what is gonna be biggest or

60
00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:36.393
boldest or strongest.

61
00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:40.129
What is the biggest focus of
this particular story and

62
00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.570
that particular item we are going
to mark up with, in this case h2.

63
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.546
Now, h2, to me,

64
00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:50.160
it's I teach the web because I think
that's the most important part.

65
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.150
If you prefer to make your first line h2,
that's totally fine too.

66
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.181
I think you can make an argument for that.

67
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.585
Why h2 and not h1?

68
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:02.541
I'll answer that question for you.

69
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.801
h1 would be the most important
thing on the web page.

70
00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:07.351
And that's actually
the name of the website.

71
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.781
That's not included here
in the introduction.

72
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:12.360
If you remember looking at
the site at the beginning,

73
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.351
we actually had a logo in
the upper left-hand corner.

74
00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:17.801
That will eventually be marked up with h1.

75
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.141
There's only one h1 on the web page.

76
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.386
So after that, what is the second
most important thing on the page?

77
00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:26.526
There's actually probably a few of those.

78
00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:30.126
This particular item is going to be the
second most important thing on the page.

79
00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:31.926
So I'm gonna mark that up with an h2.

80
00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:34.696
What about the rest of these things here.

81
00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:37.146
What would you call this if you
were writing an English paper.

82
00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:39.176
&gt;&gt; Paragraphs.

83
00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.200
&gt;&gt; You'd call them paragraphs.

84
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.991
What do you think?

85
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:44.310
They look like paragraphs, don't they?

86
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.050
All right, let's mark ' up as such.

87
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.120
This is the way HTML really works.

88
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.670
Hey, look, it's a paragraph.

89
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.930
Let's mark it as a paragraph.

90
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.641
So that's one of the things
that you may wanna do.

91
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:02.448
Another thing you may wanna do is you may
want to include some links here inside of

92
00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:03.541
your documents.

93
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.709
So for example,
I'm the Director of Learning Design and

94
00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.425
Technology at AnnieCannons.

95
00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:10.991
Perhaps I want to link to my employer.

96
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:14.051
So I may want to put in a link here.

97
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:17.832
So I'm going to say,

98
00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:26.455
a href="https://annie cannons.org".

99
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:31.214
And I'm also gonna add

100
00:05:31.214 --> 00:05:39.495
target="_blank" Annie Cannons.

101
00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:41.688
And maybe I want another one of these for
Frontend Masters.

102
00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:46.638
Now, it's also possible that you, maybe
you don't have any links that you want to

103
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:51.462
include here and that's totally fine too
if you'd prefer not to include links.

104
00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:56.598
You can just hang on a second while
the rest of us put in some links here,

105
00:05:56.598 --> 00:05:59.761
if that's something that we wanna do.

106
00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:03.273
So here, this is Frontend Masters.

107
00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:11.503
All right, now what I always tell
people do as soon as you put in a link,

108
00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:13.618
the next thing you wanna do is test it.

109
00:06:13.618 --> 00:06:16.539
So if you pull this on
over here to the side,

110
00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.798
make sure that you click on those links.

111
00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:21.903
Make sure they open in a new window,

112
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:26.127
make sure they load the webpage that
you're expecting to load, okay?

113
00:06:26.127 --> 00:06:28.207
So yep, there's AnnieCannons, and

114
00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:31.717
when I click on Frontend Masters,
there's Frontend Masters.

115
00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:35.017
So that is all working exactly correctly.

116
00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:37.744
If they're not working correctly,
you may need to go back and

117
00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:38.957
revisit your URLs, okay.

118
00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:42.014
How is everybody doing so far?

119
00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:43.741
Okay, cool, all right.

120
00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:45.891
So now the next thing that I wanna do.

121
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:50.750
Now that I have my content in place, and
I have the basic markup in place, usually

122
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.341
what we're gonna wanna do in web design
is group all of this stuff together.

123
00:06:55.341 --> 00:07:00.024
So if we're gonna create a section
like this, we're going to want to

124
00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:05.310
include some HTML elements that
go all the way around that thing.

125
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.880
And these days I've moved to
including two of those elements.

126
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.480
So I'll show you how I tend
to mark these things up now.

127
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.910
Let me take my comment out.

128
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:23.056
I'm gonna add a section with a class
of intro because that's what this is.

129
00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:31.179
And we're using the section element
because it's a section of the webpage.

130
00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:36.846
Here we go, all right?

131
00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:42.732
And if this is looking a little
bit hard to read for you,

132
00:07:42.732 --> 00:07:45.613
one of the nice things that CodePen has,

133
00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:50.865
in the little down arrow here right
next to the HTML, if you click on that,

134
00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:55.753
you can say Format HTML, and
that'll do the indenting for you.

135
00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:59.143
The other nice thing that's there
is the Analyze HTML feature.

136
00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:02.554
If you click on that,
it will do a check for you and

137
00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:05.977
make sure your HTML is
formed in the correct way.

138
00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:07.987
You've not made up a bunch of tags.

139
00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.853
You've closed things, that kind of thing.
