00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.581
Chapter 3 is where we
get a little bit funky.

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:04.718
We are going to build our navigation bar,
and

3
00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:07.410
we're gonna build it
with a hamburger button.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.012
So this is fairly advanced for
a lot of you, but

5
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:16.146
I think you're gonna find this helpful.

6
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.576
We're gonna start by building
the desktop layout, and

7
00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:22.000
then we're gonna make this progressive
smaller going down to mobile layout.

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.252
So if you open up your beginning CodePen,
and what I want you to do is,

9
00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:34.906
I want you to customize the text
that's here inside of this window.

10
00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:39.964
So obviously,
you're gonna put in your name,

11
00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:43.637
as I say here in the instructions.

12
00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:46.193
If you wanna include all this stuff,
if you don't,

13
00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:48.527
you can just include links to homepages.

14
00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.244
So include a link to your LinkedIn,
to your GitHub,

15
00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:54.783
maybe a link to your online resume.

16
00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.833
If you've got it in Google Drive or if
you've got it in Dropbox or someplace like

17
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:03.015
that, make sure it's publicly accessible
if you want people to be able to see it.

18
00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:07.314
I've given you some places where
you can set up links for projects,

19
00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:08.755
about, and contact.

20
00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:15.467
Add your name to the text on the page,
and then mark up all of this stuff.

21
00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:20.432
But for right now, what I would just
like you to do to get started is

22
00:01:20.432 --> 00:01:24.032
just to put in your name and
set up the links.

23
00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:26.299
Don't worry about the rest
of the markup yet,

24
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.751
I'm gonna go through that
with you momentarily.

25
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.191
Welcome back, hopefully,
you managed to find all those links and

26
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:41.264
modify the navigation to reflect
what you wanna show on the website.

27
00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:43.596
Here's what I have for my answer.

28
00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:48.748
So I have a linking to index.html for
my name.

29
00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:51.098
Because, usually,
when you click your name,

30
00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:54.304
this would just gonna wind up
being the logo of the website.

31
00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:56.667
When you click that,
it's gonna go back to the homepage.

32
00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:01.418
Now, if you were to click that link
right now, you would get an error.

33
00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:02.516
And that's because,

34
00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:06.542
of course, index.html doesn't exist
anywhere here inside of CodePen.

35
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:10.223
It will exist when we get to
taking things out of CodePen and

36
00:02:10.223 --> 00:02:14.822
putting them into VS Code, which
we're gonna do later in the workshop.

37
00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:20.299
I've got my projects linked and my about
links set up and the contact link,

38
00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.194
all of those, again,
same issue with not working right now.

39
00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:29.640
The ones that have that pound or
hashtag signed with the word projects and

40
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.824
contact, does anyone know what that is?

41
00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:35.910
It looks kind of weird,
we have index.html, and

42
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.616
then we have index.html#projects,
what does that mean?

43
00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:43.366
&gt;&gt; That lets you jump to a specific
part of the web page, right?

44
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.266
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

45
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.396
&gt;&gt; That you have marked as projects or
contact.

46
00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:49.294
&gt;&gt; Exactly, you are exactly right,
that is exactly it.

47
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:54.848
So we are going to mark somewhere here,
when we start assembling this page.

48
00:02:54.848 --> 00:03:00.809
We will put in the IDs, it's an ID that is
used for this, for projects and contacts.

49
00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.902
So when you click those,
you'll go to the homepage, and

50
00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:07.389
then skip to that part of the section,
somewhere there on that.

51
00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.435
And, of course,
I have links to LinkedIn and GitHub,

52
00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:15.351
I have those opening in separate windows,
that's what that target="_blank" is.

53
00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:19.328
Remember to put the underscore
in front of blank, very, very,

54
00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:22.865
very important,
to have this open in a new window.

55
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:26.018
If you say target="blank"
without the underscore,

56
00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.910
you are creating a new
window that is called blank.

57
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.997
As opposed to target="_blank",
which means, simply, open in a new window.

58
00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:39.824
So if you set up a whole bunch of these
with target="blank", no underscore,

59
00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.864
you'd wind up loading over
that page every time.

60
00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.730
So I'd see my LinkedIn,
then I'd load up the GitHub, and

61
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.203
then I'd load up the resume.

62
00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:51.298
As opposed to the underscore, in which
case, I'll still open new tabs for

63
00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.269
all of those.

64
00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.198
So that's one of the big differences
between _blank, which is a reserved

65
00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:02.376
word kind of thing, and blank, which
could be just a custom name for a window.

66
00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:07.666
And we have this all set up as links right
now, everybody good, for the most part?

67
00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:14.006
Fantastic, so let's go through how we're
gonna wind up marking up the rest of this.

68
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:18.027
This is ultimately going to be
the header of our homepage.

69
00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:23.142
So can anyone make a suggestion as
to what might be a good element to

70
00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:28.267
wrap all the way around these things,
the header of our web page?

71
00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:29.674
&gt;&gt; The header element.

72
00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:33.083
&gt;&gt; Really, you think,
how about the header element?

73
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.643
So we are going to put
header up here on the top.

74
00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:45.952
So header, and
then after all of the items there,

75
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:50.459
we can put in a /header, great.

76
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:56.138
Okay, then, for my name, that is
the most important thing on the webpage.

77
00:04:56.138 --> 00:04:59.374
Because this is the name of my website,
it's I'm Jen Kramer,

78
00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:01.480
this is my portfolio, yes?

79
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.500
So what would be an appropriate element
to use for this particular item?

80
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.835
Most important thing on the page would be?

81
00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:10.740
&gt;&gt; h1.

82
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.281
&gt;&gt; h1, so this is gonna have
an h1 around it, h1 and a /h1.

83
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:26.333
Okay, fantastic, the rest of these items
here, what are all of these links?

84
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:28.670
These are ultimately going to be a what?

85
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:37.753
Navigation bar, yes, so what would be a
good element to use for a navigation bar?

86
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:38.518
&gt;&gt; nav.

87
00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:40.311
&gt;&gt; How about nav?

88
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:45.001
So we're gonna perhaps
nav around all of that,

89
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:48.293
because that is our navigation.

90
00:05:48.293 --> 00:05:52.571
Now inside of that, we have a whole
bunch of links, what are these links,

91
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.402
what is this?

92
00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:58.748
It's a list of links, yes,
they can be visited in any order, yes?

93
00:05:58.748 --> 00:06:03.661
What would be a kind of element that
we could use to mark up a bunch

94
00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:06.458
of things I'm linking like a list?

95
00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:11.309
An unordered list,
anyone have a suggestion for

96
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:14.633
an element for that, ul, yeah.

97
00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:19.249
So we're gonna put in a ul here,
unordered list, and

98
00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.365
we're gonna end then
after all of those links.

99
00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:30.185
And then, of course, what are we going
to do for each of these list items?

100
00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.420
What are we gonna give it?

101
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.359
&gt;&gt; li.

102
00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:38.835
&gt;&gt; li?
&gt;&gt; li, for list item, yes, okay, so

103
00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:45.529
let's go through and
put in all of those list item links.

104
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.749
And there we go, and then we're gonna
close all those list item links,

105
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.147
copy, copy, copy, paste, paste, paste.

106
00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:05.822
Great, and then we can clean up our HTML,
format it, and there it is.

107
00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:08.568
Okay.

108
00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:12.386
So a few things here.

109
00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:17.384
I have not included my section around all
of this or used the header as my section,

110
00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:20.131
I have not included my container.

111
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:24.764
Ultimately, what's going to happen
as we build out this web page,

112
00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:28.892
this header is going to go inside
of my intro comment image.

113
00:07:28.892 --> 00:07:32.165
So if you remember,
if we take a look at the,

114
00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:41.023
Back here, we take a look at
our final version of this.

115
00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:45.387
My navigation is ultimately going
to be part of that introduction,

116
00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:47.703
the intro part of the web page.

117
00:07:47.703 --> 00:07:52.460
And so, this is gonna have to go inside
of that section of, what do we call it,

118
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.813
section intro.

119
00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:56.094
It's gonna have to go
inside of the container,

120
00:07:56.094 --> 00:07:59.243
so I'm not gonna include those
elements right now in my CodePen.

121
00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:03.980
I just wanted to remind you this is
ultimately how it's going to look.
