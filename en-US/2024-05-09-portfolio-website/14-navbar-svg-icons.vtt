00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.843
Before I go about changing my name and
making it smaller and

2
00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.510
all that kinda stuff,
let's put in our graphics.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.443
Because if we take a look at our navbar
again, instead of the words LinkedIn and

4
00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:16.928
instead of the words GitHub, what I
actually want here are the icons for

5
00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:17.750
those.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.853
And I wanna add a cool
comment icon next to my name.

7
00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.983
You, of course, can choose whatever
kinda icon you want, all right?

8
00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:30.970
And so the way we're going to do that is
we are going to go to fontawesome.com.

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.206
And even if you are not a fan of Font
Awesome in terms of using it from a font

10
00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:42.169
perspective, this will give you all of the
icons as SVGs and they are free to use.

11
00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:45.389
And so that is the way we
are going to use these today.

12
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:47.433
What is an SVG?

13
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.479
What does that stand for, SVG?

14
00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.892
&gt;&gt; Scalable vector graphics.

15
00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:56.362
&gt;&gt; Scalable vector graphics,
what the heck does that mean?

16
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.518
Graphic, we're pretty clear on, yeah?

17
00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:03.973
What does the vector mean?

18
00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:09.783
&gt;&gt; You can zoom as much or as little
as you want and it still looks crisp.

19
00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:14.207
&gt;&gt; It looks crisp and beautiful,
right, because it's drawn with math,

20
00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.839
not with pixels, right?

21
00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.861
So like a picture, you can zoom in and

22
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.935
it looks fuzzy eventually
cuz it's drawn with pixels.

23
00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:25.399
But vector graphic is drawn with math,
and so you can zoom in indefinitely.

24
00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.039
It's like a font in that way.

25
00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.409
So we have math equations describing
curves and things behind a vector.

26
00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.069
And what does scalable mean?

27
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.069
Scale it, yeah?

28
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.549
Okay, so that's a scalable vector graphic.

29
00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.894
So here in Font Awesome,
we wanna use the free version of this.

30
00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:48.341
So if you go up at the top here to Icons,
and

31
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.994
then you can search these icons.

32
00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:55.924
I'm gonna type in LinkedIn
into my search box here.

33
00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.930
And then if you choose Free,
it will filter those for

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.515
you and
show you the free versions of LinkedIn.

35
00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.323
And I don't know why StayLinked
is in there, but anyway,

36
00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:10.945
you have a choice between what
kind of icon you wanna use.

37
00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:14.268
I'm gonna use the first one,
the one in the box, okay?

38
00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.040
And if we click on that,

39
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.715
it's gonna show you how you could go
about including this in your document,

40
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:26.699
you have to hook up the font to
the webpage, et cetera, et cetera.

41
00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.921
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna go to SVG here.

42
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:35.091
And this is gonna give us the SVG code for
the LinkedIn icon.

43
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:40.914
And if you click this, right, it will say
that it has copied it to your clipboard.

44
00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:44.561
And now we can go back to our pen and

45
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:49.770
go back in our navbar on
the HTML side of things,

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.461
and where you have the word Linkedin here,

47
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.392
okay, you can paste your SVG code.

48
00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.619
And it'll look really,
really wacky, and that's okay.

49
00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.647
Format your HTML afterwards, too.

50
00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:16.427
Okay, so did it work?

51
00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:20.977
Well, what we have going on here
right now is there is an icon here.

52
00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.025
It's clickable, but SVG, by default,
has a dimension of zero by zero.

53
00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:30.289
[LAUGH] So it's there, but
you can't see it because it has

54
00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.949
scaled its little vector cell font down so
small that you can't see it.

55
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.459
So don't panic.

56
00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.620
Let's just leave it there for the moment.

57
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.334
And now what we're going to
do is grab the GitHub icon.

58
00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:43.774
So we're gonna do the same thing.

59
00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.538
I'm gonna do a search here for GitHub.

60
00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:51.964
And the free version.

61
00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:55.624
And there are choices
here to be made as well.

62
00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:59.599
I think the one I had was the square
one to match my LinkedIn one,

63
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.661
which was also square, but
you can pick whichever one you want.

64
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.440
And then we'll go to SVG and
we're gonna copy that one as well.

65
00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:13.488
And then we're going to
go back to our CodePen.

66
00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:16.770
We're going to find the word GitHub here.

67
00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:21.516
And that's where you
can paste in your SVG.

68
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:28.310
And you do not have to worry about
what that says at all, okay?

69
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.508
That says make a GitHub icon.

70
00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:33.238
We don't particularly care what that says.

71
00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:37.488
And then finally, the last one
is an icon to go by your name.

72
00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:43.018
And I think the one that I use, I think
I typed in comment and got the meteor.

73
00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:45.538
Yeah, I got the meteor here.

74
00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:51.688
If you wanna use a different icon,
there are 2,000 free ones to choose from.

75
00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:53.749
Feel free to look through them.

76
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.418
Take as much time as you want.

77
00:04:55.418 --> 00:04:56.259
It will be a while.

78
00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.112
[LAUGH] It's one of those things
that you can spend a lot of time on.

79
00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:01.915
But I'm just gonna use the meteor here.

80
00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.375
And once again,
I'm gonna go to the SVG tab.

81
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.445
I'm going to copy that.

82
00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.903
And then I'm going to
go back to my webpage.

83
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:18.425
And next to my name,
I don't actually want to replace my name.

84
00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:19.975
I want it to go next to my name.

85
00:05:21.157 --> 00:05:24.874
So I am going to paste in my SVG.

86
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:28.627
And then it will say Jen Kramer and
it will look like this.

87
00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:30.133
And that one turned black.

88
00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:33.367
What happened here?

89
00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:34.807
Why is this one black?

90
00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:36.087
&gt;&gt; The header color?

91
00:05:36.087 --> 00:05:38.317
&gt;&gt; The header color, maybe.

92
00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:39.344
How about the h1 color?

93
00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:41.114
You're very close.

94
00:05:41.114 --> 00:05:44.768
The h1 we know is black, okay?

95
00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:47.874
The other ones later,
we don't really have a color set.

96
00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:51.114
So they're actually kind of
displaying really, really small.

97
00:05:51.114 --> 00:05:55.702
So here, this is the meteor taking
on those dimensions of the h1.

98
00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:57.944
[LAUGH] So it's really super big.

99
00:05:57.944 --> 00:06:00.164
It scales up to a ridiculous size.

100
00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:01.039
That's what's going on here.

101
00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.439
Cool, all right, and then the last
thing I wanna do here before we go and

102
00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:13.959
style everything, let's scroll
to that last link in our navbar.

103
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.538
And this is the resume link.

104
00:06:16.538 --> 00:06:21.481
I want to add to this a class of button,

105
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.425
class="button".

106
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:29.189
And because we coded that earlier,
you should wind up with a beautiful green

107
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:34.038
button right there on your page when you
add class of button to the a tag there.

108
00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:37.388
So right here, class of button.

109
00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:39.817
Did it work?

110
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:44.004
Fantastic, let me ask you
an accessibility problem here,

111
00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:49.448
which is that we have these SVGs now that
are taking the place particularly for

112
00:06:49.448 --> 00:06:55.366
LinkedIn and for GitHub, and we don't
have that text that's there anymore.

113
00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:59.445
So if I was a screen reader, how would
I know that those are LinkedIn and

114
00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:04.240
GitHub elements or tags that are gonna
take me somewhere, to LinkedIn or GitHub?

115
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.160
How would I know?

116
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.370
Anybody?

117
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:13.780
The answer is you have no way of knowing
what you're going to go to right now.

118
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.367
So if a screen reader was reading this,
it would read off projects, about,

119
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:19.883
contact, link, link.

120
00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:22.113
It wouldn't know what those were.

121
00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:27.003
So let's give the screen reader
something to indicate what this is.

122
00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:34.983
So back here at the top again where
we go to our h1, a href="index.html".

123
00:07:34.983 --> 00:07:39.753
We're going to add an attribute here that
some of you may be familiar with, aria.

124
00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:43.624
Aria always has to do with accessibility.

125
00:07:43.624 --> 00:07:46.344
It's usually followed by a hyphen and
something else.

126
00:07:46.344 --> 00:07:51.317
In this case,
it's going to be aria-label=, and

127
00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:58.662
I'm going to say click for home so that
people know when they click this link,

128
00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:03.082
it's gonna take them to the homepage,
okay?

129
00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:04.985
That's one thing that we can do.

130
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:09.475
And then for the SVG itself, and

131
00:08:09.475 --> 00:08:14.794
this is that meteor SVG, what we can do

132
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:20.624
is add to this aria-hidden="true".

133
00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:25.828
So what this does is the screen
reader will read the link and

134
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:30.118
know that this is a link that's gonna
take you to the homepage, awesome, and

135
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:32.224
it will skip right over the SVG.

136
00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:35.711
Because the SVG is really for
people who can see it and go,

137
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:37.609
wow, cool, it's a comment.

138
00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:41.941
Didn't really have any other purpose
on my page other than it's fun to look

139
00:08:41.941 --> 00:08:42.705
at, right?

140
00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:44.935
Yes.

141
00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:49.545
&gt;&gt; So we don't use the alt attribute
because it's not an image technically.

142
00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:53.195
&gt;&gt; Correct, exactly, and
we're going to be hiding them anyway.

143
00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:55.255
They are eye candy.

144
00:08:56.785 --> 00:09:00.481
Okay, so then we're gonna do
the same thing here with LinkedIn.

145
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.481
So when I get to my link here for
LinkedIn,

146
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:15.422
I'm going to add to this
aria-label="LinkedIn".

147
00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:26.765
And then for the SVG associated with
it inside of that first SVG tag,

148
00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:32.049
we say aria-hidden="true", okay?

149
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:36.115
Alt text, of course, is great when you
have an image that is adding something to

150
00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:39.469
this webpage and that it's
communicating some kind of meaning.

151
00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:45.564
In this particular case,
these images are really eye candy and

152
00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:48.685
by using the aria, what was it?

153
00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:53.594
The aria-label property here,
this is giving us the text

154
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:58.211
that the screen readers need in order for
this to work.

155
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:02.817
And this is what the accessibility people
are recommending, to make SVGs accessible.

156
00:10:02.817 --> 00:10:08.527
So I bow to their knowledge
on this particular point.

157
00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:10.457
So then, of course,
we're gonna do this one more time.

158
00:10:10.457 --> 00:10:14.449
We're gonna do this for GitHub.

159
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:18.942
Aria-label="Github".

160
00:10:21.062 --> 00:10:24.832
And in the SVG itself,

161
00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:33.617
aria-hidden="true".
