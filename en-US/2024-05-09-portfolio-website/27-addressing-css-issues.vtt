WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:04.597
The next thing to do is to preview this
page inside of our web browser and

2
00:00:04.597 --> 00:00:07.989
see how things are looking,
how they're working,

3
00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.552
what's blown up,
what kinda problems we need to fix.

4
00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:16.615
So make sure you have your HTML
web page open here to start with.

5
00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:21.122
And then what we're going to do is,
hopefully, if you've got it installed,

6
00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.174
you can right-click somewhere and

7
00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:26.409
you should have the option to
open in a default browser.

8
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.833
So if you don't have Open in Default
Browser as an option, you can add it.

9
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:35.181
We're going to go to the bottom
icon here on the left-hand side,

10
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:37.008
it's called Extensions.

11
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:45.364
If you click on that, you should do
a search here for open in browser.

12
00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:51.820
And when you do that search for
open in browser, you are going to look for

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.077
the option that is called open in
browser and it's put out by TechER.

14
00:00:58.077 --> 00:01:00.811
It should look something like this,

15
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:05.142
open in browser version 2 TechER,
something like that.

16
00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:09.159
And then there should be an Install
button or something, and

17
00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.640
you should just click it and
it should just install.

18
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.272
Did it work, worked?

19
00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:16.330
Okay, awesome.

20
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.926
So once it's installed, then you should
be able to right-click somewhere and

21
00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:24.609
then choose Open in Default Browser.

22
00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.675
Does everybody have that option now?

23
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:28.530
Perfect, okay.

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.954
And my default browser is Firefox,
so that's how it's gonna look.

25
00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:37.042
So here's what we've got going on.

26
00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.728
So you should have a white nav bar,
it's there.

27
00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:45.718
[LAUGH] It's just white
on white background.

28
00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:49.573
You should have your featured project.

29
00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:53.129
That's looking pretty good.

30
00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.017
You should have your other projects,
that should be looking okay.

31
00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:00.959
Contact me should be okay,
the footer at the bottom should be okay.

32
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.973
So basically everything except for
the very top part of this webpage.

33
00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:10.100
Why did the nav bar quote not work?

34
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.419
Does anybody have any ideas?

35
00:02:14.693 --> 00:02:15.789
Did it really not work?

36
00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:25.540
Remember we actually wanted
the nav bar to be on top of

37
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.557
that comet image, and right now,
our nav bar is where?

38
00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:38.980
Where is that comet image located
in your code, in your HTML?

39
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.780
Do you remember?

40
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:45.033
&gt;&gt; In the intro?

41
00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.998
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a background for intro.

42
00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:51.365
Okay, so let me flatten up my HTML here.

43
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:56.777
So this section with a class of intro
has got the image of the comet on it,

44
00:02:56.777 --> 00:03:02.663
and then the container is reducing
the maximum width of the webpage, right?

45
00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:07.013
So what we need to do is we need to
take our header here that we put

46
00:03:07.013 --> 00:03:10.792
at the very top of our document,
header to /header.

47
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:15.240
I'm going to cut and
I'm going to paste it inside of

48
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.626
the container before Hi,
my name is, whatever your name is.

49
00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:24.595
So after container before that
paragraph with, Hi, my name is,

50
00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:29.161
whatever your name is, I'm gonna paste
in that whole header right there.

51
00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:39.649
Okay, And once you've done that, then you

52
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:44.600
can open in your default browser again,
right-click &gt; Open in Default Browser.

53
00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:53.442
Woo hoo, did it work?

54
00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:57.320
Yay, okay, and now you can test this

55
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.088
a little bit if you wanna
make this narrower.

56
00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:05.783
Test the responsiveness of this.

57
00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:09.647
Okay, there's the nav bar adapting.

58
00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:14.333
Scroll down the page, take a look at other
things, see how they're adapting, make

59
00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:18.699
sure all of that is working correctly,
and then squash it up a little bit more.

60
00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.891
Check out your hamburger button.

61
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.827
Oops, something going on here, okay?

62
00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:29.127
So you can have absolutely perfect
code in each one of those code pens.

63
00:04:29.127 --> 00:04:30.994
When you reassemble things,

64
00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:34.734
sometimes we have a few little
things that break like this.

65
00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:40.659
And largely, those little things that
break are gonna be due to the cascade,

66
00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.410
the big C in CSS, and inheritance.

67
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.309
So somewhere along the way here, we have
some white text overriding our green text

68
00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.503
that was here, and we're gonna need
to fix that particular problem.

69
00:04:52.503 --> 00:04:55.533
So we'll just kind of remember that.

70
00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:57.255
But otherwise, it's looking pretty good.

71
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:01.725
And when we get down super small,
however small you can get,

72
00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:04.978
things are otherwise looking pretty good.

73
00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:08.448
You should be really proud of yourselves,
okay?

74
00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:11.469
Now, we're ready to add
some final tweaks here, and

75
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.426
then our web page is gonna be done.

76
00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.880
So let us do that real quick.

77
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.607
Inside of your style sheet, okay, and

78
00:05:18.607 --> 00:05:23.081
I'm gonna scroll all the way back
up to the top of my style sheet.

79
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.200
I'm gonna flatten a bunch of things here.

80
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.673
So I'm gonna flatten up my base.

81
00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:31.007
Inside of my header,

82
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:36.388
I have here a header style, okay?

83
00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:41.180
And to this header style,
remember that header is

84
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.096
now inside of the intro
section that we have there.

85
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:50.736
I am going to add to this

86
00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:56.609
a margin-bottom: 6rem.

87
00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:01.856
So what this is going to do is that
header is now inside of the comet image.

88
00:06:01.856 --> 00:06:04.396
And what we have going on at the moment,

89
00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:12.301
Is my navigation is all pretty
closely squashed into my text here.

90
00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:18.728
So by adding the 6rem margin-bottom, it's
gonna give me a little bit more height.

91
00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:23.226
And when I refresh the page,
if I save my files first.

92
00:06:23.226 --> 00:06:26.541
This is always the hard part for me,
is remembering to save my files.

93
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.073
How about you?

94
00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.437
[LAUGH] It didn't work.

95
00:06:29.437 --> 00:06:30.556
Why didn't it work?

96
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.049
Yeah, I have to save.

97
00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:34.878
How do you know you haven't saved but
you've made changes?

98
00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:38.053
Does anybody know?

99
00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:39.441
&gt;&gt; That little circle there.

100
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.534
&gt;&gt; That little circle right there, okay?

101
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:45.729
So if you see the little circle, you have
a file that is not yet saved in VS Code.

102
00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.775
That is the number one mistake we all
make when working with individual files.

103
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:56.233
So make sure you save your work first and
then things work much better.

104
00:06:56.233 --> 00:07:01.137
So now when I refresh the page, and
I have to refresh the right page.

105
00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:04.899
That's the next problem to fix.

106
00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:08.352
Now, when I refresh the page, then I have
a little bit more breathing room there,

107
00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:09.715
that looks a little bit better.

108
00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:11.990
Everybody okay?

109
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.775
Okay, the other thing is
I have a note here that I

110
00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:21.093
changed the intro style just a little bit.

111
00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:30.125
So if we scroll down to our intro styles,
which was a separate layer,

112
00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:37.902
right now, I have the background-position
on my intro style is 86%, 20%.

113
00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:41.143
I have a note here to change that to 10%.

114
00:07:41.143 --> 00:07:43.837
For whatever reason I
thought that looked better.

115
00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:46.230
So let's see if that's true.

116
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.348
So for me, it's around line 356 in my CSS,

117
00:07:50.348 --> 00:07:55.111
change the background-position to 86% 10%.

118
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:59.332
And let's see if that looks better.

119
00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:02.097
Makes the top a little bit more readable,
I kinda like it.

120
00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:05.633
If you don't like it,
you can change those numbers, right?

121
00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:07.948
Great thing about CSS.

122
00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:11.009
Okay, now the next thing
we have going on here

123
00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:15.531
is we have some weirdness going on
with our navigation items here.

124
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:21.459
So when I roll over Jen Kramer,
my avocado meteor here

125
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:26.617
turns green, okay, but
Jen Kramer does not.

126
00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:33.332
We have projects and about and
contact that don't turn green on rollover,

127
00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:37.604
but the SVGs for LinkedIn and
GitHub, they do.

128
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:42.648
My button here for resume is in
white text, not in black text.

129
00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:46.874
And when I roll my button over here,
the background colour is changing, but

130
00:08:46.874 --> 00:08:48.269
it's still white text.

131
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:52.755
And as we've already established,
when I make this really small, and

132
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:57.611
I take a look at the mobile version of
this, we've lost all of the text here and

133
00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:59.583
we have no hover state either.

134
00:08:59.583 --> 00:09:03.834
Okay, so generally speaking,
when stuff like this happens,

135
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:07.133
this has to do with the cascade,
as I mentioned.

136
00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:13.070
And it happens to be,
if we take a look at our CSS,

137
00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:22.461
Right now, I have header first and
I have intro second.

138
00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:26.209
If I have styles set up inside of intro,
right,

139
00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:31.289
they could also apply to the header
at this point in time, true?

140
00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:39.379
So if I have, for example,
intro a, color white,

141
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:44.067
that could very easily
override some styles

142
00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:48.770
that I have up here, like header a, right?

143
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:54.848
Header a hover, change it to green,
and certainly down here in the nav,

144
00:09:54.848 --> 00:09:58.648
let me get down to the nav,
wherever it went.

145
00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:03.854
So there are a lot of places in here where
we may have some conflicting styles.

146
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:09.250
The simplest solution to this problem
that I found was actually to take header,

147
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.032
that whole entire layer.

148
00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:16.606
I'm just gonna highlight that whole thing,
collapse like this,

149
00:10:16.606 --> 00:10:20.695
cut and
I'm going to paste it right after intro.

150
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.263
Okay, so there was a ton of code, but
I've just rearranged those two layers.

151
00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:35.178
So intro comes first and
header come second.

152
00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:37.666
And I'm gonna save my style sheet.

153
00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:42.945
And then I'm going to go back to
Firefox and we'll take a look.

154
00:10:42.945 --> 00:10:47.144
And now,
I have hover states that work here again,

155
00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:50.668
see how easily that fixed all my problems.

156
00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:54.849
All I did was just rearrange
some things in my code, okay?

157
00:10:54.849 --> 00:10:58.129
My button is back to black text again.

158
00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:59.393
How awesome is that?

159
00:11:02.112 --> 00:11:08.292
Okay, so something to remember is that,
and all this styling is back here as well.

160
00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:12.490
So something very important to remember
is that as you are copying in,

161
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.903
especially when you're copying from
all these separate code pen files,

162
00:11:16.903 --> 00:11:20.266
that sometimes your CSS may,
quote, get out of order.

163
00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:23.523
If you're coding everything
as a single document,

164
00:11:23.523 --> 00:11:25.751
that's not going to happen to you.

165
00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:29.428
Because when you start adding styles and
quote, they don't work,

166
00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:33.504
you know there's probably something
in the ordering of your style sheet.

167
00:11:33.504 --> 00:11:36.998
That is the cascade is
being impacted in some way.

168
00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:41.015
With this copy paste thing,
we don't necessarily know what's going on.

169
00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:43.708
So we just have to
experiment a little bit.

170
00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:46.359
And so this solved all of our problems.

171
00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:50.777
So we are almost completely done.

172
00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:54.369
Do we have questions at this
point in time from anywhere?

173
00:11:54.369 --> 00:11:57.287
There's only one thing that we
are left missing on this document and

174
00:11:57.287 --> 00:11:59.655
I'm gonna walk you through
that here in just a moment.

175
00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:06.609
&gt;&gt; Why did the behavior change
when we brought it into a VS Code?

176
00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:09.140
&gt;&gt; Well, we had always looked
at these elements separately.

177
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.732
&gt;&gt; I see.

178
00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:11.287
&gt;&gt; Right?
We never saw them together.

179
00:12:11.287 --> 00:12:12.847
&gt;&gt; We never put everything together.

180
00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:14.727
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And now we're getting a few conflicts.

181
00:12:14.727 --> 00:12:17.244
Yep.
That's why we have some other things

182
00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:18.907
happening here.

183
00:12:18.907 --> 00:12:19.407
Okay.
