00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.016
So congratulations, at this point in time,
you now have two pages.

2
00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:09.849
You have a home page, you have an inside
page, they're commendable across devices.

3
00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.917
And it is amazing looking portfolio
with all kinds of different images,

4
00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:18.750
all kinds of different colors and
it's ready for you.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.569
So what I hope you'll do with these
particular layout is, I hope that you

6
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:28.072
will think about what story you want
to tell about your own career and

7
00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:29.871
your own portfolio.

8
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:34.351
Swap in some screenshots,
swap in little bits of code.

9
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:38.141
Swap in whatever makes sense to
tell your story in the best way.

10
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.045
You'll have a very cool looking portfolio,

11
00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.464
something a little bit different
than everybody else has there.

12
00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:47.370
You can even swap in different images
in the space images that I've used for

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.574
images that are meaningful to you and
for your life.

14
00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:55.190
So congratulations on making your
two page website with HTML and CSS.

15
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.216
And I look forward to seeing you in
another course here at Frontend Masters.
