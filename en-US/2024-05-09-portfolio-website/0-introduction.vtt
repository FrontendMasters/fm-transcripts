00:00:00.313 --> 00:00:01.329
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.690
I'm Jen Kramer, Director of Learning
Design and Technology at AnnieCannons.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.740
We are going to be building a portfolio
site using only HTML and CSS.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.429
And this course is designed mostly for

5
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.760
people who have less
experience with HTML and CSS.

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.703
They need to beef up those particular
skills and come up to date with what's

7
00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:28.786
going on, what are the latest things that
we're doing in the HTML and CSS space.

8
00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.866
I'm going to walk you through
the whole entire website.

9
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.119
We're gonna break it
down into small pieces.

10
00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:37.256
We're gonna work on small
pieces one at a time.

11
00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.826
All the way through is
a series of CodePens,

12
00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:42.815
which is an environment
where you can write HTML and

13
00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.985
CSS write there inside of your
web browser, nothing to set up.

14
00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:51.961
And then we will reassemble those in
VS code, which is your code editor,

15
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.935
where you can create whole web pages.

16
00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:59.085
And we'll create both a homepage and
an inside page.

17
00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:02.426
The actual assets that we'll be
using to put this together or

18
00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.673
my courses here at Frontend Masters.

19
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:05.753
So I'm building a website.

20
00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.413
It's all about me in the work that
I've done here at Frontend Masters.

21
00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:13.953
But if you would like to substitute your
own work, I strongly encourage that.

22
00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:18.699
So, be prepared to think about what
kind of work you might wanna include

23
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:20.353
in a site like this.

24
00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:24.192
Some screenshots, maybe a little bit of
text and swapping your own stuff, and

25
00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.629
you'll have a website that will
be absolutely perfect to you.

26
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.655
Or you can follow along with
the stuff that I've given you, and

27
00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:32.779
just concentrate on learning HTML and CSS.

28
00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.639
Either way, this is gonna work out great.

29
00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:38.959
&gt;&gt; Chad online says,
I'm excited to learn CSS.

30
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.385
&gt;&gt; Yay, we're excited to learn CSS.

31
00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:42.559
It's totally awesome.

32
00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.274
And this website is going to walk you
through everything that you're going to

33
00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:47.941
need for this particular course.

34
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.223
We have a listing of all of the chapters
that are here on the side that

35
00:01:52.223 --> 00:01:55.053
we will be working through one at a time,
and

36
00:01:55.053 --> 00:02:00.202
you can read a little bit more about the
course over here on the left-hand side.

37
00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:02.942
Let me show you the site we're
gonna build before we get started.

38
00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:04.216
Right here from the home page,

39
00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:06.981
there's a button that says view
the website that will create.

40
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.741
We have a space themed website,
cuz who doesn't love space?

41
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:13.631
So here is the website.

42
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:19.191
You'll see that we have sort of an opening
area where you can identify yourself and

43
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.511
talk about what you do.

44
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.996
We're gonna go on to a featured project,

45
00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:27.123
maybe have a great big
huge screenshot here.

46
00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:31.161
We talk about the kinds of technologies
that you use to build that along with

47
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.483
the description of that particular item.

48
00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:37.753
Then we're gonna have some
projects that we're proud of.

49
00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:41.093
Maybe you have like three projects
that you're really proud of.

50
00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:45.898
And you'll notice that we have these
cool little overlays here to give us

51
00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:50.701
the title of that project, and again,
some of the technologies used for

52
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.176
it and some smaller screenshots
down here on the bottom.

53
00:02:55.176 --> 00:03:00.445
Scroll down a little further, we've got
a contact area, and then down the way down

54
00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:06.570
here on the bottom we have a footer here
with information about how to contact you.

55
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.441
Just to show you real quick what this is
gonna look like at different breakpoints

56
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:16.330
cuz, of course, we have to make this
work on different types of devices.

57
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.643
So we do have this setup
to go to a tablet kind of

58
00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:24.624
layout where things are more
stacked on top of each other.

59
00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:26.331
Very nice.

60
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:31.823
All right, and then, of course,
we're going to go to mobile,

61
00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:35.714
and at mobile will be really,
really small.

62
00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:40.615
Notice we have a lovely hamburger button
here with a full working hamburger

63
00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.464
menu and guess what?

64
00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:43.927
It's all CSS.

65
00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:45.850
No JavaScript in this site at all.

66
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.527
So I will show you how to
make this cool thing happen.

67
00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:50.439
And again,

68
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.047
everything is all stacked on top of each
other all the way down to the bottom.

69
00:03:56.017 --> 00:03:59.827
There is also an inside page, which we'll
build right at the end of the course.

70
00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:03.899
If you click on the link here in
the navigation that says Magenta Lime,

71
00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.461
this will take you to
the Magenta Lime page.

72
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:11.162
This happens to be the project that
we built as part of the practical CSS

73
00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:15.878
layouts course, which is a more
advanced CSS layouts course.

74
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.218
Here we are with a video to start us off.

75
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:24.800
And then we have some additional images
from that website here underneath.

76
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.641
And of course,
that's also mobile-compatible.
