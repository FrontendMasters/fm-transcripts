WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.242
So let's start here in the header and
find my article.

2
00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:10.338
So what we need to do here in the header
and in the intro, we know that

3
00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:15.990
the comment image was associated with
that section with a class of intro.

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.248
We actually wanna keep a lot of the
styling that's associated with intro but

5
00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:23.655
we need to swap the background
image out for something else.

6
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.047
One of the easiest ways to do
this is just add another class.

7
00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:33.173
So I'm going to call this
intro space stars, okay?

8
00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:34.903
So now I have two classes.

9
00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:37.610
So I have two classes
that are applied here.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.482
What this means is that all of the class,
all of the styles that have

11
00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:46.840
the intro class name will apply
to this part of the webpage.

12
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.818
And now I can make some
new class called stars and

13
00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:52.660
have styling with that,
it will also apply.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.211
If that comes later in the document,

15
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:58.929
then my star styling will
override my intro styling.

16
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.489
So that's the plan for
what we're gonna do here.

17
00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.372
So here under intro,
the intro section of my page,

18
00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:13.483
I can just continue on further
down in that particular

19
00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:18.044
section and
I'm going to add stars as my style.

20
00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:23.149
I can give this padding I want
the padding a little different

21
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.553
than what I had on the home page so
4rem 0 6rem 0.

22
00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:31.478
And then I'm going to need to
add my two background images.

23
00:01:31.478 --> 00:01:36.726
So because I'm swapping out my background
image of the stars and my previous

24
00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:42.222
intro had the two background images
the jagged background image and the comet.

25
00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:45.010
Now I need to swap out
both of those images here.

26
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.003
The jagged one will stay the same,
the stars image will become new.

27
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:53.895
So background image,

28
00:01:55.488 --> 00:02:00.128
Will be url and

29
00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:05.928
this is going to be

30
00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:15.928
../img/fem-featured-top.png,

31
00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:28.641
url will be ../img/

32
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:35.558
fem-stars-sky.jpg.

33
00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.661
And let me put on the word
wrap here as well.

34
00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:41.960
Okay.

35
00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:48.898
So one image is staying the same that's
the femme featured top, the jagged image.

36
00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:52.606
I just have to redeclare it because
I'm changing the other image.

37
00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.047
Then we can add my other styles here.

38
00:02:55.047 --> 00:03:00.435
So we have background-repeat, repeat,

39
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.850
x, no-repeat and

40
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.314
background-position and

41
00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:15.827
that is gonna be bottom

42
00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:20.349
center, top center.

43
00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:31.251
All right, then if we save that and take
a look at our web page, There's our stars.

44
00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:35.095
Yay, server hello that works.

45
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:39.941
Because I had two classes and
I had intro that had the comment came

46
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.716
earlier in my stylesheet,
stars came later in my stylesheet.

47
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:48.149
So because of those two classes
assigned to that same section,

48
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.994
whatever is coming later is going
to win in this particular scenario.

49
00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:56.897
So the stars override
the comment something deep and

50
00:03:56.897 --> 00:04:00.803
metaphysical about that I guess, okay.

51
00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:08.180
So then, A couple of other
things that I'd like to do.

52
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.967
I think that this text looks
a little bit long, and so

53
00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:17.407
I'd like to shorten that up a little
bit and there's an easy way to do that.

54
00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:23.213
The style again is gonna
be header plus article.

55
00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:26.774
So this is the article that
immediately follows the header.

56
00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:32.037
So in other words, not all the articles
in the document just any article that

57
00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:36.984
immediately follows a header element,
max-width of 500 pixels.

58
00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:42.319
So that will give us a max-width
on that text up on the top and

59
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.577
that just looks better.

60
00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:50.437
Now you can gaze into the abyss on
the right side of the page, okay?

61
00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:54.117
Awesome, let's move on to
styling the featured area.

62
00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:59.541
So here in my featured styles,

63
00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:08.372
Okay, so first of all,
in my featured styles.

64
00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:13.600
I have an iframe with a video
that's coming from YouTube and

65
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.413
as we saw, by default, this video is
very tiny, really, really very tiny.

66
00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:25.066
There is nothing here in the YouTube code
that indicates how big that particular

67
00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.112
video should be.

68
00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:31.523
So what I'm going to do is I am going
to add to this a class of YouTube.

69
00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:37.341
Okay, so I add that here in my HTML.

70
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:38.893
Now I have a class of YouTube.

71
00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:43.436
And then in my stylesheet in
my featured section here,

72
00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:46.299
just scroll on down to the bottom,

73
00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:51.262
before my media queries and
I'm gonna add a YouTube style.

74
00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:55.994
Now, part of the issue with
iframe's is that it is very hard to

75
00:05:55.994 --> 00:05:59.821
get these to scale in
a responsive kind of manner.

76
00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:06.355
But thanks to the aspect ratio,
we are able to get this to scale here.

77
00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:10.795
So the way to set this up is
a very cool trick for your videos.

78
00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:17.585
You can say aspect-ratio is
16 / 9 if you say 16/9 and

79
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:23.594
it's all together,
I think it doesn't quite work.

80
00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:27.252
You have to put the spaces in as well.

81
00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:32.476
So, that's a pretty typical aspect ratio
for a video so that's what we'll use here.

82
00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:36.571
We'll say width is 100%, okay?

83
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:42.045
And then we can give it some space
on the bottom, margin-bottom, 3rem.

84
00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:48.439
Okay, so
now when we take a look at our web page.

85
00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:54.492
We go from our tiny video to a nice
big video, isn't that great?

86
00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:57.919
So pretty, okay.

87
00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.126
Now, the next problem that we have
inside of our web page here in our

88
00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:06.935
featured section as we pointed out,
we have all of this styling that looks so

89
00:07:06.935 --> 00:07:08.455
great on the homepage.

90
00:07:08.455 --> 00:07:12.579
And it looks absolutely awful here on
this inside page, all these figures and

91
00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.681
figure captions and all the rest of it.

92
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:18.650
So let's use the same trick
that we just used in the intro,

93
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.660
where we had intro and
stars as two classes.

94
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.419
Here in our featured section, let's
also have two classes we can call this.

95
00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.530
Featured and project, okay?

96
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.274
So in our HTML, We

97
00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:40.188
can go to our featured section here.

98
00:07:40.188 --> 00:07:45.412
So I'm gonna call this
section featured and

99
00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:48.240
space project, okay?

100
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.167
So that'll give me a class that I can use
to neutralize some of this other styling.

101
00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:59.040
Now, in my CSS, what I can do here is say,
make sure you're

102
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.128
further down in your styling
here after the initial styling.

103
00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:09.908
We'll say .project, Figure

104
00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:15.432
remember it's set up to
display as Grid by default,

105
00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:20.210
so we'll say display block, turn that off.

106
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.599
And then for .project figcaption

107
00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:32.670
we can say background-color transparent.

108
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.507
Remember transparent is the key word
that means transparent [LAUGH] Take

109
00:08:37.507 --> 00:08:42.654
away all the color that I had there and
just make it nothing.

110
00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:47.608
Our color will be var black,

111
00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:52.906
And text-align will be left.

112
00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:55.845
Of course, these last two are overriding
some styles we had earlier.

113
00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:57.592
We had set the color to be white.

114
00:08:57.592 --> 00:08:59.391
We had set the text-align to be center.

115
00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:02.774
Now we're resetting these to black and
left.

116
00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:07.302
I am gonna press on at the moment and
continue on.

117
00:09:07.302 --> 00:09:10.839
Because we're gonna continue to make
a whole lot of changes here and

118
00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:12.150
this is going to change.
