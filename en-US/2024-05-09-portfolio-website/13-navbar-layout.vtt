WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.787
We are starting then from my name,
which is the most important thing here

2
00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:09.196
on this page, and we have our series
of links that come after this.

3
00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.659
So let's start styling all
of this wonderful stuff.

4
00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:19.701
So let's start by setting
up our layer @ layer nav.

5
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:23.753
And so this is of course, where our
navigation styles are going to go.

6
00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:29.317
And then the first thing that I
wanna do is I have here with nav,

7
00:00:29.317 --> 00:00:32.741
these styles here, this is all Lato,

8
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:37.458
right our inherited style
that comes from the body.

9
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:42.251
And if we take a look at my webpage,
should have left it open,

10
00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:49.845
We'll take a look at my webpage,
this font here is not lato.

11
00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:56.429
This is Josefin Sans, so we're gonna have
to change our text here to match that.

12
00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.114
So, I am just going to
use my nav element here,

13
00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:03.241
right here on the page and just say nav.

14
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:08.774
And I'm going to say my
font family is what.

15
00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:11.250
What comes next for my font family?

16
00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:14.454
&gt;&gt; Var.

17
00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:16.625
&gt;&gt; Var, yep.

18
00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:22.743
And headline is the name of
that particular variable.

19
00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:25.192
And I'd also like these all to be bold.

20
00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:30.299
So I am going to set those up with

21
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.628
font-weight of 600.

22
00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:38.583
Okay, and
it looks like it made it bold but

23
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:43.221
it doesn't look like
Josefin Sans got applied.

24
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:47.227
Heading, did I call it the right thing?

25
00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:49.289
So everybody makes mistakes.

26
00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.038
So I've called my variable here,
I called it headline.

27
00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:57.891
And in my declaration up here on the top,
it's actually a heading.

28
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:01.655
So if you call your variable by the wrong
thing in the computer, just ignores you.

29
00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.747
So, it happens to everybody.

30
00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.181
You can just fix your errors as you go.

31
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:10.260
So this is heading.

32
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:17.165
Heading, there we go, that's better, okay.

33
00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.064
Then for the ul of course with
all these to find bullets here,

34
00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:24.050
we don't actually want
any of those bullets.

35
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.307
We can get rid of those.

36
00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:28.213
So nav ul.

37
00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:32.126
I'm gonna turn off the margin, margin 0.

38
00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:35.432
I'm gonna turn off the padding 0.

39
00:02:35.432 --> 00:02:41.165
And I'm going to say
list-style-type of none.

40
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.334
And so that should show all of
your links all the way to the left

41
00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.988
edge of the page here because
we've removed the padding and

42
00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:57.569
the margin and
we have removed the bullets as well, okay.

43
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.866
And then the next thing
we can say is nav a, for

44
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:07.425
all those individual links,
text-decoration, none.

45
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:12.911
We don't want any underlines
on our navigation items.

46
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:15.163
All right, how are people feeling so far?

47
00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:17.007
Straightforward enough?

48
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:18.295
Okay, great.

49
00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:22.156
What if we make this go
horizontal instead of vertical?

50
00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:23.254
Wouldn't that be fun?

51
00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:25.394
That would be amazing.

52
00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:30.035
And what kind of technique
white we use to make this go

53
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.311
vertically across the page and why?

54
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.266
&gt;&gt; Flexbox.

55
00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:36.585
&gt;&gt; Flexbox I think that's a great choice.

56
00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.967
Why would you choose Flexbox?

57
00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:42.851
&gt;&gt; Because you don't really need to
you do any changes to the markup?

58
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.657
&gt;&gt; A fair point.

59
00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:47.520
You don't necessarily have to make
any changes to the markup but

60
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.544
that would actually be true for
Grid as well.

61
00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:51.537
Grid uses the same kind of markup.

62
00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:56.731
Flexbox is great to use when
you have a series of items

63
00:03:56.731 --> 00:04:03.710
of all different widths but
the spacing between them matters, okay?

64
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.879
So if you think about it,
a nav bar is a perfect example of this.

65
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.958
We have a bunch of items that
are all different widths.

66
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.081
We don't actually wanna make them the same
width because then it's gonna look

67
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:13.750
weird, right?

68
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.343
The space in between is the most important
part here, that that is the same.

69
00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:24.228
But the nav item names,
they are as long as they are.

70
00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:24.853
Okay.

71
00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:29.879
So to set that up then, here on our nav
ul, we are gonna apply these styles.

72
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:35.267
Because remember, Flexbox has a
relationship between parents and children.

73
00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:39.822
So if the lis are individual children
here, those are going to be the actual

74
00:04:39.822 --> 00:04:43.309
links that we're gonna see
going across horizontally.

75
00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:51.193
We want their parent to be where we
declare flex and that would be the ul.

76
00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:57.558
So we can do that here, more about
this in the Grid and Flexbox course.

77
00:04:57.558 --> 00:05:02.005
So we are going to declare display flex

78
00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:12.722
And we're going to say flex-flow row wrap,
okay?

79
00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:17.567
So that's gonna put it in a row and
they're adding the wrap to it means that,

80
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:22.488
I don't know if I can get this window
small enough, you all can see that this is

81
00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:27.593
wrapping on to another line, yeah,
instead of just scrolling off the screen.

82
00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:32.534
So that's what we're doing here,
telling it to go in a row, and

83
00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:38.772
we want them to wrap if it gets too long,
and then we're going to say gap of 2rem.

84
00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:45.474
So that's gonna give us spacing between
our links to 2rem is about 32 pixels.

85
00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:48.315
Remember that the selection space for

86
00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:52.407
fingers is something like 40 pixels or
44 pixels.

87
00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:57.042
So we wanna be sure to have enough
space for somebody's fat fingers

88
00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:01.946
clicking through on these links in
addition to mouse people, right?

89
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:04.738
So that's probably
a reasonable separation there.

90
00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:10.614
So now what we have is we have our name
and then we have a nav bar after it.

91
00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:12.964
Now if you like that
layout you can keep it.

92
00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:17.958
But what we are trying to do is put the
name over here on the left-hand side, and

93
00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:22.206
we're trying to put the nav bar
over here on the right-hand side.

94
00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:27.595
So, to set that up,
what we're going to do is take a look

95
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:33.005
again at what we have here for
our structure in our HTML.

96
00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:37.398
So we have a header,
the header has two children,

97
00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:43.268
the header has an h1 and
it has a nav bar that's actually perfect.

98
00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:48.080
If we use Flexbox,
we can shove that name to the far left,

99
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.791
and we can shove the nav
bar to the far right,

100
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.930
using the property of
space between in Flexbox.

101
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.932
So let's set that up as well.

102
00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:03.359
And I'm gonna put it up
here at the top after nav.

103
00:07:06.997 --> 00:07:12.484
I'm going to call this just header,

104
00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:18.503
display flex, flex-flow, row wrap.

105
00:07:18.503 --> 00:07:23.504
And then justify-content space-between,

106
00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:34.194
And assuming we get the screen big enough,
there we go.

107
00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:40.178
Make sure your screen bit's
big enough you should wind up

108
00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:42.680
with these two elements
next to each other.

109
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.692
Everybody happy?

110
00:07:44.692 --> 00:07:47.953
No, I can't imagine why.

111
00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:50.008
What's going on here?

112
00:07:50.008 --> 00:07:52.252
Kind of wacky looking, isn't it?

113
00:07:52.252 --> 00:07:55.989
Okay, so what did I tell you
to do when it looks wacky and

114
00:07:55.989 --> 00:07:58.282
you're not sure what to do next?

115
00:07:58.282 --> 00:08:00.856
Stick a border on it, right?

116
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:02.192
So let's stick a border on it.

117
00:08:02.192 --> 00:08:07.578
Border 2px solid red.

118
00:08:07.578 --> 00:08:09.545
We'll put that on the header.

119
00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:11.305
That's our big header there.

120
00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:13.985
Let's put one on the nav.

121
00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:21.316
Border, 2px dotted blue, okay?

122
00:08:21.316 --> 00:08:23.691
So there's the navigation over there.

123
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:29.444
And then let's go to our h1 and

124
00:08:29.444 --> 00:08:36.750
we can say border, 2px dashed green.

125
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.495
Okay, so can anybody kinda
describe what's going on here?

126
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:46.317
I imagine that this is fairly
subtle at this moment in time.

127
00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:54.351
So if you take a look at the h1 there,
remember the border is going to

128
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:58.681
be the divider between the padding and
the margin, right?

129
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:02.530
And we have a lot of space
between the border and

130
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.304
the red line which is our header.

131
00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:07.068
So what is that space?

132
00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:10.673
Is it padding or is it margin?

133
00:09:10.673 --> 00:09:11.390
&gt;&gt; Margin?

134
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.128
&gt;&gt; It's margin on the h1, okay?

135
00:09:14.128 --> 00:09:19.253
So all of our headings, remember,
had a bit of margin that went with them.

136
00:09:19.253 --> 00:09:20.952
They also had a line height.

137
00:09:20.952 --> 00:09:28.687
So something we might wanna do here
is try setting our margin to zero.

138
00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:30.309
That definitely helps some.

139
00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:32.774
See how we debug that.

140
00:09:32.774 --> 00:09:35.821
Okay, so that got that out of there.

141
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:40.751
And then the other thing that we
might wanna do is, think about,

142
00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:45.153
remember Flexbox lets us lay
things out in rows, right?

143
00:09:45.153 --> 00:09:50.704
So horizontally, but Flexbox also lets
us adjust things up and down vertically.

144
00:09:50.704 --> 00:09:54.907
And by default, it's displaying there
at the top of that particular line.

145
00:09:54.907 --> 00:09:58.746
We would actually like this to go
down a little bit further, right?

146
00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.802
Probably something more like a baseline.

147
00:10:00.802 --> 00:10:03.375
We can align the items to the baseline,
and

148
00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:06.245
we are going to do that
right here on the header.

149
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:10.706
Align-items baseline.

150
00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:16.076
Okay, so
that's gonna squash things on down there.

151
00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:20.428
And it'll line things up a little
bit better with what's going on with

152
00:10:20.428 --> 00:10:21.542
the name, okay?

153
00:10:21.542 --> 00:10:23.775
Now the alignment there is close,

154
00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:27.703
it's probably not a 100%
perfect at this point in time.

155
00:10:27.703 --> 00:10:30.496
I'm not gonna worry about that
particular issue right now.

156
00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:34.519
And the reason why is because
the h1 is still too big,

157
00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:37.925
we need to add some icons
here to this nav bar.

158
00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:39.491
There's some other
changes we need to make.

159
00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:42.387
So I'm not gonna worry about
a lot of fine adjustments yet.

160
00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:44.899
We may iterate back to
that in a little while.
