1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.560
So now you have two more of these.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.460
Can you guys go ahead and mark those up?

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
Okay, so can we take like five minutes?

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.608
Okay, what I would recommend
is just to copy the figure and

5
00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:20.874
then make your changes Okay,

6
00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:26.614
so hopefully, you were able to set up the
other figures with the other information.

7
00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:31.595
I did make a mistake in
the ARIA item that I have here.

8
00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:36.732
And so aria-label="hidden" is nothing,

9
00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:41.483
this should be aria-hidden="true".

10
00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:46.190
My apologies for that everybody has
things that they have to look up, and

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.213
I am not an expert on
the ARIA properties here.

12
00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:52.852
So this is aria-hidden="true".

13
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.487
So we'll just fix those real quick.

14
00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:05.812
Okay, and, so
just sort of as a quick kinda check,

15
00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:08.584
your page should look kinda like this.

16
00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.640
You should have really big pictures, and

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.934
then you should have like the title with
the, a bulleted list of skills underneath.

18
00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:18.202
So CSS projects, advanced CSS layouts and

19
00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:22.668
the bootcamp with HTML,
CSS and JavaScript underneath.

20
00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:25.354
Okay, the other items that
are down here at the bottom,

21
00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:26.849
don't worry about those yet.

22
00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.954
Those are for the tiny icons at the
bottom, we're gonna code those separately.

23
00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.221
But for right now,
let's code these first three.

24
00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:43.523
Okay, so now that we've got our HTML in
place, we're ready to dive into the CSS.

25
00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:48.661
I'm going to fold up all of
my various layers here, and

26
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.598
I'm going to add another layer at layer.

27
00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:57.124
And I'm gonna call this one projects,
cuz that's what this one is.

28
00:01:57.124 --> 00:02:02.176
And then inside of this,
we can start to add all of the various

29
00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:07.229
styles that are gonna be needed
in order to make this work, so

30
00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.988
first of all section-projects is where
everything is located here in our HTML.

31
00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:20.118
Remember that this is the section
that we have that's gonna encompass.

32
00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:22.716
Include everything that you see
here in the project section.

33
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.974
And that is going to include,

34
00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:34.416
First of all,
our background color is var black.

35
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.831
So immediately we will
not be able to read this.

36
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.619
Well done everybody.

37
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.720
Then we can add a little
bit of padding to this.

38
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
And I've got 6rem 0 4rem 0.

39
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.550
So remember again, TRBL,
remember the clock.

40
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.680
So this is the top is 6rem, 4rem goes on
the bottom, and 0 on the left and right.

41
00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:06.759
And then of course we need
to set our text color

42
00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.745
to var white so that we can see again.

43
00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:16.585
All right, so that sets up our big
section here outside of everything.

44
00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:22.970
Now, in terms of these images, for the
most part, they are roughly the same size.

45
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.422
If you are lucky enough to work
with images that are the same size,

46
00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:26.740
that's really great.

47
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.472
Everything will line up
beautifully if you are not so

48
00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:32.400
lucky to work with images
that are the same size.

49
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.331
One of the brand new tricks
that we can do with images

50
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:41.284
inside of our CSS is to use the object.

51
00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:46.434
It property that is going to make
these images ultimately the same size.

52
00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.312
When they appear inside of our grid,

53
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:52.604
they may look a little bit off until
we start to apply that styling.

54
00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:56.844
But for now,
just you'll have to trust my process here.

55
00:03:56.844 --> 00:04:01.164
So we're going to start with figure img,
so for

56
00:04:01.164 --> 00:04:04.728
the images that are inside of figures,

57
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:10.529
what we wanna do is we're
going to say object-fit:cover.

58
00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.603
This is the same kinda concept that
we saw with the background image,

59
00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:17.838
although the property is
slightly different there for

60
00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:22.904
background images than it is for
regular images on the page like these.

61
00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:27.825
The other thing we need
to do is add the width

62
00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:32.224
of 100% and a height of 100%.

63
00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:38.134
Okay, and
let's see if these look a little bit off.

64
00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:41.493
I don't think they're
obviously off at this point.

65
00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:43.083
But it's really hard to tell.

66
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:47.054
And ultimately these aren't really
the size that we're going to be looking

67
00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:50.652
at anyway, so you'll just have to
trust me that as we continue to work

68
00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:52.515
through this particular problem,

69
00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:56.943
this is going to help make our images
sort of uniform kind of sizes.

70
00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:02.050
Okay, then we can add to this
some styling for our figure cap.

71
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.670
So let me scroll down here a little bit so
you can see our figure captions.

72
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.180
And I'm gonna say figure a.

73
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.104
We'll make the color white.

74
00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:22.050
And we can say text-decoration none.

75
00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:26.228
Because we don't want any underlines, so

76
00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:28.897
you should now have just words there,
okay?

77
00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:35.275
And if I wanted to make these words green,
how would I set this up?

78
00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:36.351
What would be my selector?

79
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.692
Figure a:hover, yeah.

80
00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:53.482
There we go and then I would say, I wanted
to make it green, what would I say next?

81
00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:55.972
&gt;&gt; Var (--green).

82
00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:58.540
&gt;&gt; Var (--green).

83
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:06.311
Awesome, so if we scroll on down here,
we should have my screen text.

84
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:06.851
Okay, great.

85
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.949
Now, that I've got sort of
that basic stuff in place,

86
00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.971
let's style the actual
figure caption itself.

87
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:24.440
So I can just say,
big caption, the HTML element,

88
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.632
and I can say the background
color will be var black.

89
00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:37.365
Obviously, that's not really gonna show
too well here on the screen at the moment,

90
00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:41.807
you'll just have to trust me that
that background became black,

91
00:06:41.807 --> 00:06:44.570
I'm going to set the opacity to 0.8.

92
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.435
Remember that we have a sliding scale for
opacity, 1 is completely,

93
00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:55.456
the color is completely opaque, 0 is it's
completely transparent, so 0.8 means

94
00:06:55.456 --> 00:07:01.723
it's gonna be pretty heavy but you can
see some stuff through it, all right?

95
00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:05.560
And then text align center.

96
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.710
So we'll align all of
our text in the center.

97
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.210
There we go.

98
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.103
Okay, and then we can stay with the rest
of the text that's here inside of our

99
00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.510
figure caption.

100
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.157
We can say our fig caption h3,

101
00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:25.767
we wanted to I turn off
the margin on the bottom,

102
00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:28.863
so margin-bottom of 0.

103
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.987
And then for our figcaption ul.

104
00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:40.527
I need to get rid of the bullets,
and I need to get rid of the space.

105
00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.127
Does anybody remember how to do that?

106
00:07:42.127 --> 00:07:43.987
How could I get rid of the bullets?

107
00:07:43.987 --> 00:07:45.547
And the space that's pushing it over.

108
00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:46.723
What do I put in here for that?

109
00:07:46.723 --> 00:07:54.007
&gt;&gt; Something decorate,
I'm gonna turn that off.

110
00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:54.527
&gt;&gt; So which?

111
00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:58.107
&gt;&gt; It's like turning off like
the decorate or decorate none.

112
00:07:58.107 --> 00:08:00.777
&gt;&gt; Yeah, close, very, very close.

113
00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:08.371
It is a list style type none,
that'll turn off the bullets and

114
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:12.326
then padding: 0 margin: 0.

115
00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:23.027
And as soon as I do that, you'll see here
that we have projects we have HTML and

116
00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:28.020
CSS and see how little space we
have between CSS and the next item?

117
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.270
So we actually probably really
don't want zero on this margin.

118
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.240
We want zero in most places.

119
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.608
We want zero on the top,
zero on the right, but

120
00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:44.219
maybe we want like two rem on
the bottom and zero on the left.

121
00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.666
That's better,
now we have a little bit of space there.

122
00:08:50.888 --> 00:08:57.887
This HTML and CSS may not technically be
all that obvious looking at these, but

123
00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:03.700
that is the monofont family
that we have the Fierra Mano.

124
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.577
And so
that is the font we need to use there,

125
00:09:08.577 --> 00:09:13.333
so let's add that font-family is what?

126
00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:17.067
Var, yeah, mono.

127
00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:24.282
So that will make our HTML CSS look good.

128
00:09:27.332 --> 00:09:32.321
Just in case, like later, especially
where I've got my bootcamp down here and

129
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:37.837
I have the full word Javascript, I'd
actually like everything to be uppercase.

130
00:09:37.837 --> 00:09:45.176
So let's do a text-transform: uppercase.

131
00:09:45.176 --> 00:09:48.604
Obviously, that doesn't affect most
of these things, HTML, CSS, but

132
00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:50.976
it will help with the word JavaScript.

133
00:09:50.976 --> 00:09:56.025
And then finally,
my font-size can be var(--small),

134
00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:59.296
which we created a little bit earlier.

135
00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:07.548
Okay, so we are almost All the way there,
the last thing we need to do is put HTML,

136
00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:10.853
CSS, and
Javascript all on the same line, yeah.

137
00:10:12.803 --> 00:10:14.793
There are many ways that we could do this.

138
00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:19.603
Once again, we could use Flexbox or
we could use CSS grid, but

139
00:10:19.603 --> 00:10:24.600
there's actually a really simple
way of doing it where we always

140
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.410
just wanna have these things side by side,
and that is if we add

141
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.615
the style figcaption li and
we just say display: inline-block.

142
00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:42.636
And that will in fact put these things
on the same line just like that.
