00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:04.053
Now I know you're wondering what
these colors actually look like.

2
00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:07.436
Yeah, let's see what
these colors look like.

3
00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:08.504
So to do that,

4
00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:14.289
you know that in our HTML we have a series
of boxes up here on the top of the page,

5
00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.540
and they're called white black,
tan, green, light green and red.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.896
Just like the colors that you just set up,
but

7
00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.755
of course we don't see them
anywhere here on the page.

8
00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:30.451
Right now these DIVS have no height, no
width, and no color associated with them.

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.118
They're just coded here in place.

10
00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:36.238
We need to write some CSS so
we can actually see these.

11
00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:41.006
So to do that, let us start by,
and I'll just leave that

12
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.990
open a little bit like that so
you can see what's going on.

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.284
I need to make a whole series
of little boxes on the page.

14
00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:51.054
How would i go about doing that?

15
00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:53.331
Did anyone have a suggestion?

16
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:54.449
&gt;&gt; Make a list.

17
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.505
&gt;&gt; We can make a list, that would
certainly be one way of doing it.

18
00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:59.888
How else could i do it?

19
00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:01.227
Maybe a layout method?

20
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.317
&gt;&gt; Would it work in a table?

21
00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:05.145
&gt;&gt; Yes, tables, absolutely.

22
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:08.565
But we don't use tables
in this context anymore.

23
00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:11.864
This is now we've moved on to other
layout methods other than tables.

24
00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.287
So yes, tables would have solved
that problem but not anymore.

25
00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:17.230
No, not now.

26
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.877
&gt;&gt; Borders.

27
00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:20.692
&gt;&gt; Borders, yeah.

28
00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:22.775
Borders would be definitely part of this.

29
00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.338
How about Flexbox?

30
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:27.214
We want a bunch of little flexible boxes.

31
00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:29.963
Let's use Flexbox to put these together.

32
00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:34.115
So Flexbox works with parents and
children.

33
00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.413
So remember we have here a parent.

34
00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:38.605
This is our DIV with a class of colors.

35
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.781
Inside of that we have
a series of children.

36
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:43.436
They're called white, black, tan,
green, light green, and red.

37
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.560
Everybody see how those
are nested together?

38
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.453
Okay, so what we do then is,
on the parent, which is called colors.

39
00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:59.579
We're gonna set up a display of flex.

40
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.968
And again, absolutely nothing is gonna
happen because we haven't put in any

41
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.868
colors actually there in place.

42
00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:07.318
Then what we're going to do.

43
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.795
Is flex our selector muscles.

44
00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:20.799
And I'm gonna do one like this .colors
with a greater than sign and a star.

45
00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.989
Anyone wanna take a guess
at what that means?

46
00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.817
&gt;&gt; Any element nested in colors?

47
00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:27.768
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly so.

48
00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.240
Any element, that's what the star means.

49
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.252
Pretty much anywhere in code, anytime you
see a star, it means anything, all right?

50
00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:36.177
Same is true here in CSS.

51
00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:40.457
Anything and
we have .colors that comes first, but

52
00:02:40.457 --> 00:02:46.013
we remember that with the CSS
selectors we write them left to right.

53
00:02:46.013 --> 00:02:48.473
But we read them from right to left.

54
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:51.605
So you always start on the right
side of your selector.

55
00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:52.490
So anything,

56
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.151
and then we have this funny greater
than sign and then that class of colors.

57
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.854
Well, that greater than sign is indicating
the relationship between anything and

58
00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:02.398
colors.

59
00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.778
In this case we're saying all of
the children anything that is a child of

60
00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:11.158
colors, which would be all of these guys,
white, black, tan green,

61
00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.488
light green and red.

62
00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:16.537
We select them all at once, pretty cool.

63
00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:21.694
So now we're going to give this a width.

64
00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:26.693
Let's say 50 pixels and
a height, let's say 50 pixels,

65
00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:29.492
so we have lovely little squares.

66
00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:31.716
And you'll notice that my page
just twitched a little bit.

67
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.235
Those squares are on up there.

68
00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:36.343
You just can't see them yet.

69
00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:42.100
And we can give ourselves a little
bit of space in between these.

70
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.712
Probably the easiest way to do
that is say something like gap,

71
00:03:46.712 --> 00:03:51.688
something like 20 pixels, and
we put that on our flex property.

72
00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:53.671
That gives us the space in between.

73
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:58.432
And then we can say something like

74
00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:02.688
border 1 pixel solid black.

75
00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.474
There they are.

76
00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.335
How cool is that?

77
00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:07.750
You made boxes?

78
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.693
[APPLAUSE] It's the root of all CSS boxes.

79
00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.849
How are you doing so far?

80
00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.172
Good.

81
00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:19.762
Okay, so now let's look at your code.

82
00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:20.855
What have you got so far?

83
00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:23.825
You have variables for colors.

84
00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.260
And you have boxes.

85
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.416
How do we connect those colors and

86
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:32.275
the variables with the boxes
that currently have no color?

87
00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:35.068
How are we gonna put those
two things together?

88
00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:39.452
Those of you who know how variables
work in any other programming language,

89
00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:40.762
what do you need to do?

90
00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.296
Anybody have a suggestion?

91
00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:45.259
&gt;&gt; Someone's saying --var.

92
00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.955
&gt;&gt; Interesting idea.

93
00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:48.427
Yes, so not -- but

94
00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:54.151
we need to put this together somehow we
have to declare our various variables.

95
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:58.561
So the way we're gonna do that is we're
going to set up a series of classes,

96
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:01.928
because we already have those
classes there in our HTML.

97
00:05:01.928 --> 00:05:04.931
So we're gonna say white.

98
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:10.213
And then I'm going to say
background color is this

99
00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:16.011
var that the guy just mentioned,
var(--white).

100
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:17.628
And that was a really
bad one to start with.

101
00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:20.624
So let's just do another one real quick.

102
00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:26.721
Because you won't be able to see that, of
course I'm just gonna copy-paste that and

103
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:30.290
make this black with
a background color of black.

104
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.468
Now we have one square with color, okay?

105
00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:36.778
What just happened here?

106
00:05:36.778 --> 00:05:42.894
We have our class, which is white,
black, tan, green, and light green.

107
00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:47.079
We've set it up to have a background
color, a CSS property, and

108
00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:52.197
we're saying declare it as the value of
this variable, which I established up

109
00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:57.416
here at the top of my document, and this
is the way we make our variables appear.

110
00:05:57.416 --> 00:06:00.898
We say var and then inside of
the parentheses we say the name

111
00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:03.396
of our variable, in this case the color.

112
00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.709
So we're just gonna copy-paste
because we've made this easy for

113
00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.866
ourselves by calling these
all the same things,

114
00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:14.268
and let's just go through and
change these colors.

115
00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:16.049
So we have tan and tan.

116
00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:22.002
Green and green.

117
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:30.441
Light green and light green.

118
00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:35.464
Oops.

119
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:41.861
And red and red.

120
00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.595
Cool, that everybody gets pretty colors.

121
00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:56.987
Super simple.

122
00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:58.240
Always a great way to start.

123
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.598
You can just copy code right out
of the CSS that we wrote here, and

124
00:07:02.598 --> 00:07:05.434
you can start any webpage just like this.

125
00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:08.338
Show what the colors
are gonna be on this webpage.

126
00:07:08.338 --> 00:07:10.682
Any questions on that so far?

127
00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:14.004
&gt;&gt; On said,
my boxes are showing up vertically, and

128
00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:18.446
it's not working when I use are only
if I put the color in by myself,

129
00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:21.461
&gt;&gt; Okay, if the boxes are showing up

130
00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:27.495
vertically, make sure that you have
a class here called colors and

131
00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:33.221
inside of colors it says display
flex with a little bit of a gap.

132
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.135
I suspect that's something
that you might have missed.

133
00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:39.886
Make sure the spelling is correct
computers are really strict about

134
00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:40.950
spelling, okay?

135
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.256
So the colors in your HTML has to match
your colors here inside of your CSS,

136
00:07:46.256 --> 00:07:48.493
so make sure that's in place.

137
00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:53.737
And then in terms of your variables, make
sure you set those up with colon root,

138
00:07:53.737 --> 00:07:58.276
not just the word root, make sure
there's a colon in front of it, and

139
00:07:58.276 --> 00:08:02.841
then make sure all of those names
have a double dash in front of those.

140
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:05.768
Generally speaking,
when things, quote, don't work.

141
00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:11.201
It's tends to be these syntax
errors here along the way, okay?

142
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:13.895
Make sure all of
the semicolons are in place.

143
00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:15.946
Make sure all the colons are in place.

144
00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:20.986
Computers are really picky
about these things, okay?

145
00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:24.133
Any other questions online?

146
00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:26.289
&gt;&gt; You forgot tan.

147
00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:27.579
&gt;&gt; I forgot tan.

148
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:29.339
I did forget tan.

149
00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:31.274
Thank you.

150
00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:36.504
Tan, tan I didn't set up the color here,
did I?

151
00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:38.026
No worries.

152
00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:39.176
Tan.

153
00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:41.180
Thank you for pointing that out.

154
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.065
What was my tan color?

155
00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:48.627
b6b57b.

156
00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:49.721
There we go.

157
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:50.593
There's tan.
