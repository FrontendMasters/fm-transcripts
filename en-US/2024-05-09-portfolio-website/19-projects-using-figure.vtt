WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.379
We have two big chunks of this webpage
left to go at this point in time.

2
00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.183
We have the project section and
we have the featured section.

3
00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:07.873
I'm gonna start here
with the project section.

4
00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.554
Now I'm going to let you code
the featured section on your own, and

5
00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.449
then we'll be ready to assemble this
into a homepage for the website.

6
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.519
So here is the project section to
remind you what this looks like.

7
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.188
On the Desktop,
we're going to have a big headline here,

8
00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:26.488
projects that I am proud of.

9
00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:31.603
And behind that, we are going to have
the following arrangement of things.

10
00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.224
So we have one giant picture here.

11
00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:37.610
Notice that it has a bar
across the bottom here.

12
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.386
It's kind of semi-transparent,
it has the name of the item,

13
00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:43.392
this is the CSS projects course.

14
00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:48.040
And then it has the technologies used
underneath of that, HTML and CSS.

15
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.977
Likewise over here for
advanced CSS layouts in the boot camp,

16
00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:55.317
we have those as well, okay,
next to it stacked up.

17
00:00:55.317 --> 00:01:00.269
And then underneath of this we
have five individual icons,

18
00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.624
I guess, for these particular
courses down here at the bottom.

19
00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.574
After that, on the left hand side here,
I have the tablet,

20
00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:13.610
we're gonna wind up stacking
those images there on tablet.

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.092
Then we're gonna do this crazy thing down
here at the bottom where we have three

22
00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:20.744
across and two underneath of that, and
everything is centered and looks lovely.

23
00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:24.414
And then on mobile, basically everything
will just stack on top of each other.

24
00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:26.934
So that is where we are heading and

25
00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:32.968
you have these reference images here to
look at as we start coding, make sense?

26
00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:34.149
Are we ready?

27
00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.577
[LAUGH] It's a lot.

28
00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:41.534
Okay, so down here,
let's start with our desktop layout.

29
00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:46.643
Actually, the Codepen button is
up here at the top of the screen.

30
00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:48.235
So let's start with that.

31
00:01:55.046 --> 00:02:00.593
So here at the top of the screen, what we
have basically, every single one of these,

32
00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:05.146
the first three, these are those
three boxes that you saw on the top.

33
00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:09.273
So we have an image, a link,
a course, title, and skills.

34
00:02:09.273 --> 00:02:10.150
That's what these are.

35
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.981
So there's your image, there's your link,
there's your course title,

36
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.725
and there's your skills.

37
00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:19.903
So let's go through and
markup one of these together.

38
00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:28.036
And then I'll turn you loose to
markup the other two on your own.

39
00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:30.474
Okay, so to get started here in our HTML,

40
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:34.251
let's start by setting up our
section just like we have before.

41
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:41.201
This is a section with
a class of section-projects.

42
00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:46.624
So that is gonna be
the section of the webpage, and

43
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:50.330
then somewhere down here at the bottom,
we will have a /section.

44
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.513
Awesome.

45
00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:01.614
Guess what the next thing I'm
gonna put in after my section?

46
00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.803
Div with a class of container.

47
00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:13.008
Yep, div class=container, Okay?

48
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:16.008
And then, down here at the bottom,

49
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:22.921
/div, Okay?

50
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.216
What's the most important thing
inside of this section of projects?

51
00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:33.216
What would be the title of the section?

52
00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:34.138
&gt;&gt; Projects that I am proud of.

53
00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:38.397
&gt;&gt; Projects I am proud of,
guess what that gets.

54
00:03:38.397 --> 00:03:41.295
How about an h2?

55
00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:42.718
Here's my h2.

56
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:50.717
Phew, okay,
that was very straightforward, yeah?

57
00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:53.059
Look how much you're learning.

58
00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.631
All right?

59
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:55.506
So now comes the next one.

60
00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:57.920
We need to have a little box.

61
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.894
It's gonna have our picture.

62
00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:02.882
It's going to have
the word CSS projects and

63
00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:06.371
it's gonna have the skills
that go with it, okay?

64
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.519
So we have a picture
associated with some text.

65
00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.605
What would be a great way to mark this up,

66
00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:20.389
quite possibly one of my most
favorite HTML constructs?

67
00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.794
How about a figure?

68
00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:26.762
Yeah, how about a figure which associates
our image with some text that describes

69
00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:27.558
that image?

70
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:32.402
So what I'm going to do here,
I'm gonna take out my

71
00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:37.257
little comment and
let's start our first figure.

72
00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:42.184
So it starts with the figure element and
it ends with a /figure, okay?

73
00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:43.614
That's the first part of the figure.

74
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:52.623
Then inside of the figure,
we are going to have an image.

75
00:04:52.623 --> 00:04:54.769
And the source for
that image is gonna be what?

76
00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:00.925
&gt;&gt; Coffee.

77
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.455
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how about this one right here?

78
00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:10.206
In this assets codpen,
coffee, blah blah blah, okay?

79
00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:14.302
What else should I have here?

80
00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:16.913
&gt;&gt; The alternate
&gt;&gt; Alt text.

81
00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:22.535
So my alt attribute will have
the following description.

82
00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:26.818
Something like, I don't know,

83
00:05:26.818 --> 00:05:33.474
CSS projects course, Okay?

84
00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:36.588
So that's the image.

85
00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:40.133
And then underneath of that,
we're gonna have a figure caption,

86
00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:41.348
which is figcaption.

87
00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.748
/figcaption.

88
00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.380
Okay.

89
00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:56.789
So inside of that, we are going to have,

90
00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.518
somehow we're gonna put
this text in there.

91
00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:05.958
The CSS projects with HTML and CSS.

92
00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.219
So CSS projects looks like a headline,
doesn't it?

93
00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.151
It's the name of the course.

94
00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:14.120
So how should we mark that up?

95
00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.182
&gt;&gt; Paragraph.

96
00:06:19.182 --> 00:06:20.879
&gt;&gt; Sorry?

97
00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.354
&gt;&gt; Put the p down?

98
00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:25.245
&gt;&gt; It could be a paragraph, but
it's actually kind of important,

99
00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:26.645
it's the title of the course.

100
00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:27.890
So it could be a?

101
00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:31.824
How about an h3?

102
00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:39.422
Okay, so there we go, there's our h3.

103
00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:40.884
That's the name of the course.

104
00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:45.938
And then we have HTML and
CSS, what would this be?

105
00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.729
&gt;&gt; H2, h4?

106
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.242
&gt;&gt; Well, they're not really headings, it's
kind of like a list of skills, isn't it?

107
00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:58.886
So how would we markup a list of skills
that go in any particular order.

108
00:06:58.886 --> 00:06:59.530
&gt;&gt; Ul.

109
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.069
&gt;&gt; Ul.

110
00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:05.325
&gt;&gt; How about a ul [LAUGH]

111
00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:08.989
/ul.

112
00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:14.519
Okay, and then each one of those
skills then would get an li.

113
00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:17.222
So the important lesson
to take away from this,

114
00:07:17.222 --> 00:07:20.667
a little bit of text here that
I've just put here on the page,

115
00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:24.883
is that your clients don't always
give you beautifully formatted text.

116
00:07:24.883 --> 00:07:28.578
They just said CSS projects-HTML, CSS.

117
00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:32.702
And it's up to you to figure out, well,
CSS projects, that's the title of

118
00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:36.902
the course, HTML and CSS, those are
possible skills that are part of a list.

119
00:07:36.902 --> 00:07:40.856
And you have to figure out these
parts as to how you mark them up.

120
00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:42.431
Okay, great.

121
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:49.176
So then the last thing here that
we're missing is we need to have,

122
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.406
Something that's clickable.

123
00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:59.292
And so I have this link here,
that's a link to the course.

124
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:04.585
I'm gonna I cut that, the first thing
I wanna do is make my image clickable.

125
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:11.313
So a href equals that web address,

126
00:08:11.313 --> 00:08:15.258
target= _blank.

127
00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:23.398
And then if I put a /a after my image,
now I have a clickable image.

128
00:08:23.398 --> 00:08:24.923
Yeah, makes sense?

129
00:08:24.923 --> 00:08:28.796
And then we may also want to make our
text clickable here inside of our figure

130
00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:29.358
caption.

131
00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:34.339
So let's make our title clickable,

132
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:39.479
a href equal, quote, that same URL,

133
00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:42.543
target, =_blank.

134
00:08:45.978 --> 00:08:49.147
And then a /a, okay?

135
00:08:53.728 --> 00:09:00.148
Great, and if you look at this, it will
look kinda like this, CSS PROJECTS.

136
00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:02.606
And then HTML and CSS are underneath.

137
00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:06.233
But you should be able to
click these things and

138
00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:10.614
it should open up the course
here in another tab, okay?

139
00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:15.007
So you can always check and make sure
that you've coded your links correctly.

140
00:09:15.007 --> 00:09:16.095
&gt;&gt; Yes?

141
00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:18.532
&gt;&gt; For accessibility sake-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

142
00:09:18.532 --> 00:09:22.849
&gt;&gt; It'll be over the image and
it's the same link,

143
00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:25.808
do you just hide one of the links?

144
00:09:25.808 --> 00:09:29.938
&gt;&gt; We could do that, if you'd prefer,
we could take this link out.

145
00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:32.282
Would you prefer just
not to have this link?

146
00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:35.410
&gt;&gt; I think both are fine cuz I think-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

147
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.473
&gt;&gt; Both should be clickable, but I'm just,
if a screen reader is reading it out,

148
00:09:39.473 --> 00:09:40.697
it would read it twice.

149
00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:42.693
&gt;&gt; Right, this is true.

150
00:09:42.693 --> 00:09:46.691
So yeah, you could add that
aria-label equals hidden.

151
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:52.380
So you could say, aria,
it's aria-label, right?

152
00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:57.229
I think that's what we had earlier, right?

153
00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.460
Aria-label?

154
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.282
Yeah.

155
00:10:00.282 --> 00:10:03.851
I'm not as fluent in these arias,
I have to I have to look them up always.

156
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:07.488
So you could say something like that and
then it would be hidden from a screen

157
00:10:07.488 --> 00:10:11.433
reader and that's probably an excellent
addition so thanks for suggesting that
