00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:05.118
Fantastic, the lance gets started here
with establishing our base styling.

2
00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:08.602
One of the things you'll see me
do a lot in this course is that,

3
00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.705
in the JavaScript box here I will
sometimes put in instructions for you.

4
00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.850
I'm not using the JavaScriipt box
otherwise, it's always just to

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.173
comment there to about what might be
going in this particular CodePen.

6
00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:23.742
So if you wanna take a look at it,
you are welcome to do that.

7
00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:27.835
For now, what we're going to do
is we're going to start here, and

8
00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:30.990
let's just take a look at
what we've got in place.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.904
So here in our HTML, the first
thing to know about CodePen is that

10
00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:40.636
it does not sure you you're
the HTML head of our document, and

11
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.371
it also does not show us
the body element either.

12
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.814
Those are pretty
fundamental to a web page,

13
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.990
this is everything that's
inside of that body element.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.565
And I'll show you later on
today how to take this HTML and

15
00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:58.071
put it into a web page where that body
element and the head are present.

16
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:03.758
So just be aware, if it looks a little
weird, that's why it looks weird.

17
00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:06.432
So we have a series of div elements here.

18
00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:10.437
Those div elements each have their
own class associated with them, and

19
00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.320
we are gonna turn these
into some boxes for colors.

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.885
So that is one of the things
we're gonna code.

21
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:21.548
Next, we have some type, you'll see here
we have our various headings elements.

22
00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:26.178
The heading elements are really important
to use in your document, the one of the so

23
00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:30.350
called semantic elements,
that communicate meaning, particularly for

24
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.893
accessibility purposes.

25
00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:36.241
And show you sort of the broad
overall structure of the page.

26
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.655
We also have a link, we have a list, and

27
00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:44.841
we have one of my favorite HTML items,
which is the figure.

28
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:49.267
Figures are designed to
associate images with captions.

29
00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:53.809
So if you have text that goes under
a picture, chances are it winds up being

30
00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:57.342
a figure, and this is how you
would go about coding that.

31
00:01:57.342 --> 00:02:00.526
So it's always good to take
a quick peek at your HTML and

32
00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.751
get Familiar with what you see there.

33
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.032
Then we're gonna take a look at
the CSS that I've given you here.

34
00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:09.369
So the first part of this
is a little preamble,

35
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.333
this is setting us up for the appropriate
kind of box model that we're

36
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:19.055
gonna use in this particular document,
so-called border box.

37
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.239
This has to do with making layouts easier,
and

38
00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.712
that's pretty much all I'm going to
say about this at that point in time.

39
00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:26.415
If you wanna know more about this,

40
00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:30.431
you can look at the Frontmasters Boot
Camp, where I explain this in more detail.

41
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:36.238
And I've also included a little
style here courtesy of Scott O'Hara,

42
00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:38.766
ahe's got a blog post on this.

43
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:44.000
This is a lovely way to make
things hidden for screen readers.

44
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.636
So if you want something, some text
you wanna show up on the page, but

45
00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:51.209
you don't want it visible to most
of the visitors for your website,

46
00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.361
you just want it read by a screen reader.

47
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.445
This is a lovely way of doing that,
that's really inclusively done and

48
00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:03.372
you just add that as our only class
into your HTML to make that happen.

49
00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:08.452
So let's start by setting up
the colors for our webpage.

50
00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:10.914
Inside of the class website,

51
00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:15.648
you'll see that I've given
you a series of colors here.

52
00:03:15.648 --> 00:03:19.624
Those of course are hex values that
we're going to use for those colors.

53
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:23.840
They are what our designer has picked out
for us to use in this particular design.

54
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.240
So one of the first things that we always
do is we start by setting these up

55
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.914
as CSS variables, or the more appropriate
name is CSS custom properties.

56
00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.176
And the way that we do that, and

57
00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:41.877
I usually put mine right up here
at the very start of the web page,

58
00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:48.260
we're gonna give this a selector called
root, R-O-O-T with a colon in front of it.

59
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.031
What does root mean?

60
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:52.658
&gt;&gt; The one location that
everything connects to.

61
00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:56.874
&gt;&gt; The one location, it's the root,
the very base of the document, right?

62
00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:00.168
Everything is derived from
this base of the document.

63
00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:03.681
And by setting up our custom properties or
variables here,

64
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:07.347
we make them globally available
everywhere in the document.

65
00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:11.694
And when it comes to colors and fonts,
that is absolutely what you wanna do.

66
00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:15.098
So, we will start by giving these names,
and

67
00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:19.228
we can debate how you name
your particular variables.

68
00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:22.968
In a lot of cases people advocate
calling them like primary color and

69
00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:25.275
secondary color and all the rest of that.

70
00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:29.227
Because what happens if one day
you go from blue to purple, and

71
00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:33.420
you now have a variable called blue,
which has a value of purple.

72
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.035
[LAUGH] So that might be
something you wanna think about.

73
00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:42.549
But to keep things simple, I am going to
call my variables by the color names.

74
00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:47.743
You set up a variable by putting
a double dash in front of it, and

75
00:04:47.743 --> 00:04:53.231
then we're gonna give it a name,
like black with a colon after it,

76
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:59.509
and then we give it our value 000501 and
a semicolon at the end, okay?

77
00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.459
Absolutely nothing is gonna change on your
webpage, don't panic it's totally fine.

78
00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.833
And that is, we're just setting
up these variables right now,

79
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.397
we haven't actually set
them up to display, okay?

80
00:05:12.397 --> 00:05:15.902
I'll show you how to do white.

81
00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:20.475
So I'm gonna call this one white and

82
00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:25.358
this one is ff,ff If that's, okay?

83
00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:29.764
All right, we've got four more to go here,
take two minutes and

84
00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:34.102
type in all the rest of those
there into your root declaration.

85
00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:45.672
Okay, It looks like the typing has
died down in the room in front of me.

86
00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:49.284
So, hopefully you have a series of
variables that are set up like this.

87
00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:52.870
Remember that variables just
like everything else in code,

88
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.908
do not like spaces,
do not like funny characters.

89
00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:58.500
So when you come to
a name like light green,

90
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.312
you want to make it all one word,
lightgreen.
