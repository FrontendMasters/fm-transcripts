WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:04.670
Okay, so the next thing we're going to
add to our webpage is this comet image.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.207
And I have given this to you
down here in the JavaScript box.

3
00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:15.177
If you pull that on up, you'll see down
here at the bottom, it says, comet image,

4
00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:16.668
and it has a web address.

5
00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:21.141
So you'll wanna highlight
that web address and copy it,

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:27.397
CodePen will allow you to upload your own
images, but only in the paid version.

7
00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:30.319
You have to be a pro member in
order to do that, which I am.

8
00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.892
All of you who are following along
are likely free members, and

9
00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:37.206
you can't add your own images,
so you'll just use mine.

10
00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:42.006
So I am going to copy the URL for
that image.

11
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:48.766
And then back in my CSS,
we're gonna start with our layer intro.

12
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:53.434
And I'm going to create
a new style called .intro.

13
00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:58.740
And that comes from my section with
a class of intro here in my HTML.

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.926
So we're gonna put this
on the outermost box,

15
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.853
the one that's gonna stretch all
the way across the web page.

16
00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:15.686
And the first thing that I'm going
to add here is my background-image:,

17
00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:20.738
and that will be url with
a set of parentheses.

18
00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:27.486
And inside of that set of parentheses,
we will paste in our URL.

19
00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:31.834
And you'll see it'll show up
right there on the screen, okay?

20
00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.385
And if it looks like that,
you've done great.

21
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.431
[LAUGH] What's happening?

22
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.881
Can anyone describe to me
what's happening here?

23
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:41.884
&gt;&gt; The text is blending
into the background.

24
00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:45.001
&gt;&gt; The text is blending into
the background, which we know, right,

25
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.848
the text is black, the image is black.

26
00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:48.149
That doesn't quite work, so

27
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.657
we're definitely gonna have
to change that text color.

28
00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.131
Why can't I see the comet?

29
00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:58.319
&gt;&gt; It's displaying at full-size.

30
00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.244
&gt;&gt; It's displaying in full size,

31
00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:04.321
and we're seeing the upper left-hand
corner of our image, okay?

32
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.195
Where is the comet?

33
00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.589
Not in the upper left-hand corner.

34
00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:11.299
[LAUGH] All right, so
we need to make some adjustments here so

35
00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.943
that we can see the image.

36
00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:15.593
So the first challenge of course, though,

37
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.965
is we simply have to get
the image up there on the screen.

38
00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.364
And then we can work from there.

39
00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:21.584
So never panic,

40
00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:26.391
you can always add more code in
order to make this do what you want.

41
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:33.825
So the first thing I'm going to
add to this is background-repeat.

42
00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.652
And I'm gonna say, no-repeat.

43
00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:39.920
By default, background images will repeat.

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.995
They repeat going across the page and
they repeat going down the page.

45
00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:47.502
By setting this to no repeat,
we're only gonna see the image once.

46
00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:51.939
So if this web page gets big enough,
we won't see comet after comet after comet

47
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.912
going across the page,
we'll just see it one time.

48
00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:56.963
So that's what that line of code does.

49
00:02:56.963 --> 00:03:02.404
Then we're going to say
our background-position.

50
00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:07.398
So this is gonna tell us where we
want the background image to display.

51
00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:12.062
And we have done work, a lot of work,
[LAUGH] messing around with

52
00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:17.533
percentages to figure out exactly where
the sweet spot is for this image.

53
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:23.929
And I have set this at 86 %, 20%, okay?

54
00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.120
If you were doing this in real life,

55
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.078
you would be typing in random
numbers here until it looked good.

56
00:03:30.078 --> 00:03:32.162
That's just kinda the way
we do things in CSS.

57
00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:37.136
[LAUGH] 86%, I believe,
in this particular case,

58
00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:42.228
is referring from the left
side of the page going over.

59
00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:47.412
As I recall, the head of the comet is
kind of up on the right-hand side here,

60
00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:50.008
and we're 20% down on that image.

61
00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.532
So there's that comet showing up there.

62
00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:56.548
Anyone wanna make other suggestions?

63
00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.863
Should we change the text color?

64
00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:01.788
Okay, let's change the text color.

65
00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:05.550
How would I go about doing that?

66
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.438
What is the CSS property
to change the text color?

67
00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:09.391
&gt;&gt; Just color?

68
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:15.830
&gt;&gt; Just color, and
what is the value that I wanna put here?

69
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.734
&gt;&gt; Var white?

70
00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:19.099
&gt;&gt; Var white, yeah.

71
00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:25.086
Remember we already set all this up,
var white.

72
00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:30.034
Hey, that already looks so
much better, okay?

73
00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:34.301
What else should we do here to improve
the look of this particular item?

74
00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:39.575
Anybody feeling a little crowded?

75
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:43.519
Maybe feeling a little crowded?

76
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:48.138
So how would I make more space here but
keeping the image in place?

77
00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:54.074
There's padding and there's margin.

78
00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:55.412
So which one would it be?

79
00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:58.762
Which one is gonna keep
the background image in place?

80
00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.105
Padding or margin?

81
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:02.450
&gt;&gt; Margin?

82
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.382
&gt;&gt; Okay, how many people say margin?

83
00:05:05.382 --> 00:05:08.446
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; One vote for margin,

84
00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:10.498
how many people say padding?

85
00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:13.704
&gt;&gt; Online have a few votes on padding,
&gt;&gt; Three votes on padding,

86
00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:14.653
one vote on margin.

87
00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:17.175
If you're never sure,
you can always type both in.

88
00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:22.684
So if we said margin, let's say 4rem 0.

89
00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:27.393
Oops, not quite what we're looking for,
so then you can just change it.

90
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.918
It's one of the great things about coding.

91
00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:32.728
If it's not right, just change it.

92
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:34.562
Much better.

93
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:36.718
All right, so somewhere along the way,

94
00:05:36.718 --> 00:05:39.392
I lost my uppercase letters
here from my heading.

95
00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:44.606
So let me go back into my base
styles here, and I'm just scrolling,

96
00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:50.926
a little it looks like I didn't quite add
that here in the code that I carried over.

97
00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:55.476
So if you scroll back in your
CSS to around line 55 to 60,

98
00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:59.029
you'll see we have all
those headings there.

99
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:07.324
To this,
we should add text-transform uppercase.

100
00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:10.857
So we'll do it for
all the headings, there we go.

101
00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:14.469
What about let's compare this
with what we have with our image.

102
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.591
Let's look at our image again.

103
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:23.188
What else do I need to do with
what I have in my CodePen?

104
00:06:23.188 --> 00:06:26.094
So look at your image,
look at your CodePen,

105
00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.391
what else do we have left to do here?

106
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:30.550
&gt;&gt; Make the link more readable?

107
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, make the link more readable.

108
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.580
The green is lovely, it matches the comet,
so lovely, but we can't read it.

109
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.386
We need to make it white.

110
00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:42.510
So how would we go about doing that?

111
00:06:46.598 --> 00:06:51.983
We already said A, our colors for
our links via the A style in the base,

112
00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:55.100
we already said that was gonna be green.

113
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:01.823
What are we going to do here to set our
a style here inside of just the intro.

114
00:07:01.823 --> 00:07:05.587
We know it's gonna start with a,

115
00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:09.627
cuz we read them from right to left.

116
00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:15.274
So it's all the as that live where?

117
00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:16.158
&gt;&gt; In the intro.

118
00:07:16.158 --> 00:07:20.839
&gt;&gt; In the intro, all of the as
that live inside of the intro.

119
00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:28.197
So intro space a, and
then we're gonna say what goes here.

120
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.744
&gt;&gt; Color.

121
00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:37.670
&gt;&gt; Ha-ha, and,
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, look at you go.

122
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.033
Color var white.

123
00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:45.680
Boom, there we go, awesome.

124
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.998
The last thing I wanna do is I
wanna make my name bold, okay?

125
00:07:49.998 --> 00:07:53.664
So my name is up there at the top,
but it's not bold.

126
00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:57.894
So I am going to go back to my HTML, and

127
00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.579
I want just my name to be bold, so

128
00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:06.627
I'm going to add a span
with a class of name,

129
00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:11.692
cuz I'm super creative that way, /span.

130
00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.267
Why did I use span and not div?

131
00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:22.728
&gt;&gt; Span is inline?

132
00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:25.371
&gt;&gt; Yes, span is inline.

133
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.133
So what do we mean by inline?

134
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.823
How wide is an inline element?

135
00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:36.888
&gt;&gt; As long as it's content?

136
00:08:36.888 --> 00:08:38.704
&gt;&gt; As long as it's content, right?

137
00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:41.028
Inline elements are as
long as their content.

138
00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:45.828
The opposite of inline is block.

139
00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:48.600
How big is a block element?

140
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.408
As wide as its container, okay?

141
00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:55.298
So inline elements are as
wide as their content.

142
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:59.828
Give me some examples of elements
that are as wide as their content.

143
00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:01.389
We just worked with one.

144
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:04.347
How about a link, yeah?

145
00:09:04.347 --> 00:09:08.090
We don't wanna go link a whole
entire paragraph, right, okay?

146
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.290
But things that are as wide as their
container would be things like paragraphs

147
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.239
and headings and divs and so forth.

148
00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:18.879
Things that are as wide
as their content would be

149
00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:23.530
things like strong and
m and n a and span, okay?

150
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:30.715
So there we go, and then down here,
we'll add to this a .name class.

151
00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:38.116
And we're gonna say, font-weight 700,
because 700 happens to correspond to bold.

152
00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:43.884
And so hopefully, you can see it made it
a little bit bold up there at the top.

153
00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:45.835
If you wanted,
you could do other things here.

154
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:50.096
You could say,
my font size would be var, let's say,

155
00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:52.887
h5 to make it just a smidge bigger.

156
00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:56.678
That would be something that you could do,
right.

157
00:09:56.678 --> 00:10:01.591
Cuz we have those sizes, we've already
set them up, you could apply this font

158
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:06.591
size to that whole entire paragraph if you
wanted to do that or just to your name.

159
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:10.936
So there are plenty of additional
changes you can make here.

160
00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:17.106
So congratulations, you've set up your
very first section of the webpage.
