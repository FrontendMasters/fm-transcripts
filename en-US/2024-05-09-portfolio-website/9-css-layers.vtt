1
00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:05.937
So that's the first thing I put around,
it is that section with a class of intro,

2
00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:11.056
and then inside of that, I've started to
add this div with a class of container.

3
00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:16.246
And these do two things.

4
00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:24.267
Once we set up the CSS to this, so
give me a second here to put in those.

5
00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:27.704
So the section with a class of intro,
make sure you close it.

6
00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:32.559
And then inside of the section we'll
have a div with a class of container.

7
00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.363
The purpose of this is as follows.

8
00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:38.349
So once again, when we take
a look at our comment image here,

9
00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.425
that comment is gonna stretch
all the way across our web page.

10
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.135
No matter how big our browser is,

11
00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:48.302
we're gonna have a comment stretching
all the way across that particular page.

12
00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:52.515
But the text inside of it, we don't want
the text stretching across that far.

13
00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:53.522
Why is that?

14
00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:01.150
Would you like to read sentences that
go from one side to the other of this

15
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.871
monitor?

16
00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:04.211
Gosh, that would be hard to read,
wouldn't it?

17
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:08.764
Okay, so your eyes read text
that's about this wide, okay?

18
00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.776
So we're going to use our container to

19
00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:16.399
make the text inside of those
pages no more than this wide.

20
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.972
But we can put our background
image on the section and

21
00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:22.834
that will allow that background image to
stretch all the way across our browser

22
00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:25.019
window without impacting the text inside.

23
00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.983
Does that make sense?

24
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.929
Sweet, so let's set that up next.

25
00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:36.617
We're gonna get going here with our CSS.

26
00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:40.667
So with that HTML in place,
one of the things that I have

27
00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:45.263
come to start doing here as I
work in CodePen is the following.

28
00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:50.108
If you look at how many styles we have so
far, congratulations,

29
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:54.165
guys, you've already
written 125 lines of CSS.

30
00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:57.227
It's a good day and
we're only getting started.

31
00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:00.590
This makes reading CSS and
CodePen kind of hard.

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.729
So one of the structures that
I have started to add here for

33
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.026
this reason is an item called @layer,
with some curly brackets that go with it.

34
00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:17.888
We're going to use the opening
curly bracket here at the very

35
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:22.952
beginning on line one @ayer,
opening curly bracket, okay?

36
00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.648
And then scroll all the way down
to the end of your code, and

37
00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:29.606
we're gonna put in our
second curly bracket.

38
00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:35.245
So in other words @layer is going
to incorporate all of that.

39
00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:42.667
And we can format this,
format our CSS, to indent all of that.

40
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:48.322
So layer is a construct now in CSS
that has to do with specificity.

41
00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:52.460
We're not gonna use it in that context,
we're just using this as

42
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.201
an organizational mechanism to keep our
CSS such that we can deal with it and

43
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.246
we can hide what we need to hide.

44
00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:04.189
We can give this a name, so
I'm going to call this base,

45
00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.250
@layer base,
because this is our base styling, okay?

46
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.149
Once you have that in place,
you'll notice that there's a little arrow,

47
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.895
a down arrow there next to layer,
if you click that.

48
00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:21.749
[LAUGH] Okay, so this is just for

49
00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.615
our benefit for reading this.

50
00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:29.379
This will just hide away all of that
styling that we already wrote so

51
00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.336
that we can focus on other things.

52
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.279
Make sense?

53
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.207
All right, I'm not suggesting that
you use this in your regular work,

54
00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.810
if you want to you're more than
welcome to, but here in CodePen,

55
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.640
this is a really helpful
way of organizing our CSS.

56
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.764
Let's set up another one of those,
@layerintro,

57
00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:51.053
because that's what we're doing next.

58
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:52.824
Now, before we leave the base,

59
00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:56.038
I'm gonna scroll all the way
to the bottom of my base here,

60
00:03:56.038 --> 00:04:00.649
I'm gonna add a couple of styles here that
I'm going to use throughout my website.

61
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:04.845
One of those is the container.

62
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:09.430
So remember, the container is
going to set the width here,

63
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.098
a maximum width inside of my HTML.

64
00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:15.698
So we don't want our text to stretch
all the way across the screen,

65
00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:17.580
we only want it to stretch so wide.

66
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.519
And so here for my container,
what I'm going to say is,

67
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:28.958
max width 1200 pixels, okay?

68
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:33.613
So in other words, hey container,
never get any wider than 1200 pixels.

69
00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:37.485
And just for the moment,
let's add a border,

70
00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:42.558
1 pixel solid red,
my favorite debugging tool of all time.

71
00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:46.385
So that's gonna put, actually,
I'm gonna make it 2 pixels.

72
00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:51.415
This is gonna put a big red box
around our container at the moment.

73
00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:55.831
And if you notice,
as we make this bigger, right,

74
00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:01.685
that red box is gonna grow and grow and
grow until It gets too big and,

75
00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:06.451
I'm probably gonna have to
zoom out a little bit here.

76
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:11.931
So at some point as I stretch across here,
you see how that stops growing?

77
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:14.447
That's our max width of 1200 pixels.

78
00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.983
Awesome.

79
00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:18.626
But now it's pushed over
to the left side and

80
00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:21.995
I want everything, so
now I want it centered too right?

81
00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:27.265
[LAUGH] Okay, so we can add a center to

82
00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:32.552
that by saying margin: 0 auto;.

83
00:05:32.552 --> 00:05:36.512
Now, margin: 0 auto; helped me remember,

84
00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:40.988
what is the difference between padding and
margin?

85
00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:45.550
So if I'm looking at my red border here,
that's the border,

86
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.545
where is the padding on that red border?

87
00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:49.941
&gt;&gt; Outside of it.

88
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:51.035
&gt;&gt; Almost.

89
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:51.586
&gt;&gt; Get Inside of it.

90
00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:55.220
Inside of it,
the padding is inside of that box.

91
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.525
Where is the margin?

92
00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:59.453
Outside of it, okay?

93
00:05:59.453 --> 00:06:03.883
So put padding is inside margin is
outside, and when we set our margin to 0

94
00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:07.890
auto, what we're saying is those
two numbers are top and bottom.

95
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.263
So on the top we're adding no margin,
no margin to the top,

96
00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:12.691
no margin to the bottom.

97
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:17.121
Auto is cool because what it does
is it takes that extra space,

98
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:20.530
divides it into 2, and
sticks it on the left and

99
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.072
right sides of your box, and
that will effectively center it.

100
00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:28.075
Okay, that's why margin: 0 auto; works so
well.

101
00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:34.320
So this leads me to what I've always said,
if you can't see it, you can't style it.

102
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.127
So when you're having issues in CSS,
stick a border on it, so

103
00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.851
that you know where your box Boxes, right?

104
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.090
And then from there, you can figure
out what is padding, what is margin,

105
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.933
why things aren't centered on the page.

106
00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:49.218
If you're trying to figure this
out without that red box in place,

107
00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.695
you are going to have issues.

108
00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:52.251
Make sense?

109
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.494
Okay, and then, of course,
you just pull that out.

110
00:06:55.494 --> 00:06:57.243
So we don't need that border.

111
00:06:57.243 --> 00:06:59.306
Well, actually,
I'll leave it in one more minute.

112
00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:05.580
Because I'm also gonna add
to this padding: 0 1rem.

113
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.873
So likewise, this is not gonna
add padding to the top or

114
00:07:08.873 --> 00:07:12.095
the bottom of the box, but
it will add it to the left and

115
00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:16.262
the right, and that will get our text
right off the edges of that box.

116
00:07:16.262 --> 00:07:17.734
Make sense?

117
00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:21.494
Cool, let's pull out our boarder,
we don't need in it anymore.

118
00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:22.076
Yes.

119
00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:27.801
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to comment lines out?

120
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.608
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.

121
00:07:29.608 --> 00:07:34.442
Yep, so a comment would look like this,

122
00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:38.715
/star this is a comment, star/.

123
00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:44.796
And just like you were suggesting,
you could grab the end of that comment and

124
00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:48.989
put it down here, and
now my container is unstyled.

125
00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:51.803
&gt;&gt; But in terms of that
border that was created and

126
00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:56.201
if you wanted to toggle it on and off or
you just wanted to sort of leave it in

127
00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:59.403
there, you can definitely
comment just that line.

128
00:07:59.403 --> 00:08:04.074
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yep.

129
00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:04.987
Let's see.

130
00:08:04.987 --> 00:08:13.261
If I put that border back in with
a comment border 1 pixels solid red,

131
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:17.556
there we go, that works just fine.
