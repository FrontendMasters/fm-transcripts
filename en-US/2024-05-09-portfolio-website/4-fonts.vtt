1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
Fantastic, okay, we're on to part two.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.620
We need to set up our fonts.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.393
So if you go back to your web
page here for the course,

4
00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:10.860
you'll see that we have fonts.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.285
And once again, your designer is going
to tell you what exactly you need

6
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.564
in terms of fonts for the particular
design that you're working on or

7
00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:22.322
you can pick these out using font pairs.

8
00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.971
So if you find one font that you like,
if you put it into Google and

9
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:30.227
you say whatever your font name is,
font pair as part of your search terms,

10
00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:34.824
you'll find something that some designer
somewhere thinks they go together and

11
00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:39.322
it will really help your design to have
professional help you pick those out.

12
00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:44.008
So If we go to Google Fonts,
you can click the link right here.

13
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.033
This will put us into Google Fonts,
which is a really easy place to go and

14
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:48.914
get our fonts.

15
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:54.369
Then we are going to look for
specifically Lato,

16
00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.837
Josefin Sans, and Fira Mono.

17
00:00:57.837 --> 00:01:00.746
So we can just do a search for those.

18
00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:06.929
So, Lato, and that will pull up Lato here.

19
00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.856
If we click on that, this interface
to me changed kind of recently, so

20
00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:17.336
it may work a little bit differently
than what you've seen before.

21
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:20.416
What you're going to do is,
as it says right here, hopefully,

22
00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:24.229
click here to download the font, get its
embed code and find out how to use it.

23
00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.409
So we're gonna say get font and
it's gonna add it to a shopping cart here.

24
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.409
That's good enough for
the moment, just leave that.

25
00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.826
Then if we click on
the logo to go back again,

26
00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:45.622
we get our search box back and
we can look for

27
00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:50.640
Josefin Sans, J-O-S-E,okay?

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.216
Same thing once again, click on that,
click on Get font, and

29
00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:58.570
it will show you you
have two fonts selected.

30
00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:06.299
And then we're gonna go back and
we will search for Fira Mono.

31
00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.919
There it is, click on that &gt; Get font.

32
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.729
And now we have three fonts here
in our so-called shopping cart.

33
00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.544
So at this point in time,
you can either download these and

34
00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:24.237
then you'd have to upload them to your
website and there's a bunch of code.

35
00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:28.877
If you wanna learn how to do that,
you can probably just sort of Google for

36
00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.477
download font, install in my website.

37
00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:36.527
To keep things simpler, we're just gonna
use the embedded forms of these, so

38
00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:40.706
the fonts will live on at Google and we'll
just incorporate them in our document.

39
00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:44.043
So when we click on Get
the embed code here,

40
00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:50.072
this is where we actually have the choices
in terms of what kinds of weights and

41
00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:53.346
styles of these fonts that we wanna have.

42
00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:59.186
So by default, pretty much all of
the weights and styles are included.

43
00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:03.693
We don't need to include include all of
those variations, and we don't want to

44
00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:08.116
include all those variations because
that is going to slow down our website.

45
00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.899
The more variations we include,
the larger these files become,

46
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.896
the more time they take to download.

47
00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:17.046
So we wanna try to streamline this as much
as possible and just pick what we need.

48
00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:22.388
So here for Fira Mono, I am going to
click Change styles down here and

49
00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:26.902
it'll show me all of
the options that are available.

50
00:03:26.902 --> 00:03:29.344
The only one that I want is Regular 400,
so

51
00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:33.093
I'm gonna click this first check
box slider to turn everything off.

52
00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:37.042
And for whatever reason, it just
gives me the Regular 400 by default.

53
00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:40.200
That is all that I want here.

54
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.584
When I go down to Josefin Sans,

55
00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:47.741
it's gonna give me the option of
the full access versus one value.

56
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:50.531
This is a different kind of font,
this is called a variable font.

57
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.863
I'm not gonna go into a whole
lot of detail on it, but

58
00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:55.091
let's just say it's all
baked into the one font.

59
00:03:55.091 --> 00:04:00.231
There's not different files that have
different file sizes to download.

60
00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:03.253
So this one we can just
leave alone the way it is.

61
00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:05.592
And then when we go to Lato down here,
once again,

62
00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:07.393
we're gonna click on Change styles.

63
00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:10.405
I'm gonna turn off all of them.

64
00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:15.904
And the ones that we want
are the Regular 400 and the Bold 700.

65
00:04:15.904 --> 00:04:19.063
This is then gonna give us
some embed code over here.

66
00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:22.127
We will need this embed code
later in Chapter 6, well,

67
00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:24.955
we don't need it right
now to work in CodePen.

68
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:30.775
What we do need to work in CodePen
is in this third line of HTML here.

69
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:35.407
So this third line of code right here,
where it says link href, and

70
00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:38.435
we have this long thing in between quotes.

71
00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:41.124
I've just highlighted it
here on the screen for you,

72
00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:42.731
that is what I need you to copy.

73
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.473
Just copy that HTTPS, it's a link, and

74
00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:49.191
that includes links to all
of those particular fonts.

75
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:56.961
If you just copy that,
Then we're gonna go into our CodePen and

76
00:04:56.961 --> 00:05:01.755
we're gonna go to Settings,
and we're gonna go to CSS.

77
00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:06.267
And then down here at the bottom it says,

78
00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:10.265
Add External Stylesheets/Pens.

79
00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:15.549
Down here where it says
your website.com/style.css,

80
00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:22.681
just paste in that URL that you got from
Google, and then click Save and Close.

81
00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:27.231
And if you did it right,
absolutely nothing will happen.

82
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:29.511
Everybody good so far?

83
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:35.901
Okay, if nothing happened,
you are in great shape.

84
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.511
Why is nothing happening so far?

85
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:39.339
Anybody?

86
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.245
&gt;&gt; You haven't applied
the font to anything yet.

87
00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:43.878
&gt;&gt; Correct, we've linked to the font but

88
00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:46.575
we haven't shown told
the font where to display.

89
00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.025
So we need to make sure that we do that.

90
00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:51.429
And here inside of the Google Font,

91
00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:55.535
it will actually tell you
exactly how to include these.

92
00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:58.385
It gives you class names for these.

93
00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:03.255
It will give you some of the various
properties that you might wanna have

94
00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:05.863
include for these particular items.

95
00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.173
And this is if you were setting
these up as CSS classes.

96
00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:11.443
We're gonna set hours up as variables.

97
00:06:12.853 --> 00:06:17.393
And so I am gonna go back to my CSS here.

98
00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:22.721
And I'm gonna scroll back up to
root up here at the very top.

99
00:06:22.721 --> 00:06:27.013
And I'm going to put in the font families
cuz all the information that we need is

100
00:06:27.013 --> 00:06:28.550
the font-family.

101
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.472
So, the first one,
I'm gonna have my main font,

102
00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:41.249
M-A-I-N, my main font, and
this is going to be Lato.

103
00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.660
And right here inside of Google,
it will tell you for

104
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.993
lato-regular it'll tell you you just
use font-family: "Lato", sans-serif.

105
00:06:55.153 --> 00:06:58.062
So what is the Sans Serif
here mean at the end?

106
00:06:58.062 --> 00:06:58.913
Does anybody know?

107
00:07:00.363 --> 00:07:01.373
&gt;&gt; It's a backup.

108
00:07:01.373 --> 00:07:03.223
&gt;&gt; It is a backup, right?

109
00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:08.280
So Lato is the priority, Sans Serif
would be whatever the computer that's

110
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.873
in front of you, whatever its default
Sans Serif font is, use that instead.

111
00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:17.216
When would we ever see
that Sans-Serif font?

112
00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:20.122
&gt;&gt; If the Lato doesn't load properly.

113
00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:21.769
&gt;&gt; If the Lato doesn't load properly?

114
00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:27.498
If Google Fonts is down, right,
it's been known to happen.

115
00:07:27.498 --> 00:07:29.920
What else?

116
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.179
I'm on the airplane flying here from
Boston and I don't have any WiFi.

117
00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:38.045
[LAUGH] So it doesn't load, right?

118
00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:39.923
So then I'll just see it in Arial.

119
00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:42.574
Okay, usually it's Arial,
Aerial is your default.

120
00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:45.295
All right, great, so
we're gonna copy that.

121
00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:48.948
And here inside of our CodePen,

122
00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:53.818
we can then just put in
not the whole thing,

123
00:07:53.818 --> 00:08:00.062
we want just the values,
Lato, sans-serif, okay?

124
00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:02.135
We're gonna do the same thing here.

125
00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:05.735
For our other font families,

126
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:10.631
we're gonna have our heading font, and

127
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:15.821
this is "Josefin Sans", sans-serif.

128
00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:23.793
Right, so tends to be that we're gonna
be using this with headings mostly.

129
00:08:23.793 --> 00:08:27.580
I've just called my heading font
because I have two sans-serif fonts.

130
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.164
Often I call them serif and
sans-serif for my variable names, but

131
00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:33.730
here I had to use something else.

132
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.553
Then finally, our Mono font, you can
just call it Mono, as in mono space,

133
00:08:38.553 --> 00:08:41.232
it's like a typewriter font and.

134
00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:48.618
And that would be "Fira Mono", monospace.

135
00:08:48.618 --> 00:08:55.172
Awesome, so now we've connected
our font to our CodePen, awesome.

136
00:08:55.172 --> 00:08:59.965
We have managed to set up our variables,
calling for the font, awesome, and

137
00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:02.880
we still, Still have ugly Times Roman.

138
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.492
What is our problem now?

139
00:09:05.492 --> 00:09:10.190
&gt;&gt; We need to apply
the variable to the text.

140
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.860
&gt;&gt; We need to make that connection,
right, and

141
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.181
indicate where we want these
font families to display.

142
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:21.231
So the best way to do this, and
the way that I prefer to do it,

143
00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:24.576
is to start with our body declaration.

144
00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:27.256
And I guess, I don't have one here,
so we'll make one.

145
00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:34.048
Right here after my root,
I'm gonna have a body style.

146
00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:36.056
So this is the whole body of the document.

147
00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:38.256
We're talking about the HTML body element.

148
00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:40.426
Remember, we don't see it here in CodePen.

149
00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:43.920
It's there,
the CodePen just trims it out for you.

150
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.740
And I can say my font-family will be what?

151
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.930
&gt;&gt; A variable?

152
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.852
&gt;&gt; Yeah, var what?

153
00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:54.138
&gt;&gt; Main.

154
00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:59.234
&gt;&gt; Main, exactly, var(--main).

155
00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:04.360
Look at that,
it looks million percent better, boom.

156
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.880
Now, what if I want to override this for
my headings?

157
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.800
How could I set that up?

158
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.600
Remember we have this HTML here.

159
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.290
How could I set up some styles there for
my headings?

160
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.724
Do I need classes.

161
00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:23.345
&gt;&gt; No.

162
00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:23.955
&gt;&gt; No?

163
00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.504
What could I do?

164
00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:29.100
&gt;&gt; You could do each take
separated by a comma.

165
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.942
&gt;&gt; Exactly, I could do h1, h2, h3,

166
00:10:34.942 --> 00:10:41.150
h4, h5, h6, all of those guys.

167
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.504
When you separate your individual
CSS selectors like this with commas,

168
00:10:46.504 --> 00:10:50.290
you're saying for the h1s,
and h2s, and h3s.

169
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.350
And each one of those is
evaluated separately.

170
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.260
So we have six selectors here in a row.

171
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.578
And now we're going to say what?

172
00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:03.533
So what do I type now?

173
00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:07.298
&gt;&gt; Font-family
&gt;&gt; Font-family.

174
00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:08.678
And then what?

175
00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:13.965
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Heading

176
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.862
&gt;&gt; Heading?

177
00:11:16.862 --> 00:11:19.124
See, it's very very predictable, right?

178
00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:21.219
And look at that,
there's all of our headings.

179
00:11:23.691 --> 00:11:27.288
As it turns out,
I wanna also have those all be uppercase.

180
00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:34.160
We can do that with CSS too,
just by doing text-transform, uppercase.

181
00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:40.414
Hey, look at that, it worked.

182
00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:44.070
The last one we'll set up just,
I don't actually have an instance of

183
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.057
this right now, but let's set up the style
just so that we can use it later.

184
00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:51.566
I'm going to set up a class called mono.

185
00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:56.786
And what am I gonna put in here for
my class of mono?

186
00:11:56.786 --> 00:11:58.764
&gt;&gt; I assume it's gonna
follow the same pattern.

187
00:11:58.764 --> 00:12:05.608
&gt;&gt; Exactly, font-family: var(--mono).
