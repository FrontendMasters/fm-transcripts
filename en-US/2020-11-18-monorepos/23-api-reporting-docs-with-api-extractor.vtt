1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.151
We need to go into each package JSON, And

2
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:14.090
add one more NPM script,
just kick it out to scripting API report.

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.920
So do it two data types.

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.640
By the way, if you wanted to automate
this, a great tool to look at is Jq.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.736
It allows For csli manipulation and
querying of JSON values,

6
00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:33.126
and this would be a great thing
where you could like read the file,

7
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:37.370
alter the JSON, write the file back out.

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.240
Jq would be great for this.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.960
But we only have four, so I do this.

10
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.898
All right, so

11
00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:47.690
now each package will look to script
D to do something called API report.

12
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.730
And what is that thing?

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.050
Well surprise, I have a script for you.

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.227
So we're gonna bring that into
our scripts packages folder,

15
00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:02.470
right alongside with everything that
operates on a per package basis.

16
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.305
Of course not forgetting the chmod to make
sure that we can actually execute this

17
00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:07.818
thing.

18
00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:11.730
One last step.

19
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.090
Your API report for each package will
be placed in a folder called etc.

20
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.850
It must exist before you run the tool.

21
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.964
So let's create it.

22
00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:34.464
Just like that, go to every package and
create an etc folder.

23
00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.170
And there it is.

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
Now it's time to run it.

25
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.360
Learner run.

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.400
API report.

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.330
What's happening here?

28
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.530
I know my problem.

29
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.819
So on the fly, I decided to move this
base config file from the root of

30
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.670
the project into the packages folder.

31
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.333
So now I'm reaching too far down
In these little thin API extractor

32
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.840
configs we'll just have
to fix those real quick.

33
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.140
No regrets.

34
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.669
I still still like where it lives.

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.670
It's things that live there
have a very clear purpose.

36
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.086
They're sort of baselines that apply
broadly to all contents of that folder.

37
00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:29.708
Okay and

38
00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:35.410
utils save.

39
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.244
Let's try this again.

40
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.079
This looks much more promising.

41
00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.940
All right,
supposedly everything has completed.

42
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.720
Let's look at what happened.

43
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.920
In the etc folder of each package,
I have a mark down file.

44
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.040
And this describes my public API surface.

45
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.760
If I were to view this file directly,
here is what it would look like.

46
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.410
So it would say,
here's my API report donated this file.

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.220
And then here we go.

48
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.470
This is public.

49
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.230
The deferred is also public.

50
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.010
It's telling me that these
things are undocumented.

51
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.240
I could make this an error if I wanted to,

52
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.270
if I really wanted to make
sure Things are documented.

53
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.580
I could say hard fail if you find that.

54
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.081
And then let's see anything else
that's interesting here public public,

55
00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:33.120
no package documentation comment for
this package.

56
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.563
Let's see, I actually enriched one
of these packages so that it would

57
00:03:37.563 --> 00:03:42.104
look more like What I would hope ducks
would look like in the real world,

58
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.509
Come on close group,

59
00:03:59.132 --> 00:03:59.919
There we go.

60
00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:06.720
Sorry.

61
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.710
It's not gonna show up.

62
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.160
The docs are not gonna show up here.

63
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.680
This is just the API report.

64
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.040
Here's an example of
something interesting.

65
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.730
I have a beta annotation here, and it's
just a js doc comment, this beta thing.

66
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.740
Just a js comment, right?

67
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.180
Just like you'd say at Prem,
something like that.

68
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.433
And And the idea here is that
in my roll ups for this, for

69
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:38.530
this package, which are these things
that were created here Types.

70
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.070
This is tricky because I think I actually
have a module here that's called types.

71
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.430
I bet it just got overwritten.

72
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.880
Yep, I think it did, which is fine.

73
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.130
So this is the public API surface.

74
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.750
Note that there are not typed cards here.

75
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.210
In fact, there should be Yep, here.

76
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.980
They are.

77
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.710
It's telling me I excluded
some things from this release.

78
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.440
They're not here they were stripped away.

79
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.910
But if we look at beta, here they are.

80
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.625
So it would just be a simple matter of
a consumer that wishes to try this beta

81
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:16.680
stuff out.

82
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.982
They just need to simply say, look when
you're looking at the type information for

83
00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:25.230
at slac slash types Here's the declaration
file, you should look for it.

84
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.250
Don't go to this one,
which is the default.

85
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.410
Just go to this one here.

86
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.744
I'm telling you to go and
look at the beta, and

87
00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:35.000
then all the stuff will start
showing up in their autocomplete.

88
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.780
It's it's a low overhead but
deliberate act.

89
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.840
Then the consumer has to take if they
want to use this pre release thing.

90
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.320
And then it's all there, right,
and there's the beta tag.

91
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.560
And then private.

92
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.340
This is where you start
to see everything even.

93
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.096
I don't know if I have an example here,
but

94
00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:56.710
sometimes we mark things as
internal which just means.

95
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.290
This is not gonna be public ever.

96
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.130
So there you go.

97
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.300
These are the roll ups.

98
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.070
And you would simply go into
your package JSON and say types.

99
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.610
Don't just go and
look at this index that DTS.

100
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.230
You're gonna say types, right?

101
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.310
Go look at one of the roll ups,
the public one by default.

102
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.470
And finally in that temp folder,
I know I already had these here.

103
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.840
Let me delete this just cuz there's no
proof that I actually made that pop up.

104
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.503
It was already there and

105
00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:40.460
is identical content [LAUGH] We
should see that pop up again.

106
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.560
temp, still building,
then the last one popped up.

107
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.730
So here you go.

108
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.790
This is information.

109
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.120
Think of it as API docs in JSON form.

110
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.653
So if you wanted to build
your own API doc site,

111
00:06:57.653 --> 00:07:03.230
You could build a little, little view
app on top of this or something.

112
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.410
And it's extremely low level and
a very stable API.

113
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:15.520
So if you look at Doc,
stop Microsoft comm.

114
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.920
This is where.

115
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.993
There's just all of this stuff,

116
00:07:18.993 --> 00:07:23.296
like everything that Microsoft makes
with a public API of some sort.

117
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:30.070
Right guides and all this stuff here.

118
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.589
It's all powered by what
I showed you today.

119
00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:38.409
You should look- you should
consider that When wondering like,

120
00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:42.370
is this contract going
to change like crazy?

121
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.400
It would hurt if it changed a lot.

122
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.180
Microsoft would be harming
themselves to do that.

123
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.930
So, but you can consume this and
then you can do whatever you want, right?

124
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.830
You could diff this like what
was just added what was removed.

125
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.050
Show me how this has evolved over time.

126
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.440
So this is API extractor.

127
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.360
One last thing I want to make sure
I show you, let me stage all this.

128
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.543
Okay, so the script that we're
running this API report thing,

129
00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:25.760
this dash dash local Argument
means I am running a local build.

130
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.220
And I'm telling you what
the API surface should be.

131
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:37.620
However, you could run this in, in ci,
for example, and let me make a change.

132
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.930
Let me alter the API surface in some way.

133
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.780
Let's say I take in, what is this taken?

134
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.300
It takes a number or a date.

135
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.240
So let's, I mean, theoretically,
no reason why I can't do this.

136
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.550
But it's an alteration to the API.

137
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.190
Now if I do this,
I think it will yell at me.

138
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.660
Oops Sorry.

139
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.310
That command that I just copied
to my clipboard is intended for.

140
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.060
per package invocation.

141
00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:23.814
Now little work.Okay.So
we're getting a lot

142
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:29.960
of feedback about some small things and
our ducks.

143
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.270
This export ID symbol.

144
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.440
I haven't said Is it
public private beta alpha.

145
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.860
It's telling me Look, you got it.

146
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.860
You gotta tell me something.

147
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.710
To missing a release tag.

148
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.020
I think it defaults to public but
you can change that.

149
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.107
And where did it really
get upset with me?.

150
00:09:52.197 --> 00:09:56.429
Completed with warnings
anything else in here?.

151
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:14.902
It should give me a much nicer error
message than what I'm seeing here,

152
00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:17.080
says it completed successfully.

153
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.020
I'll tell you what's going on though.

154
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.580
So this is this date function, right?

155
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.295
So what's happened is, each package
has its own little temp folder and

156
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.125
this is sort of what it
It read from the code.

157
00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:34.415
I know what I did wrong here.

158
00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:37.535
Yarn build.

159
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:41.961
And so we have to build because
type information is the input for

160
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:44.095
this API extraction.

161
00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:48.595
So it was sort of like
reading the previous build.

162
00:10:48.595 --> 00:10:53.839
Now what I should see here we go date or
number And

163
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.270
then this is the meaningful thing.

164
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.970
I have changed a public API signature for
this project.

165
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.500
Please copy this file utils right
copy this into the etc folder.

166
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.110
If it's in the etc folder that's
like I'm giving it a thumbs up.

167
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.920
But it found differences.

168
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.855
So I have this turned on,
such that people have to run this and

169
00:11:16.855 --> 00:11:20.200
generate that report as
part of a pull request.

170
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.713
So I would get a code change
that would look like I now

171
00:11:23.713 --> 00:11:26.570
accept numbers in this function.

172
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.690
And here's the human readable report for
how this affects the public API surface.

173
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.830
If that reports not up to date,
this will fail.

174
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.150
And there will be a GitHub check
that will say thumbs down.

175
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.690
The API report is not up to date.

176
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.507
So it really helps surface
these changes in a way

177
00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:46.550
where meaningful discussions can happen.

178
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.439
And it's just, it makes it so that
never again will you ship something and

179
00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:54.530
say, Crap, I didn't realise we export
it that or I didn't realise that.

180
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.660
That we were using the type
of this argument for

181
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.660
this internal thing as part
of a public API surface.

182
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.060
That happens all the time.

183
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.600
Now it's in your face.

184
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.643
Now it's part of your code review,
and you can see what's happening and

185
00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:11.910
make good decisions.
