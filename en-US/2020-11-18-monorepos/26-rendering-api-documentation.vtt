1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.821
So I'm gonna push this and
I wanna show you what it looks like,

2
00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:06.440
rendered in GitHub.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.530
And then we'll just take a quick look at
GitHub pages and how that presents itself.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.188
And that will be it.

5
00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.720
There we go some docs.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.344
All right.
So

7
00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:25.880
looking at the index markdown file
in here, that's the entry point.

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.050
And what we get some like, obviously not
a super relevant picture to have here.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.076
I simply am making a point here about
How you can duck how this may seem like

10
00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:42.890
a basic tool, but you have the ability
to use a limited subset of HTML,

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.240
approximately the same subset of HTML you
can use with GitHub flavored mark down.

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.870
And so you could document
each of your packages here.

13
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.761
So if we were to click into one of these,
so

14
00:00:54.761 --> 00:01:01.410
you've you've got like This here this was
an I think an h3 or something like that.

15
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.000
And you can see we can use like backticks.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.260
I deliberately created
some of these links.

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.490
Here's the link to front end masters,
right.

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.620
So we've got functions
clear indications of beta.

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.970
This is linking to other
entities using jazz stock syntax.

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.672
So I could just go straight to AI channel,
and it would take you to the right place,

21
00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:25.970
go to iMessage take you to
the right place, right.

22
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.470
Even each of these little
things has their own page.

23
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.190
So you can have some great examples
right in your API documentation.

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.808
In your comments, and it'll all be
rendered where it needs to be rendered.

25
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:47.100
Now, GitHub Pages we can point to.

26
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.720
I find that little section here.

27
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.183
So I could say the source for
GitHub Pages is front end masters and

28
00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:57.420
let's look at the docs folder.

29
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.840
Save.

30
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.280
And I wanna show how it keeps
you up to the top of the page.

31
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.240
Let's use like this slate theme you can
pick whatever you like, select theme.

32
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.962
All right, so
now what it's doing while we wait for

33
00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:20.524
it to build just to recap,
I just simply said front end masters

34
00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:25.480
the branch is FEM Look on the FM
branch in this dog's folder.

35
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.906
We've chosen a theme here it's saying
we've selected this slight theme,

36
00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:35.152
and then eventually up,
I mean already this is popping up.

37
00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:43.592
Now the theme for some reason for
me on the first render of this page,

38
00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:48.441
it's always this index page
doesn't pick up the theme.It will

39
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:53.360
after the next commit,
which I can do, I can do real quick.

40
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.075
I found a little bug that
shouldn't be showing as an h3, But

41
00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:01.230
when we drill into it, it's rendered.

42
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.570
So let's see if we can,
we can go fix that.

43
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.514
So you have the ability, you have a lot
of flexibility to write your own content,

44
00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:12.140
like you could write a little guide,
right?

45
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.032
And then you have table of functions and
you can click here and It's it's pretty

46
00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:21.720
nicely formatted syntax highlighting
around code code examples, right?

47
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.624
Just because I use the same thing I use
in markdown tagged code fences, like,

48
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:28.760
tick, tick, tick, Ts.

49
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.230
That's how we get this.

50
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.040
Right.

51
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.366
So a lot of nice features without
having to do anything complicated and

52
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.410
it's the same stuff.

53
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.130
Write the same stuff that is enriching
your existing VS code tooltips.

54
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.464
So if we were to look at teams, and

55
00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:53.770
we were to look at this type guard
that we're passing in somewhere.

56
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.689
His team so this could use some
love here to get the syntax

57
00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.527
highlighting properly, but
it's the same information and

58
00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:13.481
this is what's creating that nice
little link To an entity and

59
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.860
another package, get team by ID.

60
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.820
So if I were to document this real quick
ID of team to fetch, get a team by ID.

61
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.530
And up here instead of this,
I would say, Link slack.

62
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.007
Teams or types, ITeam, save.

63
00:04:43.197 --> 00:04:45.628
GetTeamById.

64
00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:51.140
Right, and now,
generate those API docs again.

65
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.470
It's gonna create a fresh build.

66
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.240
It's gonna extract that API surface.

67
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.425
In this case, it's gonna just sort
of forcefully approve Make sure Yep.

68
00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:05.395
So we have this dash dash local things.

69
00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:10.333
So it's just going to say, whatever
I find I'm just going to use and so

70
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.915
it'll get that API surface.

71
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:18.315
It will use that as the input for
the documentation and

72
00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:23.715
then we end up with some
different markdown some small

73
00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:28.520
changes to the markdown update docs and
a push.

74
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.630
Oops, git pull.

75
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.610
A reason I have to do this is GitHub added
that config file for my GitHub Pages.

76
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.830
Got to pull that in, make that merge,
commit and push again.

77
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.614
And what we can see if we go
back to our project real quick

78
00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:59.200
GitHub actually models
this as a deployment now.

79
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.200
So if we click on we go back to
the front end masters branch.

80
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.580
And there's a little status here.

81
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.530
There's GitHub Pages so
it's telling me like I'm in progress.

82
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.210
I'm building your ducks etc, etc.

83
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.020
And now we should see,
that was in the data layer.

84
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.260
Get team by ID.

85
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.620
There we go.

86
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.260
So there, now I'm linking to
assemble in another package.

87
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.800
I'm going across mono repos,
and it just works.

88
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.690
Right, everything gets wired up really,
really nicely.

89
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.680
Pretty cool stuff,
even this symbol down here.

90
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.670
promise that resolves to an iTeam.

91
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.790
I think this is this is not the most rich
documentation feature set that I've seen.

92
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.990
But it is good, where it's most
important to me that a solution be good.

93
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.889
Low effort,

94
00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.510
stitching together many packages in
a mono repo with minimal effort.

95
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.914
The only thing we had to do that's
sort of a little tricky is get

96
00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:07.020
all those JSON files into one folder.

97
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.810
And then you just say okay, build me
docs for everything in this folder.

98
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.160
That's not so bad.

99
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.280
Right, but but this, this is a great
doc solution for this kind of thing.
