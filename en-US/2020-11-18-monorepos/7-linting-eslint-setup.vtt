00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.240
The next thing we're going to add to
our mono repo project here is linting.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.930
So we're on section four of the notes.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.521
And you have a little starter file here
because I don't want you to have to write

4
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:16.040
this es lint configuration from scratch.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.800
That seems kind of boring.

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm going to despite Having put a bunch
of this common configuration stuff

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.190
in the packages folder, I'm going to ask
you to put this in your workspace root.

8
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.700
Why?

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.310
Editors like VS code,
kind of expect it to be there.

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.610
And if you have it in other places,
some editors may get a little.

11
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.394
Cranky and upset with you, and
they won't give you that nice red

12
00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:53.620
squiggles underneath the things
that violate your legit roles.

13
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.860
So we wanna make sure that
this can be found easily.

14
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.340
And that is my only reason for
putting this in the root of my

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.391
workspace Compared to packages,
this is a place where I'm trying to help

16
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:10.470
you learn from my experience here
because I have wrestled with this.

17
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.090
I've spent days trying to get
this right in the other way.

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.340
And take my word for it.

19
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.480
It's not worth it.

20
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.080
It's just not worth going there.

21
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.591
Not the way things currently are We

22
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:31.900
also need to set up es lint so I could.

23
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.400
This is a good time to think
about the question Eduardo just

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.470
asked in the class which is,
is this a workspace wide concern?

25
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.870
Or is this a per package concern?

26
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.792
Well, I'm gonna tell you right
away vs code wants to run

27
00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:54.810
one version of vs lint on
your entire workspace.

28
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.842
There is just no editor that is going
to be accommodating enough to say

29
00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:03.494
you wanna use this version of vs lead for
this folder,

30
00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:07.270
this other version for this other folder.

31
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.600
Not really a use case that
this tool is built for.

32
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.070
So that means this is
a workspace level dependency.

33
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.720
We have one version for the whole repo,
not ever one version per package.

34
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.890
And that means we're doing yarn,
add w dw for workspace.

35
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.507
We're gonna install eslint and

36
00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:38.005
then some plugins, typescript-eslint and

37
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:43.315
then eslint plugin and TypeScript.

38
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:47.725
Yes, lint parser.

39
00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:51.948
Right.
So, the flags here W is for workspace,

40
00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:57.334
D is for development dependency and
let's let it go.

41
00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:08.612
Following our theme of really light and
thin,

42
00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.550
per package dependencies.

43
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.809
We still wanna have
an eslintrc in each folder.

44
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.250
But it's going to be super thin.

45
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.430
That's all it is.

46
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.644
So we're extending, we're going
to folders up now instead of one

47
00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:33.270
has a location of that more meaningful
esrc that has all of our rules in it.

48
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.157
So to levels up and
then this parser options that must be

49
00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:43.256
specified on a per package basis,
because, at least for

50
00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:48.569
the way TypeScript and
es lint work together differences in

51
00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.657
Ts configs from package to package Like,
are we parsing JSX or not?

52
00:03:54.657 --> 00:03:56.290
Right?

53
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.660
You have to inform the linter about
that so that it can act accordingly.

54
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.640
That is why we need an ES lint RC for
each package.

55
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.570
But it's the same insolent RC.

56
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.730
That's the good news.

57
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.230
So go ahead and grab this, copy it and
paste it into your utils folder as well.

58
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.410
And then we never need to
think about this file again.

59
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.850
The only situation where we would
start to think about it would be if.

60
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.209
There were certain rules we wanted
to apply on a per package basis.

61
00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:46.054
The final step we're gonna take just in
the spirit of keeping Conventions nice and

62
00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:49.975
well established.Each packages,

63
00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:54.990
package JSON is going to get a lint task.

64
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.867
Right?
So this we're saying whenever I go into

65
00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:01.080
a package and I run yarn,
lint One runs esLint.

66
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.829
I wanted to let the source folder and

67
00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:08.140
I want you to analyze JavaScript and
TypeScript files.

68
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.434
So we're going to have utils
package JSON say that and

69
00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:18.380
the same exact thing in types.

70
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.331
If you're getting tired of
making modifications to

71
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:29.640
each of these files,
one at a time I feel you.

72
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.300
Were gonna solve this problem.

73
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.080
I think next up, we should be ready to go.

74
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.720
And what that means is it's
time to take it for a spin.

75
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.530
So let's enter a package and
run yarn lint.

76
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.120
Okay?, that's done.

77
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.310
I'm not sure if it's not finding anything.

78
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.500
I mean I usually like to see
it find stuff, there we go.

79
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.460
It found something left us a little clue.

80
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.960
So we would see the difference
between es lint did nothing,

81
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.490
versus it analyzed things,
and it found a problem.

82
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.390
So it's telling us that I'm
returning something here.

83
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.590
That's it.

84
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.700
It doesn't like and look at this.

85
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.840
I'm getting a little tooltip here.

86
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.944
It's not just a tooltip Prometheus lens,

87
00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:23.990
it's a tooltip that uses one of
the plugins that I installed.

88
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.488
So this is a pretty compelling bit of
evidence that VS code is happy with

89
00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.100
the way we've set it up.

90
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.040
So we're seeing this on the command line.

91
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.800
We're seeing it in the editor.

92
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.768
Everything's in sync, we can trust
that our tools are working properly.

93
00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:45.080
In here, I can just add these two words.

94
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.204
If you don't, if you're not super,
super familiar with TypeScript,

95
00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:54.940
don't worry about what these mean
that they do shut ESLint up.

96
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.550
Alternatively, we could just say
disable the rule for that line.

97
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.010
But this is the right that
this is the right solution.

98
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.700
And let's run it in the COI just to prove
that everything works and it should.

99
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.780
We're good to go.

100
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.210
We now have linting in our two packages.
