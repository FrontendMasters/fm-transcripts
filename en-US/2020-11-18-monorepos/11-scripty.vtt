00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.760
The next step we're going to take in
making our mono repo more manageable.

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.576
It's a lot of EMS there is I want
to centralise our build scripts and

3
00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:15.720
here's what I mean by build
scripts this stuff here.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.480
So the way I like to set up my mono repos.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.730
Is whenever possible,
build the same way, lint the same way.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.280
Test the same way, clean the same way.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.208
The more of that you can
centralize the lower your

8
00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:37.950
maintenance overhead gets
We're going to install a tool.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.800
It's not mono repo specific, but
it works beautifully in this case.

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.350
And it is called script.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.450
The script job is to get this
stuff out of the JSON file.

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.860
Because this is frankly,
this is not where scripts belong.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100
You don't get syntax highlighting here.

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.820
As things get more complicated.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.665
I mean, so in the class Raise your hands
if you've worked on a project that

16
00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:06.509
has an NPM script like this where you
have like, thing one and thing two and

17
00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.330
thing three, right.

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.320
It's just so painful to manage.

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.780
And you can have bugs that
are lurking in there.

20
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.086
And it's just tough to see because it's
just this one line that keeps going and

21
00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:18.850
going and going.

22
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.740
We don't want to read code like that.

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.910
And this is code don't make a mistake and
think it's not.

24
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.660
So let's begin by installing scripting.

25
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.883
This is another workspace level dependency
because it's just a COI that we're

26
00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:35.050
invoking, right.

27
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.040
It's not a library that we're requiring.

28
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.110
Alright, so it's installed now and
we can create a folder.

29
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.439
Not in packages though.

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670
Just create a folder called scripts.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.710
And I'm going you don't have
to do what I'm going to do.

32
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.870
I'm taking I'm taking
some intermediate steps.

33
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.030
Here to illustrate how this works.

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.800
I just want to show you
how scripting works.

35
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.140
So I have no scripts in this package.

36
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.720
json.
I'll show you in the outline here.

37
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.247
All I ever dev dependencies and
volta and these top level things.

38
00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:29.960
But if here I were to add scripts and

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.833
then let's give ourselves great
script D So the theme here, but

40
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:40.838
the way this works is instead
of actually implementing

41
00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:45.430
your script here,
which could be echo Hi, Mike.

42
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.610
Could be something like that, right?

43
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.950
I mean, this would work for sure.

44
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.350
If I went yarn greet.

45
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.590
Hi Mike.

46
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.100
No problem.

47
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.640
Instead of this, we're gonna say, you
know what script D, you handle it for me.

48
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.180
And then we would go into
our Scripts folder and

49
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.420
create create any executable file.

50
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.865
Now today we're going to be mostly
working with bash scripts, but

51
00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:16.620
I'm going to show you
a more creative example.

52
00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:29.620
Let me cheat here real quick.

53
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.870
I have a mental block against
the way this shibang works.

54
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.370
Yep.

55
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.520
Like, is it the exclamation first or
what is it?

56
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.030
Check that out user bin and node.

57
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.420
So I'm going to close this and
I'm going to reopen it.

58
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.836
Okay, my syntax highlighting there and
what type of file does this look like?

59
00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.643
J s.

60
00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:08.408
And now I can run your and greet and
let's add an emoji here something

61
00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:14.370
just to make it obvious we're
not seeing the previous result.

62
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.070
One last thing I have to do here,
I have to make this file executable.

63
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.346
And on a Unix system that's with chmod

64
00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:30.140
plus x and then you pass it the file.

65
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.282
That means this is not
just a file I can read,

66
00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:36.590
and write to I can run it like a program.

67
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.170
So now if I do yarn great.

68
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.050
There's my emoji with Hi Mike.

69
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.070
That's all it is.

70
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.780
You just say,
scripting handle this for me.

71
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.730
And then you have this Scripts folder.

72
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.840
And the fact that this is
this file is called greet.

73
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.910
It just works.

74
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.000
That this is where I
can put my NPM script.

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.336
Now I can have it in JavaScript.

76
00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:02.680
I can have it as a shell script.

77
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.440
It's a real file with code in it,
that syntax highlighting, I can lint it.

78
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.980
There's a great shell lint,
it's great linter for shell scripts.

79
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.810
So this is what scripting does for us.
