00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.705
Routing clearly has a lot going on and

2
00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:05.115
we got one more major piece that comes
up when it comes to defining routes.

3
00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.155
Which is the fact that, if I were to
ask you right now to define a route for

4
00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:14.120
like every to do item on the page,
that'd be hard to do.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.141
At least let's see photos there's
5000 photos can you imagine

6
00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:19.685
if you were like photos slash one,
photos slash two, and

7
00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:23.354
more importantly you can't even guarantee,
it'll be that many items, right?

8
00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:24.555
So how do we deal with that?

9
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:28.778
So dynamic routes are the next thing
I do wanna make sure that we cover.

10
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.270
So how does that work?

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.190
Well, the way that works is let's
go ahead and inside of display,

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.290
I'm gonna go and do the to section.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.103
And so we'll say okay there's
a new folder call to dues, so

14
00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:42.534
one of things we could certainly do is
drop to dues inside of the folder and

15
00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:44.693
do index dot view and
that way it's own page.

16
00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:47.479
But for the sake of practice and
showing you all different examples.

17
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.439
This is where we're gonna actually use
a child route in this particular case,

18
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.025
cuz we wanna actually be able to go,
yes, okay?

19
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.321
So when we're inside of
this to dues page and

20
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.312
we click on a link,
we only want that session to swap out.

21
00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:01.617
We want the list to disappear,
we want the item to come in,

22
00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:04.413
that's what we want to look for,
so that's how we're gonna design.

23
00:01:04.413 --> 00:01:08.589
The way you just the way you tell nutex
that you want something that's dynamic,

24
00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:12.593
and this, I think starts to become
a convention It's the square brackets.

25
00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.908
And the square brackets whatever goes
inside is the name of the parameter that

26
00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:16.470
is dynamic.

27
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.252
And so you can call it whatever you want,
but in this particular case, and

28
00:01:20.252 --> 00:01:23.187
in a lot of cases,
it tends to be very, very cool common.

29
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:28.478
So once we get this well we can do so
let me open up a script

30
00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:33.772
file block is I'm gonna first
open up an h2 element and

31
00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:40.126
this is task, ID and which ID we
can use const route = used route.

32
00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:44.091
And then from here, if I remember this
correctly, we should be able to actually

33
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.713
log out the params and this time I've
realized I had it flipped earlier.

34
00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:51.097
So to make sure this works though,
don't forget because we're

35
00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:53.926
actually looking to get into
the child at that point.

36
00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:57.982
We do have to do a couple
of things which is one,

37
00:01:57.982 --> 00:02:02.454
we need to wrap our to do
that title with a next link,

38
00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:07.349
that's going to actually allow
us to jump to that page.

39
00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.520
And so what it's gonna be it's going to
be a dynamic string whereas only slash,

40
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.709
all we need the to property, that's
why it's not coloring correctly, okay?

41
00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.265
To slash display slash to dues slash,
to do ID, this is the path that we're

42
00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:28.846
looking for and I'm missing this here,
there, yeah now that looks good.

43
00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:29.897
Does that make sense?

44
00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:33.039
That's how, as far as how I
constructed that dynamic URL, great.

45
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.585
Okay, so now that we have
that we need one more thing.

46
00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:39.259
Which is we need to actually
display the next page, right?

47
00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.183
This is what we talked about before,
because we want children elements to be

48
00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:44.117
displayed within a specific
section of the page.

49
00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:46.391
We don't want the whole thing to refresh.

50
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:53.259
So if I just wrap all this in a div,
because now we're at the page level,

51
00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:59.917
okay, we go back to here, and
then let's refresh whoops.

52
00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.000
What did I do Boolean?

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.258
A Boolean somewhere, it was here.

54
00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:09.176
That doesn't make any sense at all,
there we go, much better.

55
00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:13.756
And I realized this is a buggy thing that
I need to see fix let me just wrap that

56
00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.378
there you go much better.

57
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:21.254
Okay, so now our server should be much
happier with us great we can go to dues.

58
00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.718
Okay,great.

59
00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:27.223
So now when I click on
this you will notice,

60
00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:32.619
down here there it is this
is task ID basically one.

61
00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:37.630
And we said we wanna swap
out the list right so

62
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.184
what we can really do
actually is we can say Vf I'm

63
00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:49.430
gonna guess on this one paron
ID is todo I think, okay.

64
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.854
If it's true,
actually this is what we should do.

65
00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:57.777
If it's true, we will display the subpage,
this is probably the easiest way to do it.

66
00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:02.974
If there's the parameter ID on the URL,
when we're in this page

67
00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:08.375
display the sub page otherwise
display the list, just like that.

68
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:12.064
So then just to give
some continuity to all of

69
00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.366
this was a this is mine to
do you're just like that.

70
00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:20.674
So if I refresh this okay, it's looking
a little ugly to me for a second so

71
00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:24.843
let's just fix this wrap it with
a section give this class a title these

72
00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:28.398
are all coming from Beaumont I'm
gonna look that up later.

73
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:30.117
There, you're much better.

74
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:33.449
So you see, okay, we got we got
our task ID, this is good and

75
00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.542
if I go back to the page, there we go.

76
00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:40.128
I mean, so there's some duplicate stuff
here happening but you can see here that

77
00:04:40.128 --> 00:04:44.455
we're actually able to now dynamically
generate a page that has that data.

78
00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:48.349
And then of course, you can go ahead and
pull whatever you wanna like,

79
00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.789
you can filter it, etc, but
we won't need to dive into that.

80
00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.186
So does that make sense as far as
how that dynamic query like works?

81
00:04:56.186 --> 00:05:00.614
And so the key thing to remember is that
this thing that we define on the right

82
00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:05.831
here, in the square brackets, It's part of
the parameters that's part of the route.

83
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.995
Cuz earlier remember I was trying to do
params on like the name and that was like

84
00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:12.415
messing up, right because parameters the
wrong thing I was thinking of this part.

85
00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:15.313
The dynamic part is where those parameters
the rest of that those are like path

86
00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:17.020
matching you got to figure
that out on your own
