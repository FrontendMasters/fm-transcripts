1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.908
So we've been through a lot today, right?

2
00:00:01.908 --> 00:00:04.275
We've gone from the beginning,
from scratch,

3
00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.923
learning about the core functionalities,
a view that really drive Nuxt.

4
00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:12.257
And then, we started really diving into
the fundamentals about what makes Nuxt

5
00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:13.301
really powerful.

6
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:17.548
And so that's whether that's page-based
routing, the composables they provide for

7
00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:20.486
us, there's honestly a heck of
a lot more that we can cover.

8
00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.979
But I hope that with this, you feel a lot
more comfortable as far as exploring

9
00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.726
the dots and starting to
experiment with things yourself.

10
00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.748
But as far as some things I
do wanna call out, right,

11
00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:32.931
cuz from here, you got so
many Nuxt things to explore.

12
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:36.010
Remember what I told you Nuxt has
the nitro back end engine that they're

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.690
working with.

14
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.972
Well, basically, they came up with a way
that if you add a server folder to

15
00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:44.998
your project, you basically get
a back end that scaffold it for you.

16
00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:47.714
So you actually create API's with that,
and

17
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.295
actually it runs a whole node server for
you with API calls.

18
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:54.389
And it can store stuff and
update things, it's ridiculous.

19
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.812
And that, once again,
could be a workshop all in and of itself.

20
00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:00.680
But once again, that's one of those
things, where if that's something you

21
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.298
start to reach for, where you start
to do more full stack Nuxt things.

22
00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:07.354
And you wanna explore what that's like,
then server ware, middleware, and

23
00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:09.935
authentication, all this
stuff you have what you

24
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.208
need to start basically exploring that and
trying things out.

25
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:15.756
But again, it's not something
that everyone deals with, so

26
00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:18.306
that's why this is not being
covered in this particular one.

27
00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:21.408
The one thing I do,
wanna make sure that I do have kind of

28
00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:23.970
a brief pitch on the however
on Nuxt modules,

29
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.219
which is one of the best things
about the Nuxt ecosystem.

30
00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.173
And so two particular modules that I
do wanna call out is Nuxt Content.

31
00:01:34.173 --> 00:01:39.853
And so Nuxts content, basically think of
them like plugins into your Nuxt library.

32
00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:43.026
So you would basically say, hey,
I'm gonna install Nuxt Content, and

33
00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:44.024
I'm gonna enable it.

34
00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:48.120
And what this does is Nuxt was really
brilliant in this regard in terms of

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.960
all you do is you create a content
folder inside of your directory.

36
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.953
And they can contain any sort of
static files like markdown files,

37
00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:57.459
CSV files, JSON files.

38
00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.742
And what it does is it
makes it really easy for

39
00:01:59.742 --> 00:02:03.650
you to easily parse those things into
your page views, so you can imagine.

40
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.023
So to show you actually
a live example of that,

41
00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.143
let me go to my GitHub for
my personal site.

42
00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:16.320
This is an older implementation of it, but
it will definitely demonstrate the point.

43
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.944
You'll see here that
inside of my content blog,

44
00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:21.189
I have a ton of different markdown files.

45
00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.815
And typically,
when it comes to rendering markdown files,

46
00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:26.646
you have to get a markdown rendering
engine, you have to grab it,

47
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.235
you have to parse it,
there's a lot of things you gotta do.

48
00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:32.466
But with the way the Nuxt Content works,

49
00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:37.041
all I gotta do is inside of my page for
my blog for the slug.

50
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:41.384
You'll notice that all I have to do is
grab all of my content from that folder.

51
00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:44.984
And then what it does is it makes it so
easy for me to render,

52
00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:49.179
because it provides this global
component called nuxt-content.

53
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.920
It passes the document as a data, and
it just renders everything correctly.

54
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.213
And even to the point, where you can
actually put view components inside of

55
00:02:57.213 --> 00:03:00.310
markdown files in you all know how
to actually register those things.

56
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.000
It's serious, it's ridiculous
how much power comes with that.

57
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.672
And it's highly recommended for anyone
looking to build their own personal site

58
00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:11.758
in Nuxt, and try out some blogging
features and that kind of thing.

59
00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.444
And so they did an absolute
phenomenal job with that, so

60
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.110
keep an eye out on Nuxt-content.

61
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.009
The other one that I think is really
worth keeping an eye on is Nuxt image.

62
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.530
And so this is a DX improvement on
the whole concept of image processing.

63
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.043
Because as we all know, right, images
are a big issue when it comes to payload.

64
00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.760
But when you have Nuxt image,
I saw this in an earlier build, so

65
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.860
I know this is basically
the direction they're heading.

66
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.323
The way it works is you basically call
this global component called Nuxt image,

67
00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.528
and you pass in the path of
whatever the image is, right?

68
00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.730
And so this case, it's nuxt-icon.png.

69
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.121
Well, what that actually will do is that
if you pass a different property, so

70
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.920
we come down here, and we say, IF, these
are placeholders for high quality width or

71
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.992
even things, let me see,
we may go down a little bit.

72
00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:07.243
Responsive sizes at viewport with
small do 100 viewport width,

73
00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:10.821
then medium 50 viewport width,
large 400 pixels,

74
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:14.046
what it'll actually do is
it'll actually go out.

75
00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:17.723
And wait,
[SOUND] it will actually go out and

76
00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:22.129
cut all the images to
the sizes that you specified.

77
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:27.077
And then I'll put the correct elements
that then show the source set on all of

78
00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:32.660
those things configured correctly so that
you don't have to do any work beyond that.

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.303
And taking that image processing off of
my plate., that's huge for developers.

80
00:04:39.303 --> 00:04:44.276
Because oftentimes this is something
you have outsource to a different third

81
00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:48.186
party service, or
you have to build your own special thing.

82
00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:52.538
But with Nuxt image, and that being built
in, it's just as easy as saying on this

83
00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:57.220
component for this image, generate these
specific sizes, it'll just do it for you.

84
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.887
And the syntax is actually quite fun to
work with once you start figuring out what

85
00:05:00.887 --> 00:05:01.938
you're looking for.

86
00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:05.024
And I'm so excited for
the things that are coming out with.

87
00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:09.324
And so the other thing to realize about
a lot of these, Nuxt modules is the Nuxt

88
00:05:09.324 --> 00:05:13.047
team is aware that a lot of these
things are not just Nuxt problems.

89
00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:17.638
These are things that overall are things
that all frameworks are dealing with.

90
00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:22.438
So if you haven't heard of unjs,
this is their GitHub, here we go.

91
00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.758
And so unjs is their way of public,

92
00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.998
they're basically JavaScript
modules to solve these various

93
00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:33.571
problems that could theoretically
be ported to other frameworks.

94
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:38.007
it's just a nice image and Nuxt Content
have that branding, and obviously,

95
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:40.980
they're like Nuxt as
a first class citizen.

96
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.861
But otherwise, unjs is a repo that's kind
of worth watching if you're looking for

97
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:47.200
basically your third party,
a Java open source.

98
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.000
JavaScript library,
you just wanna import and use, and

99
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.524
then you can walk away from it.

100
00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:55.513
Thanks everyone for spending the time with
me today, it's been an absolute blast.

101
00:05:55.513 --> 00:05:57.240
Once again, my name's Ben Hong.

102
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.701
If you're looking for me on any of
the internet things, I'm under the moniker

103
00:06:00.701 --> 00:06:04.441
bencodezen, and so happy to chat with you
all as you have more questions about Nuxt.

104
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:06.930
So honestly, please feel free
to reach out, my DMs are open.

105
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.681
And so really appreciate you all
spending the time with me today, and

106
00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.632
I guess with that, till next time.

107
00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:16.976
