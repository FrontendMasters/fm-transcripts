00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.867
So we've done a lot as far as
routing we've done all this stuff.

2
00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:06.409
But then something that's probably gonna
come to your mind at this point is you're

3
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.852
probably thinking wait what
about page metadata stuff.

4
00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:13.748
Because if you actually look at our page
this whole time the page titles not very

5
00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.390
friendly.

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.760
It just says the URL.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.660
We can do better than that.

8
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.430
But the question is how?

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.557
And so
we talked about composable before and so

10
00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:29.066
composable they're gonna be everywhere in
your life when you work with U3 and Nuxt

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:35.090
because we're trying to make your life
easier by providing you helper functions.

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.830
So to show you how this works, let's say
we wanna go inside of the homepage, right?

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.412
Index.view this is fairly straightforward.

14
00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.480
How might we do this?

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.320
Well we actually have a composable
called useHead, so in other words,

16
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.544
it's a function that takes an object
where we can define properties that would

17
00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:54.580
normally go inside the head
section of the HTML.

18
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.198
So if I type the title here and I'm just,
this is an Oompa Loompa title and

19
00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:01.635
then I open this up hey, look at that.

20
00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:04.575
That page title Oompa Loompa that easy,
right?

21
00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:08.261
So you can certainly pass in dynamic
variables and that kind of stuff but

22
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.112
here's the thing though, right?

23
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:13.806
From here you might be, okay, well what if
I wanted to find a link rel stylesheet.

24
00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.616
Well, because you're in JavaScript land
it would look something like this.

25
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:21.101
It be link, an array, an array of
objects where what is its type.

26
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.131
It's a rel and a rel of what?

27
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:27.680
Style sheet, and then you gotta comma it,
and be, wait the h ref is this.

28
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.360
And it's, I don't know you, it's kind
of awkward to type properties this way.

29
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.049
And luckily the Nuxt team thought
the same thing to they're, yeah,

30
00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.060
we should let people
do it another way too.

31
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.630
And so what they did was, which again,
is gonna feel really weird at first.

32
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.178
What they've done is they've
actually created these built in

33
00:01:48.178 --> 00:01:51.449
components that are basically native HTML.

34
00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:56.720
Elements, but they're all capitalized.

35
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.022
And they're special,

36
00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:03.100
because these are things that are going to
get hoisted into how the page is built.

37
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.550
So they have nothing to
do at a component level.

38
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.610
So you shouldn't be looking at this
thinking, this is a multi root component.

39
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.920
No, this here is really
just configuration.

40
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.594
So we could do for
example is we can go title.

41
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:19.717
What can I,
Water Bottle [LAUGH] there you go.

42
00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:24.720
And then we can see wallah,
Water Bottle, at the top.

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.147
But then what's nice now is that if
you wanna import like font awesome and

44
00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.045
all those things,

45
00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:32.660
rather than having to break up what
they normally ask you to import, right?

46
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.374
Which is some sort of link so
example if it's like Import font,

47
00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:39.080
awesome CDN, for example, right?

48
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.627
Normally, it's you get some sort of,
like this,

49
00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:45.430
just for example, let's say this
thing we're trying to copy in.

50
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.868
Normally in the past, you'd have to go in
and convert this into a JavaScript object,

51
00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.490
which is just kind of a pain.

52
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.720
But now, you can just load it in directly
as long as you just make sure to

53
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.040
capitalize the component correctly,
and then this will work.

54
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.270
This will get hoisted and
it'll be part of your page.

55
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.490
And the reason this is super exciting
is because now more so than ever,

56
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.367
it becomes easier to actually split apart
the resources that matter to certain parts

57
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.780
of your app.

58
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.453
Because for those who have been in
the industry for a little while,

59
00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:16.845
we used to limit designers from including
certain number of fonts because we didn't

60
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:19.400
want them to actually get blown across,
right?

61
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.650
And so don't get me wrong,
you can always customize it.

62
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.418
But this makes it even easier now to be,

63
00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:25.970
on this specific component
when it's loaded.

64
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.929
Yeah, we need some cursive font to do
some really cool design thing, but

65
00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.570
that's the only time we ever need it.

66
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.288
And the way it's scoped together because
of single file components makes it so

67
00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:36.890
easy to figure that out immediately.

68
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.624
Right and this is an advantage to
the way they've architected this is for

69
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:45.670
that modularity and
scoping things together.

70
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.740
&gt;&gt; Really quick one, I'm sorry
&gt;&gt; Yeah please

71
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.935
&gt;&gt; Html head title link these components

72
00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:51.861
are built in via Nuxt not via
&gt;&gt; Yes,

73
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:56.777
these are Nuxt's components where this is
also why the Pascal case naming convention

74
00:03:56.777 --> 00:04:01.330
is consistent with me is because If we
lowercase this, this will not work.

75
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.970
It will not work.

76
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.130
In fact it'll read it as normal HTML.

77
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.337
But because we're hoisting this stuff,
and it's meant for

78
00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:10.720
like configuration purposes,
that's the reason why it's capitalized.

79
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.270
And so by the way, you don't actually need
the HTML, you can actually just do head,

80
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.060
just like that.

81
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.490
This will work too.

82
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.096
But HTML, for example, you can imagine,
especially on translations,

83
00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:21.840
you might need to specify
different language attributes.

84
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.640
This is a common thing too, especially as
people have international sites and stuff.

85
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.357
So this is, again, is this kind of
thinking index improvements that

86
00:04:29.357 --> 00:04:33.716
I really enjoy about seeing what the Nuxt
team comes out with as they see different

87
00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:35.918
size projects move through the things.
