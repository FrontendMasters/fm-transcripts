WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.598
We've done a lot of foundational work,
basically,

2
00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:04.650
is what we've been doing up to this point.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.137
And if you've noticed, what we
essentially have been working with is,

4
00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:10.893
it feels like a view CLI app
to be totally honest, right?

5
00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:13.430
You have your app view,
that's what's being compiled,

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.466
basically feels like
client side rendering.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.740
And that's actually what this is,

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.785
there's a reason why Nuxt
approach it this way because.

9
00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:23.350
Not everyone who uses a nice app needs
routing and all this other stuff.

10
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.597
So one of the nice things about
approaching it this way is that,

11
00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:30.641
if you wanna build an app like this,
client side rendered, and then like say,

12
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.728
add a next PWA module,
which we'll talk more about later.

13
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.673
Then all of a sudden you have a client
side rendering app that has PWA

14
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:37.415
capabilities.

15
00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.762
And you didn't have to do anything else.

16
00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:41.506
It won't import view router,
it'll keep the bundle small.

17
00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.559
So those are some of the optimizations
that Knucks makes for you.

18
00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.151
And one of the reasons why
they start out like this.

19
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.714
Because they wanna make sure you basically
often to the things that you really need,

20
00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:53.177
and that's what we're gonna be doing as we
kinda progress through the rest of this

21
00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:56.016
day, is progressively add on more and
more features onto our app.

22
00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:59.642
So naturally, one of the things we've
been kind of flip flopping between

23
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.043
is the fact that we haven't really
created a components folder yet.

24
00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:05.297
And there's a reason for that because,

25
00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:08.689
the components are a little bit
special in the Knucks arena.

26
00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.106
So let's go ahead and

27
00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:14.366
finally just move out of this app
to do at boat photo gallery bit.

28
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:19.184
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a new folder inside of our app,

29
00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:20.940
folder called components.

30
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.197
All right, and now this time, what I'm
gonna go ahead and do, is let's refactor

31
00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:29.038
this to be a little bit more like
actual component architecture, right?

32
00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.046
So, what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna create something.

33
00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:36.636
Let's see you do viewer, dot view, so
this will be one of my components.

34
00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:39.871
And we can basically just, I realize you
could have just dragged and copy, but

35
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.630
I'll just do a copy and paste,
which will be able to easier for me.

36
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.391
And then I'll delete this.

37
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.097
Great, all right, that looks good.

38
00:01:49.097 --> 00:01:50.563
And then, what else do we got?

39
00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:54.888
We have the, wanna make sure [SOUND],

40
00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:58.939
okay, so we have the to do viewer.

41
00:01:58.939 --> 00:01:59.797
It's inside of here.

42
00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:04.439
And now, what we wanna do is if we wanted
to render this, say we wanted to put

43
00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.623
the photo gallery in one section and then
put the, to do in another column, right?

44
00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:14.406
What we could do, is we can wrap this
inside something called columns,

45
00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:17.847
Oops dot columns,
which is a layout class from Al.

46
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:22.414
And we can group this first
one in one column and

47
00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:28.873
then in the other column we can
actually put in our to-do viewer.

48
00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:31.699
And so, let me go ahead and
import that at the top.

49
00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.682
So import to do viewer from, and

50
00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:39.773
then the route is components,
fot start to do viewer.

51
00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:41.799
That's it, save.

52
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.752
So, with any luck,
if I refresh this, there we go.

53
00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:50.071
We see now we have our to do
list on the right, it fetches.

54
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.947
We have our photo gallery here,
it fetches what's good side by side, and

55
00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:55.773
we have component architecture.

56
00:02:55.773 --> 00:03:00.948
So here's the thing, though, when we're
taking a look at this component, and

57
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:06.368
we're taking a look at the photo gallery
component, there's a bit of similarity.

58
00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:09.907
So what I'm gonna do actually right
now is, I'm gonna go ahead and

59
00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:11.184
refactor this one too.

60
00:03:11.184 --> 00:03:17.339
So let's go ahead and
grab all of this, And

61
00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.557
this will be photo gallery.view,
just paste that,

62
00:03:21.557 --> 00:03:24.377
I think that should be everything.

63
00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:26.099
Yep, I think that's everything there.

64
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.857
So now app.view,
we can simplify, copy this,

65
00:03:29.857 --> 00:03:34.715
unless you this sort of place
the top one to be an alphabetical,

66
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:39.220
so Photo Gallery, and
now we can delete all of this stuff.

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.153
So then we have that, we can get rid
of basically, all this HTML in here.

68
00:03:44.153 --> 00:03:48.321
And we can basically
put Photo Gallery here.

69
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:51.299
And so, just to make sure if something
shows something visually changed,

70
00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.993
we're just going to flip these real
quick so that to do on the left and

71
00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:55.244
photo galleries on the right.

72
00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:58.956
And now we switch over and refresh.

73
00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:01.192
Oh-uh, something's broken.

74
00:04:01.192 --> 00:04:02.865
Why is it yelling at me?

75
00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:07.420
Well, it's because,

76
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.290
no scripts setup.

77
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.738
That's why, cuz inside a photo gallery,
I did a straight copy paste, and

78
00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:16.241
we don't need this in anymore.

79
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.237
So that needs to go away.

80
00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:21.024
We don't need this
container section column,

81
00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:23.957
we just need the basic HTML
here that we are using.

82
00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:27.080
Which means,
we can get rid of all this other stuff.

83
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.826
Save it.

84
00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:31.338
And then now this should be much better.

85
00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.061
There we go.

86
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.757
We see that our photo gallery here,
we see that there.

87
00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:38.336
Now, a couple of things still a little
bit messed up though, is because,

88
00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:42.264
now that we're no longer an app to view
these styles here are actually still being

89
00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.197
relegated to the specific component.

90
00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:48.653
So, what we wanna go ahead and
do to be honest, is let's go ahead and

91
00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:52.330
move the BOMA import into
app.css which it is here, and

92
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.793
then to do viewer does I also
have the import it does.

93
00:04:55.793 --> 00:05:00.650
So let's get rid of that and refactor
that a little bit, and, yes sir, yeah,

94
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.978
we need the main.CSS to also
go in app.view for now.

95
00:05:03.978 --> 00:05:06.658
Okay, now we'll save this,
this should start to look better.

96
00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:09.208
There we go, this is kind of
what we were expecting now.

97
00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.271
Once again, we have what to do,
we have our gallery.
