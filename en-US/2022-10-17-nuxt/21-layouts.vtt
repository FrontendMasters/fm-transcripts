00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.680
So the next thing we're gonna talk
about is a topic that comes up a lot

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.083
as our app starts to grow and scale.

3
00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:11.173
Which is you can imagine that over time as
your app has different pages and stuff,

4
00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:14.554
you're probably gonna have
different ways to format it, right?

5
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:18.430
And so your first instinct when you're
doing that is to probably add different

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.542
style classes to different pages,
but at some point, you're

7
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.520
going to end up with this weird thing
where like some pages need this layout.

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.520
Some people pages needs this layout.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.762
And there's only so
many V ifs you can do and

10
00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.576
your app dot view before is
just like spaghetti code.

11
00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:34.063
So there's got to be a better way, right.

12
00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:37.569
And yes, there is when we asked you
this question, if there wasn't but

13
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:40.920
nothing came up with a very
intuitive way of working on this.

14
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.231
And that is with as you
would probably have guessed,

15
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.802
the layouts folder once again, I keep
accidentally creating it on the root, but

16
00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:49.620
it should belong inside of our directory.

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.301
And what the layout component is, if you
think about it is we talked before we're

18
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.764
apt is at the pinnacle is at the top of
everything so once you included an app,

19
00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:58.540
it drops down everything.

20
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.930
Think of layouts as like that middle
layer between the pages and app.view.

21
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.866
And so the first thing you're gonna wanna
create when you create your layouts is

22
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.226
there's default.view.

23
00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:14.100
And as you might have guessed this is the
default layer that everything inherits.

24
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.022
So if there's nothing in here nothing
will happen but for now just for

25
00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:22.550
the sake of argument we're just gonna go
ahead and we're just gonna make sure we

26
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.430
have a class title is primary for
example, it's a default layout.

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.330
So just by having this layout in here,
we'll notice nothing's really changing.

28
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.230
And the reason for that is if you look at
our default view page, there's nowhere for

29
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.470
the patient actually dropped its content.

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.555
Remember we did that the same
thing when next page,

31
00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:44.190
like how do we tell Knucks
we need to drop content in.

32
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.460
Well, we've had a lot of
practice with this at this point.

33
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.350
Okay, and
what we need is we need to give it a slot.

34
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.279
Because that's how we know like, hey for
the content using this default layout,

35
00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.286
drop it in this particular area.

36
00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:02.435
So now that it has a slot here,
it should look better going forward.

37
00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.302
But I wonder if it's gonna crash.

38
00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:12.312
No, that's good.

39
00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:13.688
Layouts default.

40
00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:15.760
Yep, yep, yep.

41
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.466
That should be it.

42
00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.300
So let me go ahead and
check something real quick.

43
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.711
We're gonna go inside the pages index.

44
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:28.191
And let's go ahead and actually define
the layout real quick and go like this.

45
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.879
So now if we go home,
there you go, that is much better.

46
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.660
Okay, so it looks like by default without
actually wrapping anything in the next

47
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.320
layout component, it will actually skip
the layouts directory at this time.

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.098
But the moment you wanna actually use
the layout, you can just wrap it here and

49
00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:53.880
this is the default one will apply
as we saw with default layout.

50
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.249
But obviously, we're here to
talk about custom layouts, and

51
00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.510
it was just the one we really
wouldn't need this solution at all.

52
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.412
So let's say for example,
we want a specific display layout,

53
00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:04.450
then we can basically
do a display dot view.

54
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.536
And similarly, I'll just copy
the default one here, just so

55
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.400
that it's a little bit easier.

56
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.090
We can definitely say this is
going to be the display layout.

57
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.207
And the way you do this is that what we
can do is go inside of display and so

58
00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:22.929
any page that we wanna use this specific
layout, we can basically wrap the display.

59
00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.550
So in this case,
we're gonna do it inside of here.

60
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.290
We can wrap it with this
native next layout.

61
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.874
Component just like we saw earlier, but

62
00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:35.142
the difference being is
that we do name=display.

63
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:39.930
And now you see this
is the default layout.

64
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.541
Photo wait hold up there you go.

65
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.860
Now this is the display layout,
home and display.

66
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.694
And so it's basically just a simple
technique to be an intermediary Between

67
00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:56.120
your app to your pages,
that's how you should see layouts.

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.810
Otherwise they're honestly
fairly straightforward.

69
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.150
There's not much more
complexity beyond that.

70
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.620
They act like normal components, so you
can customize the nav bar to that specific

71
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.960
page if you have like specific call
to actions, that kind of stuff.

72
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.820
That's basically all it's there for and

73
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.070
it's one of those things where you'll
probably grow into the problem.

74
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.850
You don't need to necessarily,
anticipate it in advance.

75
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.594
So as your site grows, you start to
notice the layout starts to shift,

76
00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:19.990
then you can go ahead and
start using this.

77
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.281
So just a high level technique that
I want you all to be aware of.
