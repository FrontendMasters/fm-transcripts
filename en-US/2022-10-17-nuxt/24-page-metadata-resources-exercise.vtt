00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.087
So for this exercise, what I would be
asking you to do, is to go ahead and

2
00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.474
go to Google Fonts, grab a couple
of fonts and then go ahead and

3
00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:11.017
import them onto your page and
just load them up on their styles.

4
00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.670
So for the solution, so what I asked you
to do is go into fonts.google.com and

5
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.505
just grab any font that you like.

6
00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.645
So it looks like,
let's see, Qwitcher Grypen.

7
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.905
That looks interesting, let's grab that.

8
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.185
So we can go ahead and here we go.

9
00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:34.875
We have a link here that we can grab.

10
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:40.240
So let's grab that and all we gotta do now
is we're still inside of our homepage.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.093
So I can drop this in here instead
cuz that was a fake link, and

12
00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:46.450
just uppercase all of these things.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.122
And we do need to actually close
these components though since we

14
00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.140
are inside of the single file component.

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.535
And once we have that,
we can do and we can check.

16
00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:02.388
So we can go inside of our homepage, and

17
00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:09.593
what you'll see now is that if
you look inside of the head,

18
00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:15.055
here we go fonts.googleapis, go static.

19
00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:18.594
It builds exactly as you would hope to
without the need to like write a bunch of

20
00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:20.600
JavaScript to try to make that thing work.

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.700
It really just felt more like a copy and
paste.

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.260
And that's as easy as it gets when it
comes to not only configuring resources

23
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.411
for your pages, but
also if you wanna add metadata.

24
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:31.430
Cuz that's a big part, right?

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.000
We're talking about SEO and
that kind of stuff, right?

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.286
People wanna be able to see,
get their search results index and so

27
00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:40.531
being able to dynamically configure meta
tags with certain descriptions that kinda

28
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.350
thing that's a big deal.

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.483
And so with this new way of configuration,
it makes it a lot easier for

30
00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:49.117
people to configure all these different
properties for their pages as they go.

31
00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:52.981
As you can imagine for like the photos and
to do things that we had, you could easily

32
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.790
just be like there's my page title,
there's a description, there's a site,

33
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.395
you could do a bunch of stuff with it to
actually inform people about your page
