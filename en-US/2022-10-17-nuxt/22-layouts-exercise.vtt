00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.915
For this exercise,
what I want you to do is to go ahead and

2
00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:07.336
just create some custom layouts and then
practice applying it to the various pages.

3
00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:16.974
All right, so for this layout exercise,
what I asked you to do was to create

4
00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.566
another custom layout and
just apply it to another page.

5
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.322
So in this particular case, let's go ahead
and let's create a specific layout for

6
00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:23.922
to do items.

7
00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:28.874
So what I'll do is inside of my layouts I
create a new file called to do dot view.

8
00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:32.810
And then so inside of my file now for
the index dot view.

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.072
The nice thing about this now,
is that for the, let's see to do ID, so

10
00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.622
actually here you have to do is that view.

11
00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.979
This is the page I wanna wrap,
because we're actually using a sub page or

12
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:43.704
the next page.

13
00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:47.561
This means that everything gets inherited
you don't even need to wrap your

14
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:48.179
ID with it.

15
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.954
Because this is something that
being wrapped by a nested view.

16
00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:56.574
So what we can do, is you can wrap
this inside of a NuxtLayout component.

17
00:00:56.574 --> 00:01:00.615
And this NuxtLayout component will get a,
basically what is the name to do.

18
00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.369
And then before I save it, though,

19
00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.653
let me make sure I update this it
actually has something to render.

20
00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:09.152
And so, what I'm gonna do actually,
is I'm gonna go ahead and

21
00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.131
just grab a BULMA component just to
add something a little bit more fun.

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.698
So, we'll do this card right here.

23
00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:18.506
And then I'll just drop it inside of here.

24
00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:23.065
And then what we're gonna wanna do,
is I'm gonna drop the slot

25
00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:27.555
content inside of this content
directory right here, okay?

26
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:33.012
So once we save that, and we save our to
do, we'll go ahead and we'll take a look.

27
00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:35.871
Let's go inside here, fresh.

28
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.099
Let's go to the to dos, and
then you'll notice, whoa,

29
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.932
this card is blowing up, okay?

30
00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:42.310
We need to fix this layout a little bit.

31
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.868
This card is too big, so, what we can do,
is we can say, all right, not the card.

32
00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:49.552
This is too much.

33
00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:53.909
So the card itself is gonna be
wrapped in a container div.

34
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.357
And then I'm gonna wrap it in one more
section just to hopefully clean it up.

35
00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:04.560
Just a smidge and once we say that,
that looks better.

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.093
We could shrink it in more but
I think you'll get the point here, right?

37
00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.822
Is that now you can see our to do items,

38
00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:13.460
it's now actually sitting inside of
the card, which is actually pretty nice.

39
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.158
And so, you can imagine all the fun
things you can start to do with this.

40
00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:19.805
We're, yeah, so, if it's a custom item,
I'm gonna do a profile pic, whatever.

41
00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:22.862
There's a lot of fun stuff you can
start to do with layouts as a result.

42
00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:28.055
And so, it's a nice way of kinda having
shared components, styles and stuff.

43
00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:30.548
And I look forward to seeing what you
all do as far as playing around with.
