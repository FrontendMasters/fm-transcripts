00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.751
Hello and
welcome everyone to Nuxt 3 Fundamentals.

2
00:00:02.751 --> 00:00:06.633
Excited to have you here today as you
spend all day talking about Nuxt things

3
00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.666
which to me as a Nuxt Ambassador I'm
super excited about.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.141
So with that let's jump right in.

5
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:17.650
So to get started a little fun fact
about me is I love amusement park rides.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.983
For those who have seen my past socks
before you usually see the Jurassic Park 1

7
00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:22.004
from Orlando studios.

8
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.958
But this one here is from Splash Mountain
and I believe this one's at Disneyland.

9
00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.998
And so if you're having
trouble finding me granted,

10
00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:30.230
this one's easier than
the Jurassic 1 I use Just to show.

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.980
I'm the one in the middle
with both arms up.

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
I think we're taking, I don't know,
an easy 50, 60 foot dive.

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.330
And Splash Mountain, it's an old ride, but
you will get wet on that one unexpectedly.

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.740
I was very surprised,
it was surprisingly fun.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.260
So I'm currently a Senior Staff Developer
Experience Engineer at Netlify.

16
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.431
I'm on the Vue core team.

17
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.115
The Nuxt ambassador.

18
00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:54.603
Vue Mastery instructor.

19
00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:55.910
And Google Developer expert.

20
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.911
So as far as what you can expect as far
as how this workshop is going to go,

21
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:02.941
I'm a big fan of not lecturing at you for
eight hours.

22
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:05.197
Because that's a lot of talking on my end,
and frankly,

23
00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.750
it can be pretty boring as an attendee.

24
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.010
We're here to learn how to code, right?

25
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.030
So this is the format that
I've come to use and love, and

26
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.040
it's worked out pretty well for me.

27
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.523
So what you can expect is that first thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna learn about

28
00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:17.874
whatever the topic is, right?

29
00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:21.478
So you've never heard about it,
you get explanation examples and

30
00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:22.839
it will be demoed to you.

31
00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.959
After that you'll have a chance
to ask questions, right?

32
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.979
Clarify anything in case I went
over something too quickly,

33
00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.526
we'll get a chance to do that.

34
00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:32.716
But then finally, the most important
part to this step to be honest,

35
00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:36.020
is you get to a chance to apply those
concepts that we just talked about.

36
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.308
And the other activity I'd say here in
regards to exercises as well is that I

37
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.500
really encourage you to experiment.

38
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.710
A lot of coding and learning is about
making it stick for yourself and

39
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.680
personalizing it.

40
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.850
So as much as you can be, actually
what if I try this, what if I do this?

41
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.161
That'll give you a chance, especially
because you all are here to ask questions

42
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.949
then to be like, hey, I tried this thing,
here's what happened.

43
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.283
And it's really a great way to take
advantage of the live workshop

44
00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:58.926
that we have now.

45
00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:01.383
Also, I know that sometimes
when taking a class,

46
00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:04.788
it's easy to kinda take a backseat and
just skip over the exercises.

47
00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:08.274
But I can't stress enough don't
underestimate the value of actually doing

48
00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:09.043
the exercises.

49
00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:13.090
Because while some of the exercises
might seem easy or obvious to be honest,

50
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.619
when we code, what do we do?

51
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.970
We need to type, we need to actually
get that muscle memory, right?

52
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.148
So it's just like when you look at someone
climbing a wall, it looks easy but

53
00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:25.655
developing the muscle memory to actually
get on those rocks and pull yourself up,

54
00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.048
that takes repetition.

55
00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:31.660
So since we wanna master this skill,
get better at what we do.

56
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.880
I strongly encourage you to
actually do the practice as well.

57
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.700
And then finally, whenever possible,
please get creative.

58
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.483
Again, so I put some like basic,

59
00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:41.178
like guidance as far as
what the exercises can be.

60
00:02:41.178 --> 00:02:43.768
But just to re-emphasize the fact
that the more you can think of like

61
00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:44.636
personalized ideas.

62
00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:48.255
As you're going through you're like I
would love to do this or I'm gonna make

63
00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:51.730
a fan website about the severance because
I really love that TV show whatever.

64
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.251
Whatever it gets, it's engaging and
sticky for you, go for

65
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.023
it, please feel free to
color outside the box.

66
00:02:58.023 --> 00:03:02.204
And then as a couple of reminders as far
as things to sort of frame your mindset.

67
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:05.090
Is that there are often more than
one way to accomplish things and

68
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.977
especially with Vue 3 having
options API and composition API,

69
00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.775
there is gonna be a lot of
different methods for doing things.

70
00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.687
But what I'm gonna try to do in this
workshop is provide you some conventions

71
00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:15.564
and standards that I'm
seeing in the industry.

72
00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:19.074
But just know that there are usually
multiple ways to solve a single problem,

73
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:22.106
to fit depending on what like
the special context that you're in.

74
00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:24.760
So just know that, and
whatever I'm presenting today,

75
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.207
it doesn't make any of
the alternatives inferior.

76
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.497
And the last reminder is
all code is compromised.

77
00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:34.014
So whenever I'm presenting something,
I encourage you to agree or disagree,

78
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.634
I encourage you to question it, because
your experience and your opinion matters

79
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:41.166
when it comes to how these techniques
apply to the codebase you're working on.

80
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:42.284
And so at the end of the day,

81
00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:45.491
I stress this basically with every single
workshop and anything that I teach,

82
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.614
it's really important for you to choose
what's best for you and your team.

83
00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:51.284
That's what matters at the end of the day,
because you're the one shipping features

84
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.819
to your customers, and that's what's
ultimately gonna make the difference.

85
00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.658
Not because someone else said that,

86
00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:59.112
your code is impure if it's not done
a certain way, ignore all that.
