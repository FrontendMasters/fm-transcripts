WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.430
So let's go ahead and
open up the project, shall we?

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.264
So hopefully,
you've clone down the repo and

3
00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:06.153
there's only a main branch
on there right now.

4
00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:10.372
So if it looks barren, that is by design
because what we're gonna do is we're gonna

5
00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:13.687
fill it out over the course of
the workshop so that you can see how it

6
00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:17.579
progresses and get really experienced
building Nuxt 3 apps from scratch.

7
00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.140
So with that said, let's go ahead and
just kick things off, shall we?

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.153
So when you wanna scaffold
a brand new Nuxt 3 site,

9
00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:28.090
you're gonna use their Nuxt CLI,
which is they've called Nuxi.

10
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.408
So actually, let me just bring that
up on the docks, so you can see.

11
00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.248
So on the getting started, you'll see
here that they have this, basically this

12
00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:39.440
command line tool called Nuxi, and that's
what's responsible for doing the create.

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.581
So in the past if you used vue
CLI create and all that stuff,

14
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:46.046
this is basically the equivalent,
but it's been rewritten for

15
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.440
basically the new tooling chain of Nuxt 3.

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.034
So we're basically gonna run this command.

17
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:53.898
So in here, I'm gonna run npx.

18
00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:58.319
So if you're new to the NPX command, it's
basically allowing you to run these sort

19
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.938
of terminal like command line packages,
basically as one-offs.

20
00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:03.760
Because otherwise what you
end up doing is in the past,

21
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.355
you would install all
your packages globally.

22
00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:08.602
And then as a result, you have all this
stuff that you may be used once or

23
00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.293
maybe a few times a year, but it's taking
up all this space on your computer when

24
00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:15.737
it's not necessary, so NPX kind of
like basically helps you avert that.

25
00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:19.816
So we do npx nuxi, then what we do,
we're initializing a new project.

26
00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:24.882
And just to keep things simple, I'm gonna
initialize it under the folder called App.

27
00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:29.856
And so that'll go ahead, and you'll see
actually that was pretty done fast.

28
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.400
One of the big things about Nuxt 2 and

29
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.105
Nuxt 3 is that performance
has been hugely amped up.

30
00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:39.732
And part of that is due to the way Vue
3 was rewritten, but also Nuxt 2 or

31
00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.258
Nuxt 3 with the new nitro engine if
you ever hear that pair with Nuxt.

32
00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:47.436
It's basically their new backend tooling
that powers everything that's going

33
00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:48.424
underneath of it.

34
00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.750
And so they've done a lot to optimize
that and really rewrite how that works.

35
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.643
And so this is another reason why we'll
see a lot of performance improvements in

36
00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.969
terms of seeing the Nuxi or
when you're running dev environments.

37
00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.233
For those you who have used Nuxt 2,
sometimes it would spin for

38
00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:03.685
a few seconds just before you would
get to the point where it loaded.

39
00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:08.703
And now that it uses V and more optimized
algorithms, is just way faster.

40
00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:12.420
So anyhow, let's go ahead and
jump into the app, shall we?

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.826
And I'm gonna go ahead and install the
dependencies while we go over what we see

42
00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.613
in there because it's gonna take
a little while to install, and

43
00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:19.870
I want you all to wait for me.

44
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.780
Okay, so what do we see inside of app?

45
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.090
Well, this looks pretty simple.

46
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.132
For those who haven't scaffolded a Nuxt
2 app before, the Nuxt 2 scaffold

47
00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:33.809
whenever you would, like scaffold,
the app was pretty intensive.

48
00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.817
It had a ton of folders in there,
there's a lot of boilerplate.

49
00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:40.959
And this year is kind of takes
the opposite approach this time,

50
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.871
where as you can see, what we have here
is we have your standard Git Ignore which

51
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:48.867
ignores specific files within the repo so
that you don't have to commit those.

52
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.048
We have a Nuxt Config, which is,
again, fairly common for

53
00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:55.945
most of the apps these days,
whether it's like a vue Config or whatnot.

54
00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:57.570
We have your standard package-log,

55
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.660
package.json which
tracks our dependencies.

56
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.030
We have a basic README inside of here, and

57
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.308
we have a TypeScript config file
that's automatically generated for us.

58
00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:10.420
And so before anyone panics, you might
notice you're like, wait, wait, wait,

59
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.200
I did not opt into TypeScript,
what is happening here?

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.506
Well, one of the things that's really
great about TypeScript is that you don't

61
00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:18.338
have to use it.

62
00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:21.703
But what it does do is that for
library authors and for the Nuxt team,

63
00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:24.245
which has rewritten a lot
of things in TypeScript,

64
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.694
it means that you get a lot of free
typing even if you're not using it.

65
00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.709
So later on when you see
us hover over things,

66
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.884
we're not gonna be using
TypeScript at all, but

67
00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:34.660
you'll get the benefits of
the types that will come forward.

68
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.419
So just know that when it comes to this,
even though you didn't technically like

69
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.424
say you wanted to use TypeScript,
it's enabled there for you.

70
00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:42.824
Because at the end of the day,

71
00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:46.920
if you ever choose to actually say I wanna
progressively enhance towards TypeScript.

72
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.051
Now you don't have to worry about like
upgrading the tool chain or anything,

73
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.120
it's just there for you.

74
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.787
And so if you missed it earlier this week,
I did a TypeScript and Vue 3 workshop.

75
00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:00.006
And so if you want to learn more about
progressive enhancement with TypeScript,

76
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.200
be sure to check out that recording and
that workshop.

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.464
I throw out one more file to go over,
and that is this app.vue, and

78
00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:09.143
you'll also notice it's quite barren.

79
00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:11.740
And also, in my opinion,
this is a good thing.

80
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.748
So normally, typically,
when you're starting out,

81
00:04:13.748 --> 00:04:15.340
you would probably run NPM run Dev, right?

82
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.389
So let's just do that.

83
00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.277
So npm run dev, and then you wait,
and then you say, look,

84
00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:22.235
it's gonna be a port 3000.

85
00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.531
Great, so then what do you do?

86
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.284
You open up your browser, and
so that works pretty well.

87
00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:29.152
But let's do an optimization
though to that workflow.

88
00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:33.210
Inside of package.json,
instead of just running nuxt.dev,

89
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.150
you can actually pass it a flag,
which is -O.

90
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.259
And so when you save this, what this
is going to do is when I run npm dev,

91
00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.788
is actually going to automatically open
the environment in the current tab or

92
00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:47.310
basically, the browser that I want it to.

93
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.864
And so it's a small optimization.

94
00:04:48.864 --> 00:04:51.217
But honestly, most of the time
we're running NPM run Dev,

95
00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:52.593
this is actually what we wanna do.

96
00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.870
We wanna open the tab, so
why not shortcut that bit?

97
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.170
So that's a little bit of
enhancement on your workflow.

98
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.702
So now that we have everything running,
you're gonna see this is a really,

99
00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:03.789
one of the things I will say I love
about the Nuxt team is they put a lot

100
00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.410
of time into the design and
just like having fun with it.

101
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.972
And so having this nice little gradient,
dark theme, absolutely beautiful.

102
00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.675
And so this is the Nuxt welcome component.

103
00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:16.645
And so you can see here, there's links
to the documentation, GitHub Twitter.

104
00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:20.917
But my favorite thing about this, which
might not be as apparent is that this

105
00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:25.280
Nuxs welcome, if you look around the app,
there's no component anywhere.

106
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.570
There's no boilerplate exist anywhere,
why?

107
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.126
Because if we actually go ahead and hover
over this, and if you right-click it,

108
00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:34.678
and then you Go to Definition,
for example.

109
00:05:34.678 --> 00:05:37.702
Another way you can do that to
shortcut it, if you hold Option,

110
00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:41.812
I believe Alt on Windows, you can actually
click in it and that'll do the same thing,

111
00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:43.777
it'll basically go to the definition.

112
00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:46.266
And we'll be using that a couple of times,
I think throughout the workshop, so

113
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:46.910
something to note.

114
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.695
But you notice that notice Nuxtwelcome is
actually a component that's being imported

115
00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:55.380
from a library that's basically
hidden away from your code base.

116
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.312
Because after all, they know that when
you scaffold a website or an app,

117
00:05:58.312 --> 00:06:00.200
you're not gonna wanna
use the Nuxt welcome.

118
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.060
This is something you're basically
gonna spend the first commit

119
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.150
deleting all the boilerplate,
so why bother?

120
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.770
So it's there for you just to have
something as a placeholder, but the moment

121
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.490
we delete this from our website, and
we just say like Hello Frontend Masters.

122
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.004
You see, our site did update as expected,
but more importantly,

123
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.970
Nuxt welcome is not gonna be
bundled in your site at all.

124
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.703
So that to me is the nice kind
of developer experience that I'm

125
00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:29.256
kind of hoping for.

126
00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:33.530
Because when you have so much boilerplate,
we've all done that where we just commit

127
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.950
something that says
delete boilerplate code.

128
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.411
So that said, the reason I wanted to show
you the definition though is that maybe

129
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.438
you're curious about
how they did that page.

130
00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:44.992
And so you can learn more about it inside
of, basically you can look at this path,

131
00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:46.365
look at how everything works.

132
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:47.988
So that's not hidden from you at all,

133
00:06:47.988 --> 00:06:50.189
it's just not part of your
code base out of the box.

134
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.467
The other folder that I need to mention
here actually is that you'll notice we're

135
00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:55.709
in this .nuxt folder.

136
00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.691
And so the .nuxt, so if you don't know
the period, that prefix is a folder name,

137
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.960
typically means it's
supposed to be hidden.

138
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.238
And usually, this means it's not
something you're supposed to touch, and

139
00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:06.861
that maintains true for this as well.

140
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:11.331
This basically contains a bunch of files
that the nitro server that Nuxt is running

141
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:14.910
on, it's referencing to do a bunch
of optimizations and stuff.

142
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.462
And so it's there also because sometimes
you do wanna kinda peek under the hood,

143
00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:21.558
like we just did to be like, wait,
where is this coming from exactly?

144
00:07:21.558 --> 00:07:25.436
But otherwise, you should basically never
come in and modify this cuz every time

145
00:07:25.436 --> 00:07:28.356
you run npm run dev,
it will regenerate this entire folder.

146
00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:30.180
So this is not something you wanna touch.
