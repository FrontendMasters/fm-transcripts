00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.497
So what I'd like you all to do for
this exercise, is go ahead and

2
00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:07.100
just play around with some of
the CSS stuff that we've learned.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.443
But to give you actually something to
direct it towards, let me go ahead and

4
00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.460
flip this real quick.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm gonna go app- todo, cuz you're
gonna work on your photo gallery.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.560
And for the photo gallery, I want you to
just go ahead and add some styles to it.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.066
And so at the bare minimum, you're gonna
try one thing to do try to make your

8
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.414
actual photo gallery appear
at some sort of grid.

9
00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:27.676
So that it's not just like
a straight line of photos.

10
00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:29.364
And if you can get that,
I think it's good enough.

11
00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:32.253
But then if you have extra time and you
wanna challenge yourself at some layout

12
00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:34.218
classes from Bulma play
around with it a little bit.

13
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.570
So last we left off we were talking
a little bit about styling and such.

14
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.974
So I figured, let's go ahead and
just wrap that up.

15
00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:51.046
And so what I'll do is I'm just gonna
go ahead and style just a grid for

16
00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:54.290
our photo gallery, and
then we can move on from there.

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.225
So inside of our app.view, you can see
here that we have everything here and

18
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.510
then our starter block is empty.

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.046
And so for the sake of just keeping
things on the simpler side,

20
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:08.790
what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna
create a list class for this gallery.

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.188
And I'm gonna go ahead and actually use
the module because what I wannna do is

22
00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:16.040
very unique to this particular one.

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
And I also know that list I'm pretty
sure it already exists in Bulma.

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.160
So just to be safe,
let's just do the module.

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.450
This is simple enough to
understand at this point.

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.394
So for me,
I'm just gonna do a display grid and

27
00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:29.351
then grid-template-columns, repeat 5.

28
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:33.075
So basically the way the repeat works is,
how many times are you repeating it,

29
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:37.030
5 times and what unit are you expecting,
in this case, it's 1 fraction.

30
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.074
So basically it's evenly divided between.

31
00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:43.036
So when you fetch it now,
you'll see it's now sitting very nicely.

32
00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.380
We have the five columns looking good.

33
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.890
And then if we really want, let's go
ahead and clean this up a little bit.

34
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.035
Go over to the Code.

35
00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:54.120
And then what we're gonna do,
just make this a little bit nicer,

36
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.707
is let's go ahead and
wrap this thing in a container div.

37
00:01:57.707 --> 00:02:01.110
And so this is one of the layout
classes that Bulma provides.

38
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.770
And I'm gonna wrap it once more cuz
the container helps to basically,

39
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.305
create a box that centers it, but
then we're just gonna go ahead and

40
00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:10.122
create a section div around that.

41
00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:13.387
And so what you'll see here
now is that when we refresh,

42
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:20.446
Assuming I did that right,
I think I know what happened.

43
00:02:20.446 --> 00:02:21.945
Nothing's happening, why is that?

44
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:25.442
Well, if you look at container in section,
there's nothing attached to it, and

45
00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:26.671
there's a reason for that.

46
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:30.220
Because the only time we import a Bulma
was actually on the todo app, so

47
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.570
that's why it's not appearing.

48
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.372
So for now don't worry though by the way
we're gonna stop the flip flopping between

49
00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:37.795
these two files very shortly.

50
00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:40.820
I'm just gonna go ahead,
just copy this over for posterity sake.

51
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.748
Although I just realized that something's
probably gonna break pretty bad.

52
00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:49.764
Refresh, yeah, I thought so.

53
00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:54.135
What my guess is happening right now is
that the module is applying to everything

54
00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:55.980
that's being imported.

55
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.768
So again, just for the sake now of just
keeping things simple because again,

56
00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:03.732
this is there are plenty of amazing CSS
resources on front end masters that y'all

57
00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:05.420
can check out later.

58
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.370
But let's just make this
a little bit clearer.

59
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.866
This is use the naming
way to keep it scoped.

60
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:14.594
And then like that, and
then we save it like this.

61
00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.168
Yes.

62
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:19.530
&gt;&gt; I think you have to put
Lang as CSS on the style tag.

63
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.422
&gt;&gt; Boom, perfect, yep.

64
00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:23.286
We don't have a preprocessor attached.

65
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.457
Let's do it, refresh.

66
00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:28.617
Okay, now that's making me wonder though,
okay,

67
00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:31.344
we're gonna have to test this
out because we are developing.

68
00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.367
Look at that all the list styling
is gone it looks even better
