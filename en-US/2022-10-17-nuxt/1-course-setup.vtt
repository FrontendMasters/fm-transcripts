WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.709
So I'm hoping that you have basic
skills with the terminal and Git.

2
00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.940
So those are things we're just
be kind of assuming you have.

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.029
And then a solid foundation with HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

4
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.564
Again, you need to be a master at any of
them, but as long as you know the basic

5
00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.291
syntax and how it basically
works you should be good to go.

6
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:17.647
And then basic knowledge of Vue 2,
it said Vue 3 here but Vue 2,

7
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:19.183
Vue 3, will be good enough.

8
00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:22.599
We'll be covering Vue 3 basically
functionality as we go, and

9
00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.190
providing a brief overview.

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.506
So we won't be diving in-depth, but

11
00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:27.163
hopefully should be enough
to catch people up.

12
00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:28.849
And then as people have more questions,

13
00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.687
I'm happy to answer those during
the coding exercise and whatnot.

14
00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:35.551
As far as tooling goes, again, just to
make sure everything is on the list.

15
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.733
Having Git it's really important
because if you haven't checked

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.217
already inside the chat, there's
the official repo for the workshop.

17
00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:46.136
And so throughout the workshop I'll be
pushing up different branches so that you

18
00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:50.111
can basically jump in at a certain point
if you feel like you're getting lost, and

19
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:51.687
so knowledge of Git will be key.

20
00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:54.539
The LTS version of node
would be appreciated for

21
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.459
you to download and update cuz that'll
basically help with the tooling for Nuxt,

22
00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.898
cuz you're using basically
the latest version of node.

23
00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:05.914
And then we're using VS code,
and so for those using VS code,

24
00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:08.764
there are two particular
extensions I highly recommend.

25
00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:10.196
The first is Volar.

26
00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:13.258
And so Volar is like the feature of Vue 2,

27
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:17.032
where it allows you to do
the syntax highlighting.

28
00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:20.101
But then on top of that, it adds
the type checking and all that stuff.

29
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.369
And this is even if you're
not using TypeScript,

30
00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.883
it'll still do all this for you.

31
00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.258
So Volar is key.

32
00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:28.620
And then Text Pastry is an extension
that I highly recommend people

33
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.772
have during workshops, because it's
really great at generating lists of data.

34
00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:36.826
And so just to demo that real quick,
so I'm gonna create a new file here.

35
00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:38.816
So sometimes when we
need to create mock data,

36
00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:42.195
you might need to say, I wanna create,
let's say four objects, right?

37
00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:46.322
So you might be like, okay, here,
I'll create empty bracket one, two,

38
00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:47.183
three, four.

39
00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:49.085
And then you need like a custom ID, right?

40
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.945
And so normally what a lot of us
do is we'll go come in here, and

41
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.216
we'll just fake the data.

42
00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:55.394
Will be like ID and then with Text Pastry,

43
00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:57.772
one of the things I can
do is I can do a numbers.

44
00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:00.023
And be like ID 0123.

45
00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:02.072
Which is in itself, that's helpful, right?

46
00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.120
If you can do incremental
numbers like that.

47
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.952
But what it can also help you do actually
it's gonna also help you generate some

48
00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:08.718
UUIDs as well.

49
00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:11.700
And that's super great for just faking
some data and making sure things work.

50
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.168
Because if anyone has built with
any client side frameworks enough,

51
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:19.116
you'll probably have had the experience
where you accidentally got lazy with

52
00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:20.757
labeling the key on an element.

53
00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:23.550
And then when you're doing a transition or
some sort of animation,

54
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.933
things started getting jumbled, because
this key conflicted with another key.

55
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:31.134
And so just having a nice way to easily
generate UUIDs is super helpful that

56
00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:31.686
I found.

57
00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:34.641
So, Text Pastry is the VS
code extension for that.

58
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.284
And finally, like any good
framework there are Vue DevTools.

59
00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.340
So I believe it's for
most of the major browsers, so

60
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.294
I'll be using the one in Chrome.

61
00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:46.676
But the link that you see inside of
the resource is to the GitHub repo, and

62
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:50.340
I think it should link out to all the
different browser extensions depending on

63
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.245
whatever you use.

64
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.554
So yeah,
hopefully that helps to get you started.
