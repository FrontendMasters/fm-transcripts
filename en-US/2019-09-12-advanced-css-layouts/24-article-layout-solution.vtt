00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.025
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So first thing to do when
you're working with this is to take a look

2
00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:04.457
at the structure of your HTML.

3
00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:07.811
So you'll know exactly what kind of
selectors you're going to need to form.

4
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.361
And so one of the things that I did for

5
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.784
you here is I put an ID of the inside
on the body tag here, okay?

6
00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:17.917
So that you have a little handle.

7
00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.322
It could very well be that you wind
up with articles in the sides,

8
00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.228
other places and other documents.

9
00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:27.215
But this happens to be the one
associated with the inside page, right?

10
00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:29.774
So when you scroll down
to the main content,

11
00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:31.790
you see we have our main tag again.

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.538
We have an article.

13
00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:34.817
There's the article.

14
00:00:34.817 --> 00:00:36.770
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.745
We have on the side tends what
people are saying about the book,

16
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.481
there's our side, okay?

17
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.803
And so that's what we have to work with.

18
00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:48.714
Our main tag is going to be what?

19
00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.494
The main tag becomes what?

20
00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:51.318
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Flex box.

21
00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.469
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our flex container,
yeah, the parent.

22
00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.371
And then the article and
the aside become what?

23
00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:00.118
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The items.

24
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:02.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're the flex items,
right, the children.

25
00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:10.274
So then we can go ahead over here and
write our CSS right here.

26
00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:13.298
Do I need to change
anything with main here?

27
00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:14.317
This very first main.

28
00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:15.538
Do I need to change anything?

29
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:19.675
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nope.

30
00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.806
That's exactly what we need, right?

31
00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:24.802
And then down here,
in our big logic statement here,

32
00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.278
what do we just need to do?

33
00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:29.807
Add inside article and inside aside.

34
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:32.162
That's all we need to do, okay?

35
00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:35.651
And then down here when we
get to the media queries,

36
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:40.126
what we need to do is figure out
what we're going to do for widths.

37
00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:41.067
This is what I did.

38
00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.720
I just worked with the columns that
I had in each of those dimensions.

39
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.146
I decided I would just
stay with those columns.

40
00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:48.369
You could have changed the number
of columns that you had for

41
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.669
the inside pages if you wanted to.

42
00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:52.778
That would certainly be one
way to approach the solution.

43
00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:57.071
But I just said, well, we're working
with 11, how about 7 and 4, okay?

44
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.121
And then when we got down to 950 and
we're at 14,

45
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.361
then I said, okay, how about 10 and 4?

46
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:09.334
And then when I got down here to 1,200
pixels, I said, well, how about 12 and 4?

47
00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:13.116
And technically speaking, I've repeated
myself over and over again for

48
00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:14.092
the inside aside.

49
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:19.093
But again, for documentary purposes, that
sort of helps you understand the math and

50
00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.465
how it's all fitting together, okay?

51
00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:23.355
So that's how I put together my answer.

52
00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:24.756
Your answer may be different.

53
00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:26.776
You may have had different
numbers of columns.

54
00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.715
I would be cool with that as
long as proportionally speaking,

55
00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:30.795
the page looks right.

56
00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:34.415
A fat area for your content,
a skinny area for your article.
