00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.654
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is everybody
familiar with this concept?

2
00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:04.667
Because I am seeing some
puzzled looks here.

3
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:09.855
Do I need to do my little demo about what
a difference is between an and a rem?

4
00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
Mark says yeah, okay, so

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.666
let's go in ahead and do that.

6
00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:22.327
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll just go to head and
go to codepend.io/jen4web.

7
00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.202
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll make
ourselves a little new pen here.

8
00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:33.931
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we'll save this real quick.

9
00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.863
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll call this versus rem.

10
00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:47.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll go ahead and
drop this into that collection.

11
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.044
Okay, so we were here if I have
some html if I have an h1.

12
00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:57.096
This is an h1 so exciting,

13
00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:02.112
And let's say here I have a paragraph.

14
00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:03.602
I am a paragraph.

15
00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:11.802
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay over here in my CSS,

16
00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:17.215
let's give it a background color

17
00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:22.251
of blue, and a color of white.

18
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:27.347
And then for my paragraph, let's give it

19
00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:33.619
a background color of green,
and a color of white.

20
00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.329
Okay, so here I've got an h1, and I've
got a paragraph, there they are, yeah.

21
00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.849
Now what I'm gonna do,
is I'm gonna say margin 1em,

22
00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.209
actually let me make it padding so

23
00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.257
you can see it better,
padding 1em, all right?

24
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:57.585
Now I'm gonna do the same thing here on
the paragraph, how many of you say that

25
00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:02.128
the h1 text and the paragraph text is
gonna line up, when I type in padding 1em?

26
00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:05.336
How many of you say the text of the t and
this and the, I and

27
00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:08.007
I'm a paragraph, they're going to line up?

28
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.779
How many say yeah, totally they're
absolutely going to line up?

29
00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.484
I'm putting 1em on both of those,
yeah, some of you do.

30
00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:18.557
How many you say, no way,
they're totally not going to line up?

31
00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:22.254
Some of you say no, totally,
they're not gonna line up, okay.

32
00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:27.447
Here we go, 1em,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They

33
00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.917
totally don't line up, why is that?

34
00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.446
I said padding 1em in both places,
what's wrong?

35
00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:39.068
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Relative to the line
height or relative to something.

36
00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:40.129
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is an m?

37
00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.173
First of all let's start there,
what is an m?

38
00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:43.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's the width
of the m character.

39
00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:48.722
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The width of the m
character, okay, so if I say,

40
00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:53.041
this is an h1, let's throw an in there.

41
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.876
I am a paragraph m.

42
00:02:55.876 --> 00:03:00.751
Anyone notice anything about
the size of those letter m's?

43
00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:03.752
They're kid of different aren't they?

44
00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:06.838
Okay, so it's a fundamental
way of how these things work.

45
00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:08.917
Sometimes this is exactly what you want.

46
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:11.566
You want it to be relative to
the text that you're working with,

47
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.442
sometimes you don't
want it to be relative.

48
00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:17.385
In this kind of situation if you wanted
your text to line up here, absolutely,

49
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:18.780
you want it to be relative.

50
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.694
And so here we would go ahead and
add an r for rem.

51
00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:29.223
And now, look at that, isn't that lovely?

52
00:03:29.223 --> 00:03:32.869
So instead of padding 1em,
now it's padding 1rem,

53
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.736
and now everything lines up beautifully.

54
00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:38.293
So what you see me do here in class,

55
00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:41.657
is you'll see me tend to
work with rems a lot.

56
00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:45.643
And the reason why, why rems and not
pixels, that's the next question, right?

57
00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:48.047
Pixels are a fixed unit of measure,

58
00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:51.985
we tend not to use them in
responsive design at all, okay?

59
00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:54.615
And that's mostly true
with a few exceptions,

60
00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:56.729
you'll see me use pixels on borders.

61
00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.378
You'll actually see me use
pixels in media queries,

62
00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:04.035
because my philosophy is
pixels are discrete units.

63
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.566
You can't have a half pixel yeah?

64
00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:11.087
And so they're pretty clear where
they split in the media queries.

65
00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:14.170
But you'll see people that use rems or
ems in media queries as well.

66
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.984
So now we'll go on here
to the grid answers for

67
00:04:16.984 --> 00:04:19.514
those of you that managed to get to grid.

68
00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:24.606
Just to show you yes in fact
you can do this once again.

69
00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:28.530
So the code is even simpler
if you do this with grid.

70
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.798
So here, I've just gone ahead and set up
with my rapper once again parents and

71
00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:35.105
children in grid containers grid items.

72
00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:39.631
So on the grid container,
we're gonna go ahead and say display grid,

73
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:41.791
we'll set up our three columns.

74
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.552
Are you guys familiar with this fractional
unit here, where it says repeat(1, 3fr);?

75
00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.333
Are you familiar with what that is.

76
00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:51.908
fr not France that is in fact fraction,
okay?

77
00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:54.660
And fraction is a unique grid unit.

78
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.084
In other words, you can't use it elsewhere
in your CSS, it's exclusively for

79
00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:00.083
use here on grid.

80
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:05.064
And what's fabulous about fr is it
just says in this case, this notation,

81
00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:09.909
take this page and divide it into
three pieces, make them the same size.

82
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.888
Hey, we didn't even have
to do math on that one.

83
00:05:12.888 --> 00:05:15.109
Wouldn't it be great if we
had this unit in flex box?

84
00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:17.616
It would make our lives so much easier.

85
00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.644
Instead of always having to do the math
to figure out how wide you want

86
00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:21.452
something to be.

87
00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:25.494
So that's what that's doing,
I did this one as 1em for

88
00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:27.564
some reason for my grid gap.

89
00:05:27.564 --> 00:05:30.645
But that's going to produce
exactly the same measure here.

90
00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:36.524
I could totally have said 1rem and
that would have been fine.

91
00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:39.762
Okay, and so this is the span syntax.

92
00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:44.366
And so with the span syntax we're
basically saying take your letter A and

93
00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:48.157
letter H which, of course,
is further down the page here.

94
00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:50.859
We just simply want to say take it and
go across two columns.

95
00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:55.278
So all I have to do is just say span 2,
I don't have to tell it where to start.

96
00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:59.053
Sometimes you'll see this, 1 span 2.

97
00:05:59.053 --> 00:06:03.115
In other words,
start at line 1 span across 2 columns,

98
00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:05.749
but that's very specific see here.

99
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:07.540
See here how the page has changed?

100
00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:14.611
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so when we just
say span 2 it becomes relative.

101
00:06:14.611 --> 00:06:19.034
And it’s going to go ahead and span across
whatever columns that you have here,

102
00:06:19.034 --> 00:06:19.703
all right?

103
00:06:19.703 --> 00:06:22.897
And then of course C is going
to spam across 3 columns.

104
00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:27.940
So very, very simple, so
very minimal CSS here?

105
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.395
Fine, here’s another way
that you can do this.

106
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:34.518
Once again,
the same kind of wrapper set-up.

107
00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:39.145
Okay, once again, if you had changed this
and you guys and spelled out like 33%

108
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:43.121
a piece or something, that would
be absolutely fine, not a problem.

109
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:48.404
So the places where it's gonna changes
down here in our individual grid columns.

110
00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:53.380
So here, this is the number syntax,
and so with the number syntax sizes,

111
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.250
we're going to have numbers
along the way for our lines.

112
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.729
We just call them by those numbers,
are you guys familiar with the syntax?

113
00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.236
Okay, I see some people
shaking their heads.

114
00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:12.422
So let's just go ahead and
draw in some boxes, okay?

115
00:07:12.422 --> 00:07:19.171
So what grid is going to say is and
this is our page, here's our page.

116
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.888
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: As you can tell,
I never made a living as an illustrator.

117
00:07:24.888 --> 00:07:28.492
This over here is line number 1,

118
00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:33.640
this is line number 2,
this is line number 3,

119
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.164
and this is line number 4, makes sense?

120
00:07:38.164 --> 00:07:44.196
Okay, so when we talk about if we
have a box that goes across this way,

121
00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:49.088
spanning 2 columns,
what is our notation going to be?

122
00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:50.607
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 1 to 3?

123
00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:54.726
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, 1/3, just like that.

124
00:07:54.726 --> 00:08:01.475
And, when it goes across 4 columns,
like this, what is it gonna be?

125
00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:06.939
1/4, and if it goes across just these
two here, what is it going to be?

126
00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:07.626
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 2, 4.

127
00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:11.892
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2?4, exactly,
you guys are brilliant, all right?

128
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.907
So that's where that notation comes from.

129
00:08:17.278 --> 00:08:19.015
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that's where those numbers come from, and

130
00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:19.957
I did them on the column.

131
00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:24.799
Grid row is another way of writing these,
so you could do it vertically, right,

132
00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:25.740
your grid row.

133
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.597
Span some number of rows or
spanning a column.

134
00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:32.522
So now here for
the last answer, this is yet

135
00:08:32.522 --> 00:08:35.870
another syntax which is
the grid template area.

136
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.972
And what we're going to do
is we're going to define

137
00:08:38.972 --> 00:08:43.534
our layout using the grid template
area syntax here, again on our parent.

138
00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:47.136
So we have display grid,
we're gonna tell it how many columns.

139
00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:50.854
Once again same notation and
then we're going to spell out areas.

140
00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:53.131
This is how we want our
page to be spelled out.

141
00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:57.730
And I've called my areas the same thing as
the letters, just to make it easy, right?

142
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.947
So I want to A go across 2 with 1,
C to across 3.

143
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.816
D, E, F are all on their own.

144
00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:07.765
G and the two H's, make sense?

145
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:12.632
Okay, and then down here all we have
to do is just spell out who's gonna

146
00:09:12.632 --> 00:09:14.377
live in which grid area.
