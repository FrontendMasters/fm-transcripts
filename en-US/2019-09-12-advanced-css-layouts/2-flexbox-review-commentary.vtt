&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Welcome back everyone, and

2
00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:06.300
I hope you did well with
the exercise that I just gave you.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.330
I just asked Mark,

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.350
if we had any comments from the chat room
before coming back here, and he said

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.510
that some of you are debating whether this
is even possible without using JavaScript.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.390
And so I said I would go ahead and
do my rant, and my rant is this.

7
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.560
You kids these days, okay,
you kids these days.

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.150
I've been doing this 20 years.

9
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.020
When I got started in the field,
there was HTML.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.140
That was it.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.810
There was no CSS, okay.

12
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.180
And the JavaScript you had to write for
Netscape and for Internet Explorer,

13
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.460
you had to write separate things
because everybody had a different DOM.

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.530
So I've watched a whole lot
of the world go by here.

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.790
And what we learned at the beginning of
time was the the concept of separation of

16
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.070
powers, that we have HTML, which
structures your documents, you have CSS,

17
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.620
which is all of the pretty stuff.

18
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.230
And then we have JavaScript,
which is the interactivity.

19
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.890
And there's very good reason for these
separations of powers because when you

20
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.240
build a web page,
you start by building the structure first.

21
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.360
If you start with the structure, you'll
start by building an accessible layout.

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.490
Accessibility is not only important for

23
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.590
those people out there with
disabilities who, by the way,

24
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920
there's an awful lot of people out
there with some kind of disability.

25
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.030
But if that's not enough to motivate you,
there's always the fact that search

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.780
engines do better with content that's
actually marked up really, really well.

27
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.630
Then you layer on the CSS.

28
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.520
And as you know, CSS has limitations.

29
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.400
It's only going to take you so far,
but it will make it beautiful.

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.910
And as you'll see today,

31
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.300
you can add actually quite a amount of
interactivity with just CSS and then,

32
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.790
then you turn to your JavaScript to go
ahead and take things to the next level.

33
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.520
That's what JavaScript is for,
it's for the next level.

34
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.105
You should do as much as you can with HTML
and CSS, JavaScript is the next level.

35
00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:50.755
Unfortunately, we these trends
like CSS and JavaScript,

36
00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:52.975
which may make great sense for Facebook.

37
00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:56.595
And there's like ten websites in the world
that are that big with that many

38
00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.255
users that need, and
they have 100 front end web developers,

39
00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:03.845
that need to be putting
their CSS in the JavaScript.

40
00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:06.025
Then it makes sense to put
CSS in your JavaScript.

41
00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.245
But just because Facebook does it,

42
00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:11.320
doesn't necessarily mean
that you should be doing it.

43
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.150
So use JavaScript as an enhancement
rather than as your starting point.

44
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.650
You're gonna wind up with a code that's
more accessible, it's happier for

45
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.320
search engines.

46
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.790
It's easier to maintain.

47
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.420
You can include more people on your team.

48
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.810
So you know HTML and CSS is not
necessarily that much JavaScript.

49
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.770
Anyway that's my rant.
