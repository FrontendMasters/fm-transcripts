00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.905
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hopefully you made some
good progress putting together this form

2
00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:08.106
and tying it into the layout that
we've been working on so far, okay?

3
00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:10.065
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.114
People in the room say yeah sure.

5
00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:15.782
So let's go ahead and, you got it?

6
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.232
Okay, so let's go ahead and
go through what I had for an answer.

7
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:23.348
Because I left this very open-ended of
course your answers may be different.

8
00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:27.918
If you get the result in the end
that is what is important.

9
00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:32.068
And of course I'd like to see you tie it
in to all the work we did with layout

10
00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:33.236
earlier in the day.

11
00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:34.957
So let's go on ahead and
go through these answers.

12
00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:38.117
I'm gonna start here with the HTML and

13
00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:42.079
this is form.html,
it's in your end folder.

14
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.469
And I'm gonna start here
around line number 55.

15
00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.141
So we've got form,
we've got our field set, and

16
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.294
then I've put in a div
with a class of flex.

17
00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:58.263
And I wrapped that all the way around
the three blanks that I have asked for

18
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:02.603
here, these three fields with
their labels that go with them.

19
00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:08.644
And I've called them either item1, or
I called them item2, assign those classes.

20
00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:11.785
Those may not be the best names in
the world, but it was pretty clear.

21
00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:14.241
There's one item and
then there's a second one.

22
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.894
And then of course the div of the class of
flex is gonna wind up being my flex parent

23
00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:20.225
or my flex container.

24
00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:23.870
And all of these other things
are flex items, the children.

25
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.890
Okay, so that's how I'm gonna
wind up getting that to work.

26
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.489
And then down here,
in my HTML later on I've got,

27
00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:37.257
again around the series of radio buttons,
I've got my dev with the class flex.

28
00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:40.595
My question, what resource is it?

29
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:44.929
Labeled as item1 and then around
item2 are all of my radio buttons.

30
00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.333
Okay, so there's that.

31
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:51.048
Then once again div of the class of flex,

32
00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:55.982
item1 on the label,
item2 on the select drop down.

33
00:01:55.982 --> 00:02:00.633
And then finally, the div of the class
of flex here around 98 going

34
00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.584
around the other details or the comments.

35
00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:09.045
And then that's just labeled as item1 for
the label, item2 for the text area.

36
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:12.035
So that's pretty much the pattern
that I followed there.

37
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:16.083
Then when you go ahead and
you take a look at your CSS,

38
00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:20.235
I'm actually gonna look
at layout.css once again.

39
00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:24.058
And here what I've done is I've
added an addition to name,

40
00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:25.976
I've added my class of flex.

41
00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.530
There it is, okay?

42
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.225
It's basically gonna be the same thing.

43
00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:34.840
One thing that is gonna happen though is
that things are not gonna be quite square.

44
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.889
You might have noticed.

45
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.557
At least I ran into this problem putting
these elements next to each other.

46
00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.078
Item1 and item2.

47
00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.015
So in order to get things to work,

48
00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.140
I have also added here
the aligned items of baseline.

49
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.076
And that will get these to line up much
more nicely than they were before.

50
00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:54.203
And then basically, item1 and

51
00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:58.784
item2 become part of the code that
we wrote before down here, okay?

52
00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:02.187
So we're all set to pass
in our various widths and

53
00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:06.753
if we wanted to change the gap and
all the rest of that kinda stuff.

54
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:11.148
So that is pretty straightforward.

55
00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:15.978
And it gets down here in my media queries.

56
00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:20.101
All I've done here in the very first
media query, down here at the bottom,

57
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:21.553
I have item1 and item2.

58
00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:26.580
I gave them the widths of 3 and 8.

59
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.237
And I think that's probably it.

60
00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:33.593
I think it pretty stayed the same
all the other media queries.

61
00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:38.293
I didn't change it after that, because
they were already next to each other,

62
00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:41.078
it kinda worked with
the layout the way it was.

63
00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:43.799
So that is what I came up with for
my answer.

64
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.067
Again, yours might vary a little bit.

65
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.833
But again we can just leverage this
code that we already wrote and

66
00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.145
now we've applied it to a form as well.

67
00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:53.189
Isn't that nice?

68
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.591
So we applied it basically to laying
out all kinds of different pages with

69
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:58.001
different forms of layouts.

70
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:03.046
We've applied it to layouts within
layouts, that developer section, right?

71
00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:05.025
And now we've applied
it to a form as well.

72
00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.919
So pretty sweet.
