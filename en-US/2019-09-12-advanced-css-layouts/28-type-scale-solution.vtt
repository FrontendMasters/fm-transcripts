00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hopefully,
you had a pretty easy time going ahead and

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.600
fitting in that typescale onto
the homepage and the inside page.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.150
And I'll just show you what I did.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.420
Your answers may be slightly different,
I'll give you a full credit for it anyway.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.230
Here's the way that I went ahead and
worked this.

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.200
So just like we had the math before,
I have my base font size and my typescale,

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.030
just as we set them before.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.790
Although this time, I'm working
with Rems instead of working with

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.820
Ems just to show you that you
can work with different units.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
And then, I pulled out the h5 and the h4.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.130
I'm not actually using them in any of my
documents, so I just pulled them out.

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.420
You absolutely could keep them in.

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.380
So there's that.

14
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.710
I have my small text, which I called
by a different variable name.

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.110
Just because I wanted to be different.

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.290
And then,
the last part here is this header margin.

17
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.090
I want you to take note of the fact that
I'm using this same technique here with

18
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.970
a margin that's going to
change across media queries.

19
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.575
So far today, we've looked layout, we've
really intensely looked at layout and

20
00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:04.614
the ways that we can use
this technique of calc and

21
00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.522
custom properties and changing
their values across media queries.

22
00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:11.452
And applying it in these contexts,
layout and text.

23
00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:15.090
But you can do this with anything else
that happens to be there in your style

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210
sheet that changes across a media quarry.

25
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.660
So here's an example of our header margin,

26
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.600
a value that's going to
wind up having to change.

27
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.360
So I've gone ahead and declared that as
a variable, and we'll change it later.

28
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.310
So then, we've got our h1, h2, h3,
our paragraph, our small sizes.

29
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.041
Pretty much the same.

30
00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:38.524
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I've
gone back through here,

31
00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:41.218
I made my menu a slightly
smaller text size.

32
00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:43.730
My menu toggle, I made bigger.

33
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.150
That's the hamburger button,
that's what that class is from.

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.630
So I went ahead and associated that
with the largest font size, okay?

35
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.390
The h1, that's the child,

36
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.620
the immediate child of the section,
has got the small

37
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.496
text size because it's actually small
gray type on the top of those columns.

38
00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:09.390
So just cuz it's called h1 in the variable
doesn't mean you have to always use it on

39
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.280
your h1s.

40
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.480
So there's an example of that.

41
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.950
Then, I went ahead and I scaled up
my header h1, which is actually,

42
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.150
I think, the words the layout times.

43
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.660
Actually, I wanted those even bigger than
what I had before, so I just went ahead

44
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.550
and scaled it up here as a one-off, cuz I
don't necessarily need to use this layer.

45
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.680
I absolutely could have set that up as
a calculation further up in the root of

46
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.270
the document,
if that's what I wanted to do.

47
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.157
And then,
here's where that margin comes in, so

48
00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.647
there's that header margin, all right?

49
00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:43.136
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see.

50
00:02:44.677 --> 00:02:47.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A couple of other
declarations here for font sizes.

51
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.330
And then here, in my media queries,

52
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.530
all I did was change my type scale
to these values for whatever reason.

53
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.320
I don't remember why I chose these values.

54
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.560
But anyway, that's what I did.

55
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.131
And then my header margin definitely
changed once I got over 740 pixels, okay?

56
00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:07.844
So this is pretty much
the way it would work, okay?

57
00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:13.292
So you can just take all your type sizes,
you can put it in your own SAS partial

58
00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:18.510
file or a section of your CSS,
whatever works for you, and there you go.

59
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.981
It's really now very easy to go and

60
00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:22.884
change font sizes globally
throughout your document, isn't it?

61
00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.796
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and so, if you
wanna take a look at how these pages

62
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:32.372
are looking, just so
you can say, let's see here.

63
00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:37.446
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll just pop them up
in the browser here, and show you,

64
00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:39.173
if you haven't looked at them already.

65
00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:41.318
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

66
00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:45.871
So you see that our logo looks
a little bit nicer than it did before.

67
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.319
And then, when I narrow things down here,

68
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.946
my navigation actually doesn't wrap in
terms of its size, which is kinda nice.

69
00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:57.224
And my hamburger button looks
a little bit more beefed up, beefy.

70
00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:58.754
It's a beefy hamburger button.

71
00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:02.110
And that's still looking
pretty good as well, okay?
