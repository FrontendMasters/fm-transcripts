1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.501
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So nice look at that
now we can actually read this and

2
00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.849
get information out of it.

3
00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.344
How cool is that?

4
00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:07.528
Pretty sweet.

5
00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:13.174
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
our tables totally destroyed and

6
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:16.276
then we have to bring it back again.

7
00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:20.242
The other thing that's missing here
is this caption is a little odd.

8
00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:25.307
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, for
the caption we can go ahead and

9
00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:29.848
say that the font-size: is 1.5rem or
whatever font size that you

10
00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:34.327
happen to have from your type scale,
right, plug it right in here.

11
00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:39.953
And we can say the text-align: is left and

12
00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:44.016
the font-weight: is bold and

13
00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:47.772
the margin: is 1rem auto.

14
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:51.531
And I did notice this as I was
working through some stuff,

15
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.540
it's still a bunched over here
on all the way over like this.

16
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.877
And it's basically what it's doing
is it's in line with the other

17
00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:02.530
cells that are here and it's not
stretching the full width across this.

18
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.588
How are you guys doing?

19
00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:07.803
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is this captions not
displaying as block right now, right?

20
00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:08.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That could be.

21
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:15.418
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go,
that's what I was doing thank you.

22
00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:18.088
Display block, okay?

23
00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:22.766
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nice.

24
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.629
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How are we doing?

25
00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:27.754
Good, are you happy?

26
00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.715
Isn't that a much nicer thing to read?

27
00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:32.165
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

28
00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:38.132
well you destroyed it now you gotta fix it
because that's the way it works, right?

29
00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:42.309
So, if when we come back then to our media
query we gotta put it all back again.

30
00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:52.405
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm just picking
randomly 600 pixels, obviously,

31
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:54.537
it can be any value that you like.

32
00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:59.052
This is the point where we're gonna
re-display this actually as a table.

33
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:04.398
And so, the first thing that your
gonna wanna do is you're gonna

34
00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:09.858
wanna go to your thead tr which
we positioned off screen, right?

35
00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:13.153
So now we're gonna put it
back to position: of static.

36
00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:17.140
And when you do a position of static that
will actually bring it right back on

37
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.002
screen and
you don't even have to reset left and top.

38
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:23.926
By definition left and top are not
definable properties with the static,

39
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:28.881
when the value of the position is static,
so the headings will come right back.

40
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.801
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we can
reset our thead and our tbody,

41
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:38.849
these are display values you
probably aren't familiar with but

42
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.783
this is what they are,
table-row-group, okay.

43
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:54.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our th and
our td: are display: of table-cell.

44
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.786
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Getting better and better.

45
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.743
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our tr is a display: of

46
00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:12.589
table-row,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

47
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:17.152
our table is shockingly
a display: of table.

48
00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:33.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We may wanna do
some other things at this point.

49
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.989
We might wanna do a text-align:,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Left for

50
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.054
those headers that makes them
a little easier to read, okay.

51
00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.787
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's the other
thing we're gonna have to do?

52
00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:50.004
Anyone notice?

53
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:51.614
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Remove the before and
afters.

54
00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.724
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Remove our before and
afters.

55
00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:58.775
So, the way that I did that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Was I

56
00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:07.830
did this I said td:nth-of-type,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: (Odd):,

57
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.309
if somebody has a better way
of doing this please tell me,

58
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.401
before, td:nth-of-type,

59
00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:22.834
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: (Even):before.

60
00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.606
Wasn't sure how I could get
all of the nth-of-types and

61
00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:29.474
this seemed like the fastest way to get
them all, we'll do both odds and evens,

62
00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:31.289
that's why I've spelled them out.

63
00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:31.971
By the way,

64
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:36.559
if you just say td:before where you were
like why aren't you doing that, Jen?

65
00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.474
It will actually not be as specific,
right?

66
00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:44.572
Because the specificity for
this very long selector that I

67
00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:51.449
had before up here has a pseudo class in
it, a pseudo element, and an HTML tag.

68
00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.173
As opposed to down here if
I just said td:: before

69
00:04:56.173 --> 00:05:00.677
the specificity is actually very low for
that.

70
00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:04.606
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Since you know that
the td's are inside of a tr could you

71
00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:08.634
target td's inside of a tr
would that be more specific?

72
00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.844
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Again,
well, we could try it.

73
00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:14.699
Let me finish my thought and
then we can try that.

74
00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.818
I suspect not, but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No.

75
00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:16.533
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

76
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:23.399
Yeah, td:nth-of-type,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: (Odd) once again,

77
00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.677
::after, and td:nth-of-type,

78
00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:38.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: (Even):: after.

79
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.949
Okay, then we could finally say,

80
00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.760
content:,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Double quotes.

81
00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:51.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Phew,
that turns it all off.

82
00:05:56.154 --> 00:06:00.661
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, now,
one other thing that's going on here and

83
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.276
it has to do with our striping.

84
00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:06.476
So if you will take
a look our style here for

85
00:06:06.476 --> 00:06:13.357
our striping,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Where's the striping?

86
00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:14.439
There it is.

87
00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:18.733
So we said tr:nth-child,
let me make this a little bit darker so

88
00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:21.086
you can see it up here on the screen.

89
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:26.123
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
this is ridiculously dark okay, but

90
00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:28.720
I want you to be able to
see what's happening here.

91
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.558
So we told it tr:nth-child(odd),
but yet the first and

92
00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.568
the second rows are both
colored the same way.

93
00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:37.783
Anyone have any idea why that is?

94
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The table head and
the table rows are considered-

95
00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:43.473
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.

96
00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:44.007
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

97
00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:49.649
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, the table head and
the table rows, so it's numbering,

98
00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.133
we're doing the odd and
even thing based on that.

99
00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:57.997
So we have the thead this is
an odd it's the first one right?

100
00:06:57.997 --> 00:07:01.129
And then we go on to the tbody and
there's the first one there, so

101
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.937
we wind up with two of the same color.

102
00:07:02.937 --> 00:07:06.461
So we may wanna change this
odd to an even, right?

103
00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:12.955
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's one possible, well,
actually they're both the same there too.

104
00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:17.711
Or the other thing that you
could do would be to say

105
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:22.467
that your thead tr: can
actually technically,

106
00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:26.534
eh that's good enough, just like that.

107
00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:31.153
Then we could say it's a color of whatever
background color of some other color.

108
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.055
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There,
terrible choice of color but

109
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:42.453
there you go it at least projects.

110
00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.322
Okay, so there we go, so

111
00:07:44.322 --> 00:07:50.291
our header is slightly different than
the striping in the rest of the document.

112
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.468
Make sense?

113
00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.327
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we totally broke our table and

114
00:07:56.327 --> 00:08:00.340
then we had to reassemble it,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cuz

115
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.069
that's the way Mobile-first works.

116
00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:03.671
Yes?

117
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:07.305
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: From that you can
just get rid of the odd and even-

118
00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:08.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

119
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.176
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: In the after,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And before.

120
00:08:12.176 --> 00:08:16.056
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you just said,
down to there that one.

121
00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:19.167
So you just said
nth-of-type:before just like that?

122
00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:26.557
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just n like the for
letter t's n.

123
00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:27.787
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: N?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yes-

124
00:08:27.787 --> 00:08:28.287
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: N minus-

125
00:08:28.287 --> 00:08:28.787
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.

126
00:08:28.787 --> 00:08:29.287
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 1 or n plus 1 just

127
00:08:29.287 --> 00:08:31.120
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

128
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.175
That's a great solution,

129
00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:39.018
I like that much better just plain old n.
Thank you, that selects everything.
