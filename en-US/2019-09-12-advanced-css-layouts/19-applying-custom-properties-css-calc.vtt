00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.849
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so let's go
on and apply this to a real web page.

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:08.673
Before we leave here, I'm just gonna
grab this little bit of code right here.

3
00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:13.362
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These lines 8
to 13 here on the CodePen, so

4
00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:15.780
we don't have to retype them, okay?

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.570
Cuz this is, this is the good part.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.940
This is the fireworks for the day, okay?

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.290
Copy that little bit of code.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.216
It's gonna come in handy, and
then we're gonna go on to chapter five.

9
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.169
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So here in chapter five,

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.063
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In your Begin folder I'm

11
00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:44.710
gonna go ahead and
open up my index.html, and

12
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.088
then in the CSS,
we're gonna open up layouts.css.

13
00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:52.340
You can ignore the other files.

14
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.480
You can ignore styles and the navigation.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.383
We're not gonna deal with those.

16
00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:58.272
I'm gonna turn on my word wrap here.

17
00:01:04.713 --> 00:01:09.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so all I've got going
on over here in my CSS to start with is

18
00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:14.182
simply, so I'm gonna start floating
my images when I get to 740 pixels.

19
00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:19.073
Prior to that, I've got a default style.

20
00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:23.204
It's actually in styles.css,
which centers the image and

21
00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:26.290
declares it as a block kind of layout,
okay?

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.685
So these are the media queries
we're gonna work with.

23
00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:33.276
I've just sort of outlined them for
you, so now we're ready to go ahead and

24
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:36.596
start thinking about how we're going
to apply this to this webpage.

25
00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:42.183
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so before I lose
it I'm gonna go ahead and paste in that

26
00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:47.230
little bit of code that I copied from
the code panel, just to keep track of it.

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.195
But to get started here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's go back and

28
00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:59.440
revisit what's going on with these images.

29
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.600
So what we've got here,
we have a four-column layout here.

30
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.500
We have our header.

31
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.960
We have our nav bar.

32
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.580
We've already actually done all this
styling in associated with that,

33
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.260
with the media queries.

34
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.790
So we're just focused on this last bit
of appearance down here at the bottom,

35
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.780
these four columns that we
have going on here, right?

36
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.840
Okay, so it's gonna go from this where
we've got four columns next to each other.

37
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.590
It's gonna go to, and by the way,

38
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.755
notice that those columns
aren't all the same width.

39
00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:32.945
Ooh, right?

40
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.526
We have skinny columns and
we have fat columns, don't we?

41
00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.805
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
so just file that away.

42
00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.221
That's a thing that we
have to think about.

43
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:43.849
You know these designer people.

44
00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.635
Okay, when we go to our large layout,

45
00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:51.000
we just took column number three and
moved it to the bottom.

46
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.670
We didn't move column number four.

47
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.510
That would be easy.

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.530
We moved column number three to
the bottom, and what else did we do to it?

49
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.220
We made it go horizontal didn't we?

50
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.010
So we have a couple of things we
gotta do here for this layout, okay.

51
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.650
Then when we go to our medium layout,

52
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.520
we're pulling down columns three and
four, stacking them on top of each other,

53
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.070
and then for the very last part everything
will stack on top of each other.

54
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.300
This is what we have now.

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.971
This is already done yeah?

56
00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:29.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you open up your page
right now, this already works, but

57
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.630
we need to work on coding this medium and
large layout.

58
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.782
So, let me go back to this
extra-large look here.

59
00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.091
One of the things that you might have
noticed is that some of these columns

60
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:46.450
are wider and some are a little narrower,
and I'm gonna give you another hint.

61
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.050
Our designer told us this
is a 16-column layout.

62
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.420
That's a good thing to know, right?

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.660
Thank you designer person.

64
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.010
Tanner, in the back, yay.
