00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing we're
gonna talk about is chapter four.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.910
Chapter four, we're going to start
applying custom properties and

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.720
calc to an example, a bunch of code
that I actually had in the previous

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.200
course on grids and flex box,
here at Frontend Masters.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.780
So what we're going to do here is I'm
gonna walk you through real slowly,

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.410
we're going to talk through all
the logic about how we're gonna apply

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.526
custom properties in calc
to refactor this code.

8
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.540
Then we're gonna take what we learn
here from this little example, and

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.970
we're gonna apply it to the homepage and
start working on code for that.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.900
And then you are gonna get to
work on the inside page for that.

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.210
So that's the sort of arc of the next few
things that we're going to be doing here.

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.790
So to get started with chapter
four in your exercise files,

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.650
go ahead and look in the chapter four.

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.950
Look in the instructions,

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
it will give you the starting code
pen which is here upon the board.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.910
So you'll see here that we have some
pretty basic, sort of HTML going on here.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.900
We have a div around the whole thing,

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.990
a div with a class of
rubber cuz we often do, and

19
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860
then inside of this you'll see I've got
some comments telling you what's going on.

20
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.880
So here's row one with
four individual boxes.

21
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.500
You'll see we have a div with the class
of row, and then we have article, okay.

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.320
And it's got some stuff, right.

23
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.350
And the code just sort of goes on and
on and on like that.

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.390
I'm gonna just show this to
you in full page view just so

25
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.860
you can remember what this looks like.

26
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.080
This is a prototype of a four
column grid system and

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.850
we were talking about pie
in the previous course.

28
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.610
So we've got a lot of pie going on
here and you can see we have our four

29
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.140
columns here underneath of that we have
a two and two, we have a one and a three,

30
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.790
we have a four going across, and then
down at the bottom is a one, two, one.

31
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.100
If we start to narrow down the screen,
shockingly,

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.420
things will start to rearrange.

33
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.490
So there's our one, two, one, is now two
going across with the ones underneath.

34
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.520
We've got some things stacked on
top of each other a couple places.

35
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.400
And then when we narrow
up the screen again.

36
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.640
I'm sure you're all shocked to know that
they're all just sort of stuck on top of

37
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.670
each other, okay?

38
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.990
So that's the basic code that we
have going on here at the moment.

39
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.880
And when we're done here,
the screen will look exactly the same.

40
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.820
Don't you love working
on a code like that?

41
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.800
[LAUGH] It's gonna be exactly the same.

42
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.890
But we are going to spend a lot of time
refactoring what we've already written.

43
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.700
So I'm just gonna sort of hind
the picture down here at the bottom,

44
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.630
just so
we can focus on the code part of this.

45
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:42.555
Just so you can understand the math behind
this because one of the things that's not

46
00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:45.985
documented here is the math and
how the math actually works out.

47
00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:51.959
You can see I've got some of these
numbers here like 92%, there's a 4% here.

48
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.215
20, 44, 68,
where does that stuff come from?

49
00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:59.680
You might be wondering how do we
arrive arrive at those numbers?

50
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.798
So let me go ahead and show you that.

51
00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:10.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if you were to
draw out the four boxes here, right?

52
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.830
So if we had a row of four boxes,
it's one box per column, right?

53
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.140
Each of these is gonna be 20% wide,
so there they are, each 20% wide.

54
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.720
We've got four percent margin to
the left to the each of these boxes, and

55
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.520
if you do all of that math,
two four six eight, yeah?

56
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.800
And then 4 times 5 is 20, so
that our depth 200%, yeah?

57
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.570
Everybody good so far?

58
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.410
So If I put two things together here,
right?

59
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.364
So put together these two,
what does that wind up becoming?

60
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:51.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How wide
is each of those boxes?

61
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 44.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 44, right?

62
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.900
Because it's 20 plus 20 plus 4.

63
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.550
If I put three of them together?

64
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.430
we wind up with 20 plus 20 plus 20,
which is 60.

65
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.790
Plus 4 plus 4 which is 8,
so 68, all right?

66
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.760
Everybody clear where these
numbers are coming from?

67
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.540
So that not totally random.

68
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.720
Okay so now what we're gonna do

69
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.870
is we're gonna start to rewrite
this such that we're gonna leverage

70
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.800
our calc and we're gonna leverage
our custom properties here.

71
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.450
So I'm going to start rewriting this
at the very top of this document.

72
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.860
Remember I said one of the things that we
want to do with calc and custom properties

73
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.070
is we want to put our logic at the top
where the mobile is located and then in

74
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.110
the media queries, we're just going
to change the value of our variables.

75
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.890
So that's exactly what
we're going to do here.

76
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.840
So here at the top, we have our row, okay,

77
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.450
display flex row wrap,
that's going to stay the same.

78
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.520
But rather than using this 4%
margin thing that I have going on,

79
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.161
I'm actually going to change
this to justify content,

80
00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:08.480
space, between, okay?

81
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.830
So I'm going to let flex box actually
manage its own space and you'll see why,

82
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.550
you'll just have to take my word on this,
it's going to work out great, okay.

83
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.263
So remember, space between means what?

84
00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:24.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Spaced evenly except for
the two [INAUDIBLE] on the end.

85
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, not on the ends, but

86
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.318
between the various boxes on the page,
okay?

87
00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:37.750
And then so if I was going to go ahead and
start working on my math.

88
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.960
All right, for
that first row I had four boxes, right?

89
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.900
And I told you it was
a four column layout, true?

90
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.240
So I could have a width of of one
sort of call it a width of one, and

91
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.060
a width the one, and a width of one, and

92
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.510
a with the ones were like four units
if we thought about it that way.

93
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.300
Does that kinda sort of make sense to you?

94
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.190
Okay, so if some number of columns and
we have some number of boxes,

95
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.940
basically in terms of how this
is gonna fit together, and

96
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.570
those are gonna be important to us and
doing our math.

97
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.060
So I'm gonna start by here on my row,

98
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.400
just to show you that we can
declare variables wherever we want.

99
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.750
Remember, we're scoping them.

100
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.710
So it has to be now a child of row
in order to leverage this variable.

101
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.490
I'm gonna make my columns to be 4, okay?

102
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.590
Cuz this is a four column layout,
so there's 4.

103
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.340
All right, now here, everybody clear on
what this little selector means here?

104
00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:41.420
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, new to some of you.

105
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.430
So those angle brackets, anytime you
see those angle brackets in your code,

106
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.570
that is an indicator that
this is attribute selector.

107
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.740
So in other words we're
working with HTML attributes.

108
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.780
So what's an HTML attribute?

109
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.820
Give me an example of one.

110
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Class or ID?

111
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Class or ID,
give me one that is not CSS.

112
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: A truff.

113
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A truff, right?

114
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.251
A truff will be an example
of an attribute, so

115
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.990
it's those not the tag itself, but the
other are supporting things, yeah, okay?

116
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.860
So here we are saying, for a class,
that somewhere inside of it,

117
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.920
that's the star equals has
the string call hyphen.

118
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.340
And it just so happens to be that all of
my column classes here all start with

119
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.180
call hyphen, cool.

120
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.330
So I can just uniformly select
all of them with that selector.

121
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.190
Very nice, okay?

122
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.310
So right now, this is the mobile layout.

123
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.930
So this flex number here,
this is the shorthand.

124
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:45.140
Remember, for flex grow, for
flex shrink, and flex basis, okay.

125
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.300
So, grow zero, shrink zero,
flex basis is 92%.

126
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.500
And we have a margin
of zero on the top and

127
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.140
bottom, four on the left and
right, make sense?

128
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.040
Okay, so that's going away, bye bye.

129
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.530
[LAUGH] So glad to have you,
but see you later.

130
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.810
What I'm gonna do here is

131
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.630
let's just do a quick analysis
of what's gonna happen here.

132
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:19.350
Basically, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say I have some number of boxes.

133
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.050
I have some number of columns and
that's gonna determine my width, right?

134
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:28.810
Boxes divided by the number of columns,
so if I have four boxes and

135
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:34.380
I have four columns if you divide
four by four you get one, right?

136
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.920
Multiply that by 100%, we have one great,
big huge box occupying the row.

137
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.060
Does that kind of make sense?

138
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.600
Okay, all right, the math for
you so you can see it.

139
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.140
So I'm gonna set up
a variable here called width.

140
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.720
And I'm gonna give it a with
the four because we're in mobile,

141
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.800
everything is going to
stack on top of each other.

142
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.530
So every box is going to
be four boxes wide, right?

143
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.660
Okay, and so
then I'll set up a variable here.

144
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.000
I'm gonna call it initial basis.

145
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.530
And I'm gonna say that we have calc.

146
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.511
And we're gonna calculate
a variable called width, right?

147
00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:23.968
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna divide
that by a variable called columns.

148
00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that's gonna give us 4 divided by 4, true.

149
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.500
That gives us a value of 1.

150
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.930
Is 1 helpful to us?

151
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.740
Probably not.

152
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.270
It would be better if it was
in a percent format, yeah?

153
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.183
Okay, so let's multiple it also by a 100%.

154
00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:55.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so my initial
basis is just gonna be a 100%, okay.

155
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.720
Then we actually needed to
display this on the page, so

156
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.400
we could display this as our flex basis.

157
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.370
So now we needed to clear our flex basis
and that's simply going to be what?

158
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.003
The variable of the initial basis.

159
00:10:13.742 --> 00:10:16.666
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you want it to
still say flex, you could say,

160
00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.360
simply you could say flex.

161
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.700
Flex, and in that case it would be 00.

162
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.420
And then the variable of initial basis,

163
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.960
right, that would be
the same kind of thing.

164
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.270
If you wanted to write it that way,

165
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.630
whichever way you want
to write it is fine.

166
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.360
To keep it clear,

167
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.370
I'm gonna write it this way, cuz we're
really just dealing with the flux basis.
