00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.778
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's great for
mobile dimensions, but

2
00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:05.396
what are we gonna do to
bring this nav bar back?

3
00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:10.171
[LAUGH] Okay, cuz we really should have
a nav bar here when the screen gets

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.680
this big, don't you think?

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.882
So now,
we have to undo all of that stuff, right?

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:18.459
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everybody good with that?

7
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:20.670
This is called mobile first.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.626
So we have no media query so far.

9
00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:27.160
This is all of the mobile behavior
that we have so far in our code here.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.790
So now, what we need to do is

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.600
we need to say what we're going to
do when we go into our media query.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
I've picked 800 pixels.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.990
By the time we get to the end of today,

14
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.930
800 pixels,
this nav bar will not wrap on itself.

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.520
That's probably the point at which,
as you start to narrow the screen,

16
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.170
when you get to the point that the nav
bar starts wrapping to another line is

17
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.640
probably the point where you
would turn on the mobile display.

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.466
This is where that's gonna be, but
we are a long way from that yet.

19
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.866
[LAUGH] Okay?

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:58.907
All right, so let's go on ahead and
add these styles.

21
00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we're gonna bring back some borders here.

22
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.368
We have other borders here.

23
00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:10.958
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So then, after that,
we're gonna go ahead and

24
00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.777
start adding some things here.

25
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:20.086
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
I'm around line 123 here on your code.

26
00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:21.681
And let's go on ahead and add this.

27
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:26.859
So we have our menu hyphen toggle.

28
00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:34.139
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
our main hyphen menu, menu hyphen close.

29
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:41.963
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And these are the
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These are our fun,

30
00:01:41.963 --> 00:01:43.261
awesome icons, basically.

31
00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.518
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There you go, display none.

32
00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:51.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of course, right?

33
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.010
We don't want these icons to display
when we're at desktop dimensions.

34
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.370
So this will get rid of your hamburger
button, get rid of the closed box, okay?

35
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.913
Then, the actual nav bar itself,
main-menu, what do we need to do here?

36
00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:17.493
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So right now,
our main-menu is set to what?

37
00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:22.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Vertical list.

38
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.666
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, mashable,
just plain old main-menu.

39
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:28.449
See here,
the position is set to fixed, okay?

40
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.241
So in our media query,
we need to turn that off.

41
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:33.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the position static?

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.456
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, position is static.

43
00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.657
Static is the default behavior.

44
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:42.116
This is one of those default values for
everything in your document.

45
00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:45.655
Everything has position of static by
default, so we're gonna reset that.

46
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.615
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we're gonna set it to display block.

47
00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.065
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, good?

48
00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:01.066
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then,
we're gonna get to our main menu

49
00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:03.044
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: UL.

50
00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:11.131
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is all
about undoing what we did, right?

51
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:13.320
Height of auto.

52
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.164
Width of auto.

53
00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:19.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Background of none.

54
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.928
So if you go through and you take
a look at ul styling in the mobile,

55
00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:27.735
we're just basically negating
everything that we just did.

56
00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:30.187
Overflow, hidden.

57
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.933
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text align, center.

58
00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:37.568
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that's what that's all about.

59
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we can
display our lis horizontally.

60
00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:56.706
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm using inline block for
that, of course you could use Flexbox.

61
00:03:56.706 --> 00:04:00.659
If you prefer Flexbox for displaying
your nav bar, you could totally do that.

62
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.855
But inline block's really, really simple.

63
00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:10.106
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We've

64
00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:12.740
got our little icon going back in here.

65
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.293
I guess I'm kind of repeating myself.

66
00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:21.827
I've already got these styles here, which
are doing what I'm typing in now, okay?

67
00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.648
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we've
got our off canvas style.

68
00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:27.142
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We need to undo that.

69
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:31.857
So again, this is all about just
turning off everything we just did.

70
00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:35.460
So our main menu li first child.

71
00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:39.851
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A,
we'd originally had a border on that,

72
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:41.508
so we need to turn that off.

73
00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:48.731
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then, main menu A.

74
00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.533
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Set our color.

75
00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:59.784
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: C85028,
lovely shade of orange.

76
00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:03.482
Border bottom, none.

77
00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:10.361
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: display, inline,
to keep them all on the same line.

78
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.847
And then, we'll reset our hover and
focus states.

79
00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:31.902
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Background of none.

80
00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:36.125
Color of 7e64be,

81
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:42.936
which is a lovely shade of purple.

82
00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:49.525
And text-decoration, none.

83
00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:52.839
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, thanks.

84
00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:58.917
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so if we go ahead and
refresh the page one more time.

85
00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:00.849
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

86
00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.067
We have a nav bar, yay!

87
00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:05.878
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can hover over things.

88
00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:08.172
None of the links are coded to
go anywhere, so that won't work.

89
00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:11.472
But you know how to take care of that.

90
00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:14.299
When we get to our break point,
there we go.

91
00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:18.154
There's our hamburger menu that comes out.

92
00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:20.744
All those things are just as
clickable as they ever were.

93
00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:22.085
Which is to say they don't go anywhere.

94
00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:23.224
And then, we can click out of it.
