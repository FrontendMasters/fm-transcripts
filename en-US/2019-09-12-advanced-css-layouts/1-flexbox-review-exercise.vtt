&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So just to get you
started and to refresh your memory,

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.210
here in the classroom we have a lot
of people who work with JavaScript on

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.980
a regular basis, maybe not so
much CSS on a daily basis.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.876
So to get those juices flowing and get you
to remember how to work with CSS again,

5
00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:17.523
and plain old CSS, not CSS in JavaScript.

6
00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:20.540
Plain old CSS,
we're gonna start with a CodePen.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.780
So what I've given you here in
this folder is a screenshot

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.530
of a thing I'd like you to layout.

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.680
Super simple, all right?

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.480
And here in the instructions,

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.160
what I'm going to have you do is
simply code this layout using Flexbox.

12
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.170
There's the starting CodePen right there.

13
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.370
If you don't have a CodePen account,
you can create one.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.380
If you don't wanna create one,
that's fine.

15
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.560
But if you do wanna save your work,
you will need to create a CodePen account.

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.750
Fork the CodePen, go on ahead and
code it using Flexbox.

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay, don't change the HTML.

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.680
This is one of our favorite
academic exercises.

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.396
Don't change the HTML.

20
00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:01.658
Just go on ahead and write CSS to lay
the page out the way it looks, okay?

21
00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:05.996
Which means that you're gonna have
to use some CSS selectors, no.

22
00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:11.330
And then my hint here to you is to
remember to keep the flex in Flexbox.

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080
One of the most common mistakes that I
see with people working with Flexbox

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.560
is that they tend to use
the CSS width property.

25
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.270
And the width property is the wrong thing
to use when you're working with Flexbox.

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.715
Instead, you work with
the flex-basis property, yeah?

27
00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:30.968
Okay, so try to work with that flex-basis
property as you're adjusting widths within

28
00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:32.380
that layout.

29
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.680
If you have some more time,
there is a part two here.

30
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.430
This is working with CSS grid.

31
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.744
I used three different syntaxes
with CSS grid to lay this out, and

32
00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:44.576
the page looks exactly
the same at the end.

33
00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:47.140
But I've used the line based placement,

34
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.226
which is like grid column one slash three,
okay?

35
00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:54.170
I've also used the span keyword,
like span two.

36
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.520
And I've also used grid area notation,
so I've coded it all those ways as well.

37
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.793
There's some answers that
are there in the starting CodePen.

38
00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:05.150
So why don't you go on ahead and get
started with this, just to get warmed up.

39
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.020
This is like the lap around
the football field before practice,

40
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.330
just to get the muscles warmed up.
