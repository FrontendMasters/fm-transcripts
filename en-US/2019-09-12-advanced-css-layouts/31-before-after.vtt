00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.451
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
now comes the cool part, all right?

2
00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:06.815
So so far, we have information,
we just can't read it all, yeah,

3
00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:08.665
super helpful, all right?

4
00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:10.268
This is the cool part.

5
00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:15.063
So what we're going to do here is,
we're gonna come up with some labels.

6
00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:20.022
And the way I'm gonna structure
these labels is as follows.

7
00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:24.309
I'm going to say,
first of all, td before, so

8
00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:29.455
before the td I'm gonna tell it
the white space is a no wrap

9
00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:34.390
which we'll get around a little
bug that a weird little

10
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.026
space will show up if you
don't have this in place.

11
00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:43.460
And I'm gonna make my font weight bold.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.379
Okay, so that'll affect all of them and

13
00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.779
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
say td nth of type, and a number.

14
00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.894
Colon, double colon before.

15
00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:08.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Content, Description.

16
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.199
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Slick, so
the headers are back, okay?

17
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think you need
a dash in nth of type, after of.

18
00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:22.642
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,
that's why it didn't work.

19
00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:24.125
Thank you.

20
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.861
And hyphen of hyphen type.

21
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:28.224
There we go.

22
00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:32.875
So you can see here in the table,
that now I have the word's description.

23
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.081
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Helpful [LAUGH] Although
that's not really the one we needed help

24
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:40.167
with, right?

25
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:43.977
Okay, so then we can just
repeat this process, yeah?

26
00:01:43.977 --> 00:01:49.056
Now we're hard-coding this
here in our CSS, okay?

27
00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:51.985
This is one of those limitation
kinda things, right?

28
00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.935
There's probably better ways
of repeating this content so

29
00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:57.590
that you don't have to
repeat yourself here, yeah?

30
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.816
This is a good situation where you
could pull in some JavaScript or

31
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.339
you could pull in a backend
programming language,

32
00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:05.933
whatever In order to write these out for
you, okay?

33
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.714
Probably JavaScript's a better choice.

34
00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:09.030
Then we'll write all these out.

35
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.209
But given that today is all about CSS,
we'll just go ahead and

36
00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.442
write all of these out.

37
00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:18.294
So for the second one,
we're gonna have to say "Weight: ".

38
00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:23.811
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For the third one,

39
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.579
we're gonna have it say
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Measure,

40
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.017
notice I'm not putting in the units.

41
00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.482
Scientists, don't panic.

42
00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.128
The units will come back.

43
00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:40.151
We know how important they are.

44
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:47.056
And 4 is going to be Vitamin C.

45
00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:52.259
And 5 is going

46
00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:58.333
to be vitamin K.

47
00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:02.747
Okay, so there we go.

48
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:04.564
Check that out.

49
00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:07.134
Now you can actually read this?

50
00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:08.467
Very nice.

51
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:12.935
But as I mentioned, the units of
measure are all missing aren't they?

52
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:14.060
How could we add units of measure?

53
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.193
Anyone want to make a suggestion?

54
00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:17.953
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The after?

55
00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:19.837
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about after?

56
00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:22.028
Nice, okay.

57
00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:25.845
So after, once again all those same
caveats apply about there's a better way

58
00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.852
to do this than write it directly in CSS.

59
00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:32.825
All that applies for
after 2, so here we're going

60
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:37.694
to say instead, and
the numbers are 2 and after.

61
00:03:37.694 --> 00:03:44.122
And the content will be,
in this case its gram,

62
00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:47.994
so its going to be, Space G.

63
00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:53.513
Okay, so this is for

64
00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:57.416
2 and for 4.

65
00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.448
And that one was milligrams per measure.

66
00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:09.363
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then five
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is

67
00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:13.736
micrograms per measure.

68
00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:17.241
Unfortunately, with the before and
after properties,

69
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:20.898
whatever is put in here is
directly written to the web page.

70
00:04:20.898 --> 00:04:25.574
And so while we could probably come
up with the beautiful little code

71
00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:29.428
to give us an actual micro,
the Greek letter for micro,

72
00:04:29.428 --> 00:04:34.126
what will actually show up there is
whatever that code is for micro.

73
00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:39.645
Yeah it's not very pretty, so
I'm fudging it here using a u instead.

74
00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.219
Okay, and
that's the reason why I'm doing that.

75
00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.946
I wanted to take a quick moment and just
show you a quick addition that we've made

76
00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:53.777
to our table example from CodePen based
on feedback from somebody here in class.

77
00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:59.882
So I mentioned that that micro symbol
was pretty difficult to put it in.

78
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.032
But we actually have a solution for
that now.

79
00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:06.890
So first of all, over here in your HTML.

80
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.451
If you'd like that micro symbol to appear.

81
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:13.857
You can just use the HTML
character equivalent thing of

82
00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:17.799
ampersand with micro and
a semicolon on the end.

83
00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:20.363
Don't put a space between
the semicolon and the G.

84
00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:24.031
And it will show up as micrograms
per measure down here on the bottom,

85
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:25.748
which is exactly what you want.

86
00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:27.451
However, as I said,

87
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:33.226
if you actually use that same ampersand
micro semicolon in the before and

88
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:38.730
after over here in the CSS that we
had been talking about previously.

89
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.138
That exact text would show up, so &amp;micro,
which is not really what we want.

90
00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:48.764
So here, what we've done
instead is use this equivalent,

91
00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:53.769
which is a front slash,
the weird slash, the one you never use.

92
00:05:53.769 --> 00:06:00.161
That one, capital B, number 5, next to the
G like that, and that will work as well.

93
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:02.768
And I can just go ahead and show you that.

94
00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:07.448
Real quick, so
if we go to full page view here and

95
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:12.245
I shrink the screen down,
you'll see that there

96
00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:16.698
it is 0.7 micrograms per measure, okay?

97
00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:21.441
So that's a really nice tip to get
around that particular problem and

98
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.568
I've updated the Codepens to reflect that.
