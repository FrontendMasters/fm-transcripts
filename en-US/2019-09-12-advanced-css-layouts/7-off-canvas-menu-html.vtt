1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.638
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this hamburger button.

2
00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:03.692
We're gonna put it up here at the top,
right?

3
00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:07.150
That's where good hamburgers go,
they go at the very top of the document.

4
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.114
So let's go ahead and start this,
and we're gonna put in,

5
00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:15.004
it's gonna be a clickable thing.

6
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.032
So we'll start with an a href.

7
00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'm gonna have this link to main menu.

8
00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:26.671
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's pound main menu.

9
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:31.379
We'll eventually have an ID for that and

10
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.502
the class will be menu-toggle, okay, and

11
00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:43.296
we're also gonna give this an ID,
main-menu-toggle.

12
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:47.538
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's always hard the first
line of code because you're like,

13
00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:48.630
why are you doing that?

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.680
Why are you doing that?

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.370
All will become clear as we write
a little bit more code here, so

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.930
just sort of take my word for
it for the moment.

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.894
Obviously, we need to close that tag.

18
00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:00.303
And in between,
we need to put something to click on.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.601
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You also need a-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

20
00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.064
I need a quote right there.

21
00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.202
There we go.

22
00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.626
Thank you, and then here in the middle,

23
00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:15.168
we'll go ahead and
put in our font awesome, -span,

24
00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:20.739
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Class=fa fa-bars.

25
00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.544
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, if you copy
this right out of font awesome,

26
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.785
it will be in an eye tag.

27
00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:31.291
I've never been a fan of the eye tag,
but so

28
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.877
spam tag will do pretty
much the same thing.

29
00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:36.754
It's a generic tag.

30
00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:38.810
So there's our bars, yay.

31
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.710
There's the hamburger button.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.590
Tell me about this
hamburger button right now.

33
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.493
Is it doing anything?

34
00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:45.452
What is it doing?

35
00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's just
hanging out there on the page.

36
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.090
Let's go ahead and
put in the next chunk of HTML here.

37
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.150
And our nav,
we're gonna put in an id of main menu.

38
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.150
That's where it comes from.

39
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.690
So when we click on this
button up here on the top.

40
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.062
Somehow we're gonna
trigger our navigation.

41
00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:15.262
So those two things go together.

42
00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:17.791
Makes sense?

43
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.673
And then we're gonna give that a class.

44
00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:28.039
Main menu, and
then inside of that we'll go on ahead and

45
00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:33.514
put in an a href equals,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Close my tag.

46
00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.860
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is gonna
go to main menu toggle

47
00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.888
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll give it a class

48
00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:48.938
of menu-close.

49
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.783
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Any one wanna guess
what's gonna go inside of my a tag here?

50
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.771
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Awesome.

51
00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:05.714
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Fun, some kind of fun,
awesome doing what?

52
00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:10.486
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a big x?

53
00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:12.979
Yeah, big x.

54
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.425
So once again, if you copy it out of fun,
awesome, it will give you an i tag.

55
00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.520
I'm gonna use a span.

56
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.444
Up to you, fa, fa hyphen close.

57
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Close the span.

58
00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:33.449
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then the last little
thing I'm gonna add here is down at

59
00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:39.453
the bottom after the navigation before,
actually after this slash nav tag,

60
00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:43.560
we're gonna add this,
a href equals and this is weird.

61
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.967
And I don't expect you're gonna
understand what it is just yet, but

62
00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:49.329
take my word on it,
it's gonna be really cool.

63
00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.294
Main-menu-toggle.

64
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.687
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then a class of backdrop.

65
00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:06.553
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And it's gonna be hidden.

66
00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:11.041
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
that link has nothing in between.

67
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:14.208
Anyone wanna take a guess what that weird
little line of code might be doing?

68
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:19.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Has a thing
called backdrop in it.

69
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.414
There's a hidden in it.

70
00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:27.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we unclick,
it'll toggle the hidden or the display?

71
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.740
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
there's something here going on.

72
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.160
So what we're building is
an off canvas kind of thing.

73
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.740
We're gonna slide in the menu.

74
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.720
So we have the menu on the page.

75
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.730
What happens if they don't click the x?

76
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.108
What if they click over there somewhere?

77
00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:41.435
What happens?

78
00:04:43.274 --> 00:04:44.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I don't know, right?

79
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.980
So this line of code is gonna do that,

80
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.200
it's gonna make the whole screen
clickable to make the menu disappear.
