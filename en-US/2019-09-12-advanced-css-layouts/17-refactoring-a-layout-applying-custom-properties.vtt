1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What we're going
to do is we're gonna come down

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.407
here to our media queries.

3
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:09.706
And instead of assigning this margin,
this margin goes away.

4
00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:12.948
We don't need that margin anymore,
all right.

5
00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:15.664
Now what we're going to do
here in my media queries,

6
00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:19.505
instead of saying the flax with
the value here, I'm gonna call out what?

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.099
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is gonna change
from where we were outside the media

8
00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.537
query to inside media query?

9
00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:30.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The width.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.186
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The width,
that width variable, right?

11
00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:36.071
Okay, and so that value is gonna change.

12
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.553
So here, the value for this,
this is going to become flex,

13
00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:44.329
or sorry, all we have to do is this,
width of two.

14
00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:50.301
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right?

15
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:54.474
Because now that 2 will go
into our calculation here,

16
00:00:54.474 --> 00:01:01.835
we'll have 2 divided by 4, which is 0.5
multiplied by a 100%, we get 50%, right?

17
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.901
2 boxes of 50% each next to each other.

18
00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:06.146
Make sense?

19
00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:13.477
We haven't got into the gap yet so,
let's do the easy part first, okay?

20
00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:16.744
Okay, so what does it mean here for
this one?

21
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:21.005
Column of 1-4 and 2-4.

22
00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:25.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And really I've
refactored some other stuff here, too.

23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.206
This should also be .call(-3) and
.call(-4).

24
00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:33.668
What is this one going to be?

25
00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:45.454
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: col-4 should be
the giveaway, what would be the value?

26
00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:46.108
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Back to 4.

27
00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:47.353
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about 4, right?

28
00:01:47.353 --> 00:01:49.115
We're back to 4.

29
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:53.710
Not all of those were set that way, and
I'm not gonna go through all the code to

30
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.476
explain Be now, the 1-4 and
2-4 and all the rest of that.

31
00:01:57.476 --> 00:02:00.460
You can read the original
code if you want.

32
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.046
And the ordering we're gonna leave alone.

33
00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:08.435
Okay, then when I come down here to my
desktop sizes, what is this gonna become?

34
00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:11.055
It was 20%, what's my value of width now?

35
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:21.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many
boxes across do I have?

36
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.375
Four boxes, right?

37
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.446
So my value of width is what?

38
00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:31.095
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, right?

39
00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:35.949
Okay, so here my value of width is 1.

40
00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.221
What would my value of width be here?

41
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.435
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 2.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2.

42
00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.032
My value of width here?

43
00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:51.559
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 3.

44
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.799
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 3?

45
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.663
And 4 is gonna carry down from
the previous media query.

46
00:02:57.663 --> 00:02:59.747
So if we take a peek at what we built so

47
00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:04.075
far,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I probably have to save

48
00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:07.169
this for so I can show you,
hang on for that.

49
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:20.275
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Thank you, and now we can
take a look at this in full page view.

50
00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:22.184
And we can kinda see, okay?

51
00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:26.248
So there's the 4 the 2, the 1 and the 3.

52
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:28.216
The full row, the 1, 2, 1.

53
00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:33.317
And if I start to narrow this page down,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All

54
00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:38.666
my media query points work, yeah,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

55
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:43.119
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And look at that.

56
00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.773
There they go,
they're all stack on top of each other.

57
00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:47.259
Awesome?

58
00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.184
Look how little code it took for

59
00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:54.305
us to write a 4-column grid system
using really something pretty simple?

60
00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.762
What about that gap?

61
00:03:56.762 --> 00:04:01.510
Cuz we've just done the super easy
thing here, we managed to put in 25,

62
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.898
50, 75, and 100%, okay?

63
00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:06.307
Big deal, but what about those gaps?

64
00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:08.499
That's something we need to go back and
add.

65
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.487
Okay, so let's think again,
if I have a row with four boxes in it, and

66
00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:18.395
they're pushed all the way out to
the side with justify, or series,

67
00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:23.245
the justify contents at the space between,
how many gaps do I have?

68
00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:28.095
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three gaps, right?

69
00:04:28.095 --> 00:04:32.205
If I have three boxes of any size,
how many gaps do I have?

70
00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:32.879
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Two.

71
00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.525
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Two.

72
00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:36.745
If I have two boxes of any size,
how many gaps do I have?

73
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:37.279
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One.

74
00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.499
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One.
If I have one great big huge box,

75
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:40.920
how many gaps do I have?

76
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Zero.

77
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.623
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have you
determined the pattern here?

78
00:04:43.623 --> 00:04:44.568
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Minus one.

79
00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:46.422
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's kind of like that,
isn't it?

80
00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:51.178
Okay, so let's go ahead and set this up.

81
00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:54.613
So the way I went ahead and
did this math was as follows,

82
00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:57.391
I''m gonna set something called the gap.

83
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.709
I'm gonna establish that here
again outside the media query.

84
00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:02.851
Here's my logic.

85
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.774
I'm gonna call this the calc.

86
00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:11.844
And the way that I did this was
I said the variable of columns,

87
00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:17.943
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Weâ€™re going to subtract

88
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:22.330
from the variable of width, yeah?

89
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.994
Variable of width.

90
00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:27.219
Okay.

91
00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:33.105
So, if I did that math real quick
that would be like 4 minus 4,

92
00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:35.337
would be 0%, right?

93
00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:40.972
Or 4 minus 3 would be, would be 1, right.

94
00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:44.415
And it'd be more helpful to put
that into a percent, wouldn't it?

95
00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:48.980
So I'm going to multiply this by 1%.

96
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:54.979
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

97
00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.901
So that's gonna calculate my gap for me.

98
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.808
And now what I'm gonna do is my flex
basis calculation here becomes what?

99
00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:12.809
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I need to
add that initial basis, and

100
00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.175
then how am I gonna bring it in the gap?

101
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:21.062
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Subtract it
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Subtract it, right?

102
00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:22.004
Yeah.

103
00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:27.437
So we're only going to say from my
first basis We'll say simply calc,

104
00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:32.632
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we're gonna say,

105
00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:39.358
the variable of initial basis
minus the variable of gap.

106
00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:46.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean,
one more closing parenthesis.

107
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.437
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Am I missing one?

108
00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:49.535
Yes, I am, thank you.
