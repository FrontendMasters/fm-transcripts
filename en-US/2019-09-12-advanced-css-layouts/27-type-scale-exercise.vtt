00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.832
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And in chapter eight,
it's called the you try it type scale?

2
00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:08.764
Okay, so what you're going to do now is

3
00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:12.952
you've got the book once again.

4
00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:16.887
I've got all of the various
screenshots of how the fonts

5
00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:20.580
are actually supposed to
look at this point, okay?

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
And they project really badly so
you should look at this on your screen.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.419
The little words on the top,
the H1's actually got really small.

8
00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.100
There are some other size
changes that happen here.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.880
Notice hat the layout times is actually
laid out a little bit more nicely than it

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.517
was before.

11
00:00:36.517 --> 00:00:39.160
[LAUGH] It was kinda ugly before.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.462
There's a deep irony and
a bad layout for the layout times.

13
00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:49.070
In any case, so you can go ahead and
flip through these.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.120
There's the home versions.

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.490
There's also the book version
with the changes that are there.

16
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.118
And so what I'd like for
you to do then is,

17
00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:03.889
I've given you in your beginning files,
in your CSS,

18
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.955
for both the homepage and
for the inside page.

19
00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:14.213
I have given you a file called type.css,
and I've linked it up to both of those.

20
00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:17.168
This is the code that we just wrote, okay?

21
00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:19.159
So this is the code from
the code pen that we just wrote.

22
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.890
It's a starting point.

23
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.440
What I'd like for

24
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.920
you to do now is to think about what
would actually work on this website?

25
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.450
What kind of additional
changes do you need to tweak?

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.870
How do you tweak them?

27
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.790
Basically what you did with layout but
now you're gonna do it with type.

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.350
Sound good?
