1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now what we need to
do is we need to pull out column three.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.450
And we're gonna move it down underneath.

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.660
Let's do this in two parts.

4
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.995
Part one is let's pull out column three.

5
00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.010
[LAUGH] Okay?

6
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.990
Let's pull out column three.

7
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.810
And just make it appear at the bottom.

8
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.220
So let's think this through, okay?

9
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.080
So right now,
we're working in 16 columns here,

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.510
yeah, okay, and this was the arrangement.

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.910
We're trying to pull out the third column.

12
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.010
So effectively how wide does
the third column become?

13
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 16.

14
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It could
potentially become 16.

15
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.190
Here's the next thing I want
you to break in your head.

16
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.700
Okay, when you work in boot strap or any
of those other response design frameworks

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.800
you have 12 columns right and
it's 12 columns no matter what you do.

18
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.880
Guess what we have in this arrangement.

19
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.680
We can change how many columns
we have like that can't we?

20
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.770
So, we can just change the number
of columns we have and

21
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.460
move our column down,
how cool would that be?

22
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.170
Okay.

23
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.530
So, the devs column right
now is two columns wide.

24
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.650
What if here, at our next media query,
what we do is the following.

25
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.965
Let's go ahead and re-declare our main.

26
00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:24.339
[SOUND] And let's say instead,

27
00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:28.629
we'll make the columns 14, right?

28
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:34.700
16 minus two is 14, so
I'm gonna make these 14 wide, alright?

29
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.063
And then my devs will wind up doing what?

30
00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.008
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: My devs will have a width.

31
00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:48.588
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of 14 correct?

32
00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:52.769
Does that make sense?

33
00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:59.596
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, now technically
speaking in order to make this work with

34
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:03.692
the cascading media queries here because
we've got these series of minimum

35
00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:05.350
widths, right?

36
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.490
So when I'm actually
down here at 1200 pixels,

37
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.790
I'm actually getting these
styles feed into this.

38
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.380
Let's say if I was at 1300 pixels,
I am definitely over

39
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.220
950 pixels and I am over 1200 pixels so
both of these things are true, right?

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.140
So we need to rearrange these properties
a little bit now to make this code

41
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.980
work, okay?

42
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460
So that's the next thing I wanna do.

43
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.710
So down here,
even though we had it declared at the top,

44
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.990
let's re-declare main again,
now to be columns of 16, right?

45
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.490
Okay?

46
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.200
And then first, main and
those can go up here, right,

47
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.260
because those are saying the same and
resources are staying the same as well.

48
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.889
So, does that kind of make
sense why I did that?

49
00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:08.719
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So first is gonna be five
columns wide whether we're at 950 or

50
00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.954
1200 pixels.

51
00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:17.011
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Same with main, it's gonna
be six columns wide at either dimension,

52
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:22.060
devs changes, so we have 14 down to two,
resources gonna be the same at both.

53
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.730
And the number of columns changes.

54
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.390
All make sense?

55
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.500
Okay?

56
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.560
So let's save that.

57
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.040
And now let's go ahead and
refresh our page.

58
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.040
All right, so
here we are at fat dimensions looks good.

59
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.720
Let's go ahead and go down.

60
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.930
Oops, looks like we still have
a couple of other things to do?

61
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.330
Developers dropped down
exactly as we wanted it to.

62
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.620
And so did Design Resources, why is that?

63
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.606
Can anyone explain why that happened?

64
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because
the devs section ended up

65
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.055
just taking the entirety of a new row,

66
00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:06.540
or not row but [INAUDIBLE].

67
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It kind of does.

68
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.210
It did exactly what you told it to do,
didn't it?

69
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.920
That's so annoying when that happens.

70
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.220
Okay, so we had these.

71
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.180
This is now 11 columns wide right?

72
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.050
We have five over here on the left.

73
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.900
We have six over here on the right.

74
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.750
So we have three empty columns we
said justify a space between and so

75
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.350
there they are in the middle.

76
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.100
Then we have our developers,
they are taking up the full 14 columns.

77
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.990
And then underneath is our design
resources they got pushed down.

78
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.660
Row wrap it did exactly
what we told it to do.

79
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.280
So how do we fix this problem?

80
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Order?

81
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The order property, right?

82
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.810
All we have to do is simply
reorder with Flexbox.

83
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.400
We're just reordering
the order of these boxes.

84
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.220
So let's go on ahead and
say first we'll have an order of one.

85
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.340
Main will have an order of two.

86
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.770
Devs will have an order of of four,
correct?

87
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.120
And resources has an order of three.

88
00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:15.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now that devs is
going to be the last column, correct?

89
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.760
It's the one that winds
up while wrapping under.

90
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.470
Devs is just going to be in
line with the other columns.

91
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.079
Makes sense?

92
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.723
Okay, save that.

93
00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:31.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's go on ahead, and
refresh the page, and see if that worked.

94
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.533
Hey, look at that.

95
00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:36.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go,
we grabbed the third column.

96
00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:39.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How amazing is that?

97
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.100
How often do you see that done?

98
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.569
That would actually be pretty hard
to do with Bootstrap, wouldn't it?

99
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.940
Potentially.

100
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.190
Okay?

101
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.440
So, there it is.

102
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.930
Yeah, it's not formatted right yet,
we're getting there.

103
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.430
Okay?

104
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.630
All right, how are you doing?

105
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.970
Are you happy people, so far?

106
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.650
Okay, so now, if I go back and
pull this back out again.

107
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.190
Oops!

108
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.177
What do we need to do
now to fix this problem?

109
00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:13.866
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The order again.

110
00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:15.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change the ordering again!

111
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.430
Correct in the 1200 pixel media queries.

112
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.050
So here we need to say that devs is
now an order, whoops, order of three.

113
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.550
Yeah?

114
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:34.010
And resources becomes our order of four.

115
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.210
Okay.

116
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.067
So now there we go, there they
are in the right order now, yeah?

117
00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:46.194
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, devs goes down to
the bottom, they're stacked on top of each

118
00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:49.760
other because that's exactly what we
told it to do, and you know what?

119
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.520
I'm going to leave it like this for
the moment.

120
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.500
Okay, let's just keep on going down and
get everything in the right order,

121
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.580
and then we'll go back and
clean it all up, okay?

122
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.250
Alright, so, my next question to you now
that you have seen how this process works,

123
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.150
okay, so we went from 16 columns to 14.

124
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.870
What I would like for you to do is I would
like for you to try the next media query.

125
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.980
The next media query is 740 pixels.

126
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.880
Okay?

127
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.790
I want you to think about
what needs to happen.

128
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:27.010
This is the final dash MD
down there in your files.

129
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.920
This is the way it's supposed to look.

130
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.240
Don't worry about the devs yet.

131
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.000
The devs are gonna be
stacked on top of each other.

132
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.515
But what I'd like for you to do is to get
to the first and the second columns next

133
00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:42.195
to each other just like that and then have
your devs and your design underneath.
