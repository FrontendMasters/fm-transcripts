00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if you now take a look
at what you got before, whoa, okay.

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.570
Switch our view here back to
full page view, what do we got?

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.330
Hey, look at that, the gap is back, okay,

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.140
and it all lines up, and
it lines up beautifully, look at that.

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.950
Okay, and if I start to shrink it down,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Wow, look at that.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.013
Still get a gap, still everything
lines up, isn't that awesome?

7
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why aren't you
guys jumping out of your chairs?

8
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.221
This is amazing.

9
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:41.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.260
then now you've got everything stacked on
top of each other just the way you want.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.792
Are you happy?

12
00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:49.474
Look at what little we had to do.

13
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:57.903
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we go back to our code here,

14
00:00:57.903 --> 00:00:59.725
look at what little we had to do here.

15
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.468
We've simply established,
I have the same number of columns, and

16
00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:05.840
each column is gonna have a width, right?

17
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.560
I calculate this initial basis
just simply dividing the width

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.554
by my number of columns and
multiply by 100%.

19
00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:16.264
I have a gap that I'm also factoring here.

20
00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:19.210
I'm gonna make this a little bit
bigger to put it all on one line,

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.450
make it a little easier to read.

22
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.930
Columns minus the width times 1% to
convert it to the right number of units.

23
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.276
And then I'm simply gonna subtract
my initial basis minus the gap.

24
00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:39.476
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I just wrote
a grid system for everything.

25
00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:44.180
It is the grid system,
we're done, Bootstrap is dead,

26
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.030
this is all you need, that's it.

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.110
Cuz now what could I do with this, what if
I decide I wanna have a 12 column layout.

28
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.872
What do I do?

29
00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:56.704
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just change
the value of columns.

30
00:01:56.704 --> 00:02:00.264
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change the value
of my columns, right.

31
00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:02.964
And then change my value of my width.

32
00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:05.337
Down here, I'm gonna have to
declare different values for

33
00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.690
width to make it work for
12 columns, right?

34
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.600
But fundamentally, the logic,
it is exactly the same, isn't it?
