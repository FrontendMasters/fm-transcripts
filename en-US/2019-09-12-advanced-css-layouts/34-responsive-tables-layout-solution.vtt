00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.963
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
going through this table answer here,

2
00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:06.193
we'll go ahead and put this in.

3
00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:09.584
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Drop this on down here.

4
00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:13.460
So I went ahead and put in a main with
an ID of table down here in our HTML.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.750
Here's our little blah blah
that's gonna start us off here.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.950
A citation.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.120
And then, we have the div here with
that scroll that I talked about earlier,

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.890
so there is the scroll added there.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.792
We have our accessibility additions
put in here to this table for

10
00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:34.986
planned data and the fact sheet caption.

11
00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:40.973
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then, we have a whole
bunch of different table cells here, okay?

12
00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:45.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's pretty much
what's going on over here in the HTML.

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.620
There's a thead, there's a tbody,

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.240
it's pretty much what we saw
in the code pen, all right?

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.538
And then, over here in our CSS,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

16
00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:01.646
what we have is
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: First of all,

17
00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:06.330
of course, we dissolve the whole thing as
we had done before, so there's all that.

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.300
Pretty much basically what
you saw in code pen before.

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.206
We have different words here
in our content before, right?

20
00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:16.650
So, there's that.

21
00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:23.107
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have my font size
calling in my variable for my caption,

22
00:01:23.107 --> 00:01:26.735
instead of just coding in something hard,
okay?

23
00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:27.619
And then here,

24
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.500
where we get to our media queries
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Once again,

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.309
changing my font size on my caption.

26
00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:42.114
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then,
some generic page styling down here.

27
00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:43.794
So that's the table CSS.

28
00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:45.397
So that's how the tables are dealt with.

29
00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:48.670
Pretty much the code pen solution
that I showed you before,

30
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.580
the layout will change
a little bit as well.

31
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.948
Because of course,

32
00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:57.940
we can just plug this right on into our
inside article and so forth is here.

33
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.684
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And as we scroll down here,

34
00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:11.437
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go,

35
00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:14.520
I think my big change was
down here at the bottom.

36
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.530
So I said for
my inside page table in the article,

37
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.466
I set my width to 12 for the main
portion of it, and 4 for the other.

38
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:28.980
And then, that wound up getting changed,
I think, in the first media query.

39
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.590
Here it is, right here.

40
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280
Sorry, it's in the second media query.

41
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.181
The 950 pixel media query.

42
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:37.274
Here, we have the inside table article and

43
00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:39.494
the inside table aside
set to the same width.

44
00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:41.280
So that's basically what I did.

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.951
If you had different numbers for
your various widths of the screen and

46
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:46.544
so forth, that's all good.
