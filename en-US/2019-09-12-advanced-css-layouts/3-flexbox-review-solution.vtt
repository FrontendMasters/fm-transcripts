00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.737
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we're gonna start
here with, this is the Flexbox answer.

2
00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:08.226
This is the Codepen, the URL for this
Codepen is inside of your instructions for

3
00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.750
chapter one and you can follow along here.

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.846
So, as you see over in my HTML, I set this
up with a whole bunch of divs because

5
00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:18.823
there's absolutely nothing semantic
whatsoever going on in this code.

6
00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:22.240
We have the letters A through H, the end.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.220
So I've just used div tags here.

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.330
I gave you a class for
every single one of those inside divs, and

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.250
then a class on the outside as a wrapper.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.070
Remember that the key to Flexbox is
parents and children, flex containers and

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.510
flex items.

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.576
If you remember that relationship,
Flexbox becomes so much simpler.

13
00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.710
So what I've got going on here is,

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.900
first of all remember what to
declare on the flex parent.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.580
That flex container.

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.203
Here on the wrapper, we've gone ahead and
set this up to display: flex.

17
00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.600
We've said row-wrap, okay?

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.870
Cuz we want to put everything on rows,

19
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.860
it's gonna wrap onto
the next row potentially.

20
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.330
I've had my justified
content as space between.

21
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.560
Which one is space between?

22
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.288
How does that look?

23
00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:10.122
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Everything except the ends.

24
00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:12.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everything except the ends,
right?

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.310
Let's push it all the way
on out to the edges and

26
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.060
whatever space is in, we'll just
put in between the remaining boxes.

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.020
Why did I pick that?

28
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.740
It was convenient and it looked nice.

29
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.560
Okay, actually it doesn't really matter
that much with this particular layout,

30
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.700
if you don't mind a little bit
of white space on either end.

31
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.640
You could've done space between, for
example, you could've done space evenly.

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.940
A lot of other things you could've done.

33
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.080
But in order to get the boxes all the way
to the edge of the screen like that with

34
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.670
no white space,
you would need to use space between.

35
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.930
Okay, the other thing you might
have noticed is that the content is

36
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.690
gonna define the width of that box,
isn't it?

37
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.050
At least to start with.

38
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.576
And so align content of
stretch is gonna go ahead and

39
00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:53.827
stretch those boxes to
fill the full widths.

40
00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:57.952
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, some of you
are looking like you're learning for

41
00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:58.630
the first time.

42
00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:03.620
Ooh yeah, these are some of the things
that we tend to look up in Flexbox.

43
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.030
We have a little cheat sheet,
we look them up.

44
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210
I have one from the previous
class that I taught here.

45
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.330
I'll go ahead and add that to the Github
repost so you'll have that to refer to.

46
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.665
It's just a whole bunch of
properties you can take a look at.

47
00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:17.883
[COUGH] All right,
now to put a space in between everything.

48
00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:20.544
This is the hard part here,
how are we going to go ahead and

49
00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:22.920
put a space in between
on a row by row basis?

50
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.860
Well, I use this cool
little selector here.

51
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.180
I said wrapper, and then this weird
looking greater than sign and the star.

52
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.256
What does that mean?

53
00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:34.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's the children.

54
00:02:34.923 --> 00:02:36.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All of
the direct children of wrapper.

55
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.480
Yeah, okay?

56
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:42.860
So if I'd had other stuff between those
divs, they wouldn't have been effected or

57
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.710
inside of those divs,
other than just the letters.

58
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.010
So here, this is going to put
a margin on the bottom of one round.

59
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.611
So that's going to give us our
space in between the rows.

60
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.186
Make sense, okay?

61
00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:58.097
And then all I need to do is tell
it what the flex basis is for

62
00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.198
all the rest of them.

63
00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:05.685
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's 66% for those
that look like they take up two columns.

64
00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.120
30 or, what did I say?

65
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.770
32% for those that are a single column and
then 100% for

66
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.170
the one that takes up the full width.

67
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.570
And the reason that those are not.

68
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.178
Those are not fully
adding up to 100% is so

69
00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:23.710
that we have a little bit
of space in between these.
