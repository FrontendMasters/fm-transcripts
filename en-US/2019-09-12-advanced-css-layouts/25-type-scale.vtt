00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So all you designers out
there who have benoided my type sizes

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.360
cuz some of you I'm sure are,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.950
now we're going to address the type
sizes here for the website.

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.160
If you take a look at all
the CSS that I have written for

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520
you that you haven't really seen.

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.940
And all the CSS we've written so

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.760
far we actually have an address type
sizes anywhere on this webpage.

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.770
So now we're going to go into this and
think about type sizes.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.970
How many of you here would describe
yourselves as graphic designers?

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.610
I have two who,
maybe three kind of sort of, okay.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.439
Would any of you say it
was your main focus?

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030
One person says it's their main focus.

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.250
Okay, so we have a relatively heavy
developer crowd here in the classroom.

14
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.410
I would assume online,
it's gonna be somewhat similar.

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.980
And so one of the problems that we have
when we're trying to fake being graphic

16
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.850
designers is trying to come up with
things that work, or the right colors.

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.960
We have clues like color out of Adobe.com
to help us choose color pallets.

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.930
This is a website called type scale and

19
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
type scale is here to help
us with our type sizing.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.720
Because we shouldn't really just
be choosing random sizes for

21
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.850
our type wherever we want to put it.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.940
There is a, type, believe it or
not, has been around since about

23
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.610
you know a really long time
like close to a thousand years.

24
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.565
Gutenberg Bible is what the 1400 or
something,

25
00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:25.930
that's when type sort of got started.

26
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.060
So we have some rules that we can
actually adapt and use here on the web.

27
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.420
And so
this web site is called type-scale.com.

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.880
Feel free to take a look at it.

29
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.820
What type scale is doing here is you will
see that it is we have obviously a whole

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.880
bunch of different sizes of type here,
okay?

31
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.460
And this is set up with a base font size,
base font on size right now and 16 pixels,

32
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.710
which is what you would
expect with a web browser.

33
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.640
You could change the base font size,
if you wanted to.

34
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.820
And then we have a scale here, okay?

35
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.790
So the scale, and if you are musicians,

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.260
as many of you web developers are,
you may actually know the major second,

37
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.370
the minor major second,
the major minor thirds are, and so forth.

38
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.720
If you don't, it's the distance
between two notes in music, okay?

39
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.090
And for whatever reason,

40
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.840
they've named our type scales by
these musical definitions here.

41
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.980
And so what this is going to do, I'll just
go on ahead and choose different items

42
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.810
here, it will scale our
type exactly like this.

43
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.030
So if I want more distance,

44
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.880
more difference between my type sizes,
maybe I'd go with a minor third.

45
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.590
If I want something really,
really honking big and

46
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.070
different, that's pretty different, okay?

47
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.420
Probably don't wanna go up that far but
you can, okay.

48
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.650
That's the golden ratio, but

49
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.552
chances are I think the minor second
might be something or the major second

50
00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:03.110
might be something close to what you see
pretty much to the browser by default.

51
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.020
And so
this is the way this is going to work.

52
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.970
If you take a look at the math for this.

53
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.022
Let me go to, let's see.

54
00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:18.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What do I want to start on?

55
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.130
Okay, so if you start with the major
third, this is a good place to start.

56
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.600
Right here, this is the one two
three fourth from the bottom.

57
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.410
You'll see that these words here,

58
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.820
our visual types scale are at 1M or
16 pixels, okay?

59
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.154
The next number up is 1.25.

60
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:48.180
How did we get from 1 to 1.25 given the
pieces that we have here on the screen?

61
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.044
What did we do?

62
00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:55.921
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We took our base
font size which is 1M, right?

63
00:03:55.921 --> 00:03:59.110
And we multiplied it by what?

64
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.427
1.25 and that gave us 1.25Ms.

65
00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:07.000
Okay, so that's our second font size.

66
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.252
Now we're gonna to take that 1.25,

67
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:16.931
we're gonna multiply by 1.25,
and we get, trust me 1.563.

68
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:23.687
We're gonna take 1.563,
we're gonna multiply by 1.25,

69
00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:29.060
and we're gonna get,
trust me, 1.953, okay?

70
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.318
So our random numbers here
aren't actually so random.

71
00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:36.190
Everybody kind of clear on what
a type scale is, how this works?

72
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.380
Maybe something we could do
with custom properties and

73
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.650
calc, set something up like this for
our document.

74
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.950
That might be really cool?

75
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.299
Anyone ever wanted to change their
font sizes over media queries?

76
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.970
How many times do you
change your font size,

77
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.820
how much code is taken up changing
font sizes over media queries?

78
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.560
Wouldn't it be great to scale that back
to something a little bit smaller?

79
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.450
Here's a model for how we can do it.

80
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.630
How awesome is that?

81
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.900
Okay, so, let's go ahead and set this up.

82
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.710
You can stick with Poppins
here if you want for font.

83
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.580
If you pull over the little tab here on
the side, you can set up whatever you

84
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.510
want in terms of fonts, your line, height
your font color and all the rest of it.

85
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.850
It's going to give you a sample of these
different just, blah blah text here, okay?

86
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.180
And then down at the bottom, somewhere,
there is a link to code pen.

87
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.670
Where did the link to code pen go?

88
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.020
There it is, so you are edit whatever
it is you want over there and

89
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.910
there you are gonna add it on code pen.

90
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.510
Okay so going ahead and open up this
website if you don't have it open already.

91
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.080
Go to type hyphen scale.com, set it up
to be a major third if it's not already.

92
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.320
And then what we are going to do is we're
gonna click the button down here on

93
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.210
the bottom that says edit on CodePen,
all right?

94
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:14.343
And if you go on ahead and go there,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This will go ahead and

95
00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:19.510
give you that exact HTML and CSS that
was used to put that together, okay?

96
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.990
As I said, happens to be Poppins.

97
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.820
If you have preferences on your fonts,
you can always go to Google fonts and

98
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.016
you could get the @import statement.

99
00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:34.770
We've using @import here
because this is code pen, and

100
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.540
we're working just internally here.

101
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.726
You probably aren't gonna use
@import in your real work.

102
00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:46.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
so, as you see here.

103
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.610
Here is my HTML where I'm
setting my base font size.

104
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.190
There's my body, sort of,
description what this is.

105
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.050
Then I've got my paragraph and then, sort

106
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.410
of just generic settings here for margins
and font families and yadda yadda yadda.

107
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.380
And then comes the interesting part,
here's all of our font sizes, yeah, okay.
