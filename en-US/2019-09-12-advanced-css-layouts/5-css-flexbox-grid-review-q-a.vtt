1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How come you didn't
have to name the other areas?

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because we haven't
used the grid area syntax before.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.880
So this is a way that I can
define regions of my page.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.640
Whereas with some of
this other syntax here

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.710
we're defining in this case
this is by line, line number.

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.500
Okay?

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.210
And this we're just saying,

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.750
wherever grid lays down these boxes,
make this one span across two.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.135
Make this one span across three.

10
00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:30.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.476
Which syntax is better?

12
00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.659
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's your million
dollar consulting phrase, everybody?

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.580
Yes?
It depends, yes.

14
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.940
And what does it depend on?

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Browser support.

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Browser support, maybe.

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.240
Although in your case she's gotta
support IE 10, that's a big deal.

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.410
Yeah, I know, we feel bad for her.

19
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.130
[LAUGH] But what are some other choices?

20
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.198
Assuming browser support isn't a thing?

21
00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.992
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whatever your
development team knows,

22
00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:06.131
that's a good place to start, okay?

23
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:08.000
That one.

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.061
How often are these things gonna change?

25
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:15.237
If you suddenly decide to add another
column and you have to go back and

26
00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:20.620
recode all your numbers again,
that would kinda be a bad thing, right?

27
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.340
Which is gonna take you the least
amount of maintenance to change

28
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.320
if the layout changes.

29
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.810
The other thing that's really nice is
that with grid area here in particular,

30
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.000
this is really easy to put in
spans across rows and columns.

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.240
You just spell it all out
really really quickly.

32
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.310
Plus with this lovely little
diagram you have here,

33
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.280
you can see exactly the way
the page is supposed to look.

34
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.620
So a lot of people like this
methodology for that reason.

35
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.460
The documentation maybe is a little
bit cleaner and easier to understand.

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.810
But any of them work in this
particular scenario including Flexbox.

37
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.540
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So

38
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.950
let's say you're supporting a product
that some of your users are on

39
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.420
Evergreen browsers and
others are are on IE 11 or IE 10.

40
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
How would you go about,
would you recommend adding both

41
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.050
display options where newer browsers that
support grid would would show it as grid?

42
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.320
Older browsers would fall back to Flexbox.

43
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so you can do that.

44
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.489
Absolutely you can do that.

45
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.320
The disadvantage to that is now you're
basically maintaining two code bases.

46
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.620
One is for grid, one is for Flexbox,
say for example, or floats or

47
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.500
whatever it happens to be.

48
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.540
So while that's possible,
people generally stay away from it.

49
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.366
The other thing I'll point you to is
Rachel Andrews's resources on this topic.

50
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:42.720
At her gridbyexample.com website.

51
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.770
And there she's got a whole
bunch of different ways you can

52
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.550
work through browser compatibility
issues but still work with grid.

53
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.840
And that's probably your best way, and
see what she's saying about that lately.

54
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
repeat that resource?

55
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep.
gridbyexample.com.

56
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.900
I'm gonna go ahead and
pull it up here gridbyexample.com.

57
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.620
Again this is Rachel Andrews resource.

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.070
She talks a lot here about grid,
grid patterns, a lot of code.

59
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.580
She's got videos.

60
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.920
Over here in the resources
I think these are some

61
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.790
of her latest blog posts here and here
we go, supporting browsers without grid.

62
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.227
So here's an article about how
you might go about doing that.

63
00:03:27.643 --> 00:03:33.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Fabulous, other questions?

64
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.060
Any questions online, yeah?

65
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It was actually a question
online that I would like to hear

66
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.920
the answer for it was back with Flexbox.

67
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.656
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

68
00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:49.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: This person used margin to
space rather than justify content and said

69
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.730
that their flex basis values are the same
and is their preferred option between.

70
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm so glad you
asked that question, person online.

71
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.510
Thank you so much.

72
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.900
We're going to talk
a lot about that today.

73
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.910
And I have used margin in
my Flexbox in the past.

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.334
If you watch the previous
course from two years ago two,

75
00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:11.990
yeah, two years ago,
I use a lot of margin.

76
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.980
I'm big into doing it this way now because
again, Flexbox is all about being flexible

77
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.460
and when you specify your
margin in a percent like that,

78
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.530
you've actually specified that that
is essentially an absolute value.

79
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.932
Even though you may be using a percent
that is a relative unit of measure,

80
00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:32.880
two percent is always going to
be two percent with a margin.

81
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.920
It's never two point one
it's never one point nine.

82
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.780
With this type of methodology here using
justify content with space between

83
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.880
that is going to allow that space
to shift just a little bit.

84
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.060
And that may be helpful in
lining up your web page.

85
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.010
And we're gonna see this in action
when we get to chapter four.

86
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.970
That's where the good stuff starts.
