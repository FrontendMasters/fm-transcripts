1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
we are totally missing accessibility here.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.690
And it's so much easier to
put the accessibility in now,

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.730
rather than add it after the fact and
try to retrofit your site.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.116
Because it literally takes three minutes.

5
00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:15.718
So let's just go ahead and spend the three
minutes putting this back in place.

6
00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.016
So we're going to go on ahead and

7
00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:22.987
start back on up here at,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The,

8
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:26.319
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Find my code again,

9
00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.680
here we are, main menu,
main toggle, right here.

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.760
Okay, so we can give this an aria-label.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.934
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is aria, anyone?

12
00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:42.039
Something a soprano sings?

13
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.460
What is an aria?

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.825
These are screen reader directions here,
okay, so

15
00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:49.813
just think of it as
screen reader directions.

16
00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:54.502
And so what we're gonna tell this
thing to do is open main menu,

17
00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:57.425
because that's what this is gonna do.

18
00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:59.623
When you click this,
it's gonna open the main menu.

19
00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.767
By using this as a generic aria label,

20
00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:06.066
the screen reader will know that you can
click on this to get to the main menu.

21
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.636
Okay, let's also add here, well,
it's great to have these icons or

22
00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:15.681
your SVGs or whatever it is you wanna use
here to put in your hamburger button.

23
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:21.630
It's also nice to have words like,
main menu, or something to that effect.

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.440
And so one way we can do that is
by putting in another span tag.

25
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.935
And we're gonna make this a screen reader
only item, so span class = "sr-only".

26
00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.564
You might be familiar with this type
of class from working with Bootstrap.

27
00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.892
The concept here is that,
when we write the class for this,

28
00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:45.352
it will make sure that this text is not
gonna be seen regularly on the screen, but

29
00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:47.303
it will be read by a screen reader.

30
00:01:47.303 --> 00:01:52.544
And so let's go ahead and
add that, open main menu.

31
00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.501
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not recommended
to use both at the same time.

32
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:58.602
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
now I'm gonna use both.

33
00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:00.636
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it'll read it twice.

34
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:02.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
then it'll read it twice,

35
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.260
so choose one of those two, okay,
either the aria or the screen reader only.

36
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.575
And then, let's see,
down here on my backdrop, here it is.

37
00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:21.630
I've also been told that this
is potentially duplicative,

38
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.723
also, tabindex = "-1".

39
00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:29.926
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This can potentially
be the same thing twice,

40
00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:32.128
because you're using the hidden attribute.

41
00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:34.523
You may not be familiar with
the hidden attribute, but

42
00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:38.440
it does exactly what you think it does, it
hides this tag pretty much from everybody.

43
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.595
Okay, and tabindex -1 means that people
won't be able to tab onto this if they're

44
00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.535
tabbing through the links here
with their screen readers.

45
00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:50.904
Okay, what have I missed,
I missed the nav tag.

46
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:56.374
Up here on the nav tag,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our ID of main-menu,

47
00:02:56.374 --> 00:03:00.416
we've got our class of main-menu,
we can also put in an aria label here.

48
00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:02.358
I thought this was duplicative also.

49
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:14.952
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: aria-label,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Main menu.

50
00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:19.353
Because by nature, this is a nav tag,
I thought that might be enough,

51
00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:21.096
do you know for sure, Amy?

52
00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right,
if you have more than one nav element,

53
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.460
you should have an aria-label if you
don't have a heading to call it out.

54
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.556
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if we had multiple nav tags here,

55
00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:35.773
then you would probably wanna
include this aria-label.

56
00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:39.021
But in fact, on this page,
we don't, but I'll go ahead and

57
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:43.162
put it in anyway cuz maybe you guys are
gonna copy this and use it in other code,

58
00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:45.095
so maybe you will want to keep that.

59
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.816
And then likewise for our close button,

60
00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:53.965
we should add to this a span
class of screen reader only.

61
00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.601
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
this would be close main menu.

62
00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:07.525
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so there we go,
a few extra accessibility

63
00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:11.910
things that we can add on
our Font Awesome icons.

64
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.213
We can also add to this, aria-hidden,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: = "true",

65
00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.042
did I put that on the other one?

66
00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:28.994
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No I didn't,
so we can add that here too,

67
00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:35.158
aria-hidden,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: = "true",

68
00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:40.249
okay, so
just hiding those Font Awesome icons.

69
00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:45.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And you're right,
when you have the hidden attribute,

70
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.984
I mean, you shouldn't mess
with tab index period, but

71
00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:50.716
with the hidden attribute, you don't need-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You don't

72
00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:51.341
need the tab index.

73
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.031
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The tab index.

74
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:55.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, yeah,
it's kind of a belts and suspenders.

75
00:04:57.855 --> 00:05:03.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so there's our HTML,
is everyone clear on what this is?

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.529
If you didn't keep up with
all the typing and so

77
00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.787
forth, it is available to you in
the ending state folder for chapter two.

78
00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:14.202
Okay, so we've gone ahead and
we've put in all of our HTML here.

79
00:05:14.202 --> 00:05:17.753
In the real world, if I didn't already
have my CSS written, I may be jumping back

80
00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:20.800
and forth a little bit to add some
classes and so forth as I go.

81
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.650
But for the moment,
we're basically done with the HTML.

82
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.746
So if you save that and
drop it in a browser real quick,

83
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.398
you will see what this looks like.

84
00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:36.999
And so you should see your Font Awesome
icon up here, there it is,

85
00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.441
there are the bars,
there's our close button.

86
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:43.679
So far so good,
that's the best HTML can do.

87
00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:47.478
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Awesome HTML.
