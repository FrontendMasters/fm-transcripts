&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is the you
try it portion of the exercise.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.867
So I have given you the way
I'd like the tables to look.

3
00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:08.969
And again,
they're not projecting very well,

4
00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.772
be sure you take a look
at it in your files.

5
00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:14.730
This is the way it should look
at extra large sizes, okay?

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.104
So we have some footnotes over
here in a column on the side.

7
00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:21.910
Hint hint, maybe the inside
layout will work well here, okay?

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.930
And then as we go down to the larger,

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.984
notice that I'm breaking this
a little bit sooner, okay?

10
00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:34.046
And then we have this lovely scroll bar
that shows up down here at the bottom,

11
00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:35.962
remember how we put that in, okay?

12
00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:40.905
When we go down to medium, then it
is gonna stack on top of each other,

13
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.480
next to the bar with the footnotes.

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.904
And then finally,
when we go down to small,

15
00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:51.262
then everything stacks, okay?

16
00:00:51.262 --> 00:00:56.428
So now, I had some pro-pointers here for
you in the instructions.

17
00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:59.140
So I wanna be sure to go
through those with you also.

18
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.362
So first of all, remember,

19
00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:06.744
the first hint is there's a page
layout and there's a table layout.

20
00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:09.528
Both of those are responsive, okay?

21
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.688
So the trick is to combine your page
layout with your table layout together so

22
00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:18.320
that everything works together, it'll
work correctly on the page, makes sense?

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.899
Okay, so that's first of all.

24
00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.889
Second of all, you may need to override
some of the inside page layouts that you

25
00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.227
already did for the book.

26
00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:29.877
You may need to override some of those in
order to make this work for your table,

27
00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:30.733
makes sense?

28
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.599
Okay, so
my suggested approach is as follows.

29
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.606
So first of all, determine where the right
column can be next to the table and

30
00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:39.680
where it needs to move under the table.

31
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.044
Okay, so style that first.

32
00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:46.986
Then make the table stretch fully across
the page as soon as you start to wrap

33
00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:48.878
that aside under the table.

34
00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:52.318
Because what you'll find is that
the table will stretch only so far,

35
00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:56.132
it won't stretch fully across the page,
you'll see it when you get there.

36
00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:58.420
You wanna make sure that table
stretches all the way across.

37
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.806
And then when the table no longer
stretches across the page, then

38
00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:08.081
disassemble it the way I just showed you
how to do it, and turn it into a report.
