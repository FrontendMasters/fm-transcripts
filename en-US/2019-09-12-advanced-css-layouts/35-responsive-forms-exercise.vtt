00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.440
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
we have one final exercise here and

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.920
that is we're moving on to forms.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.397
Okay, and so
here we have forms at two dimensions.

4
00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:15.350
This is the form that we're going to have
stacked on top of each other like this.

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.350
This is the form at extra large,
large, and medium dimensions,

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.150
it's gonna be some layout like this, okay?

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.026
So in other words,
we have a column mover on the side.

8
00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:27.497
Again, it's very similar
to our inside page layout.

9
00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:29.782
We have a form mover
here on the other side.

10
00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:35.245
And where you are starting

11
00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:42.698
is actually the form's all coded.

12
00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:44.344
The form's all coded here,

13
00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:48.852
but we've done what people often do
these days when laying out forms.

14
00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:50.472
They lay them out basically for mobile.

15
00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:53.684
So we have your name on top of the label,
right?

16
00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:57.532
Because if it gets really,
really difficult to put your name and

17
00:00:57.532 --> 00:01:01.152
then the blank right next to it and have
everything line up so nicely, doesn't it?

18
00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:05.052
Yeah, it gets to be a real
pain in the neck, okay?

19
00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:10.910
So this is all beautifully lined
up here for your mobile layout.

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.450
What you are going to do is

21
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.430
apply everything that you've
learned today to this form, okay?

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.540
So you're gonna have to go through here.

23
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.670
You're gonna have to read this code.

24
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.134
And you're gonna have to think about
how you can go back to that cool layout

25
00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:29.316
formula that we came up with and
maybe apply it here.

26
00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:33.768
So what you see on this page,
to make the forms, so

27
00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:38.234
you have your label next
to your form link, okay?

28
00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:42.511
So how might you think about
this particular problem?

29
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:47.282
What is one really key thing to think
about when you start putting things

30
00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:48.565
on rows like that?

31
00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:55.277
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I've
been saying it all day,

32
00:01:55.277 --> 00:02:00.220
where is the flex container,
where is the flex item?

33
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.390
Where are the parents,
where are the children, right, okay?

34
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.940
So for example, here,

35
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.270
if we're looking at your name and
you want that on one side, right?

36
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.696
And you want the field that goes with it,
this input type with the ID of name,

37
00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:18.781
you want it going on the other side.

38
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:21.149
Those are gonna be what?

39
00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.321
Flex containers or flex items?

40
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:24.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Flex items.

41
00:02:24.174 --> 00:02:25.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex items, right?

42
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.864
Okay, so somehow we have to
find a container for that.

43
00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:32.859
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense?

44
00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.637
So we may need to change
this HTML a little bit,

45
00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:37.996
to put these things next to each other.

46
00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:41.088
The other thing you might wanna
think about is as you start looking

47
00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:43.688
down here where we have a whole
bunch of radio buttons.

48
00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:48.959
We want the radio button right near
whatever it is that actually labels it,

49
00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.220
yeah, okay?

50
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.700
So how are we gonna set that up?

51
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.432
It's a whole group of things together that
may actually wind up being a flex item.

52
00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:01.440
Hint, hint, hint, hint, okay?

53
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.000
So you may have to think about how you're
gonna change around your HTML here first

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.430
to apply to the form layout.
