00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm so glad you're
here today, my name is Jen Kramer.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.680
I am a lecturer at
Harvard University's Extension School,

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.364
where I teach at least five classes
a year on HTML, CSS, and user experience.

4
00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:15.772
And I am here today at Frontend Masters
to lead you in this part two,

5
00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:18.550
essentially, of my first course.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.470
My first course had to do with grids and

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.750
flex box, working on those
layouts from the very ground.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.480
And now we're going to build
on top of that in this class,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.550
which is called advanced CSS layouts.

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.350
So what we're going to be covering
today includes a whole bunch of stuff.

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.574
So first of all, we're gonna start
off with a quick review exercise I'll

12
00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:37.978
tell you about in just a second.

13
00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:43.303
Second, we're gonna go into making
a hamburger button with CSS only,

14
00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:45.335
pretty cool trick.

15
00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:50.419
Then in our third chapter,
we're going to go into

16
00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:56.241
a brief introduction to CSS
custom properties and calc.

17
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:58.868
I'm gonna talk to you about that
via some PowerPoint slides,

18
00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.674
just show you what's going on.

19
00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:03.570
Then we're going to build
a simple grid system

20
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.962
working with custom properties in calc.

21
00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:10.730
Then we're gonna apply that to some real
pages, a home page and an inside page.

22
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.545
Then we're going to go into
a bit about typography.

23
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:16.786
First of all, we're gonna talk about
a type scale, what is a type scale,

24
00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:18.475
how can it help you with your designs?

25
00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:22.408
And we're gonna talk about how we can put
that type scale on steroids using custome

26
00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:26.170
properties in calc, applying that to
the designs that we're working on, and

27
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.625
then we're going to talk
about responses tables.

28
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.999
We're gonna talk about responses
tables not only in the traditional

29
00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.197
Bootstrap sense of the word,
with the little scrolly bar thing,

30
00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:39.650
but also how we can disassemble tables and
make them truly usable on a mobile device.

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.402
And of course,
accessibility is a part of that,

32
00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:43.600
we'll be including that along the way.

33
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.460
And then finally,
if there's any juice left for anyone,

34
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.910
we'll talk about responsive forms.

35
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.780
How can we take all of the principles
that we've learned during the day and

36
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.320
apply them to some kind of form layout?

37
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.107
So that is the broad overview of
the stuff we're gonna cover today.

38
00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:02.067
It's a lot, in my Harvard class,
I would cover this stuff over a period of

39
00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:06.313
about three to four weeks,
[LAUGH] we're gonna do it in one day.

40
00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:11.175
First of all, there is a GitHub repository
available that you should go on ahead and

41
00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:15.845
download the files for this, or hook it
up however you normally do with GitHub.

42
00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:19.126
So if you go to github.com/jen4web,

43
00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:24.150
that's the number four, Jen4Web,
this is my GitHub repo.

44
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.299
Right here on the front,
I've pinned the one for today,

45
00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.940
which is the one that
says advanced CSS layout.

46
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.828
If you are not a GitHub person, you can
simply go on into that list of files,

47
00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:38.940
and the button that says clone or
download, just go on ahead and

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.512
download the zip file.

49
00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:43.280
Put that on your desktop and
you can work with the files from there.

50
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.870
If you're GitHub literate, go on ahead and
do your GitHub thing and and

51
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.299
fork and all the rest of that stuff.

52
00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.940
Okay, you'll notice that all of
these files are set up with numbers.

53
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.545
I think of these as chapters of a book,

54
00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.710
those are all the topics that I
just rattled off where you there.

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.870
So as we go through, I'll tell you what
chapter we're on and each of the topics.

56
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.794
Inside each of those folders, you'll
typically find a beginning folder, so

57
00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.772
that's the starting state of
whatever we're working on.

58
00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:14.437
If you happen to get behind or
confused or you break something,

59
00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:18.160
you're not sure what's going on, there's
always those starting files that we'll be

60
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.680
working with in that particular chapter.

61
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.628
And there's also a finished state
where we're gonna leave it, so

62
00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:25.747
you'll know exactly what
it should look like.

63
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.038
Again, if you break
something along the way,

64
00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:30.229
you at least have some
code you can refer to.

65
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.063
In all of the folders for sure,
there is an instructions document

66
00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:38.400
that will describe exactly what we're
going to be doing in that chapter.
