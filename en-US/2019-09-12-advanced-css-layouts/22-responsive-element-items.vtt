1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Did you
get the layout done?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.270
Maybe the devs weren't going
in the right direction yet?

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.370
We're getting there.

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.920
One thing at a time.

5
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.160
So, what did you wind up doing?

6
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.370
Anybody wanna describe what they did?

7
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.790
You change something to 8?

8
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The width to 8.

9
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You change the width to 8?

10
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, what did you do?

11
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I changed the width to 11
and then just moved up the first and main.

12
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.999
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I don't have to repeat it

13
00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.192
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Changed it to 11,

14
00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.460
how did you get 11?

15
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.337
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 5 and 6.

16
00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.823
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 5 and 6, right, 5 and 6,

17
00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:33.200
from the top,
we know the 11 column layout.

18
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.997
Let's move the other two down and
make those 11 columns wide, right?

19
00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:39.400
So, that's what I have here.

20
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.970
And then you're gonna have to
rearrange some of your code again.

21
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.230
So, here, then main will become

22
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.830
a columns of 11, right?

23
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.850
First and main are actually the same here.

24
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.110
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we'll just pull those on up, okay?

25
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.080
Devs, devs is now gonna be what?

26
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.192
I will just copy these up.

27
00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:18.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
devs is going to be 11, right?

28
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.530
And resources is going to be 11 also.

29
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.610
And do I have them in the right order here
or do I need to rechange that, right?

30
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.870
I think they swapped again, didn't they?

31
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.850
Okay, so we're back to 3 and 4 here.

32
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.640
Okay, cool.

33
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.932
So, now at this point,

34
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:40.910
then you should have a fully
working layout here, all right?

35
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.160
So we go from that, to this, to that.

36
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.790
We've got stuff stacked up underneath,
which is great, okay?

37
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.960
And then, finally, we'll go to that.

38
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.140
Okay, so somebody had a question
online about screen readers.

39
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.800
And the answer is we don't know,
basically.

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.950
This technology is so new,
I would imagine most screen readers

41
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.820
actually haven't even
caught up with it yet.

42
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.880
So, as always, test with the screen
readers to see what's gonna happen.

43
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.470
But this is such a powerful technique,
they're gonna have to catch up, right?

44
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.540
They're totally gonna have to catch up.

45
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.640
Okay, so the next thing we need to deal
with then are these developers, yeah?

46
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.120
Okay, so let's deal with these developers.

47
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.610
So the developers need to go somehow.

48
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.290
First of all, they need to go horizontal,

49
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.980
right when we get we get
to this dimension here.

50
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.480
Those developers need to go
horizontally across the page, right?

51
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.780
And then they pretty much need to stay
that way for at least a little while.

52
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.688
At some point they go to two columns,
as I recall.

53
00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:00.211
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, does anyone have any
ideas of how we might go about making

54
00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:00.730
that work?

55
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.830
There.

56
00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:06.187
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Might be flex direction.

57
00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:09.033
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, yep, flex direction.

58
00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:13.233
So we could go write out a whole thing
here, we could turn them into flex box,

59
00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:16.440
right, put them on a row, etc,, etc.

60
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.197
Could we actually use the code we
already wrote to format our developers?

61
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:27.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure, why not.

62
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.240
Let's use the code we already
wrote to format our developers.

63
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.090
How would that look?

64
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.200
Devs ul, right?

65
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.190
If we take a look at our HTML here,
these are in figure captions, and

66
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.260
so forth, or go up a little further.

67
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.470
These are list items, right?

68
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.950
We have a ul and an li for
each one of those.

69
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.261
And then inside of them is
the whole figure, right?

70
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:57.110
So, what’s gonna be our flex container?

71
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.218
The ul, what’s gonna be our flex item?

72
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.080
The li, right?

73
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.590
My gosh, we can just supply
what we already have, can't we?

74
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.617
So, here what we just need to do is say,
display, flex, okay?

75
00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:18.668
Flex-flow row wrap, justify-content,

76
00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:23.460
space-between, okay?

77
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.814
And if we take a look at
our mobile mockup here,

78
00:04:27.814 --> 00:04:32.630
you see that they start
off in two columns, right?

79
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.657
So let's set our columns to 2.

80
00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:40.626
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

81
00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.967
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then for our logic,

82
00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:54.462
all we have to do here is say,
section, what, devs li.

83
00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:56.259
Done.

84
00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.232
[SOUND] Isn't that amazing?

85
00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:08.272
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
then probably in addition to that,

86
00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:11.594
let's initialize our variables for
the devs.

87
00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:18.112
So, devs li,
we'll have a width of 1, correct?

88
00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because we wanna
have two next to each other, right?

89
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.558
So the width is 1, the columns are 2, we
wind up with two boxes next to each other,

90
00:05:30.558 --> 00:05:33.021
makes sense, okay?

91
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.537
So, if we go on ahead and
save that, and we scrunch

92
00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:43.560
ourselves down to mobile here and
refresh the page.

93
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.160
And we take a look.

94
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.200
Lo and behold,
there's our developers, yeah?

95
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.080
Nice.

96
00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.100
All right, so if we scrunch,
those developers are down.

97
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.690
That doesn't look so
bad there on mobile, does it?

98
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.420
Not too bad, okay.

99
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.090
So, when we get bigger,
in our various media queries,

100
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.530
now we need to go through and
change some values right?

101
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.500
Is it just at the last one?

102
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.070
Let's see here.

103
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.050
So starting at medium,
we actually need to put them all in a row.

104
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.935
So, how are we going to do that then
when we get to our next media query?

105
00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:29.643
How are we going to put all of these
devs in a row, all going across,

106
00:06:29.643 --> 00:06:30.700
just like that?

107
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.350
What are we gonna do?

108
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.780
First of all, how many columns do we have?

109
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.380
Five columns.

110
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.730
Each item is one column wide, right?

111
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.958
Okay, so let's go on ahead and do that.

112
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:51.244
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Scroll on down here
to your 740 pixel media query.

113
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.950
So, this is gonna be devs ul, right?

114
00:06:57.185 --> 00:06:58.016
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And our columns.

115
00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:02.188
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Become 5, okay?

116
00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:08.657
So,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's

117
00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:09.572
see what that's looking like.

118
00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.011
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So there's our devs,
two columns of them,

119
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:14.826
until we hit our media query.

120
00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:16.760
There we go.

121
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.710
There they are, all five of them.

122
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.885
And then we can just
sorta make them bigger.

123
00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:28.040
And actually they wind up going back to

124
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.390
one on top of each other here because
there's just no room for them, right?

125
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.067
But for completely sake we can go
ahead and put in the revised value for

126
00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:40.173
columns, which would be what?

127
00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:46.987
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What would that be here for
1200 pixels?

128
00:07:46.987 --> 00:07:48.147
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One.

129
00:07:48.147 --> 00:07:49.163
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One column, right?

130
00:07:49.163 --> 00:07:52.768
Width is 1.

131
00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:57.883
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not meant
to be columns [COUGH].

132
00:07:57.883 --> 00:07:59.797
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,
column, sorry, columns.

133
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.582
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So yeah, there we go.

134
00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:14.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, now,
one other question for you.

135
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.529
Are you happy with the gap
here between the developers?

136
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.427
Let's just make sure that
we're happy with that gap.

137
00:08:30.925 --> 00:08:32.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
they get down to looking like that.

138
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.552
Are you happy with that?

139
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What if we wanted
a different gap for the developers?

140
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.749
What are we gonna do?

141
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone
have any suggestions?

142
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is controlling
the width of my gap right now?

143
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We could either
restate the gap property or

144
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.735
change the decimal multiplier
into its own variable.

145
00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:01.717
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could change this
0.3% into its own variable, couldn't we?

146
00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:05.210
And then we just need to change
the gap wherever we go, right?

147
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.700
That little constant multiplier number,
right?

148
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.310
So let's just go ahead and do that.

149
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.920
So, I'm gonna add to
this then a gap constant,

150
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.946
because that's basically what it is right,
of 0.3%.

151
00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:28.533
Okay, and then all I have to do now
is swap out the hardcoded 0.3% here,

152
00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:29.876
and just say var.

153
00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:34.066
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Gap constant.

154
00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:41.611
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so that shoild
do exactly the same thing as what I

155
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.910
had before.

156
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.570
Now, for my developers,
I can just change that, right?

157
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.827
So if I want a little bit
of a fatter gap here,

158
00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:54.957
I could just say gap constant is,
let's say, 3%.

159
00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:00.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet,
now it's totally flexible.

160
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.740
You can lay out anything using
exactly the same logic anywhere you

161
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.170
wanna go on your web page.

162
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.366
So, now we've laid out the whole
logic of the whole web page,

163
00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:18.933
we've laid out the developer potion of it,
