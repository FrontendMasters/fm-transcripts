WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We got 16
columns to work with here.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.490
And somehow, we're gonna have to go to
through through these various layouts.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.100
So let's start with this one here.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.660
We have two columns next to each other and
then underneath,

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.370
we're going to have, basically,
the other two columns, right?

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.965
Let's start by thinking about
this particular problem.

7
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:30.610
And of course, we have to write out what
we're doing for our mobile layout as well.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.371
So here we go for our mobile layout.

9
00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.861
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we
look at our HTML here,

10
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.680
scroll on down to where
the content starts.

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.066
We have a main, right?

12
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
here's the children, yeah?

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.880
So I've just used VS code here to
hide what was inside of all of

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.920
these simplifies things, right?

15
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.040
So main is here, and
we have four children.

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.570
Does that look like a pattern, yeah.

17
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.600
So main is gonna be our parent.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.320
All the sections are gonna
be our children.

19
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.370
Main is considered to be the flex,
is gonna be our flex container.

20
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.859
And then the sections are gonna
be our flex items right?

21
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.560
So the selector then is not gonna be this,
right?

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.830
For all of these stuff,
what is this selector going to be?

23
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.409
Could we use one selector that
would grab all of those items?

24
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Section.

25
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about section?

26
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.360
Yeah, section, okay?

27
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.120
So that's gonna be our code here for
section.

28
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.440
We have some tweaks to make,
but one thing at a time, okay?

29
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.830
And then what's the other
important part here going to be?

30
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.210
Main, right?

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.400
So main ones are being our parents, so

32
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.430
here, what kind of things
do I need to declare here?

33
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex flow.

34
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, display flex.

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.776
We need to do our flex flow,
row wrap, okay.

36
00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.434
And we need to do our justify content.

37
00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:22.887
Space between, okay.

38
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:32.718
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And columns is what?

39
00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.517
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 12,16.

40
00:02:34.517 --> 00:02:35.855
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 16, right?

41
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.152
Because that's what our designer told us.

42
00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:39.705
Our columns are 16.

43
00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:44.600
And so
how wide is it at mobile dimensions?

44
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.043
How wide is each one of our columns?

45
00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:49.261
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 16.

46
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 16 columns, correct.

47
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.200
Okay, so
let's change our width here to 16.

48
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.555
Gosh, we're done.

49
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:04.253
[LAUGH] Okay,
that's pretty much it, right?

50
00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:07.837
By the way,
I'll throw in something else here, for

51
00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:13.215
those of you who are bothered by passing
invariables without a default value,

52
00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.900
that is supported here in CSS,
so you can add to this.

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.660
Just simply put a comma and
a default value, so

54
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.870
if there is no value that's passed in and
we'll use that as the default.

55
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.720
So it's just comma and
then whatever you want.

56
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.967
Okay, so I've chosen 0 and 16.

57
00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.230
You can choose whatever you want.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.111
Likewise here for gap,
we can say, columns, comma.

59
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:43.066
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 16, and
the variable is with comma 0.

60
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.081
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

61
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.627
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool, that's all set.

62
00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:52.819
We've done the mobile layout and in fact,

63
00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.998
if you save that layout.css and
you view your webpage.

64
00:04:00.017 --> 00:04:03.346
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Shockingly, it will look
exactly the same as it did before, yay.

65
00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:06.367
[LAUGH] Okay, aren't you all happy?

66
00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:09.872
Of course these are floating,
cuz this is a wide screen now so

67
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:13.950
you'll need to shrink it down so
that those images aren't floating.

68
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.540
Okay, good.

69
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.920
So we got it working for that dimension.

70
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.760
Oddly, the next dimension I want to work
on is going to be the 1200 pixel 1 with

71
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.040
the 4 columns next to each other.

72
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.910
I just think, conceptually, it'll be
easier for you to look at that first and

73
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.810
sort of work backwards and we may wind
up having to refactor a little bit.

74
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.560
So these media queries cascade correctly.

75
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.840
But I think, conceptually,
it'd be easier to start with this.

76
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.580
So what's gonna happen when
we get here to 1200 pixels?

77
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.340
Let's remind ourselves
what this looks like.

78
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.880
So we've got these four columns, right?

79
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.280
How wide is each one of those
columns in columns as your unit?

80
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.700
So let's just make up some numbers, right.

81
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.900
Which one is the skinny one?

82
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Designers or the developer.

83
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, those developers.

84
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.230
That's kind of a skinny one.

85
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.450
What's our fattest one?

86
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Ranger School.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The number two here, yeah.

87
00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:17.250
One is slightly narrower,
say the number two, okay?

88
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.630
And number four is maybe slightly wider
than the developer's number three, right?

89
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.558
So we need to come up with a bunch
of numbers that add to 16.

90
00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:27.446
And honestly,

91
00:05:27.446 --> 00:05:32.260
we could probably ask our designer how
many columns wide they made each of these.

92
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.570
But my designer didn't tell me.

93
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.440
So I'm gonna guess.

94
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.640
And we can guess with some
reasonable numbers here, right?

95
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.294
So first of all let's just establish
that we have first, right.

96
00:05:44.294 --> 00:05:47.274
We just gonna use the ids of these
sections cuz they are there,

97
00:05:47.274 --> 00:05:48.263
and they are handy.

98
00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.882
We have main.

99
00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:52.840
We have devs.

100
00:05:56.558 --> 00:05:59.604
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we have resources, right?

101
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.869
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There are four parts.

102
00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:15.121
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
if we take a look at our order here,

103
00:06:15.121 --> 00:06:17.665
we have first main devs and resources.

104
00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:20.475
So they are all essentially in
the order that we want already.

105
00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:22.215
The source order is
the order that we want.

106
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.435
So we don't need to do any reordering.

107
00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:28.915
So let's just come up with a description
of what it is we're gonna do here.

108
00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:33.180
So how wide is first gonna be?

109
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.040
How wide is main gonna be?

110
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.760
How wide is debs gonna be?

111
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.460
And how wide is resources gonna be, okay.

112
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.120
So what I said first is gonna be five

113
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.551
main is going to be six
Deb's is gonna be two.

114
00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:04.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
resources is gonna be three.

115
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.460
And if you add that, 5 and 6 and
2 and 3, you get 16, right?

116
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.850
Okay, so, let's go ahead and
what do we need to declare here?

117
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.190
For first, we need to do what?

118
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The width property.

119
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.239
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, the width variable.

120
00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:25.277
And what's that width gonna be?

121
00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:26.585
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 5.

122
00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:31.959
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 5, awesome, and then all
we have to do is just copy that, yeah.

123
00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:36.607
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
what's it gonna be for me?

124
00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:37.749
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 6.

125
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:42.756
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 6,
what's it gonna be for devs?

126
00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:45.509
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 2.

127
00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:48.594
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2,
what's it gonna be for resources?

128
00:07:48.594 --> 00:07:51.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 3.

129
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.522
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 3, awesome.

130
00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:56.484
Go ahead and save that.

131
00:07:59.303 --> 00:08:01.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Take
a look at your webpage.

132
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.980
Let's refresh it.

133
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.970
Still works at mobile.

134
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.488
Not sure what we're gonna
get here in between.

135
00:08:06.488 --> 00:08:08.375
Well, whole lot or nothing.

136
00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:09.389
Look at that.

137
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:21.422
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's

138
00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:22.716
easier than Bootstrap, isn't it?

139
00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:26.341
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
much easier than Bootstrap.

140
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:31.430
All that extra markup and
all the rest of it, look at what we did.

141
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.075
I'm finally seeing some
smiles in this classroom.

142
00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:34.697
It's great to see.

143
00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:38.663
Okay, now, what do you think about
the gap in between these rows?

144
00:08:38.663 --> 00:08:39.593
Are you happy with that?

145
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:43.851
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a little hefty.

146
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:45.381
Maybe it's a little hefty.

147
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.688
But again, we just copied over
what we started with, right?

148
00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:50.429
So if we wanna tweak it, what can we do?

149
00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:01.137
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is the thing we
need to tweak if we want to tweak it?

150
00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:02.855
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Gap.

151
00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:03.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The gap, right?

152
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.057
The gap is the issue.

153
00:09:05.057 --> 00:09:10.460
We multiplied it by 1%.

154
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.540
Maybe we should drop
that value a little bit?

155
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.690
What if we did something like 0.3%.

156
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.949
Because I've never done this before and
I'm randomly guessing 0.3%.

157
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:25.065
Okay, so you can make that
constant whatever you want, right?

158
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.656
I'm gonna make it 0.3% this time.

159
00:09:27.656 --> 00:09:31.590
Now let's go on ahead and just save
that and go on back and take a look.

160
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.120
That's a little nicer.

161
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.620
What do you think?
