1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The first thing that
I'm gonna talk about is CSS Calc().

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.400
What is it exactly,
anyone wanna define Calc?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A method for
calculating values in CSS.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a way to do
math in CSS, directly in CSS, okay?

5
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.050
That's basically it.

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.400
And these are the things that you can do.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.360
Addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.500
In other words, no exponents,
I actually have an example for

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.690
you later where exponents would have
been really, really helpful, okay?

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.550
[LAUGH] But addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and

11
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.210
division are what we
have to work with here.

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.040
And you can do the length, frequency,
angle, number, time, integer, okay?

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.750
Remember that time, or
frequency, and so forth,

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.980
those are generally
associated with animation.

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.880
Some of the other things like length,
or numbers, and integers, and so forth,

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.070
those are associated with all
kinds of different CSS properties.

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.900
And the way Calc is gonna look
is it's something like this.

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.820
So you're going to display your property,
and then you'll say the word calc, and

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.050
then you'll do whatever math
you want to do inside of that.

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.945
Anyone want to make a comment
on that particular line of code?

21
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.600
A 100% minus 80 pixels.

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.110
Anyone want to say anything about that?

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.750
Yes, David?

24
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Units are different, and

25
00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:14.418
you're gonna struggle to
resolve that in the browser.

26
00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:15.474
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Units are different and

27
00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.597
we're gonna struggle to resolve
that to the browser, anyone agree?

28
00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:22.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Now,
I thought that was the cool part about it.

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.591
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly, that is the cool
part about it because Sass will [SOUND],

30
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:30.338
Sass does not like that kind of thing.

31
00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:34.233
You have to have the same kinds of
units when you do math with Sass, but

32
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:37.390
with CSS Calc,
It is very happy to do that math for you.

33
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.120
It will in fact do that now,
and it will not blow up, okay?

34
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.630
So let's talk about compatibility,
I took this screenshot on August 9th.

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.128
So this is what compatibility
looks like at this point in time,

36
00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:54.692
usually when we talk about
compatibility we really mean IE, and

37
00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:59.321
that's tend to be true, it's a little bit
buggy in IE like all the good things are.

38
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:00.993
[LAUGH] Okay?

39
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:07.310
But 96% support globally at this point
in time, according to can I use, okay?

40
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.530
So anyone wanna think about what are some
of the big advantages that we can

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.070
work with Calc over Sass.

42
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.370
This one, okay?

43
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.120
So again, you can do weird math.

44
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.990
Remember that if you
do have to support IE,

45
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.810
you can always put in
something right before it.

46
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.130
IE willl actually render what
equals 90% in this particular case,

47
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.060
it would look at width of this Calc thing,
and

48
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.900
it would just, I don't know what that is,
and ignore it and move on, right?

49
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.800
If we do have people here who
still need to support IE, so

50
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.460
that's one way that you
can go about doing that.

51
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.730
This is also a very nice way
to document your math, okay?

52
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.909
Where did you get that
random looking number?

53
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.650
[LAUGH] How often have you said that
as you were looking at something?

54
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.800
Why did we say this
weird string of numbers?

55
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.030
Yes?

56
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.270
Okay, so
this is a nice way that you can do that.

57
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.625
There's more reading here at
CSS-Tricks as always great resource,

58
00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.080
so we'll talk to you
a little bit about that.

59
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.249
So here's one of the advantages.

60
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.620
Again, from that same article
in this particular example,

61
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.220
we're floating two things
next to each other, okay?

62
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.820
Back in the old days, our heads used to
explode because one was 40, one was 60.

63
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.610
We of course, wanna gap in between
the things, we put in the gap,

64
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.310
and then it would wrap onto the next line.

65
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.710
Cuz it actually adds up
to be more than a 100%,

66
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.230
once you put the gap in place, right?

67
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.750
Okay, so now we can just simply say 40 and
then 60 minus 1em.

68
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.970
Isn't that great?

69
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.710
And other things float next to each other.

70
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.050
Wow, that already makes your life easier,
yeah?

71
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.420
Here's documentation of weird numbers,
I don't know why you build a seven column

72
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.390
grid system, but maybe you'd want to,
and where did you get 14.2587%?

73
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.450
Designer?

74
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.830
What were you thinking?

75
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.550
Well, Designer did all this math right and
the math looks like this, really easy.

76
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.740
All we do is take 100% divided by seven,
that's one box.

77
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.280
If we want it to be twice that wide,

78
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.850
we take 100% divided by
seven multiplied by two.

79
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.960
Yeah, that's where the weird
numbers come from.

80
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.650
So now, we've documented our math really,
really nicely.

81
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.180
So that's something that
we can do with Calc.

82
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.132
There's a couple of quirky things
about Calc that you need to remember.

83
00:04:28.132 --> 00:04:30.770
And that tends to be
writing these things out.

84
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.500
What I would suggest is that
you always put a space around

85
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.100
whatever your operator is.

86
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.980
So space, plus sign, space,
whatever things you were adding together.

87
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.990
The reason why is because
remember that in CSS,

88
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.190
the slash operator can be used
in other places in CSS, okay?

89
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.310
That's one of the things
you need to remember.

90
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.020
Here, it's gonna have a hard time
determining what is a minus something and

91
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.590
what is a negative number.

92
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.130
So that's another reason
to go on ahead and

93
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.340
put in this whitespace around it, okay?

94
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.850
And you can nest Calc statements
inside of each other as well.

95
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.411
Calc inside of a Calc inside of a Calc
becomes effectively parentheses,

96
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.027
all right?

97
00:05:12.027 --> 00:05:12.820
So far so good?

98
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.940
And you can combine it with Sass.

99
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.310
So if you're doing something in Sass and
you wanna actually use Calc,

100
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.710
this is the way you'd go about
pulling in a Sass variable.

101
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.590
This is the syntax that you use,
all right?

102
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.720
So remember, Sass variables are declared
with the dollar sign, all right?

103
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.814
Here, the way we're going to render
that if we're using actually Calc.

104
00:05:32.814 --> 00:05:35.710
We're gonna put the curly
brackets around that variable and

105
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.000
a pound sign in front of it.

106
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.392
You've probably seen that syntax
before in other applications in Sass.

107
00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:46.540
It indicates the CSS take
the value of that variable, yeah?

108
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
Everybody good so far?

109
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.290
Okay, anyone remember
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally?

110
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.670
I always ask this question and people are
like, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,

111
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.540
I never heard of that.

112
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.900
It must have been an exclusive thing
to elementary schools in Virginia

113
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.610
where I grew up.

114
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.640
So Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
is the order of operations, right?

115
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.700
Do your parentheses first,
then your exponents, and

116
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.000
then multiplication, left to right,
addition and subtraction,

117
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.350
left to right,
that's how we used to remember it.

118
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.690
So when you see something wild and
crazy like that,

119
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.560
we're calculating something really weird,
remember your order of operations.

120
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.740
So multiply the things and
then add them together.

121
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.120
So basically a little bit about Calc,

122
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.800
use it anywhere to perform
your number calculations.

123
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.230
Don't forget about your whitespace.

124
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.490
You can mix and match units, that's
the big differentiator from Sass, okay?

125
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.700
You can use parentheses or
nest your calc() statements.

126
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.140
Remember your order of operations and
it's well supported by browsers in use.
