&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now,
we're going to move on to chapter six,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.670
which is the inside page layout for
this website.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.822
And in your chapter six folder,

4
00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:14.176
you will find some images that are going
to describe how this pages should look.

5
00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:18.633
So at extra large and large dimensions,
we want it to look like this.

6
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.193
In other words, we have a floated book,
we have a bunch of stuff going on.

7
00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.472
By the way,
everybody take a cool little look there.

8
00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:29.178
Look at how the text wraps around
the image around that circle.

9
00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:31.084
Isn't that amazing?

10
00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:32.398
You should be amazed.

11
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.720
That is a new cool thing
called CSS shapes.

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.493
And when we talk about the answers, I'd be
happy to show you a little bit about that,

13
00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:42.053
cuz that's pretty slick.

14
00:00:42.053 --> 00:00:46.020
So this is the way it's gonna work here
at extra-large and large dimensions.

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290
Here we are at medium dimensions.

16
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.557
And you can see that we have things
have gotten a bit skinnier here, okay?

17
00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:55.080
Columns going on down.

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.184
And then finally, here's what it should
look like at small dimensions, okay?

19
00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:04.653
Look at book dot html,
that is your starting file for this.

20
00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:07.670
You'll see that I've added to this
a page called inside dot css.

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.890
If you take a look at inside dot css,

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.720
this is just some of the styling
that has to do with that book page.

23
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.510
There's nothing here in terms of layout,
so

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.070
you don't really need to
spend any time with this.

25
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.460
The file that I would spend time
with is the layout dot css.

26
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.852
What you're gonna need to do is figure
out how to make that inside page.

27
00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.426
Go on ahead and
work through those layouts.
