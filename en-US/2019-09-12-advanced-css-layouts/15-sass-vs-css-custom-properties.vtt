00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We just want
to compare some code here.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.820
Here's what happens with SASS.

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.230
Again, I'm assuming that most
of you are familiar with this.

4
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.210
It's a pre processor.

5
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.460
There's compiling that goes on.

6
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.600
So here, we declare a SASS variable.

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.220
We can call it right
referring to its name.

8
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.570
We have to compile it in order for
that color to show up in our CSS, right?

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.190
You know this.

10
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.090
With CSS, it's a little bit different.

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.280
We can just declare our color.

12
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.332
There's no compiling involved,
we just call it.

13
00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:28.630
All right, so here is the code pen.

14
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.710
And here I'm working with SASS.

15
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.120
Is that font size big enough?

16
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.050
Can everybody see that?

17
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.930
Okay, so basically I've got an H1,

18
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.870
I've got a paragraph,
I've got an article, okay.

19
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.530
There's an article,
more paragraphs and stuff.

20
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.420
And so what I've done over here in my SASS
is I've declared my color red, right.

21
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.870
In the article, I said my text
color will be that color, yeah, and

22
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.240
shockingly, my article is red.

23
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.456
Everybody's surprised by this?

24
00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:11.881
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, what happens
now if I say my color here is color.

25
00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:17.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now all that stuff is red,
yeah?

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.460
Okay, what happens if I do this?

27
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.780
I'm gonna change my color.

28
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.200
So first of all you're a terrible
programmer, but what happens here

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.900
if I change my color value here,
what color are the paragraphs going to be?

30
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The new one
should be the new color.

31
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's say
I'm gonna make them blue.

32
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.714
So how many of you say it's still red?

33
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.690
This is a scoping question, right?

34
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.590
How many of you say, yeah,
it's totally still red.

35
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.380
How many of you say it's gonna be blue?

36
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.290
Okay, so pretty much everybody
here says it's gonna blue.

37
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:05.100
So we are gonna make it blue.

38
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.730
The paragraphs are inside of the article
so here we have a red on the article.

39
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.240
That still takes effect on the heading,
but then I read a clear my color to

40
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.020
be blue, the paragraphs are gonna be blue
even that paragraph here becomes blue,

41
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.660
because that declaration of color is
closer to the actual words, right.

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.500
This is one of those just straight
CSS inheritance kind of things and so

43
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.720
we wind up with blue colors for
a paragraph.

44
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.200
All right, remember the other
part of scoping for SASS?

45
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.370
What happens if I
re-declare my color here?

46
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.499
Let's say I make it green,
what's gonna happen now?

47
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say
the paragraph's gonna be red?

48
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.840
How many say the paragraphs
are gonna be blue?

49
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.640
How many sig paragraphs
are gonna be green?

50
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.450
Pretty much everybody say's
they're gonna be green.

51
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.110
Shockingly, they are green, okay?

52
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.490
And that's because I redeclared it
locally inside of the paragraph.

53
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.590
We need a SASS class?

54
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.930
Okay, this is all variables,
this is all scoping.

55
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.200
And that's why I'm focused on this.

56
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.490
So this is the way it
normally works in SASS, okay?

57
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.780
Let's take a quick look at this and,
with CSS variables.

58
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.283
It's the same kind of example.

59
00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:32.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody
have any questions so far?

60
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.440
That's literally all the SASS
we're gonna do today.

61
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.090
We did it, we're done.

62
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.950
Okay, so here,
I've got my route declaration,

63
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.010
right, my color is declared as red.

64
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.270
I'm calling it there in my article.

65
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.570
There it is.

66
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.030
And shockingly, my article is now red.

67
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.410
Okay, so
let's do the same thing that I did before.

68
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.994
So basically what I'm going to do now is,
let's see.

69
00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:08.423
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll put it right here.

70
00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I'm gonna redeclare my color here.

71
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.180
And I'm gonna make it,
I'm gonna make it blue.

72
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.820
What color is my article
going to be at this point?

73
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.440
How many say it's gonna be red?

74
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.430
How many say it's gonna blue?

75
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.370
Okay.

76
00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:31.472
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure enough, it's blue.

77
00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:33.873
What happens if I take this?

78
00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:37.907
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Actually, all of this.

79
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.179
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not that.

80
00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:50.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I'm gonna paste that
same declaration here into my paragraph.

81
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.130
So I'm gonna redeclare my
paragraphs as blue, okay?

82
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.594
By redefining my variable and calling
the color of my paragraph to be blue,

83
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:06.374
how many say that my paragraphs
are going to be blue?

84
00:05:10.274 --> 00:05:12.841
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say
they're going to be red?

85
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:14.840
How many say they're going to be black?

86
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.110
Okay, so if I put it here, okay.

87
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.020
Making sense, sort of?

88
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.643
What if I move this color
blue back here to article?

89
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:31.977
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's gonna happen?

90
00:05:35.094 --> 00:05:36.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Paragraph should stay red.

91
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.420
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if I move this back, all right?

92
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.290
Let me put all this up here.

93
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.320
So the root color is red.

94
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.990
Right now what we have going
on the root color is red

95
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.650
I've called the article to be read,
I've called paragraph to be read.

96
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.600
So sure enough, all the paragraphs
are read and the article is read, yeah?

97
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.200
If I put in here inside of article,
I'm gonna redeclare my color to be blue.

98
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.820
What's gonna happen here on the page?

99
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.850
How many said paragraphs
are going to be red?

100
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.810
How many say the paragraphs
are gonna be blue?

101
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.500
Lots of people are totally confused.

102
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.650
Okay, so you're kind of both right.

103
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.700
So the first paragraph is
gonna be red because here

104
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.340
this paragraph is taking it from red,
yeah.

105
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.220
And here, the color is coming.

106
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.221
It was redeclared as blue, p inherits
that, cuz we scoped the variable, right?

107
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:41.121
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [SOUND] Yeah,

108
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:46.704
cuz we're scoping variables by
where we're declaring things here.

109
00:06:46.704 --> 00:06:49.700
This is actually part
of the power of this.

110
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.580
That's also the part of what's
gonna cause you headaches,

111
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.500
cuz you gotta remember how CSS works.

112
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.800
This is all straight CSS.

113
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.280
This is nothing special
about custom properties.

114
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.331
This is all about
inheritance in the cascade.

115
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:06.306
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How are you doing so far?

116
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:10.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, it gets better.

117
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.201
Cuz some of you look afraid,
[LAUGH] it's gonna get better, all right?

118
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:18.370
Don't write your code like this.

119
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.920
This is terrible methodology.

120
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.710
All right, don't do this.

121
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.350
All right, so let's go on back and
finish this up here.

122
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.930
So now you might be wondering about,
when am I gonna use SASS and

123
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.440
when am I gonna use
these custom properties?

124
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.750
And is SASS dead.

125
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.730
So a lot of people ask me at this point,
is SASS dead?

126
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.100
What do you guys think?

127
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.050
Do you think SASS is dead,
we're done with it?

128
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It depends.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends, great answer.

129
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.805
What does it depend on?

130
00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:43.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH].

131
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.960
Browser support needs.

132
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Browser support
is definitely a thing, but

133
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.230
let's set that aside and say we have
perfect browser support because

134
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.090
in my world, we only support the latest
version of Chrome and Firefox.

135
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.210
It's a beautiful world.

136
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.910
There's rainbows and
unicorns everywhere, okay?

137
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.970
So in that world,
what else, what's better?

138
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.210
SASS, variables, is SASS dead?

139
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.300
Are we done with it?

140
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.670
What else is saas good for?

141
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mixes are great.

142
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mixes are great, what else?

143
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Leaving out curly braces.

144
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
leaving out the curly braces,

145
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.720
all the nesting stuff,
isn't that fabulous?

146
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.720
Yeah, that's the little thing with
SASS can't do it with CSS, what else?

147
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:25.570
Extends?

148
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Nesting?

149
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Extends?

150
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Nesting.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nesting, extends,

151
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.670
partial files.

152
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.700
All those things are still things, right?

153
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.330
So SASS is not dead.

154
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.915
But now we can do the same kind
of thing in both places, so

155
00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.025
what are we going to do?

156
00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:41.894
How do we separate things into
custom properties versus SASS?

157
00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:45.783
And here's my advice on that, so
what I would suggest you use your SASS for

158
00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:48.790
is things that are going to never change.

159
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.080
So your colors,
your font families, and so forth.

160
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.480
Things that are not going to
change across your media queries.

161
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.400
Because the big advantage of custom
properties is that you can change your

162
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.090
values across media queries.

163
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.190
Just like you do now with CSS, right?

164
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.850
Okay, in SASS,
you can't take your color of red and

165
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.830
then go to your media query and
make it now green.

166
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.880
I don't know why you'd do that,
but you can't do it, right?

167
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.450
And then redeclare your variable again
in another media query and make it blue.

168
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.260
That just doesn't work with SASS.

169
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.560
You can do that with custom properties.

170
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.470
And that is the big,
big take home from today.

171
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.790
So the things that are going to
change in the media queries.

172
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.520
So the things you're gonna copy and
paste and reinstate over and over again or

173
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.060
things like your font size, your margin,
your padding, your widths, flex basis,

174
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.260
all those kinds of properties.

175
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.460
You repeat those over and

176
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.010
over again, what we're gonna do is
change the value of the variable.

177
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.560
Its gonna be a beautiful thing.

178
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.670
Outside that media query in the Mobile CSS
layout, you establish your logic for

179
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:56.220
the layout, and then inside the media
queries all we do is change values.

180
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.780
My gosh, your webpage just shrunk big time

181
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.250
because we don't have to restate
ourselves over and over again.

182
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.988
All we do now is change the values
of variables, makes sense?

183
00:10:08.988 --> 00:10:13.630
Everybody excited,
this is gonna be amazing.

184
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.770
The result is no duplicated code.

185
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.920
We now have just different values,
just different values.

186
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.820
The logic will always be the same.

187
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.510
The values will be different, okay?

188
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.880
As I said, this is the article, one of the
many articles that you could take a look

189
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.270
at about CSS variables and JavaScript,
so feel free to take a look at that.

190
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.460
I have a whole bunch of resources

191
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.750
from which we are going to derive
the rest of the course today on Flexbox,

192
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.190
Gridsystems Grid, Cal Customer properties,
all kinds of wonderful stuff.

193
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.200
That's where you can go and
read all of those.
