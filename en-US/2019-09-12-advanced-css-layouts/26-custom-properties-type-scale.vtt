WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what I'm gonna
do here is I'm just gonna copy

2
00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.604
this cuz this is the part
I'm really interested in,

3
00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.484
and I'm just gonna move
this up on the style sheet.

4
00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:15.509
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just so it's easier for
you to see what I'm doing.

5
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.450
All right, so now what we're going to do,
as you can probably guess.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.650
Let's rewrite this using custom
properties in calc, okay?

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.007
It's gonna be a tiny little bit more code,
but it's gonna be so much easier

8
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:37.467
when we get to our media queries to
change our font sizes, isn't it, okay?

9
00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.396
So how might we go about doing that?

10
00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:43.015
Anyone have a suggestion for
where we might start?

11
00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.370
&gt;&gt; Mark: We could create a custom
property for base font size.

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.406
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
let's go ahead and do that.

13
00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:54.062
Let's create a custom property for
a base font size, yeah, all right.

14
00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:57.749
So up here on the top let's just
go ahead and put it in root

15
00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.389
because we wanna access this from
everywhere in the document, yeah?

16
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.862
And let's go on ahead and
say we a base size of 1em, and

17
00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:12.328
this time we're using ems because
this is in fact what we wanna do.

18
00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:17.835
1em, and
then we might have our type scale, yeah?

19
00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:29.697
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the one that
we chose today was 1.25 right?

20
00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:39.126
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that gets us started.

21
00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:40.819
How big is a paragraph?

22
00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.086
What is the font size for a paragraph?

23
00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:47.186
&gt;&gt; Mark: 1em.

24
00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:51.925
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 1em, right, so here we'll

25
00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:56.670
say our font size is var what?

26
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.397
&gt;&gt; Mark: Base size.

27
00:01:57.397 --> 00:02:02.355
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Base-size,
right, okay cool.

28
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.923
So that's gonna get us started.

29
00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.375
We know what our base size is.

30
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:11.194
So our h5, let's say we want to go up
incrementally from that paragraph,

31
00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:11.966
all right?

32
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.766
So what does an h5 wind up being?

33
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:22.575
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's call our variable h5,
just to keep it clear.

34
00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.403
What does this wind up being?

35
00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:27.715
If it's one size up from the paragraph,
how big is it?

36
00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.011
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 1.25.

37
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:31.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It will be,
how do we do the math to get that?

38
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.658
&gt;&gt; Mark: Base size times the type scale.

39
00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:39.495
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct, okay,
so we're gonna say calc of var.

40
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.318
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Base size.

41
00:02:47.404 --> 00:02:51.507
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Times the var
of the type scale, right?

42
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.542
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool.

43
00:02:56.597 --> 00:03:01.644
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then, of course,
all we need to do here is for

44
00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:06.200
h5, down here at h5 instead of saying font

45
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.895
size of 1.25em, we just save var of h5.

46
00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:14.410
Yeah you could call these things
probably better variable names.

47
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.630
I'm going to stick with
these headings just so

48
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.641
clear here for learning practices, okay?

49
00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:26.833
Okay, so what does h4 become then?

50
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.908
&gt;&gt; Mark: h5 times type scale.

51
00:03:32.908 --> 00:03:38.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: h4,
h4 becomes h5 times the type scale, right?

52
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.032
Are we detecting a pattern here?

53
00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:43.896
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is this where that
exponentiation would come in?

54
00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:46.714
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, if we had
exponents this example would be so

55
00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:48.308
much easier wouldn't it?

56
00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:51.872
[LAUGH] But unfortunately we don't so
we'll work around it.

57
00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:57.001
So instead of this being base
size it will be h5, right?

58
00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.822
h5 times the type scale again.

59
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:07.075
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What if it was base font
size, times type scale, times scale steps.

60
00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:09.976
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
how would you set this up then?

61
00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:13.455
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So
h4 would be the same as the calc above.

62
00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:13.966
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

63
00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:19.167
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But you would multiply by a
new custom property like type scale steps.

64
00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:25.776
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if I have type scale steps.

65
00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:29.087
And so you're suggesting we do what?

66
00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:35.434
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, so in the h4,
it would be equal to 2, all right?

67
00:04:35.434 --> 00:04:36.331
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

68
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:39.087
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It probably doesn't need
a default value, I don't think here.

69
00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:42.706
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, right but
this is actually not,

70
00:04:42.706 --> 00:04:47.823
this is the 1em times 1.25 times 1.25,
right?

71
00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:52.735
It's not 1 times 1.25 times 2.

72
00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:53.691
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Mm-hm.

73
00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:55.545
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See what I'm saying?

74
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.314
It's actually an exponent, not scaling
up like what you're talking about,

75
00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:00.525
where we're doubling.

76
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:02.918
It's actually exponential.

77
00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.373
Okay but a good thought,
but a good thought.

78
00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:10.382
And that's why that doesn't work
because we're not going up stepwise,

79
00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:12.658
we're going up exponentially.

80
00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:16.768
Okay so anyone can guess what we're

81
00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:21.432
going to do here for h3, h2, and h1?

82
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:28.936
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It becomes pretty
simple at this point, right?

83
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:35.449
h2, h3, and
h1 all become like this, right?

84
00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.158
I just have to say h3, h2,

85
00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:46.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: h2 and h1.

86
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.465
And then we just need to
change our variables here.

87
00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:55.360
So this is h4, h3, and h2.

88
00:05:57.315 --> 00:06:01.832
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and then of
course, once you have that all spelled out

89
00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:06.858
here in the root, then of course you
need to actually call those things.

90
00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:11.356
So we would scroll down the page here.

91
00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:15.645
I'm not sure why they put
a margin-top of 0 here on the h1.

92
00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:17.345
You can leave it or not.

93
00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:21.650
We just now need to go through and

94
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.717
say our font-size is
var of in this case h1,

95
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.414
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: h2 and h3

96
00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:46.558
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And h4.

97
00:06:51.031 --> 00:06:54.893
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, whoops one semicolon.

98
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so hopefully you've
gone ahead and you've spelled this out.

99
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.226
We have in our root, we go up
exponentially here as I was saying,

100
00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:13.137
there's our various heading sizes times
type scale, we're getting bigger.

101
00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:17.244
We've gone ahead and called those
variables then h1, 2, 3, 4, an 5.

102
00:07:17.244 --> 00:07:20.022
Now we get to small and
this text small, okay?

103
00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.741
So we have this one here.

104
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.401
Font size is now 0.8 ems.

105
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:26.311
How did we get that?

106
00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:27.929
Anyone wanna take a guess?

107
00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:36.198
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How did we
get 0.8 ems from 1.25?

108
00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:38.954
&gt;&gt; Mark: Wouldn't that be
base size divided in two?

109
00:07:38.954 --> 00:07:42.653
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct, so that is
exactly what we're going to do here.

110
00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:46.236
Instead of multiplying up,
we need to divide down, right?

111
00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:47.812
That would make sense.

112
00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:55.280
So here this winds up being font size.

113
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.726
And because I only have one of these,

114
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.647
I'm just gonna put it
here in this declaration.

115
00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:00.788
Obviously you could add
this to the root and

116
00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:03.894
you could scale down accordingly
if you wanted to go that way.

117
00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:10.752
We'll go ahead and
say calc variable of base size

118
00:08:10.752 --> 00:08:16.281
divided by the variable of type scale.

119
00:08:19.323 --> 00:08:22.238
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay cool.

120
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.688
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we'll just go ahead and save that.

121
00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:39.154
All right, so if you take a look
at the page on the bottom,

122
00:08:39.154 --> 00:08:41.767
absolutely nothing should have changed.

123
00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:47.186
We just love rewriting code that
doesn't change at all, yeah?

124
00:08:47.186 --> 00:08:55.569
Still looks pretty much the same
way it did before, all right.

125
00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:58.589
And, so now what happens if I
want to add some media queries?

126
00:09:03.223 --> 00:09:09.241
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's just say for example
a min-width of let's say 480 pixels,

127
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:14.756
just to come up with some things
that are really quick to come up.

128
00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:19.439
And let's say @media,

129
00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:26.353
with a min-width of 768 pixels.

130
00:09:26.353 --> 00:09:30.931
Obviously, these can be
whatever numbers you want.

131
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:35.582
What would I do here?

132
00:09:35.582 --> 00:09:41.103
So, we went ahead and
we wrote this particular series,

133
00:09:41.103 --> 00:09:48.510
outside media query, what could we
change here as we go to larger screens?

134
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.319
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Either either.

135
00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:52.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Either what?

136
00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:53.808
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Type scale or base size.

137
00:09:53.808 --> 00:09:57.476
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Type scale or
the base font size, right, yeah.

138
00:09:57.476 --> 00:10:01.775
So I may actually want my font
size to be larger on mobile so

139
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:07.507
instead of a 1em, maybe I actually want
this to be like one point whatever,

140
00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:10.575
1.4, because that's what I typed.

141
00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:19.221
So down here all I have to do then is just
say my base font size winds up now being,

142
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:23.158
let's say whatever, 1.2ems.

143
00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:27.638
And then here, my larger dimension,

144
00:10:27.638 --> 00:10:33.382
my base size becomes 1em, yeah, sweet?

145
00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:36.675
Now we have a whole flexible type scale,
it's absolutely beautiful.

146
00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:39.441
It goes all across all the media queries.

147
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:42.544
With a really minimal amount of code,
right?

148
00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:47.966
Okay, so when you save that,
let me just flip

149
00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:52.836
over the view here to the full page view.

150
00:10:52.836 --> 00:10:55.218
All right, so there it is,
big on desktop and

151
00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:59.386
I think we're going to get bigger because
I kind of picked big blowup numbers.

152
00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:04.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

153
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.727
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Big and bigger.

154
00:11:17.934 --> 00:11:20.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What do you think of that?

155
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.417
Mark, you were?

156
00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:24.398
&gt;&gt; Mark: There's just
a question about if you're not

157
00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:28.880
supposed to use import what should
you use for importing the fonts?

158
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.271
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Generally speaking,
I think the performance is better when you

159
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:35.345
actually use the link tag in
the head of the document is what

160
00:11:35.345 --> 00:11:39.836
I heard that performance goes up with that
as opposed to using the import statement.

161
00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:44.043
But this is code pen, so
linking is a little bit more difficult.

162
00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:46.276
So we do it the lazy way with the import,
and

163
00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:48.522
we don't really care this is a prototype.

164
00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:51.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The link tag is especially
helpful if a user has encountered that

165
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.736
same Google Font elsewhere on the web?

166
00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:54.852
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Absolutely true, yes.

167
00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:56.846
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hopefully will
already be cached in the browser.

168
00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:57.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Very good point.

169
00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:01.053
Yes, if you have the link tag and
may already be cached in your browser,

170
00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.995
you don't have to download it again,
better performance.

171
00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:06.628
Okay, so the other thing that
we could have done instead,

172
00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:10.415
if you don't like base font size changing
is you could have changed the type scale.

173
00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:14.850
Maybe you want things to be more
dramatic at larger desktop sizes less

174
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.148
dramatic on mobile sizes, right?

175
00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:22.250
So maybe you actually want a type scale.

176
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.241
And I actually wrote this
down in my notes here.

177
00:12:24.241 --> 00:12:29.356
So here's my type scale
of 1.25 at desktop,

178
00:12:29.356 --> 00:12:33.972
but maybe I wanna type
scale that's a little

179
00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:38.864
bit less dramatic at
this intermediate size.

180
00:12:38.864 --> 00:12:44.057
Type scale of 1.2, and then maybe for

181
00:12:44.057 --> 00:12:47.570
mobile, I actually want,

182
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.762
I'll go back to my 1em base font size and

183
00:12:52.762 --> 00:12:59.362
change this font scale back to 1.125,
okay?

184
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.500
So when the designer comes back to you and
says, by the way,

185
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.234
I wanna totally refactor all
the font sizes on the site,

186
00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:09.331
you're gonna change it in five minutes and
then you can take the rest of the day off.

187
00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:13.645
Yeah, okay, so there we go.

188
00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:18.460
So this one, now with those changes,
if we take a look at it in full page view.

189
00:13:21.248 --> 00:13:22.977
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go,
there's that type scale.

190
00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:30.450
And as we shrink it down, the changes
get a little bit less drastic between.
