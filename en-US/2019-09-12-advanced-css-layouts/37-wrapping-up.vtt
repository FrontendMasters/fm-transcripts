00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.566
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
just to tie everything up here,

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:08.237
I have tongue-in-cheek called this
technique, the death of Bootstrap.

3
00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:10.452
Let's just evaluate that
statement a little bit.

4
00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:15.139
First of all, obviously,
we are limited here by browser support.

5
00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.087
Just that's the world of being
a front end web developer.

6
00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.058
There are plenty [COUGH] i.e.,

7
00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:27.025
browsers that still are not supporting
these custom properties, and so forth.

8
00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:31.050
But we have managed to get around
all of those layout problems.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.967
We can now change our columns at will,
we can change our width at will.

10
00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.848
Pretty cool for changing the ways
that we're laying at web pages.

11
00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:40.684
We've done it in a flexible way.

12
00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:44.498
We have flexible boxes,
we have flexible gaps in between them.

13
00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.320
We don't have to do a whole lot of
math to change those things as we go.

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.499
This formula you can use again and
again and again, within one web page.

15
00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.797
You can use it across a whole
bunch of different websites.

16
00:00:55.797 --> 00:00:58.005
That'll be a pretty cool thing to do.

17
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.782
Where is Bootstrap still gonna be useful?

18
00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:05.604
It's still gonna be useful if you don't
like to write all your CSS from scratch.

19
00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:10.111
Bootstrap makes it look pretty from
the beginning, so that's still there.

20
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:14.650
But Bootstrap, we have broken
the paradigm of the 12-column layout.

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.650
You can now have whatever
columns you want.

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.169
And we have reduced in Bootstrap,
as we state over and over again,

23
00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:24.412
all of the various
different kinds of layouts.

24
00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:27.684
And we stack up all the different kinds
of classes to try to make it work.

25
00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:29.318
We've broken that as well,

26
00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.731
we can do exactly what we want
to do wherever we want to do it.

27
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:35.827
So that's why I'm calling
this the death of Bootstrap.

28
00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:39.193
And this is some additional
resources you can take a look at,

29
00:01:39.193 --> 00:01:43.028
they all very much informed what I
have presented for you here today.

30
00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:46.242
I've taken techniques from
these various articles.

31
00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:50.081
I've combined them with other things and
created some of the stuff.

32
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.312
So there's some reading here for
you on calc, on custom properties.

33
00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:57.947
Especially, the Smashing Magazine articles
are particularly good for this and and

34
00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:00.829
give you examples of how
this kind of thing can work.

35
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.604
I heavily borrowed here from this
Responsive Designs and Custom Properties,

36
00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:07.714
Building a Flexible Grid System.

37
00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:09.560
If you take a look at that article,

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.069
that's where that concept of
the initial basis that we had here.

39
00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.597
But if you read his code really carefully,
he actually uses borders to create a,

40
00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:18.403
quote, gap.

41
00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:20.225
So the gap part I wrote myself.

42
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:23.055
Then we have some additional
stuff here on grid,

43
00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:27.000
including somebody was asking
earlier about grid with variables.

44
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.822
Here's an article on
that variables plus grid.

45
00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:33.050
Absolutely, you can combine
this technique there.

46
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.899
There's some more things on flex box,
flex box grid systems and

47
00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.548
then the games that you probably
already are familiar with.

48
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.460
Feel free to go through this list.

49
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.325
That's probably gonna be better for
you than a book at this point in time.

50
00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:49.419
Yes, we have another question.

51
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.993
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Kelly's asking,
with Boostrap,

52
00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:56.719
there's a lot of utility classes for
adding margin and padding.

53
00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.461
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Absolutely.

54
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:00.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Here you're moving
all of the concerns to CSS,

55
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.683
do you think that's the future of CSS or
that's?

56
00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.606
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Remember,

57
00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:10.245
the technique that I presented here
today basically did the following.

58
00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:14.544
We said, whatever we're going to
change across the media queries,

59
00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:18.038
we put up in a CSS variable,
then we call that variable.

60
00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:22.322
We set up all of our logic in the mobile
layout and then in the media queries,

61
00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.908
we just changed the values
of our variables.

62
00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:28.535
So in something like margin,
I gave you one minor example here.

63
00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:29.794
And I did not go back and

64
00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:33.915
refactor all of the other code that I
could have gone back and refactored.

65
00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:36.367
It was just the timeline was too short.

66
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.876
But you can go back and take a look at it.

67
00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:42.567
What is actually changing from
media query to media query?

68
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:46.833
So if you start with a margin at x and
you're gonna change it to y.

69
00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:48.434
Set it up as a variable,

70
00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:52.931
change the value of the variable
when you get into the media query.

71
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.540
So it's a technique you can apply to
pretty much anything along the way.

72
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.271
I put it here in layouts and
in type because those are pretty dramatic

73
00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:06.268
examples of how you can really
leverage this technique.

74
00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:11.012
But those are equally valid, so
you can apply it to margins and

75
00:04:11.012 --> 00:04:13.853
patterns and other various things.

76
00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:18.407
Thank you all so much for
all the questions, I've enjoyed it.

77
00:04:18.407 --> 00:04:20.681
And I look forward to seeing what
you create with this new technique.

78
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.020
Thank you very much.

79
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.077
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
