00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.022
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
in your chapter 9 folder you will

2
00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.855
find the link to this particular CodePen.

3
00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:15.795
So if you go into chapter number 9,
go into your instructions.

4
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:18.701
You'll find a link to
the starting CodePen here.

5
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:21.230
And I'm gonna go through now,
responsive tables.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.108
We're gonna look at these
in isolation in CodePen.

7
00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:25.421
And then, of course,

8
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:29.168
we'll look at them in the context
of our web page layout as well.

9
00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:35.437
So what I've got here to get me
started is a little bit of HTML.

10
00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:39.987
We're talking about fruit,
because the fine USDA happens to give me

11
00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:44.865
some lovely tabular data with information
about the nutrition of fruit.

12
00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:49.016
Because that's just great content for
putting together a table, right?

13
00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.075
You all know how this works.

14
00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:54.072
So I'll show you what we have so far.

15
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:56.813
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go.

16
00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:59.696
So we've got our title here,
Talking About of Fruit.

17
00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:04.336
We have the h1 as the title of the web
page, while the caption is discussing

18
00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.590
the contents of the table,
a little bit about that.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.080
And then we have our
actual table that's here.

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.379
And so what I am gonna walk you through
now is some pointers about making tables,

21
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:15.932
first of all, accessible.

22
00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:20.522
Then we're gonna go talk about how to make
a table responsive, beyond the scroll bar.

23
00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:23.086
And then you're gonna get
to try it on your own.

24
00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:27.169
You're gonna apply this to a table that
you're going to put inside of our web page

25
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:29.344
layout as we've been working on it so far.

26
00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:30.718
Sound good?

27
00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:35.658
Okay, so first of all,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

28
00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:40.448
we've got this little bit of text, on up
here in the top, we can safely ignore.

29
00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:43.714
So this is just basic table-based layout.

30
00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:46.416
Tables are coming back again,
as people are doing more and

31
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.029
more stuff with big data, right?

32
00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:50.548
You need to publish
the actual chart of the data,

33
00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:54.918
in addition to whatever cool JavaScript
visualization of that data you're doing.

34
00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:57.743
And this is basically the way
you go about coding a table.

35
00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.063
You probably already know this.

36
00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:00.120
There's a table tag.

37
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.105
There's rows, that's the tr.

38
00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.247
There's d's,
those are the table data, right?

39
00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:08.927
So far, so good,
that's what we've got going on here.

40
00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:12.315
Okay, so we're missing several
key pieces to this table,

41
00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:16.191
that I'd like to talk you through
as to why we're going to add them.

42
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.365
So first of all, here with the table,

43
00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:25.433
it always should be something that
you would wanna do, to add a caption.

44
00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we'll go ahead and add a caption.

45
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.132
This is the Vitamin C and

46
00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:36.688
K content of common fruits.

47
00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:39.464
Don't go to sleep on me.

48
00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:42.164
Someone is interested in this, okay?

49
00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.532
So there we go,
there's our caption, all right?

50
00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:51.118
And then after that,
this stuff right here, our Description,

51
00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:57.230
Weight, Measure, Vitamin C,
Vitamin K, what is that, actually?

52
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.941
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Table header.

53
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.593
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
some kind of table header, right?

54
00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:04.842
These are the labels for
these particular columns, aren't they?

55
00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:06.535
So we can improve the markup of this.

56
00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:10.091
Does anyone have any suggestions for
what we should do here?

57
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.097
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: thead and th's.

58
00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:14.137
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so a thead.

59
00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:21.477
So the thead tag goes here,
right before the row.

60
00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:24.829
Okay, so before the row, and

61
00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.475
then you're gonna close
that head after the row.

62
00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:33.016
And thead is sort of
an artificial construct.

63
00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:38.090
It's going to dictate exactly
what we have going on here,

64
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.139
for where the head of this
table is going to be.

65
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.961
There's some other things that we can
do here to improve accessibility and

66
00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:45.782
improve our markup.

67
00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:48.605
What else should we do
inside of thead here?

68
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.777
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What else should
we do in the table head?

69
00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.556
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Change the td's to th's.

70
00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:58.447
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change our td's to th's,
absolutely.

71
00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:02.351
So these should actually be th's,
not td's,

72
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.479
because these are heads of the table.

73
00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.766
And that's why we use this markup.

74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.914
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It looks like I might
have changed the front part here, but

75
00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:14.659
not the back.

76
00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.277
Okay, so there we go, th's.

77
00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:20.039
And there's one other thing that
we can do here, anyone else?

78
00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.496
Anyone have an idea?

79
00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.589
I'm sure Amy knows.

80
00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:28.533
What else should we add, Amy?

81
00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:29.775
&gt;&gt; Amy: We can scope.

82
00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can scope it.

83
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.060
Okay, so
we can add here also the scope="col".

84
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.085
So in other words, this is making it
extremely clear to screen readers that

85
00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:47.057
these are table headers that are for
the columns, as opposed to the rows.

86
00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:50.501
Makes sense?

87
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:55.122
So these are simple things that you can
do that take three seconds to put in, and

88
00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:59.131
will increase the accessibility
of your site very, very quickly.

89
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.348
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
then the other thing to put in,

90
00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:06.684
now that we're done through the head here,
you can label.

91
00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:10.102
Obviously, if there's a head,
there must be a body, right?

92
00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:13.679
So we can put in a tbody tag.

93
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.999
And that will basically be
the rest of this particular table.

94
00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:22.729
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is a tfoot tag,
just so you know.

95
00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.407
So just after the /tr here,

96
00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:30.864
we'll put in our /tbody, okay?

97
00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.121
There is a tfoot tag.

98
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.234
Typically, a tfoot tag is gonna go around.

99
00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.954
Like if we were adding up all
the numbers in this column and

100
00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:40.162
maybe we have a series
of totals at the bottom,

101
00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:43.979
that would be a good example of something
that'd be marked up with the foot tag.
