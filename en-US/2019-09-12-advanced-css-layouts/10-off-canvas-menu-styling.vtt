WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.463
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the next thing we need
to do is that main menu that you have

2
00:00:03.463 --> 00:00:06.793
right now, that looks so
beautiful on desktop, yeah?

3
00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:12.238
And when I squash this page down
a the moment, it looks like that,

4
00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.409
okay, so
itâ€™s all stacking on top of each other.

5
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.875
What we need to do now is we need to
get that navigation in a narrow box and

6
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.944
we need to push it off the page, right?

7
00:00:24.944 --> 00:00:27.516
Because this is going to be
an off Canvas kind of thing and

8
00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:29.063
we want it to slide back on again.

9
00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.125
So, let's write some styles that
are going to make that happen.

10
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:41.115
And so, this will be our main-menu,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

11
00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:47.135
the way I'm gonna do this is
a position of fixed, okay?

12
00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:53.573
Fixed position, display none, okay?

13
00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:56.382
So fixed position,
it's gonna be in one place on the page.

14
00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:59.381
No matter where you scroll on the page,
it'll stay in the same place.

15
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.608
Display none means we can't see it, right?

16
00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:09.340
I'm also going to say on the left it's
going to be off the screen by 200 pixels.

17
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.048
That's a relative number,
you can pick whatever you want.

18
00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:16.407
200 pixels is what happened to work here,
okay?

19
00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:20.568
You can do something with rems, you could
do something with view port etc, etc.

20
00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:21.517
But the key is,

21
00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:25.978
it must be the same as a number I'm
going to show you here in just a moment.

22
00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:32.162
The top will be 0, so at the top of
the page will have a height of 100%.

23
00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:36.307
Remember, that only give you 100%
of the content of that area,

24
00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:38.210
the written content, right?

25
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.898
It doesn't give you 100% of the screen.

26
00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:44.366
We need to think about our overflow, so

27
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:49.736
the overflow in the x direction,
we're gonna say visible.

28
00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:53.354
We'd like people to see,
if we have really long navigation names,

29
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.011
we'd like people to see them.

30
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.979
But the overflow in the y,
we're going to make it auto,

31
00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.018
because we may need a scroll bar yeah,
okay?

32
00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.543
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then, one other thing
you might often use JavaScript for

33
00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:10.718
is your animation.

34
00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:14.638
Because when it slides out,
you want it to slide out and look pretty.

35
00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:17.972
Don't forget we have CSS for
that too, yeah?

36
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.186
And it may even work better
than the JavaScript,

37
00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:21.699
cuz it only takes one minor code.

38
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.365
Transition is our property, and
we can line up a bunch of things for that.

39
00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:31.527
So from the left 0.3 seconds, and ease.

40
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.639
Ease is the animation type of methodology,

41
00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.108
whether in terms of how it's going
to look as it comes in or out.

42
00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:41.410
Some of you might be familiar with that,

43
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.687
if you think about dropping a ball I'm
holding a ball and I drop it, right?

44
00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:48.642
If you watch that ball very carefully,
it goes slow and

45
00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:52.186
then it speeds up as it hits the ground,
remember physics class?

46
00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:56.293
[LAUGH] Vaguely, yeah,
it speeds up as it hits the ground and

47
00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:01.159
then it comes back up and it slows
down until it gets to a height, yeah?

48
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.379
And then it speeds up again, all right,
that's a natural kind of animation.

49
00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.021
As opposed to what you would see
traditionally on a computer,

50
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:13.041
which is things move at one rate,
period, right?

51
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:17.195
Anybody who's so,
old you played Pong on the original Atari.

52
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:20.253
That's what it looked like,
yeah, it went like that.

53
00:03:20.253 --> 00:03:25.122
Okay, ease is one of these things it gives
you a little bit like start slow and

54
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.723
go fast or start fast and then slow down.

55
00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:31.671
I think this one is start fast and
then slow down.

56
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:33.501
Okay, so that's what that one is and

57
00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:39.387
then we'll also give this a z index,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of 999,

58
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:42.777
because hey, it's a great number.

59
00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:48.026
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So far so good?

60
00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:49.963
Any questions on any of this so far?

61
00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:57.194
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so then we're
gonna style up our menu some more.

62
00:03:57.194 --> 00:04:01.963
So .main-menu ul, let's go in ahead and

63
00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:07.135
say it's going to have a list=style; none.

64
00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.982
I actually already did this, but
I'm gonna repeat myself here.

65
00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:16.552
Margin 0, again, in case you guys
wanna copy this code later and

66
00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:18.590
put it somewhere else.

67
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.169
Padding on the top 2.5em,
here I'm using ems very

68
00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.170
deliberately because that's
the size space that I want.

69
00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:34.455
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: My minimum height is 100%,

70
00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:38.347
and the width is 200px.

71
00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:43.477
So it's very important here,
that's your width of the ul is the same

72
00:04:43.477 --> 00:04:48.171
as the width or the left value
on your main-menu above, okay?

73
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:52.001
Because that's gonna be part of
the sliding this thing onto the screen.

74
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.294
So if you want to change that,
and you want to make it 300,

75
00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:59.316
then it needs to be 300 width here,
-300 on the left, make sense?

76
00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:04.189
Okay, and then we can give it a color.

77
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:11.203
Background color, lovely shade of black,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Technically dark gray.

78
00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:16.847
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so far so good?

79
00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:19.559
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a question.

80
00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:20.263
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

81
00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:24.676
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why do you use a minimum
height instead of just height?

82
00:05:24.676 --> 00:05:30.034
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In this particular case,
if you wind up being on a phone,

83
00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:34.066
right, height could cut some of that off.

84
00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:39.350
Minimum height's gonna make
it a little bit bigger, yeah.

85
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.555
Okay, so then a, display = block.

86
00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:49.534
Remember these are going to be links that
are stacked on top of each other for

87
00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:53.278
a mobile screen that you're gonna
be able to touch and click, right?

88
00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:56.862
So you wanna make sure that there's
enough space for your fat finger,

89
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:59.059
to actually touch these links, correct?

90
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.804
Okay, so
let's make sure we style them as such.

91
00:06:01.804 --> 00:06:03.546
By display = block what's gonna happen?

92
00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:06.852
What magically happens to these links,
that's a really wonderful thing on phones?

93
00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:11.594
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Clickable.

94
00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:14.265
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's gonna make
a whole big area clickable right?

95
00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:19.554
as are inline element,
only the words are clickable by default.

96
00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:21.070
When you turn it into a block,

97
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.173
you turn it make a huge area that
becomes clickable with an a.

98
00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:28.193
So this is a really great thing to do for
your links, especially on mobile devices.

99
00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:32.898
Okay, padding 0.75 that
is going to give us

100
00:06:32.898 --> 00:06:37.724
space around those links so
that we can click them.

101
00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:43.830
Color of white and
text decoration of none,

102
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.631
no unsightly underlines.

103
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:52.658
And we'll give it a pretty
border on the bottom,

104
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:59.408
1px #383838,
another great shade of blackish-gray.

105
00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:05.019
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so so far,
just a lot of pretty stuff.

106
00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:10.697
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now I gave the borders
on the bottom of all those links.

107
00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:14.358
Maybe I want one to match on the top too,
so

108
00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:19.467
I could say .main-menu,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: li first-child,

109
00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:30.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: a, border-top, 1px #383838.

110
00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.416
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
now we have a line on the top,

111
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:45.162
we'll have a line underneath each of these
links as we're going down, so far so good?

112
00:07:45.162 --> 00:07:48.909
We're almost getting to
the end of the pretty stuff,

113
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:53.246
we have two more styles and
then we get to the really cool part.

114
00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:58.446
Okay, so we're going

115
00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.282
to say our main,

116
00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:09.065
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: -menu a; hover, and

117
00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:14.379
main-menu a; focus.

118
00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:23.438
Put in styles for those background,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And a text decoration.

119
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.295
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
then the last style here,

120
00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:33.725
I'll be making it pretty packed,
is our close button.

121
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:38.267
So .main-menu,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: .menu-close.

122
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.957
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll
position that absolutely,

123
00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:49.344
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because we want it right in

124
00:08:49.344 --> 00:08:52.296
the top right corner.

125
00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:59.611
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that's where x is going to show up.

126
00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:06.819
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone want to

127
00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.030
take a guess what our web page
would look like right now?

128
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:14.678
If I went ahead and just viewed it in
a browser with what I've written so far?

129
00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:16.404
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There would be no menu.

130
00:09:16.404 --> 00:09:19.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There would be no menu,
anything else?

131
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.372
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It would look very
much like the mobile layout.

132
00:09:23.372 --> 00:09:26.244
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It would look very
much like a mobile layout, yeah?

133
00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:31.026
So if I look at my page so far,
that's what I would see, okay?

134
00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:34.879
So I have a hamburger button here, I can
click it, it does absolutely nothing.

135
00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:42.427
[SOUND] Awesome, my nav bar as we
spelled out is off-screen, right?

136
00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:44.530
And then no way of bringing it on, no
