1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We are into chapter two,
this is the hamburger layout.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.828
You could go ahead and

3
00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:08.810
take a look here in the instructions
what we're going to be doing.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.340
We're gonna be building
a CSS-only hamburger button.

5
00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna
go ahead and code this together.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.470
So what you're gonna see here is that I
have given you some other resources here,

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.700
if you want some other
CSS-animated hamburgers.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.760
We're gonna use a Font Awesome button
to actually be our hamburger button

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.630
here today.

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.350
But you could go to this website and
pick a different one.

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.160
It actually has CSS-only animation.

12
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.500
You can download the code, and
drop it in your page and use that instead.

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.058
And I am heavily basing what
I'm talking about today on this

14
00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:50.741
fabulous article that comes from Medium on
how to build a pure CSS hamburger menu.

15
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:52.026
And I'll just go ahead and

16
00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:56.680
put that up here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: To give him credit.

17
00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:02.699
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: His name is Mark Caron,
okay?

18
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.760
And he wrote this terrific article that
will walk you through the whole thing.

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.680
So we're gonna go on ahead and use that.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.096
So if you go on ahead and
open up your begin folder,

21
00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:19.660
I'm gonna go ahead and open my index.html.

22
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.331
And the other file I'm
gonna open here is nav.css.

23
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.622
I'm gonna opened that one to the side so
that I can have these next to each other

24
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:35.311
when I turn on my word wrap,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

25
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:38.820
we can see what's going on here, okay?

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.992
And just to show you what this web page
is looking like at this point in time,

27
00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:45.390
we go on ahead and
open this up in a browser.

28
00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:51.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is what our website
looks like at this point in time.

29
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.584
And the reason why it looks like
this is because I've coded this for

30
00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:58.574
you so
far with a mobile-only layout, okay?

31
00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.542
So in other words, all these boxes
are gonna stack on top of each other.

32
00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.570
I'm gonna go through all this code
with you here in just a moment.

33
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.780
So we've got our logo up here on the top,

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.230
we've got some kinda
navigation going on here.

35
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.550
We have a whole bunch of resources.

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.290
By the way, to the person who said I
should mention my book, there it is,

37
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.430
Before You Code, [LAUGH] okay?

38
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120
It's all about how to plan websites.

39
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.940
And as you scroll on down here,
there's more information.

40
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.819
Here's a little bit about
the Frontend Masters Bootcamp coming up.

41
00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.737
Probably not for you guys,
but maybe for your friends.

42
00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:33.288
A little bit about HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript, Brian Holt and

43
00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:34.698
I taught that last year.

44
00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:38.900
CSS-Tricks, here are some developers
you should be following on Twitter.

45
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.340
And then some design resources
down here in the bottom, okay?

46
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.290
So this is what that page is
looking like at this point in time.

47
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.600
If we take a quick peek, let's see,

48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.470
down here at the bottom, this is what
these are gonna look like towards the end.

49
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.120
Just so
you see what that looks like, okay?

50
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720
So we are gonna put some
columns together here.

51
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.800
We're gonna do funky things with those
columns, watch the developer column,

52
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.776
the third one.

53
00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:07.100
Ooh, we're putting the third one on
the bottom, ooh, how cool is that?

54
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.720
And then we have to make it go horizontal,
my gosh, we have so much to do.

55
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.770
Here it is, medium, okay?

56
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.780
And then, of course, small,
everything's stacked on top of each other.

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.829
So that's where we're headed today,
all right?

58
00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.599
Okay, good, so if you take a look at
your HTML here just for a moment,

59
00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.749
real quick, what have we got going on?

60
00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:31.276
I have segmented your style sheets
here into individual style sheets.

61
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.650
And I wanna be really clear
about this right now.

62
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.037
I'm not suggesting that
this is a best practice for

63
00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:37.822
you to do on your style sheets at home.

64
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:41.370
No, sir, [LAUGH] this is all
about teaching and learning.

65
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.200
And so what I've done is I've segmented
these into individual style sheets,

66
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.940
kind of like you do individual
partial files with Sass.

67
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.210
Although, we don't have
partial files in CSS, so

68
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.310
I am just using these as
individual CSS files here.

69
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.410
So this will help you find
things in the CSS easily.

70
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.450
We'll continue to add on style sheets
as we work through this example across

71
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.760
a couple of different chapters.

72
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.400
So that's what's going on here, okay?

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.587
Here's our body, we have a header, okay?

74
00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:11.898
The header's got a logo.

75
00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:15.250
Any Font Awesome friends out there,
Font Awesome people?

76
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.205
Yay, we love Font Awesome, so we've
got a Font Awesome icon in here, okay?

77
00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:25.261
Here's our nav bar as it starts,
super simple, nav tags, bulleted list.

78
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:28.269
That's your basic nav bar, okay?

79
00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:32.274
Down here, we have the main portion of the
website because this is the main focus of

80
00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:32.808
the page.

81
00:04:32.808 --> 00:04:34.670
That's when you use the main tag.

82
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.680
I'm divided these into several sections,
each section has a class.

83
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.720
So we have a class of first, and
then we have a series of articles, okay?

84
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.620
So we have an h1 starting off the section.

85
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.560
Section should always be associated
with some kind of heading with it, and

86
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.590
so there we go.

87
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.620
That's our,
what is this whole section about?

88
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.500
Jen's Awesome Resources, then we have
a series of articles here, okay?

89
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.622
Bunch of articles, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:05:01.622 --> 00:05:04.402
These are just headings, paragraphs,
lists, things like that,

91
00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:05.731
as you continue to scroll down.

92
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:10.213
Then we get to our next section,
all right?

93
00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:12.318
And we'll just go on through here.

94
00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:16.603
When you get to developers, this is
probably syntax you haven't seen before.

95
00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:19.958
If you think about what those developer
things are, there's a picture, and

96
00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:20.741
there's a name.

97
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.445
And I think there was a little
icon to link you off somewhere.

98
00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:28.974
I'm using this as a bulleted list
because it is a list of developers, so

99
00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:32.533
the correct semantic way of
coding this would be a list.

100
00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.798
And then inside of that,
each of these is a figure, right?

101
00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:39.631
Cuz in a figure, we can have a link,
we can have a picture,

102
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.391
we can have a caption to go with it, okay?

103
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:47.580
And the caption has my name,
my affiliation, my Twitter link, okay?

104
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.520
So if you're wondering about the HTML and
why I did it,

105
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.220
that's why I did it that way.

106
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.370
And then down here at
the bottom is our last one.

107
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.310
This is our list of resources,
there it is, so

108
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.820
there's our list of resources,
it's just another bulleted list.

109
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.209
Everybody clear on the HTML?

110
00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:07.350
That’s what we’re starting with.

111
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.299
Okay, over here, if you wanted to look
at styles.css, you're welcome to do so.

112
00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:14.526
We actually won’t do anything
with that file today,

113
00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:16.920
that is the default styling for
this document.

114
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.550
So you’ll find colors and whatever,

115
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.630
centered images and a bunch of other
things like that in that styles document.

116
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.970
Apparently, there's some debate online
about what is the best way to do this.

117
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.715
Whether it's Font Awesome,
whether it's SVGs, or

118
00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:36.610
whatever for your hamburger button and
for your close button.

119
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.090
You can do whatever you want,
Font Awesome is really super easy.

120
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.351
Again, for teaching purposes,
it's really straightforward.

121
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:46.857
I've been told by some people
in the class that the version of

122
00:06:46.857 --> 00:06:50.720
Font Awesome here may be
a little bit out of date, okay?

123
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.150
So if you wanna go through
the debug process and

124
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.320
bring that up to the most recent
version of Font Awesome, have at it.

125
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.700
And remember,
I told you also about this particular

126
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.549
website that will give you some
other options for hamburger buttons.

127
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.670
The Squeeze, the Arrow, whoo,

128
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.530
the Arrow Alt going the other way,
or whatever, the Collapse.

129
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.980
So these are other things
that you could swap in here

130
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.380
instead of using the Font Awesome icons.

131
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.476
So, again, a lot of times, things that
I'm doing are because they're just really

132
00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.567
straightforward for teaching purposes.

133
00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:29.905
You are, of course, welcome to
use whatever methodology is gonna

134
00:07:29.905 --> 00:07:32.779
work better in your particular situation.

135
00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.031
The other thing that I had
somebody tell me, too,

136
00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:39.989
is that I have put in a whole
bunch of h1s for these sections.

137
00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:43.640
And that apparently this information
is a little bit out of date.

138
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.600
But it used to be we used to always put
in h1s here for things like sections, and

139
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.190
h1s for articles, and that type of thing.

140
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.160
Apparently, now we are doing one h1 for

141
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.870
the entire web page, so these should
probably be something like an h2.

142
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.420
Again, I'm not gonna bother going
ahead and changing the code on this.

143
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.380
But that's obviously a really
easy fix to make, as well.
