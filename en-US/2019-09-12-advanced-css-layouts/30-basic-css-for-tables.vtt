WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.281
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have gone ahead and
fixed our HTML, and made it semantic.

2
00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:11.091
So then the second step,
and I'm gonna fork this.

3
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:13.800
If you're following along and
want to do separate code pens,

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.110
that's the end of part one.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.240
We're going on to part two.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.410
And in part two, we're gonna add a little
bit of accessibility stuff to this,

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.400
in addition to adding a side scroll.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.240
So the side scroll is what you
get in bootstrap when you call

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.590
a responsive table.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.430
You wind up getting little
scroll bars on the tables,

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.730
because everybody just loves scrolling
around tables on their phones, yeah?

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.946
Okay, so let's go through
how to go about doing that.

13
00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:40.978
And do it in an accessible way.

14
00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:45.302
So what we're going to do
here is before the table tag,

15
00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:48.219
we're gonna add our div tag, okay.

16
00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.868
Then this div tag, the purpose
of it is going to be to scroll.

17
00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:56.888
So we'll give it a class,
which is how we're

18
00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:02.180
going to make it scroll,
tablescroll, okay.

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.016
And then we can give it
some of these aria things

20
00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:11.604
that are going to help with accessibility,

21
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:15.205
aria-labelledby, nutrients.

22
00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:18.504
Okay, and where is that coming from?

23
00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:20.738
That's actually gonna come
from our caption here.

24
00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:23.121
So let me just connect those two for you.

25
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:26.797
So here in our caption,
we're gonna give this an id of nutrients.

26
00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:32.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is gonna tell the
screen reader that this div is actually

27
00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:34.870
associated with this caption here.

28
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.081
That's the way you set that up.

29
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.206
So back to that div that
I sort of half put in.

30
00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:43.650
We've got our aria labelledby.

31
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.736
We've got a role,
you can call this a role of a region.

32
00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:53.852
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then we can give this a tabindex of 0.

33
00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:03.097
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so that's gonna
help a lot with accessibility there, and

34
00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:08.077
give screen readers instruction about
what's going on, why this div exists.

35
00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:12.074
And then obviously, at the end
of our table, we'll go ahead and

36
00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:13.787
put in our closing div tag.

37
00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:16.012
You have to scroll for
a while to get there.

38
00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:18.976
So now, the next thing that we need
to do is we're gonna style that.

39
00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:22.550
So the side scroll, vertical,
horizontal scroll thing,

40
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.917
that is controlled by this div
thing that we just put in.

41
00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:29.201
And so then we'll go on ahead and

42
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:33.709
over here in our CSS, our tablescroll div.

43
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.464
We'll go on ahead and
tell it to overflow-x: auto.

44
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.532
Generally speaking,
there will be a y scroll bar, but

45
00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.889
this is how you can also
give it an x scroll bar.

46
00:02:55.523 --> 00:02:58.705
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
how is everybody doing so far?

47
00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:02.943
I know, not terribly exciting,
but those are the basics, okay.

48
00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:07.287
And so when people talk about responsive
tables, usually that's as far as they get.

49
00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.773
We ready to take it to the next level?

50
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.443
Yeah, cuz we've been having so
much fun today.

51
00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:16.161
All right, so
let's take this to the next level.

52
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:20.177
You all are familiar with
the display property, right?

53
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:25.004
Okay, so the display property, we say
display none, things go away, right?

54
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:29.794
When we display, we have display block,
we have display inline, right?

55
00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:34.762
All these different parts of
the table have their own display

56
00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:37.206
properties as well, right?

57
00:03:37.206 --> 00:03:42.586
What we'd actually like this table to
do on mobile is we'd actually like

58
00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:48.502
to have sort of, you can think of each
of these as an individual report, right?

59
00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:53.030
So an apple, raw, without skin,
has a weight of 110 grams.

60
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.000
And in a one cup of slices with 4.4
milligrams per measure of vitamin C,

61
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.190
and 0.7 of vitamin K, right?

62
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.100
Wouldn't that be great if we could just
sort of make that as a little report,

63
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.110
that you could just sort of scroll down,
and read all those things?

64
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.980
That would be pretty awesome, okay?

65
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.730
So that's actually the direction
we're going to go here

66
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.500
with the CSS we're gonna add next.

67
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.730
So this is for mobile displays, so
it's gonna be outside the media query.

68
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:32.444
And so we're gonna start
here with this table thead,

69
00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:36.720
tbody, th, td, and tr.

70
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.531
These are all going to display: block.

71
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.571
Wow.

72
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:50.729
[LAUGH] So basically,
we just disabled the table, yeah?

73
00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.249
That's super useful, isn't it?

74
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.839
[LAUGH] Okay.

75
00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.855
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that's where we're gonna start it.

76
00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:06.313
Then the next thing we're going
to do is in this thead here,

77
00:05:06.313 --> 00:05:11.785
we have all of these headers
that are here in place, right?

78
00:05:11.785 --> 00:05:15.348
Those are useful if you've actually
got this in tabular format.

79
00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:20.152
We'd actually like to repeat those,
because otherwise,

80
00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:23.620
we just have this string of stuff, right?

81
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.076
We have to remember that apples, raw,
without skin goes with description, and

82
00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:29.922
110 goes with weight, yeah?

83
00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:34.994
Okay, so actually,
I'm just gonna turn that off.

84
00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:39.773
And I'm gonna turn it off in an accessible
way because screen readers will still

85
00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:40.353
need it.

86
00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.731
But we're gonna repurpose
all those headers.

87
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:48.257
So I'm going to say my thead, tr,

88
00:05:48.257 --> 00:05:54.546
I'm gonna say a position of absolute,

89
00:05:54.546 --> 00:06:00.456
and then top of -9999 pixels and

90
00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:05.236
a left of -9999 pixels.

91
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:16.336
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so at this point,
our headers are completely gone.

92
00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:22.357
And now what we have here makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever, table.

93
00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:26.607
You put on a 1 pixel solid, whoops,

94
00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:31.416
sorry, a border of 1 pixel solid black.

95
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:35.397
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

96
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.026
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the thing, this is just
gonna put a box around the whole table,

97
00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:45.892
all right.

98
00:06:45.892 --> 00:06:51.123
It's not gonna put any
borders in between the rows.

99
00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:54.696
You can add that border in between
the rows if you want to do that.

100
00:06:54.696 --> 00:07:03.300
The way I usually do that is
with a tr with a border bottom.

101
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.676
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 1 pixel solid black, okay?

102
00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:12.026
So that'll give you some spacing
here in between the data,

103
00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:14.107
makes it a little bit easier to read.

104
00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:20.023
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then the table itself
will put the border all the way around

105
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:20.797
the outside.

106
00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:27.079
Something that people commonly will put
on this, too, is a border collapse.

107
00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.129
Collapse, and the reason why is if you
actually put a border on the individual

108
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.866
table cells, you'll actually wind up
with a tiny little gap in between

109
00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:36.880
the various individual table cells.

110
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.551
By putting border collapse on this,
then everything will have one solid line,

111
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:43.442
it'll look much nicer, okay.

112
00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:46.888
So that's why that line of code is there.

113
00:07:46.888 --> 00:07:50.963
Then the other thing we might
wanna try doing is striping this.

114
00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:53.996
Anyone have any idea how we
could actually stripe our table?

115
00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:59.080
Maybe we'd wanna have a series of stripes,
and some alternating color of some kind.

116
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.630
Anyone know how we might do that?

117
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Odd and even.

118
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.213
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Odd and
even, using nth-child or

119
00:08:05.213 --> 00:08:08.464
nth of type, either one of those
would work in this situation.

120
00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:15.101
So tr:nth-child, and we can just say odd,

121
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:19.475
cuz we love the odd children.

122
00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:23.412
Background-color of eee,

123
00:08:23.412 --> 00:08:29.010
a lovely shade of light grey, okay.

124
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.990
So once again,
this is just about readability.

125
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.590
And if you want to throw some
padding on those, you can too.

126
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.900
So, for the th and the td, let's throw
in a little bit of padding, okay.
