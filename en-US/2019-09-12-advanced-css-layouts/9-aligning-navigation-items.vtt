00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So here in my nav,
the first thing that I'd like to do is,

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.790
if you notice here,
the hamburger button is kinda small.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.630
And it would probably look
better if it was bigger, and

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.485
if it was probably next to the LayOut
Times and My Web Design Destination.

5
00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:25.524
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, okay, so
one of the things that I could do here to

6
00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:30.901
make that happen would be to,
right after my header here,

7
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.422
I'm going to add this,
a div with a class of row.

8
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.658
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then close that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Down here after that a,

9
00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:53.849
the a that we have in
here with the icon and

10
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.050
our open main menu item here.

11
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.490
So now what I have is I have a header,
yeah, with two children here.

12
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.540
Right, I have a div with a class of row,
and a div with a class of logo.

13
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.591
So now,
I'm totally able to work with these and

14
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.312
make these two line up next to each other.

15
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:22.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so let's go ahead and
write our CSS for this.

16
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.984
So after my header here, then, I could go
ahead and put in some additional styling.

17
00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.406
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll stick it up here,
after this big,

18
00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:36.200
long comment up here at the top.

19
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.095
The CSS that you see here
already is the pretty stuff.

20
00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.249
It's those pretty borders,

21
00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.920
it's turning off the navigation bullets.

22
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.856
It's making it go horizontal on
the page at desktop dimensions,

23
00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:54.920
it makes it stack at mobile dimensions.

24
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.730
So that's what we have going
on here at the moment.

25
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.580
Notice we also have some
other things in here,

26
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.520
I'm particularly proud of this line here,
line 50.

27
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.750
Okay, so we're putting in two little
bars in between each of these,

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.860
and so what we said is, basically,
after each li, but not the last child.

29
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.520
So on one line of code,
we've managed to go ahead and

30
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.100
put in all the bars exactly
where we want them.

31
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.870
You could also write it this way,
two ways, right?

32
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.879
The two styles after and
then last child after, yeah?

33
00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.447
Okay, so that's what we've got going
on down here, in other words nothing,

34
00:02:31.447 --> 00:02:34.800
we need to mess with,
it's just making nav bars pretty.

35
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.047
Okay, so here we'll go ahead and
say header.row.

36
00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:45.008
And I'm gonna go ahead and
say display: flex and

37
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:49.969
flex-flow: row nowrap,
cuz I don't want this

38
00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.575
one to wrap, and
what is this gonna do for me?

39
00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:02.069
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Make it one line.

40
00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.022
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make it one line, right?

41
00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:05.283
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That doesn't wrap.

42
00:03:05.283 --> 00:03:08.541
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's gonna put
the div with the class of row and

43
00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:13.246
the div with the class of logo right
next to each other, aren't they?

44
00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:17.211
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think we want logo to be
inside of row in the HTML, though, right,

45
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:19.307
if we want them both on the same row?

46
00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:20.515
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me just double-check.

47
00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.632
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

48
00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:25.731
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Need two
flex items in there.

49
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:30.164
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, sorry, thank you very
much, I misplaced my closing div here.

50
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
we've got div after the logo.

51
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.723
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
we've got our div with a class of row.

52
00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:49.299
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have this first child
here, right, the a starts here and

53
00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.710
it doesn't end until down here,
so that's one child.

54
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.566
The second child is logo, which starts
here and it ends there on line 25,

55
00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:59.659
so line 22 to 25 is the logo.

56
00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.039
Okay, sorry, very easy to lose track
of those closing divs, as you all know.

57
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.680
Okay, so now this should put
it next to each other, right?

58
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.700
If we go ahead and
save our HTML, save our CSS, and

59
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.260
we take a look at our web page here, those
two should be now next to each other.

60
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.772
So there they are next to each other,
okay, still not pretty, but

61
00:04:20.772 --> 00:04:23.863
at least they're next to each other,
that's a victory.

62
00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:29.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so then we have
some other styles we need to add.

63
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.624
Let's go on ahead and add our
screens reader only style, sr-only.

64
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.850
And this is something of
an incantation at this point, I think.

65
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.563
You pretty much copy this out of
Bootstrap, I think is what everybody does.

66
00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:45.740
Cuz when I read this, I was like, yeah,
that's Bootstrap, so it's the usual stuff.

67
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.940
position: absolute,

68
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.610
width: 1px, height: 1px,

69
00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.700
padding: 0, margin: -1px,

70
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.489
overflow: hidden,

71
00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:12.842
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: clip: rect(0, 0, 0,

72
00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:19.664
0),
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And border: 0.

73
00:05:19.664 --> 00:05:23.264
This is basically every possible way
that you can hide something on the page.

74
00:05:23.264 --> 00:05:25.867
There it all is,
that's screen reader only,

75
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.749
okay, so
whatever your browser will understand.

76
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:32.013
It'll understand one of those,
and magically,

77
00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:35.129
the thing won't be hidden
on the page anymore.

78
00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.782
Okay, now let's get into
some more interesting stuff.

79
00:05:38.782 --> 00:05:45.540
We have our menu-toggle,
that's our actual button here.

80
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.390
Right, so where's menu-toggle,
so this is the a here.

81
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.070
This is going to affect that and
potentially its children,

82
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.610
which would be our
Font Awesome button here.

83
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.522
So let's go on ahead and

84
00:05:57.522 --> 00:06:02.147
set our color to black,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

85
00:06:02.147 --> 00:06:03.895
we'll give it a little bit of a margin.

86
00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:10.099
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can also
make it change colors,

87
00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:17.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Oops, menu-toggle:hover,

88
00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:22.037
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: menu-toggle:focus,

89
00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:23.838
what is focus?

90
00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:27.172
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody?

91
00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:29.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: When it's tabbed.

92
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.854
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: When it's tabbed,
when it's tabbed, yep.

93
00:06:32.854 --> 00:06:39.019
And the color here will be, c85028,

94
00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:43.994
which is a lovely shade of orange.

95
00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.962
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
again we come on back,

96
00:06:50.962 --> 00:06:52.830
take a quick peek of what's going on.

97
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.130
There it is, it's black,
when we roll over it, it turns orange.

98
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.393
Somewhere along the way,
I made that bigger, but not yet.
