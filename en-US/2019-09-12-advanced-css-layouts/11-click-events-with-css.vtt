00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So first of all,
we're gonna use this selector,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.300
you've probably never seen before.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.620
Main menu, colon, target,
anyone ever heard of this one?

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.090
Anyone ever heard of target?

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.510
So target basically says,
when the main menu is targeted.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.050
In other words, something has been
clicked on and it is a target.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.500
So if you notice, here on our a, and

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.880
on that hamburger button here,
it says main menu, right?

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.190
So when this is clicked on here,
and it becomes now the target,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.380
we are going to do something.

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.510
Anyone wanna take a guess
what we are gonna do?

12
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Display.

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about display the menu,
yeah.

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.130
So, display, block, okay?

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.160
Cuz right now it's a display none.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.240
So when it becomes the target,
it will become display block.

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.020
My left will become 0, so it's gonna
come out and show on the screen, right?

18
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.859
And we could say outline, none,
just in case there's an unsightly outline.

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.806
Then the other things we need are,

20
00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:15.190
main menu, target, menu close.

21
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.630
So what does this selector say?

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.750
For anything that has
a class of menu close,

23
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.550
when the main menu is targeted, right?

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.650
So, this is gonna happen when the main
menu is targeted on that thing,

25
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.070
that menu close.

26
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.200
What are we going to do here?

27
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.199
We're gonna make a z-index of 1001,
in other words,

28
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:41.360
we're gonna bring it to the top,
so you can click the X, right?

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.362
When you slide that thing on, the X
actually goes underneath, so we need to

30
00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:47.526
make sure the X is on top and clickable,
so that's what that's doing, okay?

31
00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:51.951
And then, also,

32
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:59.033
main-menu, target, ul.

33
00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:04.601
Position of relative and
a z-index of 1000,

34
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:09.380
slightly below the close button, right?

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.250
Because the close button we positioned
absolutely in the top corner, we need it

36
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.530
to be actually be underneath the menu
which is on top of the screen behind us.

37
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.140
So, that's the three layers,
the main screen, the ul and

38
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.010
then the close button on top, makes sense?

39
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.720
Okay.

40
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.740
All right, now, and

41
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.570
then the final, let's just take a quick
peek at what we've got going on here,

42
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.060
go ahead and save your code, let's look
at it in a browser, what do we got?

43
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.978
Hey, all right, so there it is.

44
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That works, okay?

45
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.440
The other cool thing that happens
because of the way this is coded,

46
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.250
you'll notice that the URL changes here,
and the back button actually works.

47
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.870
Wow, so I can click that and

48
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.020
hit the back button, and that will work,
because of the way we've got this coded.

49
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.900
Now, what happens though,
for the person who for

50
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.140
whatever reason can't get this X
up here or doesn't want it, and

51
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.640
they're over here clicking away cuz
usually that does something, yeah?

52
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.546
Okay, so
this last style is about that, and

53
00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:28.017
the last style is, we're going to say,

54
00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:34.081
our main menu, target once again,
plus, back drop.

55
00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:39.315
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What does that mean?

56
00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:48.442
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

57
00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:52.080
here's what we've got going on
over here in our HTML, okay?

58
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.007
Backdrop's all the way down here at
the bottom, outside of the nav tag.

59
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it sibling?

60
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so this is
the immediate adjacent sibling selector.

61
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.730
And so, what this is saying is,

62
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.660
when backdrop immediately follows
the main menu when it's targeted, yeah?

63
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.610
This is the big thing with these CSS
selectors, we write them left to right,

64
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.010
you read them from right to left,
read them from right to left.

65
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.470
So when backdrop here, okay?

66
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.397
Is an immediate sibling of main menu and
its targeted, what are we gonna do here?

67
00:04:29.397 --> 00:04:34.376
What we are going to do
is we're going to say,

68
00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:37.410
position of fixed, okay?

69
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.750
And display block,
what are those two things going to do?

70
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.160
For this little link that's
out here all by itself,

71
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.810
this weirdo little link with
nothing in it, what is it gonna do?

72
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's gonna
cover the rest of that.

73
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.394
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Covers the whole screen,
yeah?

74
00:04:55.394 --> 00:05:02.710
The whole screen becomes one great big,
huge, giant clickable link, all right?

75
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.023
And we can then of course position it,

76
00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:11.841
left of zero, top of zero,

77
00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:17.999
width 100%, height 100%, okay?

78
00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:24.279
Z-index,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Would be 998,

79
00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.831
because we want it underneath the menu,
the close button, all those other things,

80
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.110
we want it underneath all of that.

81
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.560
But we'll still want it above the webpage,
right?

82
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.380
Then we can give it a background color.

83
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:44.624
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Something like rgba 0,
0, 0,

84
00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:50.876
0.85, what is that gonna do for me?

85
00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:53.630
Are you all familiar with this notation?

86
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.460
What is this gonna do for me?

87
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Transparency.

88
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A little
bit of transparency, so

89
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.390
I can kind of see the webpage
over there on the side, right?

90
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.765
Okay, and then if you want you
can also add a cursor, default,

91
00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:12.360
cuz you don't want them rolling over and
thinking they can click on something and

92
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.180
it'll look like the arrow that way, okay?

93
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.820
My gosh, this is amazing, isn't it?

94
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.630
Wow, and it was a long wait but
worth it, right?

95
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.728
It's like one of those jokes that takes
forever but has the best punch line.

96
00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:31.554
Okay, so let's go ahead and refresh,
and take a look on what's going on now.

97
00:06:31.554 --> 00:06:35.995
So now I have, Uh-huh, okay?

98
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:39.055
Looking more like
a Java Script kind of thing?

99
00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:39.959
All right?

100
00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:44.009
And if I click over here,
then the whole thing goes away.

101
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.270
Pretty awesome?

102
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.760
So see that, I can scroll on down the
page, still scrolling down the page, but

103
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.980
once I click,
it just makes the menu disappear.

104
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.420
Nice?

105
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.600
I saw some big smiles there as we were
going through this target stuff, right?

106
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.650
You may have heard of doing this kind
of thing before using check box.

107
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.220
Check box is another way of doing this,
that's kind of a hack way of doing it.

108
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.120
The target pseudo class is much cleaner,
much nicer?

109
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.654
You don't have to put in the form element,
the check box kind of thing,

110
00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:22.541
that's the way we used to
fake an on click, okay?

111
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:26.175
But now that we have target,
that's enough here to fake an on click for

112
00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:27.480
this kind of situation.

113
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.937
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you talk a little
bit about why you're using the hidden

114
00:07:30.937 --> 00:07:32.124
attribute and the backdrop?

115
00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:34.087
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because first of all,

116
00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:39.150
we don't actually want anyone
to see that by default.

117
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.100
Like we run into a big link somewhere and
click it and

118
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.740
it does nothing,
it's kind of weird, right?

119
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.590
The other part of that is for
accessibility purposes, so

120
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.860
that a screen reader is not
reading that out on a page and

121
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.570
saying, here is a link you can
follow that does absolutely nothing.

122
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.777
So we just hide it, yeah.

123
00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:02.891
And technically speaking as we was
saying earlier, hidden or the tab index,

124
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:04.800
either one of those will do, yeah.

125
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.710
But we did belts and suspenders.
