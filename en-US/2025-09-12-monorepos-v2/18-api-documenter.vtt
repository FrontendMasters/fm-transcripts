00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.058
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Next we're gonna take
the output of API Extractor and use it

2
00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:08.640
to make some simple API documentation for
our models monorepo package.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.680
This is quite simple.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.560
We first need to install API Documenter
if it's not installed already.

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.770
Let's check, @microsoft/api-documenter.

6
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.890
And doing this within
the models package is right.

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.390
Great.

8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.330
Dependency added.

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.620
Now I'm going to run pnpm
api-documenter markdown -i for

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.970
input temp -o for output docs.

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.140
So we're saying I wanna
invoke api-documenter.

12
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900
I want my docs in markdown.

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.807
The other option here is a YAML file which
you can feed into other documentation

14
00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:02.900
systems like docusaurus.

15
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.571
I've personally never figured out how
to do that, but it is just a matter of

16
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:12.420
aligning those two formats and
then pointing to this temp folder, right?

17
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
So if you customized where this
temp folder was being stored,

18
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.470
you would wanna keep that consistent.

19
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.590
And this by the way, is something
you don't want to commit to git.

20
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.590
So while we're saying that,
let's go to our gitignore.

21
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.590
Make sure we're ignoring that, temp save.

22
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.110
We wanna see that get grayed out, perfect.

23
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.110
And then the output folder is docs.

24
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.070
Let's let it run.

25
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.150
Great.

26
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.710
Deleted the old output from docs.

27
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.870
Well, none was there.

28
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.110
And then what was written was
a new seeds models package.

29
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.590
Look, a bunch of markdown files.

30
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.150
Let's look at our index.md in VS Code,
get rid of that.

31
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.136
You can see here how if we
had more than one library,

32
00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:08.500
you could lump these things together and

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.279
you could have like all of the different
packages you might have in your monorepo.

34
00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.039
And then clicking into one of those,
you can see.

35
00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.159
All right, we've got like
a seed packet collection model.

36
00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.015
There wasn't a lot of commenting here, but

37
00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:28.039
this is all just coming from
code comments seed packet model.

38
00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.679
Here are the different types and
the description.

39
00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.795
This is all derived from comments and
type information.

40
00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:41.420
So particularly if you're
using this mostly for

41
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.270
internal purposes,
it's kind of nice to have this in here.

42
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.070
You can browse this right within VS code.

43
00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.390
You don't have to go to
some other docs website.

44
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.150
You don't have to switch out of this tool.

45
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.133
I really like the idea, particularly
if you're not making this a product and

46
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:04.430
you really care about the visual
appearance of the docs greatly.

47
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.910
These end up being just a very browseable
thing if there happen to be code.

48
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.550
Comments on things that
gets percolated through.

49
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.861
But mostly it's type information and
it does have a nice sort of multi

50
00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:24.910
page structure where you could easily
track the changes to things over time.

51
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.190
So that's another aspect
I like about this.

52
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.183
If you check this into git,
this lets you look at the history of

53
00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:38.467
these things over successive builds and
you can see them as almost

54
00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:43.559
like a time machine of the surface
without having to worry about

55
00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:48.290
the implementation and
refactoring within the methods.

56
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.410
It's a nice distilled piece
of information there.

57
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.263
So this is API Documenter.
