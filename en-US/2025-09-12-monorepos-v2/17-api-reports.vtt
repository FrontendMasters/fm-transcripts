&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
we've made some changes and

2
00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:09.059
we can run the report again and

3
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.640
take as a given that some
of these have gone away.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.840
Now I want you to look at another
folder that was created here.

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.960
It's this temp folder.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.020
So what we have here is this thing
that I referred to as an API report.

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.060
Here's what it looks like.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.631
This is the API report.

9
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:38.554
This is a markdown file, if you commit
it to GitHub, it will render beautifully

10
00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:43.260
on the website and it shows exactly
what is being exported from this module.

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.700
It also encodes warnings.

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.940
So there's a lot of stuff here,
this is a complicated type.

13
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.161
Now I want you to imagine you're
reviewing a pull request and

14
00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:02.459
instead of having to piece through and
see like you've changed this type and

15
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.709
it is used in a function signature
that happens to be public.

16
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.834
But where you change
this type is like deep in

17
00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.215
some internal code having
something that's so

18
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:18.115
clear to see that's sort of a roll up
of the exposed API surface of this

19
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:23.760
library is super useful because you can
just see it in terms of a diff here.

20
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.483
It becomes clear as day whether
whatever you changed in a pull request

21
00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:31.334
has ripple effects that downstream users

22
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:36.560
of the library will feel in a way that
is either breaking or non breaking.

23
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.716
But that's a good reason to bake something
like this into your build process or

24
00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:47.472
to build a bot around it so
that it comes into a pull request and

25
00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:53.443
says here's the updated API report makes
it super, super clear to spot when

26
00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:59.910
a given code change has ripple effects
that affect the library's outer surface.

27
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.479
There's another file here,
it's called Models API JSON and

28
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.009
this is going to lead into our
next topic where we talk about

29
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.630
generating API documentation
based on this.
