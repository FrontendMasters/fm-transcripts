00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.740
&gt;&gt; Sarah: Okay, layouts in CSS.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.717
So let's talk about before,
I was like, don't worry about code,

3
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:08.876
don't worry about code.

4
00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:13.690
Now, let's worry about code and kinda talk
about how to make these things a reality.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.260
One of my favorite sites on the Internet
is Grid by Example by Rachel Andrew.

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.030
Rachel Andrew does a ton of really great
content about CSS grid and how to use it.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.650
And she does do flex box and
float fallbacks, so even if

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.210
you have to support older browsers,
she shows you how to do that as well.

9
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.450
So if you go into the start here,

10
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.270
on her site she has all of
these really amazing videos.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.996
And if you've never heard
Rachel talk before,

12
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:47.697
she's just got like the nicest voice in
the world, you just sit there and like aw,

13
00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:50.441
Rachael so nice,
it's like really relaxing.

14
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.955
[LAUGH] A lot of times like when I'm
watching coding videos and stuff,

15
00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:57.347
I have to wear headphones, but
this is like, my husband's like,

16
00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:59.430
actually it's okay when Rachel talks.

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.711
I don't actually mind how
we met in the background.

18
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:05.309
She also has a ton of examples and
a ton of patterns and

19
00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.930
we're actually going to work off of
one of these little bit later today.

20
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
Because I think that if you're not
familiar with grid, it's a really great

21
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.718
place to get started, she has all these
patterns that you can kind of grab and go,

22
00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:19.264
and try things on your own.

23
00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:21.913
It's a really good way of learning
especially because, it's so

24
00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:23.850
hands on you're really
playing with the code.

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.400
Another person to follow or

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.050
check out if you need to know
about CSS Grid is Jen Simmons.

27
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.360
Jen Simmons has this
Experimental Layout Lab, which is awesome.

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.550
She goes through all of
these different crazy cool

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.550
ways of laying out text and
just got like a million of them,

30
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.160
and they're all really beautiful and
wonderful.

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.270
But the nicest thing is they're really
done in a browser so you can go and

32
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.460
explore them with dev tool.

33
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.370
So you might notice this composition is
kinda like that Swiss Design that we were

34
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.180
talking about earlier, right?

35
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.840
So if I take this apart
Inside the browser.

36
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.661
What I find is she's got a transform
rotate, which I'm not surprised by, right?

37
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:08.470
She's got like a 45 degree angle.

38
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.372
She basically lays out
the entire composition and

39
00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.145
then at the end [SOUND]
kind of puts it into place.

40
00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:18.652
You can see how I in the bottom right
hand corner I kind of undid that and

41
00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:23.310
you can then just see the layout
straight how she probably built it.

42
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.440
I don't know but what I imagine.

43
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.630
And then if you kind of
highlight each one of them,

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.110
you can see how she built this grid.

45
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.520
And it's not actually that much code,
that's the kind of a amazing part.

46
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.930
Is you can explore all of her projects,
they're pretty nicely cleanly done.

47
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.050
And you can kinda play with them,
you can break them.

48
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.590
I encourage you to play
with them in the dev tools.

49
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.300
Both Chrome and Firefox have
really good devtools for grid now.

50
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.370
You can see I just literally
hovered over that header wrapper,

51
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130
and this grid appears.

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.460
And you can see which parts
are the grid and which aren't.

53
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.010
You can see there's grid gap, so
spaces in between each piece of the grid,

54
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.960
and those dotted lines
between each one of them.

55
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.920
So that's so cool,
it's such a nice way of learning.

56
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.255
I also, in order to learn grid, started
playing with this site called Grid Garden.

57
00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:28.300
It's like a 28-level
game that it teaches you

58
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.780
grid as you play it, so it starts with
how to start grid columns, start.

59
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.350
And it takes probably
like only a half-hour or

60
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.250
something to go through the entire game.

61
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.310
And you kinda understand Grid a little
bit better as you're working with it.

62
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.740
The thing that's in the right-hand top
corner is the most important thing.

63
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.150
I am not a Grid expert.

64
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.850
I am not Rachel Andrew.

65
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.400
I am not Jen Simmons.

66
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.810
Grid is not the thing that I am and do.

67
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.950
Like I spend much more time working
with like view and JavaScript and stuff.

68
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.130
But I work with Grid enough to like

69
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.700
kind of understand some
basic principles and stuff.

70
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.840
I'm still working on getting better.

71
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.520
So it's okay if you're not,
your also just playing and trying it out.

72
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.520
Grid is actually really a cohesive and
kind of nice to learn.

73
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.640
Grid is also huge,
there's just so much in Grid.

74
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.540
So even if you just learn a few things,
that's okay too.

75
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.390
I was talking to Chris Coyier,
if you know him.

76
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.036
He does CSS-Tricks and
ShopTalk show and a few other things.

77
00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.140
He was co-working at
my house with Mary and

78
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.790
Susanne who wrote Suzie,
which was a CSS Grid back in the day.

79
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.990
Now she gives talks like don't
use my grid system, use CSS Grid.

80
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.610
Both of them are awesome people but

81
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.290
I was basically like,
I don't know if I can learn Grid.

82
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.990
It seems really complicated cuz I've seen
all these talks with all of these features

83
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.706
and I was just like [LAUGH] I'm just
gonna stick with life box [LAUGH].

84
00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:02.170
And they were like, you know,
in order to use grid,

85
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.400
you don't need to use all of those things.

86
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.840
You can just do X, Y and Z, and
I was like, I didn't know that.

87
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.066
So you can just start with
kind of simpler systems and

88
00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:15.846
then learn more features
as you get better at it.

89
00:05:15.846 --> 00:05:20.566
So let's check out some of these code
pens that I've prepared for you.
