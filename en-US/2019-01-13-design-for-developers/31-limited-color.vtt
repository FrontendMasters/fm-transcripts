&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Limited color,

2
00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:05.221
I think that when you're first starting
out you should limit your color.

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.678
You should limit your color
palettes as much as possible.

4
00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:11.425
Because it'll keep it consistent,
and keep it cohesive, and

5
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:14.688
then you can kind of add more detail and
bring more out.

6
00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:17.805
So this was actually just
a tweet from Justin Mezzoll,

7
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.077
he's a really great designer
that you should check out.

8
00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:25.873
And he's showing how by limiting
the color you can get an idea of what

9
00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:28.158
kind of color ranges to work in.

10
00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:30.375
And then by adding a little bit more and

11
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.774
a little bit more you're
starting to just fill in detail.

12
00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:35.839
So it's kinda like the composition idea,
right?

13
00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.758
Where we have the big building blocks that
we're working with in the composition.

14
00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:46.060
We figure those out and then we can
fill out little details here and there.

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.238
So here's an example
of some limited color.

16
00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:50.967
I mean I think the color
work here is really great.

17
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:57.393
It's really not something that you
would decide to do on your own.

18
00:00:57.393 --> 00:01:02.313
It's actually a little bit different on
the screen again seem like I wanna check

19
00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:07.087
out the slide after but it's mostly kind
of on this like purple scale with some

20
00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:08.859
unique bits here and there.

21
00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.415
But they just keep to those colors, almost
like take the background, take the blue,

22
00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:17.533
and those icons, that's pretty much
all the color they're working with for

23
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.573
this whole thing.

24
00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:20.913
But the color is pretty nice for

25
00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:25.330
the whole to keep it consistent
across the entire design.
