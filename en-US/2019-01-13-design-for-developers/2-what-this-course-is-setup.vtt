00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so lets talk
quickly about what this course is not and

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.400
what this course is.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.290
This course is an course,
it's not a replacement for design school.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.150
Design school is four years long and
then people often go to grad school.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
And its not a replacement for spending
many, many, many years in the field.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.500
In fact each thing that we touch on today,
every single deck that I show you

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.310
could be a course of it's own
that I could just devote.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.349
I could devote an entire day to color,
well I could devote an entire, well,

9
00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.900
I can devote an entire semester to layout.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.505
So, what am going to do is I'm going
to give you lots of resources to work

11
00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:41.390
from.but am also gonna try to
hit all of the major points so

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.500
that you at least have some foundations,
and you can work off of them, right?

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.190
This course is also not a way to feel
superior to people who are designers,

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.992
so don't go to work and be like I know
more than you now or something like that.

15
00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:57.945
You know, people don't like that I hear,

16
00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.686
especially if they've been
working in the field forever.

17
00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:04.280
If, you know, a designer took
a course on Java Script for a day,

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.610
you wouldn't want them telling you how to
write the code same kind of difference.

19
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.160
You all know that I'm just
putting it out there so that,

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.240
everybody is at the same
understanding about this.

21
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.450
So, when we setup our projects
what I'm gonna ask you to do today

22
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.210
is to set it up in a folder.

23
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
And, you know, if you're not using
something like along these lines,

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.630
you can create a new project, dump it into
the sidebars so that it has easy access.

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.350
And then we're going to make
a couple of folders here as well.

26
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.470
So one of the folders that we're gonna
make is going to be called insp or

27
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.330
inspiration.

28
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.680
That's where we're gonna put things
that kind of feed our brains and,

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.710
get us excited about making
something than we're gonna put have

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.990
a filter called source that's where we're
gonna put the actual source images and,

31
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.890
actual fonts that we're
gonna be working with.

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.150
And then we're also going to have
depth which is where we start to

33
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.490
maybe you use the CLI tool to
create a project in there.

34
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
That can eventually become a GitHub repo.

35
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.290
So the nice thing about this setup and
you don't have to keep using the setup or

36
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.030
anything but I encourage you to
try using a set-up like this,

37
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.280
because then everything is so

38
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.330
easy to work with especially if
you're working on a side project.

39
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.870
That's one thing I should mention.

40
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250
This course should be used for
jazzing up some of your side projects.

41
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.890
A lot of times developers are working on
something where they wanna show a dev

42
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.120
concept and
nobody cares because it looks not great or

43
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.340
it looks very bootstrappy or,
you know, what have you.

44
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.380
So hopefully this class gives you
enough kind of foundational concepts to

45
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.660
work off of where you're like, you know,
I can actually take this side project and

46
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.110
I can start from concept all the way
to execution and a published project.

47
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.700
And that's so exciting, right?

48
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.880
The idea that you don't have to
collaborate with someone if you don't want

49
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.340
to, you can work on something all on
your own, can be really, really freeing.

50
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.720
There's a whole piece of communication
that you don't have to have this like

51
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.850
whole back and
forth between what your intent and

52
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.290
intention is and how that's created,
that can all be you.

53
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.310
So in creating this you can
kind of see the setup for

54
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.990
an entire type project start to finish.

55
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.399
So it's a nice way to kind of keep
everything right at your fingertips.

56
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.070
So, what this course is?

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.043
This course is definitely a place to
understand some base concepts especially

58
00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:30.690
if you're communicating
a lot with the designer and

59
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.097
they might reference something or,
you know,

60
00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:37.200
you're not exactly sure why they're
making decisions they're making.

61
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.460
It gives you some concepts for that.

62
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.620
We talked a little bit
about side projects.

63
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.610
This course is definitely a place to get
some of those concepts so that you feel

64
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.209
like you know where to go from here and
you know how to build things on your own.

65
00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.190
This course is definitely
a place to get resources, so

66
00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.180
if there's stuff you're like,
how do they even start from here to there?

67
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.251
You have all of these extra materials
that tried to chalk it full of

68
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:09.062
other reading materials, other sites,
other things that you can look at and

69
00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:11.446
ways that you can develop on your own.
