&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There was a question
from the last section which was whether or

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.320
not you could nest grids
inside of each other.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.510
You totally can.

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.810
It's actually a really good idea to,
especially if you can imagine,

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.430
let's say you have a layout that's a kind
of interesting dynamic composition but

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.260
in one of those areas you have a grid
of photos or something like that.

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.490
That's totally a great
time to use a nested grid.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.110
Just like I mentioned you can
put Flex Box inside a grid,

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.000
you can also put grid inside of grid.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I would say that if you can try to draw,

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.760
unless it's a situation where you have
these kind of clearly defined reasons why,

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.360
you maybe should try to make one
layout with one grid first for

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.960
the reason that as a maintainer, looking
at nested grids might be a little bit

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
complicated, especially as
you're diving into the code.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.880
So always having a mind towards
you maintaining your code or

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.424
someone else maintaining your code.

17
00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.670
What makes logical sense
since you're looking at them.

18
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.090
And certainly you can
document in other ways.

19
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.150
But it's just a good thing to keep in
consideration how you're gonna update it

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.030
in the future.

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.150
What happens to that
grid when people change

22
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.850
the rules on you when people decide
that they need to change the design.

23
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.730
Is it easy to update or
does it become really unwieldy?

24
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.990
And there's definitely points where
a nested grid would actually keep it from

25
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.940
being unwieldy too, right?

26
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.520
There are times when that would
make a lot more sense, so

27
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.830
just keeping those things in mind.

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.330
Cool.
