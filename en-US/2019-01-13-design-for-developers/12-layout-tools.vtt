00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so let's talk
about tools, many of you know these tools

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.820
but in case you don't let's
just go over them very briefly.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.498
Because maybe you know the tools but
you might not know why you would reach for

4
00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:12.677
one over another.

5
00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:17.470
Photoshop and Illustrator are made
by Adobe, they are both very old.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.210
And so
people who have worked on the web for

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.100
a long time probably know
they way around them.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.794
I'm one of these people, so
I have all of these shortcuts and

9
00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.847
things as I work with Photoshop and
Illustrator.

10
00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:30.940
I work with Sketch but

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.340
I'm not as comfortable in Sketch because
it's a little bit of a newer tool.

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.754
Photoshop is really great for
JPEGs, Bitmaps,

13
00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:45.320
like those masks we were talking
about earlier, transparencies,

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.030
effects, filters, things like that.

15
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.964
It's a really, really powerful tool,
and it actually does do shapes now, and

16
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:56.174
it does do things like artboards and
stuff.

17
00:00:56.174 --> 00:01:00.320
So they've borrowed from other programs,
it used to be very clear,

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.810
if you're doing x, use Photoshop,
if you're doing y, use Illustrator.

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.700
They've actually learned
a bit from each other,

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.040
so the delineation isn't so
striking anymore.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.410
Illustrator was originally intended for
things that are more like vectors.

22
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.930
So if you're creating an SVG,
Illustrator is really great for that.

23
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.670
Drawing path points and
if you do make a gradient,

24
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.570
the gradient is made in code
not like with pixelly things.

25
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.540
So creating things that have like a lot
of gradient, with a lot of patterns and

26
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.450
textures.

27
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.240
Probably going to work a little
bit better in Photoshop.

28
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.290
Illustrator has those capabilities too,
if you only had Illustrator,

29
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.530
you could totally get by, but those are
where their strengths lie, I would say.

30
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.220
It's a little bit more clumsy
to work with the shapes

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.060
in Photoshop than in Illustrator.

32
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.970
Illustrator has all sorts of ways to
combine shapes and break them apart and

33
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.110
clip them and things like that.

34
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.280
Sketch is a newer tool that took
the world by storm, if you go into any

35
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.700
development office today you're probably
gonna see a lot of designers using sketch.

36
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.350
And the reason for that is it's

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.450
really efficient at having
multiple ideas in one place.

38
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.050
So when I'm working with Sketch,

39
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.352
I can have an art board that shows a more
desktop-y view, a move mobile-y view.

40
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:27.352
Just like a bunch of lines,
some symbols, things like that, and

41
00:02:27.352 --> 00:02:31.527
they can all exist on the same page and
it really doesn't slow down.

42
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:35.909
It doesn't go like, [SOUND] And your
computer sounds like it's gonna fly away.

43
00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.325
I mean eventually you can make
an artboard that is just too much.

44
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:44.540
But Sketch is really good for that, Sketch
is really good at housing those things.

45
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.030
It's really good at reusable symbols,
so you can take a bunch of icons and

46
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.422
drop them into designs really well,
it's not good at exporting those symbols.

47
00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:57.960
I'm gonna talk a lot about that
tomorrow in the SVG animation course.

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.944
But Illustrator is way, way superior
in terms of their export because they

49
00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:06.991
have Dmitri Baranovski who is
the person who wrote snap SVG.

50
00:03:06.991 --> 00:03:10.801
So it's just like really, really awesome.

51
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:16.096
Sketch gives you all these nested groups
that are created in a way that's really

52
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:21.750
hard to optimize and even if you do,
it's not easy to animate or work with.

53
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.040
So there are some differences in the way
that they handle vector-y things.

54
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.780
All of these tools are awesome,
and none of them are wrong.

55
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.390
So you can make beautiful things
in every single one of them.

56
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.900
It's like when people say,
which JavaScript framework should I use?

57
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.962
Same kinda thing, same kinda thing.

58
00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:47.471
We're like, all get the job done,
it depends on personal preference for

59
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.719
some of this stuff.
