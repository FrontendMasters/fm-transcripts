&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Some image export tips.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.647
Something that has been found recently
is that if you double the image size,

3
00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:13.675
and reduce the quality to almost nothing,
and then shrink it down.

4
00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:19.234
It actually retains the same amount of
crispness as you probably want to get,

5
00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:23.190
but it doesn't look like
it's reduced quality.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.270
So you should try that and
see if you're actually getting

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.610
a much better image and transmitting
a much better image for that size.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.890
And I think there's a smashing
write-up about this.

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.110
TinyPNG, TinyJPG is really super awesome.

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.989
There's a number of ways to use it.

11
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
They have a web app so
you can use it online.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.630
I use a Photoshop extension that allows
me to export really fast with it.

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.670
They also have a desktop
application that you can use.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.010
It's really well done.

15
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.290
And a lot of times, I pull the image out
and the quality doesn't appear reduced,

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.980
and it's really effectively smaller.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.940
There are a lot of webpack
plugins that you can use.

18
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.790
I highly suggest you make them
part of your build process,

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.220
cuz then you don't have to think
about that too much anymore.

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.730
So even if you're working with designers
who aren't really paying attention to

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.640
the image export.

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.400
And there's a lot of them out there, so
you can actually check out a lot of them.

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.970
Some of the CLI tools that
create applications for

24
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.440
you already have them included.

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.175
So you might already be using
one without realizing it.

26
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:40.166
SVGOMG is super awesome for
optimizing SVG, I use that all the time.

27
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.900
It's a web-based tool, but
it's by Jake Archibald,

28
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.070
so of course it has service workers.

29
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.950
Which I like, because sometimes
I'm on planes without Wi-Fi and

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.800
I can still use it.

31
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.510
Because you just have to visit it once and
then it's cached in your browser.
