1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.240
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: What I'm going to do
is take the code pen that we were just

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.610
working on before, and
we're gonna add some fonts in here.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.880
And I said,
don't design in the browser and stuff.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.860
But that's okay, we're gonna do
this just as a quick thing today.

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.490
Normally, I would say, for some of your
original designs that you're starting from

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.580
scratch maybe lay them out and
take more care with them, but

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.100
we're doing this really quick together.

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.035
Okay, so we've got our nav and
we've got some text here.

9
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:44.545
I'm gonna add actually one more Lorem,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Thing

10
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.558
here,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Save.

11
00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:53.230
Cool, okay, let's go over to the Googly.

12
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.230
So we probably wanna pair a serif with
a sans serif or something like that.

13
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.100
So let's maybe find a nice
serif that might look good for

14
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.640
the design that we're working with.

15
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.960
I kind of like these, I've been pairing
recently a lot of these either sub

16
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.600
serifs or these kind of more
fancy serifs to be used for

17
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.010
giant text next to some of the san serif.

18
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.030
You don't have to do it that way,
you could totally reverse that also.

19
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.960
Let's maybe, I'm just gonna add this and

20
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.820
maybe we find something better,
but we'll just keep.

21
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.687
This one's also nice and
that's the nice thing,

22
00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:41.106
is I can kind of collect a few and
be like nah.

23
00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:44.599
All right, I've got three in there,
let's go look at them.

24
00:01:48.503 --> 00:01:51.104
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I think the Vidaloka
is kind of the most bold and

25
00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.317
I can see it the most clearly,
so I'm gonna use that one.

26
00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
I'm gonna remove a couple of these.

27
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.390
Now let's go back to looking
at just serifs or san-serifs.

28
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
so here's some san-serifs.

29
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.840
One nice thing is that they put
the most popular fonts at the top.

30
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
And the reason why this is important is
some people try to use fonts that are not

31
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.640
that popular because then your design
looks a little bit more unique,

32
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.470
that's totally great.

33
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.265
The other counter,
the kind of counter side of that is

34
00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:33.980
Ilya Grolovic, I can't say his last name.

35
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.660
There's a famous Google guy who talked
about how because Google's link href that

36
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.042
kind of request is usually cached in your
browser for some of the more popular ones.

37
00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:51.000
That because Open Sans is so popular,

38
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.610
you might not actually be including
that as a download cost for your site.

39
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.850
So you might be getting that for free for
a lot of people who are visiting your

40
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.494
site, because so
many people hit that URL up.

41
00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:06.612
So those are two things to think
about when selecting fonts,

42
00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:10.100
maybe that matters, maybe that doesn't.

43
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.418
It's also a hard thing to
measure because you don't know.

44
00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:17.989
[LAUGH] You don't necessarily
know that they have Open Sans

45
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.541
cached in their browser,
but maybe they do.

46
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.991
There's some kinda nice ones,

47
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:29.462
I'm gonna add Raleway, maybe, newly,

48
00:03:29.462 --> 00:03:34.262
maybe,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I don't know.

49
00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:39.209
Niramit, all right,
let's check these out again.

50
00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:44.441
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: You can
go look at some of these.

51
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:48.094
Since we know we're going to use Vidaloka,
Vidaloka?

52
00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:52.247
Yeah, you can see, this is what it
would look like with Open Sans,

53
00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:55.472
that's what it would
look like with Roboto.

54
00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:59.299
It kinda looks nice with Raleway,
actually.

55
00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.218
Lato,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: What do

56
00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:04.269
you guys think, Lato?

57
00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.041
Raleway?

58
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:06.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Raleway.

59
00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.640
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Raleway,
okay, let's do Raleway.

60
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.040
Did I already select Raleway?

61
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.150
Yes, yes I did, okay.

62
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.720
So now let's grab not everything.

63
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.496
Grab these, and
we're gonna add that to our

64
00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:28.895
pen here by adding it in the head, Save.

65
00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:38.769
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And then for
body, I'm going to grab Raleway.

66
00:04:42.297 --> 00:04:47.937
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And then h1, h2, h3.

67
00:04:53.235 --> 00:05:02.436
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm going to add,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Vidaloka.

68
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:05.784
Since it's a display already and
it's usually bold,

69
00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.520
I'm gonna also say font weight, normal.

70
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.820
Because for h1, h2, h3,
they're going to try

71
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.330
to change it to a bolder font.

72
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.294
But I don't need a bolder
version of that one, right?

73
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.550
So let's see, that is looking okay.

74
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.180
Maybe I can remove some of
the borders on some of these.

75
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.934
So I'm gonna get rid of,

76
00:05:37.242 --> 00:05:38.841
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Get rid of that,

77
00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:41.362
it's looking all right.

78
00:05:41.362 --> 00:05:47.505
I think I have on the h1,
a margin, is it margin or?

79
00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:52.536
Yeah, margin, and maybe we'll
make the h1 a little bit bigger.

80
00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:56.052
Font size,

81
00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:04.961
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's a little too big,

82
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:05.550
60.

83
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.020
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: See what it
looks like in the, come back here.

84
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.820
Cool, I'm also gonna add in,

85
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.716
I'm gonna put in a little bit
of padding on the side here.

86
00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:29.520
Or maybe I just increase the gutter width
because it's kinda smushy, isn't it?

87
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.380
It's just kinda squished together.

88
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.790
So for the gutter, let's see,
we've got good gap is ten.

89
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.580
I think it goes rows columns for
grid gap too.

90
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.140
So rows I'm kind of okay with 10 pixels,
but columns maybe 50 px.

91
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.369
That looks a little better, maybe 100.

92
00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:56.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: You probably
have to compensate somewhere else.

93
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.270
But yeah, that's starting to
look a little bit better.

94
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.670
Now let's take that image that we
had from before and upload it.

95
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.942
Let's,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This one,

96
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.638
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Go to File &gt; Open,

97
00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:18.809
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay?

98
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:26.091
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Now we're gonna have
a whole other section on better ways

99
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.050
to export for images.

100
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.440
I'm just doing this really quickly so
that we can see.

101
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.288
Let's do 1400 quality,

102
00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:44.192
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Don't matter.

103
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.245
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Assets,
you can actually go into photos and

104
00:07:56.245 --> 00:08:00.652
they have some that are just ready for
you in there and

105
00:08:00.652 --> 00:08:05.172
it kind of allows you to pick
what you want from these.

106
00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.461
That's pretty nice.

107
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:09.554
Okay, design assets.

108
00:08:19.343 --> 00:08:20.634
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Use the smaller one?

109
00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:28.060
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool,

110
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.490
they just added this,
I think, not too long ago.

111
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.240
Copy as background image, that's nice.

112
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.398
All right, let's go into the content area.

113
00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:45.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And we'll do,

114
00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:14.777
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Some are right,

115
00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:16.550
because its background image, sorry.

116
00:09:22.964 --> 00:09:25.476
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
letâ€™s remove the text here.

117
00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:48.387
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
the last thing we'll do is we'll add some

118
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:51.922
Lorem content in the footer area.

119
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:11.110
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, we're getting
pretty far for just a few hours.

120
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.130
Cool, we'll do more stuff
with this in just a second.

121
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.030
So we've got kind of our layout,
we've got some typography.

122
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.270
If we wanted to,
we could maybe even add a third font,

123
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.660
I don't know, to be kind of accent for
this area here.

124
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.510
But you can kinda see how
those typographical changes

125
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.170
can make the layout be
a little bit more strong.

126
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.920
So before we just had some squares and
stuff and

127
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.810
now we have a little bit more space
to work and things like that.
