&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
working with Photoshop, Quickeys.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.510
There are a million Photoshop, Quickeys.

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.790
And I know a lot of them, and
I probably only know a small portion.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.534
[LAUGH] I work very quickly in
Photoshop because of the Quickeys,

5
00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:17.252
but I probably don't
know all of them myself.

6
00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:21.466
There are some that are really worth
your time to commit to memory, and so

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.444
I put them here.

8
00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:25.133
These are really, really important.

9
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:29.117
So V makes the Move tool, so
that you can move things around.

10
00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:31.042
M is the Marquee tool.

11
00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:34.945
If you hit first, first the Marquee
tool will always be a rectangle.

12
00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:40.000
If you hit shift and M, then it'll go
to the next shape which is a circle.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.570
And that's true for all of them.

14
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.139
So if there's tools nested in tools,

15
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.972
if you need to flip between them
really quickly, you use the Shift key.

16
00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:50.772
G is a Paint bucket.

17
00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:53.110
If you hit Shift+G, you'll get a gradient.

18
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.640
D is Default colors.

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.400
So the default colors are always black and
white.

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.840
So you might get fill for
background and foreground.

21
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.952
You might have two different colors.

22
00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:05.242
Don't worry, I'm gonna work
in Photoshop in a minute and

23
00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:06.983
this will become a little
bit more clearer.

24
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:10.445
But if you need to get back
to those default colors, D,

25
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.400
you can actually use X
to make them switch.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.050
So if you have, if you have to
switch between foreground and

27
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.360
background color is really quick X.

28
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730
T is for Text.

29
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.640
Once you're in the text, you can't use
the Quickeys cuz it thinks it's text.

30
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.676
That one always catches me.

31
00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:29.420
[LAUGH] I'm always, wait, why does
it say V in the middle of my page?

32
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.750
I is the Eyedropper.

33
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.270
The Eyedropper tool is really great.

34
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.560
Because sometimes we wanna actually
pull colors out of images to use them,

35
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.390
and we're gonna do that
a little bit later today.
