00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:04.702
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Exercise,
time to pair some fonts.

2
00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:07.328
Take one of the compositions
you made earlier, and

3
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:10.208
turn the rectangles into
blocks of text with two fonts.

4
00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:20.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you were pairing
fonts earlier, some pairs you would sort

5
00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.862
of matter of factly declare that
they don't look good together.

6
00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:31.696
And I just wanna know what if
I don't detect that at all?

7
00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:35.319
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's okay,
some of these stuff is subjective.

8
00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.695
So if you don't agree like some of

9
00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:47.604
the stuff like,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This one.

10
00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:52.306
So is this like one of the examples or
was it the other one, was it?

11
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:57.548
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A lot of these, I don't
detect anything obviously bad and sort of

12
00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:04.243
what I'm wondering is if there's anything
more to it than taste or subjectivity.

13
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:07.916
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Well, if you can't tell
the difference between something like

14
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:12.268
this, pairing things that are opposite,
is a really good place to start for

15
00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:14.731
people who do notice those kind of things.

16
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:19.536
So again, pairing a display and
a sans-serif, or a serif and

17
00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:25.836
a sans-serif can kind of make sure that
you're covering that base a little bit.

18
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:30.434
I'm not saying that you have to
agree to that, and if you like this,

19
00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.296
then go for it by all means.

20
00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:35.548
But if you're like,
I wanna follow the rules but

21
00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:40.464
I just don't understand them,
then maybe kind of stick to what's safe,

22
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:45.006
which might be working with things
that are a little bit different.

23
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:50.240
So two things that are not super-similar,
or playing around with

24
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.075
that font joy thing that we saw earlier
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So

25
00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:03.066
this can be like the palette thing
that we talked about, right?

26
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:08.957
Where you keep playing around with
this until you find something

27
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:13.987
that does strike you,
that maybe you don't know why.

28
00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:16.965
I honestly, for
some of the color palettes, I'm like,

29
00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:20.577
I don't know why I like this color
palette, but I'm really into it.

30
00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:21.459
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

31
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.926
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I might know that
they're analogous or they're triad, but

32
00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:30.227
I don't really know why it
strikes me the way that it does.

33
00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:33.730
Some font pairings work the same way, so

34
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.088
you could work with it,
with this kind of machine-generated

35
00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:43.947
concept until you find
something that does strike you.

36
00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:44.541
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

37
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:45.230
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, no problem.

38
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.920
I'm gonna answer a couple
of questions that came in.

39
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.969
One was back from color.

40
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.768
It was a question about whether
LCh Lab color is additive or

41
00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:54.638
subtractive color mixing.

42
00:02:54.638 --> 00:02:59.231
Well, anytime you're working with
a computer, it's additive color mixing.

43
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:04.229
We might mimic some of the processes
of subtractive color mixing,

44
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:08.783
and we can adjust what we're
working with with Photoshop and

45
00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:13.620
Illustrator to be capable to be
in CMYK color mode for printing.

46
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.523
But really,
since it's coming through the screen,

47
00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:19.437
it's always gonna be the additive process,
right?

48
00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:25.070
That's what is creating those colors
under the hood from a very base level.

49
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.757
So great question.

50
00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:28.797
There was another question about,

51
00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:32.888
well, not a question as much as
comment about variable fonts, right?

52
00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:37.924
Yeah, variable fonts are really awesome,
I forgot to put them into the slide deck.

53
00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:41.596
If you're into variable fonts,
you should follow Mandy Michael.

54
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.899
She is amazing and
her code pens are awesome.

55
00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:50.134
She has this grass with variable fonts.

56
00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:53.524
How cool is that?

57
00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:56.302
My god, she is a genius.

58
00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.052
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The cool thing, too, is you
only need one font for every weight so

59
00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:00.826
you don't-
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Right, yeah, yeah,

60
00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:02.492
I should have explained that.

61
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.830
Variable fonts are like one
font that is bigger or smaller,

62
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.097
so let's actually look at it.

63
00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:19.653
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I think,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So you can see how it

64
00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:25.849
would grow, you see how it's growing,
like those little serify bits?

65
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:34.864
And then, dots get bigger, smaller,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Heavier weight,

66
00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:36.394
condensed.

67
00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:40.341
And so this is cool,
you just deliver one font.

68
00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:45.714
And if you're a dev working with
a designer who can't make up their minds,

69
00:04:45.714 --> 00:04:47.260
[LAUGH] that's okay.

70
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.901
You're not having to load a whole new
font every time they change their mind.

71
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:56.866
Or you can just decide, I like this
font but I want it just ever so

72
00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:59.701
slightly, more heavy or lighter.

73
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:03.819
Variable fonts are so awesome.

74
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.705
Mandy Michael does all sorts of
amazing things with fonts and texts.

75
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.408
These are real letters.

76
00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:16.817
It's not an SVG or something.

77
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:17.460
You can even cheat.

78
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.699
See how she's got content editable, so
I could probably write something here.

79
00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.793
I'm gonna write,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Tacos,

80
00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:33.411
[LAUGH] and let's see.

81
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:38.990
Yeah, fracturing the font, what?

82
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.264
I have a two reverse engineer collection.

83
00:05:42.264 --> 00:05:44.318
That's a private collection on CodePen.

84
00:05:44.318 --> 00:05:46.740
I just stick the things in there, and

85
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.382
then if I have like a long plane ride with
WiFi, I'll be like, break it, how to work.

86
00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:55.579
[LAUGH] I do that with
her stuff all the time.

87
00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:58.398
She had some mix and
match emoji things, too.

88
00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:04.908
Anyway, we will stop fan-girling over
Mandy Michael and continue our journey.
