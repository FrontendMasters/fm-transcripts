&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so
let's talk about where you get your fonts.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.530
Where are some of the,

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.300
they're not really foundries like
people call them type foundries.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.120
But they're not really
type foundries anymore.

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.180
But we still call them that.

6
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.415
There's like a lot of typographic terms
that are left over from the days of your,

7
00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.270
[LAUGH].

8
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.350
Okay, so Google Fonts.

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.340
Not spendy, super easy set up.

10
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.500
Probably a lot of you have used them.

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.322
I'm covering them here, just in case
someone is real new to the business.

12
00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:30.876
Font Squirrell, also not spending.

13
00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:35.730
Sometimes it's $0, sometimes it
can be like a low amount of money.

14
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.073
Sometimes for their more spending fonts,
they're sending you to another site but

15
00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.938
it lists a lot in that you can
kind of peel through them.

16
00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:46.012
One thing that I really like about
Font Squirrel is it has a generator.

17
00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:49.716
So if you do have a font from somewhere
else that doesn't have a web font,

18
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.238
you can come here and use their generator,
and it creates a web font,

19
00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:54.730
all of those things for you.

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.915
Fonts.com, it can be moderately spendy.

21
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.823
Slightly more difficult to set up because
they give you some of the code for it but

22
00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:08.792
not exactly the way that you would
use it like Google Fonts does.

23
00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:12.315
But one thing that I really like about
it is it has a tool called WhatTheFont.

24
00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:16.815
So if someone gives you a design and
they're like, we fired the designer and

25
00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:21.453
we never want to talk to that person
again, and like this is a flattened image,

26
00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.637
I don't know what font this is.

27
00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:27.087
You can take a screenshot of the font and
send it through WhatTheFont.

28
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:30.077
And it will use machine learning
to analyze the font for you and

29
00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:31.457
tell you what font it is.

30
00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:36.150
That's come in handy more
than once in my life.

31
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.620
[LAUGH] So that's a really,
really good one.

32
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.350
Hoefler, Hoefler is so great like
it's got this its typography.com.

33
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.750
And the fonts are beautiful,
but it is definitely spendy.

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.740
And don't even,
it's kind of like going to see

35
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.240
puppies if you don't want a puppy like
you shouldn't go play with puppies for

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.690
sale because you're gonna
come home with a puppy.

37
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.950
Like maybe don't go to this website
unless you're willing to spend money,

38
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.830
because you'll go and
you'll be like, aw, but I love it!

39
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.430
Come home with me.

40
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.650
[LAUGH] They do have some cool
subscription plans, like I use their cloud

41
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.250
subscription plan, which means that I pay
I think 300 bucks a year for six fonts.

42
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.590
The only thing is you have to use
their CDN if you use it that way.

43
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.840
So some companies just will
not let you use Hoefler,

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.800
that's just not an option for some people.

45
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.660
I think that's just with their
subscription plan, but I'm not positive.

46
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.740
I don't really remember.

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.780
They're beautiful fonts though.

48
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.750
There's really great stuff in there.

49
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.790
They present it so well.

50
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.340
It's really nice.
