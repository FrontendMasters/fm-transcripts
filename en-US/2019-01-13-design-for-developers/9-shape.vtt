00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.840
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
let's talk about shape.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.800
Shape is really important.

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.820
We started talking about triangles.

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.370
But there's all sorts of other pieces of
shapes that are really interesting and

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.500
important to understand.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.870
One thing is that circles draw
your eye more than other shapes.

7
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.900
If you look at all of
the shapes lined up here,

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.500
your eye probably keeps reverberating back
to that circle whether you like it or not.

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
That actually is a thing.

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.050
So there's this idea that's called
saccade where even when you're looking at

11
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.960
one image, your eye is constantly scanning
around in an event called saccade.

12
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
So it's always creating a spacial or
a mental map of what it's seeing.

13
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110
And I talk about this a lot
because it's really important.

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.570
That kind of scanning event is
where we pick up on certain things.

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.190
I mean, there are some things that
are more important than others.

16
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.984
Things that are moving are the most
important because if you are predator or

17
00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:54.822
prey, which we are both of.

18
00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:59.180
You want to either eat things that move or
run away from things that move.

19
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.730
So if something's moving,

20
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.550
your eye is like whoa whoa whoa go pay
attention to that before anything else.

21
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.050
We also notice bright colors,
because fruits, berries, we eat those too.

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.510
So if you ever have like an accent that's
a bright color that you want to draw

23
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.540
someone's eye to, that's important.

24
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.290
But it's also important because
of the circle concept, and

25
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.480
the reason why they think
that circles draw your eye.

26
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.640
So this is a kind of map using,

27
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.570
they actually scanned this person's
eye and kind of drew where the person

28
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.060
is looking while they're creating
that saccade shape with their eye.

29
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.300
So as they're scanning around, you can see
that they're scanning my entire face and

30
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.180
they kind of scan in a circle, but then
they get really drawn into the eye, right?

31
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.300
They get there's like a lot of kind
of saccade material right in the eye.

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.430
So both face and eyes have circles, and

33
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.360
that's probably why circles draw us in so
much is because your brain is like,

34
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.260
wait, I need to maybe recognize
this person and understand a face.

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.030
And that's also why humans
see faces everywhere,

36
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.600
you know they have those books of like
inanimate objects that are faces.

37
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.520
We love that, we just can't get
enough of this like idea that

38
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.500
clothing hook is like an octopus
who wants to fight us.

39
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.640
Or an outlet is like a smiling person or
something like that.

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.880
Okay, so this looks like it lines up.

41
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.380
But really the circle lives
a bit outside of that line.

42
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.030
If I line the circle up
perfectly with that line,

43
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.130
it would look like it was tucked in.

44
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.230
It would look like it wasn't lined up.

45
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.600
For some reason the edge of that
circle is compensated by our eye.

46
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.070
So if you do use a circle what you might
end up finding is that you're using

47
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.440
margin left, negative five, or something
to just push it out just a little bit.

48
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.390
And that will actually make it look
like it's compensated appropriately.

49
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.520
Diagonals are really dynamic.

50
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.737
We also really love diagonals and
we see them again and

51
00:03:01.737 --> 00:03:03.822
again actually in architecture.

52
00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:08.156
As like, whenever we're like this
is the supreme version of x thing,

53
00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:12.944
it's usually got a diagonal in it,
we don't use them a lot on the web though.

54
00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:15.515
But I'm gonna show you how
you can make them in code so

55
00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:17.660
that you can use them on your sites.

56
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.480
We're still stuck in table based
layouts even though we're not

57
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.370
in table based layout land anymore.

58
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.060
So we can talk about how it just shows up.

59
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.480
Any time people are like,
the greatest blah!

60
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.100
It's usually got a diagonal in it.

61
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.300
There's all these examples, you'll start
to see those everywhere as well too.

62
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.580
Partially because we don't see them quite
as often now, little bit more rare.

63
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.690
So if you wanna have
a dynamic composition that

64
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.770
isn't like a lot of other compositions
out there, throwing a diagonal in,

65
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.210
it's a pretty good way of doing that.

66
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.272
This Swiss design that I mentioned
earlier made lots of uses of diagonals.

67
00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.622
They used grid systems all the time.

68
00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:06.342
But they also crossed
through those grid systems,

69
00:04:06.342 --> 00:04:08.503
breaking them up with diagonals, too.
