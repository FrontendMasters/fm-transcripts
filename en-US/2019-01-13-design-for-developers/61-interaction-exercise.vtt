00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.885
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
so we have another exercise.

2
00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:05.294
You know how before we did
those compositions and

3
00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:08.523
some of you did it on paper where
we kind of made two compositions or

4
00:00:08.523 --> 00:00:10.300
three compositions on paper.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.118
This time,
I want you to make two thumbnails,

6
00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:18.343
meaning just notes to yourself, it doesn't
have to be something really fantastic.

7
00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:23.140
And take one of the thumbnails that you
like and turn it into a storyboard.

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.405
The bonus here,
if you choose to accept it,

9
00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.130
is to take that composition
that we made earlier.

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.617
And implement that storyboard or
thumbnail into that codepen, so

11
00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.790
make some sort of interaction.

12
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.209
And you could make the interaction
be really something small, so

13
00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:43.643
you could have just like an icon
changing or something like that.

14
00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:47.550
Or a menu opening, or it could be
something big like those page transitions,

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.510
it could completely changing
the shape of those layouts.

16
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.370
We know Grid now and we've worked a bit
with things, like Flexbox and stuff.

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.210
So you could change,

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.630
with Transforms, the way that
everything's laying out on the page.
