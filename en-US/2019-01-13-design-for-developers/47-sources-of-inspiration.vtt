00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.580
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
let's go to Give n Go.

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.669
It's a curated gallery of dribble shots
reworked as interactive code pens.

3
00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.227
So basically people take what's on
dribble and they recreate it, so

4
00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:15.572
a lot of times people are posting gifs and
things on dribble but they don't really

5
00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:20.702
know how to make it in code and so people
will take that and remake them in code.

6
00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:24.165
And some of them are pretty
good practice for

7
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:29.470
front ends who want to learn their skill,
test their skills.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.040
And some of them are pretty interactive,
as well.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.240
I really like this one.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.460
Where is it?

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.660
This one here.

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.550
That's really nice.

13
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.730
Here we go.

14
00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.527
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So that's pretty
different because he's actually using

15
00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.309
material design to get that done, but

16
00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.360
it's a real thing that you can really play
with and really check out the code of.

17
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.600
So you can kind of explore this site and
see all of these different

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.340
people taking stuff from Dribble, and
you can actually even submit your own so

19
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.130
you can say like I used this Dribble
thing and I recreated in code.

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.466
Check it out and may add it to the site.

21
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.490
So that's pretty cool.

22
00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We talked about
Swiss Design and how I liked it earlier.

23
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.900
I actually used Swiss Design for
the first time I practiced grid.

24
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.270
So I started to learn grid by
doing that grid garden thing.

25
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.840
And then I made this thing,

26
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.400
which I added some animation
bits cuz that's who I am.

27
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.900
[LAUGH] And so then it reconfigures for
responsive, and the grid changes.

28
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.560
For each different version
we talked about min/max.

29
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.390
You can still use media
queries with grid too.

30
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.890
The code for this is probably
not the best code in the world,

31
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.150
this literally the first
time I ever tried grid.

32
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.880
But taking some of those Swiss Designs,
and

33
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.530
they are just like so ripe for
practicing grid on, I think.

34
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.530
You could take one of them.

35
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.900
And definitely in the Code Pen I
give credit to the original design.

36
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.070
I have a picture of it and
say where I got it from and stuff.

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.900
So you can put in the detail section.

38
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700
Hey I'm working from this source.

39
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.680
Clearly like the first one
wasn't animated, right?

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.750
That was all my reinterpretation of stuff.

41
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050
But it's really good practice.

42
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.490
You can learn through play.

43
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.991
My friend Miriam Suzanne,
the one I mentioned before,

44
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:28.290
who made suzie css framework.

45
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.740
Was also working with grid and
she was learning view as well.

46
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.140
So she started to learn transition
groups by making this like battle

47
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.510
ground scene and like made all of this.

48
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.660
Somebody asked if you could
put grids inside grids,

49
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.010
she definitely did that with this pen.

50
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.280
And it's really cool, I mean you can
change the size of it, the grid gap,

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.570
the number of invaders,
she's got that cool hover effect on stuff.

52
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.440
So that's, pretty awesome.

53
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.946
So you can kind of learn through play as
well, depending on what you wanna make.

54
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.401
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This is like a really
really cool thing if you wanna

55
00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:12.245
work with a design really quickly and
kind of get up to speed really quickly.

56
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:14.775
There are UI kit out there for purchase.

57
00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:17.605
So you can use them absolutely.

58
00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:19.735
So you can go to something
like Shutterstock or

59
00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.535
Istock photo, write UI kit, and
a bunch of stuff like these comes up.

60
00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:28.000
And granted, they're not all gorgeous and
amazing, but

61
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.600
some of them are a pretty
good place to start.

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.650
Like, some of these I might not use
right out of the gate, but I might say,

63
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.410
like, that's kind of what I want.

64
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.680
Let's take that, buy it for $40 or
whatever, and change all the fonts

65
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.160
around and change some of the layout
around and add different photos and stuff.

66
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.130
By the end, it's not the UI kit, right?

67
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.590
By the end, if you haven't really used
the UI kit exactly the way that it looks.

68
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.030
But you're even allowed to
cuz that's what they're for.

69
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.480
They're literally online for that purpose.

70
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.260
So if you wanna start from something
that's not starting from scratch

71
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.100
that can be a really good way to do it,
too.

72
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.310
If you want to work with Photoshop,
and create,

73
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.570
take an image, and make it fantastic and
do all sorts of stuff,

74
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.940
there's a, Instagram, and
filters, and things like that, but

75
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.780
there's also on places like
Creative Market, Photoshop Actions.

76
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.936
So these actions will do any
number of things to your images.

77
00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:30.944
So if you wanna do something
more spectacular, or

78
00:04:30.944 --> 00:04:35.898
whatever, you can click, you can load it
in as a plug-in, and click the button.

79
00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:40.623
And then it will create these
bright whites or a stroke affect or

80
00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:45.259
half tones and all sorts of stuff
that can take a normal image,

81
00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.147
that's just from unsplash or something,
and maybe make it posterized or give

82
00:04:51.147 --> 00:04:57.514
it some sort of stylistic difference that
is different from where you started from.

83
00:04:57.514 --> 00:05:01.315
And then even if you're using something
from unsplash and someone else's used it,

84
00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:02.771
yours is just quite different.

85
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:08.275
And it can communicates a different thing.

86
00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:12.635
I don't know if you guys have seen this
before but Codepen has a patterns section,

87
00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:17.465
so if you go to Codepen, actually let's
go to Codepen, so we can go there and

88
00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:20.885
they are like accordions and
menu icons and grids and

89
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:25.705
star ratings and tabs and breadcrumbs and
buttons, so we are going to buttons.

90
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:29.810
And there's all sorts of
cool buttons in here.

91
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.700
Like all of them MIT licensed.

92
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.270
[LAUGH] So
you can really reverse engineer things and

93
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.280
learn how things are done,
or even try them yourself.

94
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.460
And there's tons of stuff to learn.

95
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.260
From reverse engineering and
checking out other people's styles.

96
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.390
This is not a hover style I
would have ever thought to make.

97
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.800
I would not have thought to do that.

98
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.560
But it's kinda cool, I might look at that,
sleep on it, and make something else

99
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.450
tomorrow where there's some sort of
curve or return, and it's not theirs.

100
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.220
It's just this concept,

101
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.090
that when you hover,
something turns, something like that.
