00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.320
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right let's check
out some of the things that people made.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.880
All right let's start with Andrea, cool.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.030
Okay so you can see how this would be kind
of like maybe this would be the fold,

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.000
you start with like a logo here, nav,
three, and then this is really awesome.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.100
That's kind of like the sunset

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.740
in the background over a bunch
of different lines of text.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.630
That's awesome.

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.160
I love the diagonal that goes across here,
that really breaks up the space great.

9
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:33.725
Cool, we've got another circle.

10
00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.245
People taking good advantage of circle.

11
00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:40.745
I like how they didn't move
around the circle either.

12
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:43.995
It's actually in front of the other thing.

13
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:46.808
So one thing we didn't talk about yet

14
00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:52.632
is an idea of things moving backwards and
forwards on the z axis in space too.

15
00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:55.590
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Lovely, lovely.

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.300
I love this one.

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.970
This one's Jacob, right?

18
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.820
Great one by Jacob.

19
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.880
So there's, here's a few different ones.

20
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.100
This one is like, maybe you can
imagine being built an SVG or

21
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.850
something because it's got some
other different kind of shapes and

22
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.350
we're gonna talk about how
to do this in a minute.

23
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.500
We've got a couple of circles that
are kind of bordering this one, and

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.580
a little cutout of this one.

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.610
These are really cool.

26
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.220
Right, sideways layout,
yeah, that's right.

27
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.762
Well, [LAUGH] I think we're supposed
to turn our heads to see this one.

28
00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:25.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So we've got a circle.

29
00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:26.816
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
Couldn't get it to rotate.

30
00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.860
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: [LAUGH] Right,
right, right.

31
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.190
Circle and, what's really cool about this
is that the shape is actually diagonal and

32
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.830
kind of off kilter but
the text is still straight within that.

33
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.270
So you're not like rotating the text.

34
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.770
It's still really legible.

35
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.630
That's really awesome.

36
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.778
I think that that's it for.

37
00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:50.860
Our layouts, yeah.

38
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.470
Cool.

39
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.420
Okay lets move on.

40
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.300
So how did people find that exercise?

41
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.220
Good, good?
Kind of helps break down

42
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.670
some of the shapes and

43
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.110
kind of helps you be creative inside of
your compositions without feeling like.

44
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.050
It's the end of the world right?

45
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.000
If you spend forever lining
things up in Photoshop,

46
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.160
even if it's before you're sketch or
whatever.

47
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.525
Even if it's before you're committing
to code you might feel like.

48
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:23.990
Man I made this whole block of text and
everything I committed to this and

49
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.974
then you kind of locked into that thing.

50
00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:30.459
Once you already have stuff there it's
really tough to kind of think about

51
00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.942
a whole new way of reorganizing
all of that information.

52
00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:38.620
So by breaking it down into just simple
shapes and kind of removing yourself.

53
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.560
From those details they are able to
experiment a little bit more in kind of

54
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.520
break free of some of the things
that you would normally just kind of

55
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.460
make yourself beholden to
just the giant text box.
