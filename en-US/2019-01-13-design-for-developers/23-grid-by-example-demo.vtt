00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: It's demo time,
this one's gonna be a hard demo for

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.470
me to do, so
I'm gonna make a lot of mistakes.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.750
Don't worry, we'll still get it done,
[LAUGH] But regular dev and

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.510
regular life is gonna be
mistake-ridden anyway.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.467
So okay, let's open up that
layout that we had before, and

6
00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.840
we had a bunch of different layouts,
right?

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.210
What I'm gonna do, instead of building it
from scratch because I think that would

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.820
take a while and
I also think that this is more

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.360
true to life,
we're gonna go to gridbyexample.com.

10
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.050
And we're gonna go to
the experts since I said

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.240
about a million times
that I'm not an expert.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.930
We're gonna look at some of the examples
and patterns and we're gonna see what

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.270
closely fits what we're already working
with and then modify it because.

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.570
I think that's probably where you're gonna
start in real life probably, probably?

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.350
So okay,
we've got a bunch of examples here.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.040
And in her videos, she has these
videos that get you started for

17
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.350
each one of them, and videos that
you can watch for each one of them.

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.208
And she has all of these cool
examples to check out, right?

19
00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:17.480
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I see tons and tons.

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.630
So if you wanted that composition and
to just fancy it up,

21
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.260
it already is there, you could just
grab it and then manipulate it.

22
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.340
So let's look at some of these here.

23
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.613
Okay, cool.

24
00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:38.860
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, and
then let's look at some of the patterns.

25
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.860
Pretty neat.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.990
This is really nice too, that's like
something everybody makes sense of.

27
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
So if we look back at our layout,
I would say

28
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.310
probably the first one is most
similar to something I already saw.

29
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.150
This one, I think,
something like that I saw already, so

30
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.720
let's go back here, in examples.

31
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.540
This, no clearing required,
looks pretty similar, yeah?

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.952
It's got an implicit height, we're
gonna manipulate it, but that's pretty,

33
00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:17.638
pretty close, we got this,
yeah, just a bit wider version.

34
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.095
Okay, so let's open this up and

35
00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:25.461
I'll make the text a little bit bigger.

36
00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.832
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so
what we've got here is we've got,

37
00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:33.120
I'm gonna title this CSS really quick.

38
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.450
The other thing that I like to do, and you
don't necessarily have to do this, but I

39
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.440
think it will probably save you some time,
is to use normalize and autoprefixer.

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.210
Then you don't have to add
prefixes to everything, and

41
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.880
then normalize will keep those.

42
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.140
There's a lot of weird things that
the browser assumes you want like

43
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.870
padding on the body and
stuff that you probably don't want.

44
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.290
So Normalize helps you clear out all
of those crazy styles and autoprefixer

45
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.230
will keep you from having to write all of
the prefixes, so I'm gonna add those in.

46
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.242
I'm also gonna add SCSS as
a preprocessor because I like it,

47
00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:11.161
you don't have to use something like that.

48
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:16.061
So okay, we've got a body with
a margin of 40 pixels, so

49
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:22.120
that's what's keeping that to
be 40 pixels around there.

50
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.820
Then we've got our grid area,
sidebar, content, header, footer,

51
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.060
we saw what that does earlier,
that was pretty cool?

52
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.900
And she's doing this really
nice thing here where she's

53
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.970
lining it up, she only really needs
one period to make that space.

54
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.630
Instead, she's drawing
all the periods out so

55
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.850
that it's clear what's going on there,
neat?

56
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.278
I like that.

57
00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:57.000
Okay, so for grid-template-columns,

58
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.162
I'm gonna change this to repeat(3,

59
00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:10.180
1fr) so then we have it just going across.

60
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.201
I'm actually going to
explicitly say to this wrapper

61
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:22.352
that what I want you to be
is width 100 field width and

62
00:04:22.352 --> 00:04:27.462
height, 100 view height, okay, cool.

63
00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:31.484
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Wait, first I have
to fork it in order to save it,

64
00:04:31.484 --> 00:04:35.988
that's a big thing if you're using that
thing, I'm gonna keep this private for

65
00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:38.340
now and then I'll open it up.

66
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.170
Well actually, I'll just leave it
public so that people can find it easy.

67
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.706
And okay, so now we've got

68
00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:52.390
this,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Browser.

69
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.900
The body has this margin of 40,
which we want,

70
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.943
if we go back to our Photoshop document,
that's what we want here vaguely.

71
00:05:03.943 --> 00:05:07.478
But it's extending beyond here and
that's not great, so

72
00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:10.310
what we're gonna have to do is use calc.

73
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.276
And if you're not familiar with calc,
what we can do here is say,

74
00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:21.698
all right, what we want is not
a width of 100 view width,

75
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:27.150
we want calc 100 view width minus,
what was, 40?

76
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.070
Yeah, okay 80 pixels, so
double the amount there, yeah?

77
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.600
Makes sense?

78
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.220
Cuz that was 40, so
that wasd double one on each side, yeah?

79
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.000
Okay, now everyone was like,
no, yes, okay.

80
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.432
Same with the height, except we're
gonna change that to view height.

81
00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:55.413
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, getting a little
closer, cool, we didn't even do much and

82
00:05:55.413 --> 00:05:56.870
we're getting there.

83
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.220
All right, so we've got the header,
the content, and the footer.

84
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.790
Let's look back at the document.

85
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.631
That header is the implicit height,
you've got 80 pixels or

86
00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:10.834
something like that, and
the footer is the same implicit height, so

87
00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.816
80 pixels or something,
let's just do that.

88
00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:18.693
Let's go, so the grid template columns,

89
00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:24.382
grid template areas,
I think it's grid template

90
00:06:24.382 --> 00:06:29.899
rows,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: It will be,

91
00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I think this is right,

92
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.671
80px, 1fr,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That seem good?

93
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:45.581
Yes, okay, cool.

94
00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:49.918
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This
footer is wrong though,

95
00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:53.570
because remember in our Photoshop
document, we had it start here.

96
00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.068
So I'm actually gonna make the footer
do the same thing as the header does.

97
00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:03.418
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Better?

98
00:07:03.418 --> 00:07:04.590
Yeah, cool!

99
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.090
In terms of that text on the side,

100
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.860
I'm just gonna absolute fix position
that to the side or absolutely position.

101
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.910
So absolutely position, if I want it to
stay and then scroll up with the page.

102
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.420
But I actually wanna do it fixed so
that it's just like constantly there and

103
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.850
if there's stuff below the fold,
it stays there.

104
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.340
That's just a decision I'm making,
you don't have to do that but

105
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.780
that might be fun.

106
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.550
In order to make room for that in
the sidebar though, we need to push

107
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.780
the sidebar over so we have room for
that text to fix position layout there.

108
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.765
So really we want
the width to be 80 pixels,

109
00:07:42.765 --> 00:07:49.630
let's see, we want it to be -120 maybe?

110
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.246
And then its shorter and
then we move it over with some margin.

111
00:07:55.246 --> 00:08:01.457
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Margin left,
[INAUDIBLE] let's start there,

112
00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:06.393
and 40 pixels, I think it should be

113
00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:10.385
bigger, maybe 60 pixels.

114
00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:17.105
[INAUDIBLE] I guess we're getting there,

115
00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:24.430
so now we've got that little piece here.

116
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.490
And inside here,
I'm gonna do what I said earlier,

117
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.930
where I just lay out those with either
inline block or display flex and

118
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.140
then I'm gonna position
absolute that logo over there.

119
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.600
So it's okay for it to take up that space,
we're not gonna fill that block normally.

120
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.467
So I can actually have another div here,

121
00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:53.006
it's gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Div

122
00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:58.468
class side text,
I don't know, naming is hard,

123
00:08:58.468 --> 00:09:03.360
and then I'm gonna say Laurem and
then tab.

124
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.063
If you're not familiar with Emmett, that's
another thing to get good at because if

125
00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:11.323
you use Emmett then you can
build layouts really quickly.

126
00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:15.960
It could be like, actually let's
do that for the header right now.

127
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.844
Let's say ULLI times 4,

128
00:09:21.844 --> 00:09:27.283
of course it doesn't
work when I'm doing them.

129
00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:34.405
Okay, let's do LI times 4,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,

130
00:09:34.405 --> 00:09:37.420
now it's working,
I probably hit something wrong.

131
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.189
So now I can say, Thing, Taco,

132
00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:50.697
Tacopants,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: other tacos,

133
00:09:50.697 --> 00:09:56.467
your normal Nav content,
[LAUGH] That you have,

134
00:09:56.467 --> 00:10:01.383
I always just use tacos for everything.

135
00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:05.348
Even secret login names, so
now if you see tacopants online,

136
00:10:05.348 --> 00:10:08.580
you're gonna be like, that's Sarah.

137
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.330
So okay, we're gonna take this text,
I'm gonna eliminate some of the text and

138
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.350
make it a little bit shorter.

139
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.461
Probably we don't want all of this stuff.

140
00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:26.495
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool, and then for
the side text I'm gonna say,

141
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:36.925
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Position fixed left 0,

142
00:10:36.925 --> 00:10:41.814
I just always start from left 0, top 0 so

143
00:10:41.814 --> 00:10:45.040
I can change it from there.

144
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.302
0, 0, then I'm going to go maybe 20 px?

145
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:57.070
No, 40 px, and
then before we change the top,

146
00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.888
let's actually transform it.

147
00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:06.193
Transform, rotate 90 degrees.

148
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:11.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There we go.

149
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.738
Now, maybe left is,

150
00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:22.369
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: -30, top is 120,

151
00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:26.846
maybe, no, not even close.

152
00:11:26.846 --> 00:11:32.542
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This

153
00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:39.440
is an exact science,
everyone [LAUGH] Let's say 205.

154
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.190
But now if I had more content on the page
that would just stay stuck there, and

155
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.170
then I could scroll.

156
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.820
And it would just be a little decorative
bit and/or have some information in there,

157
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.106
depending on what you want.

158
00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:56.120
So we're good,
we're doing pretty well here.

159
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.873
Let me actually make this nav a thing

160
00:12:00.873 --> 00:12:05.000
real quick, we have another?

161
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.762
Yeah, we have the header,

162
00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:13.075
so I'm gonna say,

163
00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:18.920
UL display inline block, no?

164
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.500
Wanna do display flex, there we go.

165
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.757
And then we'll do LI list

166
00:12:27.757 --> 00:12:33.282
style,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And

167
00:12:33.282 --> 00:12:37.997
then let's give it some margin, so

168
00:12:37.997 --> 00:12:44.224
margin 0,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: 30px 0, 0.

169
00:12:47.494 --> 00:12:52.090
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That is way too big,
maybe 20px, and

170
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.966
then this will get a padding-left: 0,

171
00:12:56.966 --> 00:13:02.410
because there's an implied padding on ULs.

172
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.904
So then I'll add a back in and

173
00:13:06.904 --> 00:13:11.230
say, margin left 20px.

174
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.027
Actually no, I don't want that,
I want it to be its own color, so

175
00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:19.020
the header actually,
I don't want that to have that background.

176
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.768
I'm gonna say, color is black,

177
00:13:25.768 --> 00:13:31.070
and then I'm gonna remove

178
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.854
the background color here,

179
00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:46.300
this needs to color
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Shouldn't that be that?

180
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.869
No, we have another color.

181
00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:55.105
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
now this one goes there,

182
00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:59.716
I don't want that margin left.

183
00:13:59.716 --> 00:14:04.116
And there's some background
colors that I don't want, but

184
00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:06.798
I don't want, let's see, I want.

185
00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:10.975
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: To get rid off this.

186
00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:19.384
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And cool, maybe we want
just to put a border on these boxes so

187
00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:21.281
we can see them for now.

188
00:14:27.744 --> 00:14:31.008
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, so you can
kinda see where we're going with this,

189
00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:32.378
we're getting there.

190
00:14:32.378 --> 00:14:35.192
For the sidebar,
I'm gonna put in some content so

191
00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:39.012
that we have stuff to work with,
so probably the sidebar will have,

192
00:14:41.016 --> 00:14:46.146
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: h1 something big,

193
00:14:46.146 --> 00:14:54.303
[LAUGH] And then ptag with lorem.

194
00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:02.859
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This text is really big,
I think she has a font size, yeah,

195
00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:04.648
font size 150, okay.

196
00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:11.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, we have
a layout, that was a few minutes, cool.
