00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's
talk about inspiration and

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.450
particularly how to be inspired by people.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.360
And not rip them off because there's kind
of like an interesting line there, right?

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.130
You can really really
like someone stuff and

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.610
then sometimes you can like Veer into the.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.210
Land of copying them too much, so
how do we get inspired by people and

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.190
not copy them?

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.890
Or maybe intentionally copy them,
but not publicize that piece?

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.640
So Dan Mall has some really
great content about this.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.770
Dan Mall is a designer, unlike me,
who is a faux designer.

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.450
I'm like a developer who design,
he's but his job is a designer.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.480
I'm a firm believer in the idea that
there's nothing new under the sun.

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.860
Said differently, everything is a remix.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.160
Free from the pressure that
all things designers do

15
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.790
need to be original works of art.

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.910
I can instead focus on
what my sources to combine

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.290
in an unique way that my
audience is less accustomed to.

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.030
So he has a essay called stealing
your way to original designing.

19
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.060
He lays out some principles on
what the differences are and

20
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.550
especially this idea of remixing.

21
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.100
That you can use from different sources
as long as you keep remix singing and

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120
key pre-mixing.

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.760
So one thing about inspiration
is looking around.

24
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.620
I actually think that it's a really good
idea to look around especially before you

25
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.830
start designing there are some
places that you can check out.

26
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.000
Dribble, Behance, CodePen,
Glitch, CodeSandbox.

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.110
Those are just a number of different
designer resources out there.

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.280
And finding your heroes is
a good idea because you

29
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.200
can kinda sit in your own box, in your
own mind and only understand so much.

30
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.530
But when you look around and see all
sorts of different ways of working.

31
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.640
You kind of enrich what tools are in
your toolbox visually as well,

32
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.070
you can say I didn't know that you
could maybe place text that way.

33
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.610
That's a pretty good idea.

34
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.750
Or like,
what if I broke things out of bounds?

35
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.900
Earlier we saw those scale and
cropping ideas.

36
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.330
That's a concept, right?

37
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.940
That's something that you can employ.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.890
You're not necessarily having
to take a Swiss layout and

39
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.560
then steal the Swiss layout.

40
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.420
You could take the idea of taking
an image and blowing it up and

41
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.800
reusing, that wouldn't be stealing
from those designers, right?

42
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.140
So get inspired by multiple sources but
here's what I would ask you to do.

43
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.170
Wait.

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.710
So take that insp folder that we
made when we first started doing,

45
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.720
dump a bunch of things in there, find all
of these things that really appeal to you.

46
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120
And then sleep on it for a night and
don't make something yet.

47
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.900
And then try to work from memory.

48
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.870
So it's very very hard to exactly
copy a reference it you're not

49
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.100
looking at it directly and you've
given yourself some time to process.

50
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.820
And it might be that when you stop and
you don't look at it for

51
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.780
a little while, things kind of
recombine in your imagination

52
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.060
in a way that is totally unique,
that's not like.

53
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.470
Either this source or this source.

54
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.860
So that's a suggestion on how to learn and
grow and look at new ideas and

55
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.680
things and find your own tone and
your own path.

56
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.270
Also revisit.

57
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.390
If there was a particular design
you were like super into and

58
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.950
you were working from memory and you kept
thinking about it, look at it again.

59
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.090
Maybe it's totally different, but if you
look at and you're like this is the same,

60
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.780
then you should change it or
toss it out and start again.

61
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.810
So there are a number of ways of working
even if you're getting inspired.

62
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.800
I also think that you should look at
other disciplines for inspiration.

63
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.170
All too often we stay on the web
there's like a whole tradition of

64
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.320
human history that happened way
before the last 40, 50 years.

65
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.540
Don't limit yourself to just the web.

66
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.450
Look at this book.

67
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.620
I mean, this is a book full of etchings
where someone, cut out Little pieces

68
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.680
of etchings until it recombined and
created an entirely new art piece.

69
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.090
That art piece isn't the etchings in the
book but it is the etchings in the book.

70
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.220
There's tons of art projects that
you can check out or art books,

71
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.600
you can also listen to music, music can
also kind of inspire, creative ideas.

72
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.250
We watch movies,
read comic books, watch anime.

73
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.300
We're talking about anime earlier.

74
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.160
There's all sorts of different
things that might inform your work.

75
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.440
We were watching
Neon Genesis Evangelion earlier and

76
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.870
there's all these dynamic cuts in
the way that they like explode things.

77
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.105
And like show things from really
interesting angles that you could actually

78
00:04:56.105 --> 00:05:01.160
re-use to think about
diagonals being dynamic or

79
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.100
colors, or blur, or changing styles all of
a sudden that are really good ideas for

80
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.400
the web that maybe aren't
that used that much.

81
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.200
It doesn't have to just be stuff for
the web.

82
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.010
So, one thing that you can do,
is do this idea of master copies.

83
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.790
And that's something that
we did in painting, a lot.

84
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.110
Was this, you might even see people
at museums do this, sometimes.

85
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.130
There might be some, a painting, and

86
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.950
then someone is sitting in front of
the painting, painting the painting.

87
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.190
Why are they doing that?

88
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.500
Well, you can learn a lot by
trying to copy those strokes.

89
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.510
The idea, when someone does a master copy
is not that they're gonna show that master

90
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.020
copy to everybody and be like,
this is mine [LAUGH].

91
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.050
That's not what they're doing.

92
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.670
They're trying to learn how to paint
using some of those old styles.

93
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.610
It's very similar to reverse
engineering actually.

94
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.650
They're trying to understand how all
the brush strokes were laid out.

95
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.470
And you can kind of look at code and
be like, it works like that.

96
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.850
But if you actually go thru and reverse
engineer something and play with the code.

97
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.430
You know it in more certain terms.

98
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.660
It's the same kind of idea.

99
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.710
So, if you wanted to take something
from Dribble or something like that.

100
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.070
And just as practice, copy it and
bring it into illustrator or

101
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.860
Photoshop or Sketch, and try to figure
out how they made all those pieces.

102
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.280
You probably learn a lot.

103
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.690
You might not be able to show people,
[LAUGH] at the end, but you might

104
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.350
be able to show people the thing you make
after that, which might be a lot richer.

105
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.610
So if you ever have an afternoon where
you're trying to practice design,

106
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.770
it's a good idea to make
one of those copies.

107
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.010
You just can't claim it as your own.
