00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.960
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: In photography,
there's this idea of rule of thirds.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.750
And that rule of thirds can actually
carry across to the web design and

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.350
development as well.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.010
This rule of thirds is if
you take a composition,

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.700
you break it down into three pieces.

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.330
And you pick one of those thirds and

7
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.520
put the key part of the composition
there instead of right in the middle.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.140
In can actually help
the composition by a great deal.

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.460
And there's also an idea
of triad compositions.

10
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.940
I love triad compositions.

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.630
Once I tell you this you'll start
to see them everywhere, I swear.

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.290
So, if you look at this composition
we start from her hand in the corner,

13
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.490
it goes down all the way to that cloth
here, then it moves over to his foot,

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.940
and then it goes back up to her arm,
that's the composition.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.690
So it kind of draws here, here, here, so

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.400
you can see how there's triangles
within this composition.

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.080
This is very intentional.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.950
There's lots of things written about
this in old medieval texts because

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.760
it keeps your eye from leaving the canvas.

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.380
Your eye is constantly circling
instead of coming to the canvas and

21
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.400
dropping off, it goes back.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.780
It circles back through and
it goes back up.

23
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.260
So there's tons and tons of triangles in
canvases, especially post Caravaggio,

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.320
there's a lot of this idea that
you'll see again and again.

25
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.710
So here's some triad
compositions in painting.

26
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.790
You can see in my brand shot.

27
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.720
There's a triangle.

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.640
It goes into that shadow, right,
like the guy who's laying there,

29
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.640
it goes up to her umbrella.

30
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.570
It goes back down and
across where the dogs are.

31
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.820
These are very intentional.

32
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.910
That guy is positioned perfectly so
that he can draw a triangle with your eye.

33
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.560
This is the Edo style print here,
kind of going down, over, across, back up.

34
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.660
And the same with the Swiss
design composition.

35
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.480
We're going to talk about Swiss design
a bunch today because its a really

36
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.000
interesting, dynamic composition to study.

37
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.166
So we get to see these triangles again.

38
00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:15.518
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So, Swiss design is
kinda famous for using large, flat,

39
00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.244
geometric shapes.

40
00:02:17.244 --> 00:02:22.725
And really some things are kind of subtly
using and making and breaking grids.

41
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:26.165
Swiss design is not subtly using and
making and breaking grids.

42
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:31.385
Swiss design is using and making and
breaking grids very very cleanly,

43
00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:36.512
very obviously and if you ever
want to you know kind of study or

44
00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:40.752
make master copies of things, Swiss
design is a really great place to do so.

45
00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:42.712
We're gonna do that a little bit,

46
00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.462
I'm gonna show you a couple
examples of that today.
