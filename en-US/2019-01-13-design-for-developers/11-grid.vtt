00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.710
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So there's a book
called Making and Breaking the Grid.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.820
If you want to learn about grid and
composition, this is the best material.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.400
It's like unlike the 20 million version
I think because people still go to,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.090
people still teach it in design school.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.990
If you go to a design school the first
thing they're gonna tell you

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.100
is to buy this book because it is really,
really important.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.470
It is really important
to understand grids.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380
Even if you don't wanna use them.

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.500
Even if you don't wanna use them,

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.330
you should understand why you're
breaking those rules, right?

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.200
It's kind of like the design
version of best practices, right?

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.880
You should know best practices, and then
if you don't do them at least you know why

13
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.110
you're not doing that or
why are the best practices important?

14
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
Actually there's a good joke
about this that somebody asked.

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.230
Do developers have any superstitions?

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.300
And the answer is yeah, best practices.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.280
[LAUGH] So
this book is really a great one, and

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.230
it's kind of an old-school one, but they
keep it up to date with new examples and

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.260
stuff and it's really awesome.

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.210
So what do I mean by using a grid and
making a grid?

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.020
Well, one of the things that we're
doing when we create with grids, and

22
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.070
it doesn't necessarily have to be just one

23
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.770
solid grid that you're following
every piece of that grid.

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
But it's really this idea that you're
anchoring things to one another,

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.170
that things aren't just thrown
around on your design, that you have

26
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.650
many different elements, they all
have a thing that they're locking to.

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.430
Because look at that line at the top,
right?

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.100
That's like a really curvy,
not part of a grid system line.

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.150
They're breaking the grid in
order to bring that line.

30
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.750
But everything is anchored
to something else.

31
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.495
Nothing is just thrown onto to the page.

32
00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:54.515
And if I took this design and

33
00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:58.335
just moved things a little bit,
so they weren't anchored anymore.

34
00:01:58.335 --> 00:01:59.545
You wouldn't like it anymore.

35
00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:01.275
I know it's sounds crazy, but

36
00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:06.035
you would be like it feels disorganised,
it just feels little chaotic.

37
00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:10.545
So this idea of anchoring things to one
another in order to bring them on to

38
00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:16.100
the picture, and they're not even anchored
in a way where like A goes to B, goes to C

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.160
goes to D it's not the thing at the bottom
is anchored to the thing on the side.

40
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.477
The patterns in design baseline, is lined
up here, that nationwide remember we

41
00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:30.854
talked about curves and circles needing to
etch out a little bit from those lines,

42
00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:33.151
that's what they're doing right there.

43
00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:39.473
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This is another one of
those things where once I explain this and

44
00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:42.050
you see it,
you will not stop seeing it anywhere.

45
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.966
So you can pull down
designs from Kripal and

46
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:50.155
start to draw lines across them and
be like, look at all the anchoring.

47
00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:52.963
[LAUGH] People are anchoring
all the time and

48
00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:56.785
that's a way that people keep
those designs consistent.

49
00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:01.058
So when you're working with a UX
designer or a UI designer and you're

50
00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:05.848
a developer and they're like that needs
to be brought up just by this amount,

51
00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:08.380
and you're like no it doesn't, why?

52
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.100
That's so hard for me to do,
it doesn't matter.

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.890
It actually kinda does [LAUGH].

54
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.810
There's a lot of these
things that actually when

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.440
a product manager comes over to a designer
and is like move that to the right.

56
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.620
And they're like why do you wanna
move it to the right, what are you?

57
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.920
They are trying to ask, so
that they can solve the problem.

58
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.850
Because it's not as simple as just
move this thing to the right.

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.110
The whole design starts to break
apart if you do that enough.

60
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.520
If I kept moving these things
out of their anchoring,

61
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080
eventually the design breaks down.

62
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.690
So when you hear a designer asking those
questions, they're like let me solve that

63
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.600
problem for you, but we're gonna keep
it anchored and keep it cohesive.

64
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.360
And I'm gonna use all of
these design rules that.

65
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.890
They're not saying that out loud, right?

66
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.435
They're thinking in their minds.

67
00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:57.603
Like I need to still follow some rules
here while solving whatever problem

68
00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.492
you're trying to have me solve.

69
00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:05.608
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
here's an example of Grid, right?

70
00:04:05.608 --> 00:04:08.760
This is right out of the book,
Making and breaking the Grid.

71
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.550
It provides a systematic ordered layout,
we mentioned this before and there's this

72
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.350
a phrase that is used a few times over and

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.990
over again in this book,
that's called the architecture of space.

74
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.800
And I really like that, I think it does
breakdown how you think about having

75
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.760
spacial awareness within a thing.

76
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.910
You notice that when you
walk into a building, right?

77
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.040
You'll notice whether a hallway
has a high ceiling and whether or

78
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.590
not you can find your way into.

79
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.260
You may not think this place has
a high ceiling but you're like, wow,

80
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.240
this place is so open or like wow,

81
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.160
okay, I can't really find my way around
here or these hallways are crazy.

82
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.180
You don't know why the hallways are crazy
but that's all pieces of architecture.

83
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.190
Same with layout.

84
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.580
If you visit a design and

85
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.510
you're constantly confused as to where to
go the architecture of that layout is not

86
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.660
kind of working the way
that you had expected.

87
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.150
So in this making and
breaking the grid book,

88
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.880
there's a lot of these kind of
sections that go over alignment logic.

89
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.600
And we're not gonna go over all, again,
we don't have time to go over all of

90
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.320
these things because that would probably
mean that we were gonna be here for

91
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.740
the next like four years.

92
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.960
[LAUGH] But this is a really great way of

93
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.670
checking out how to make and
break grids for your own projects.

94
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.160
And some reasoning behind each one,

95
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.760
you're gonna be making some
of these in just a minute.

96
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.610
So this is the kind of idea
that you're gonna be employing.

97
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.040
We have sketchbooks that you can use where
if you have something like Photoshop or

98
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.260
Illustrator on your computer,
you can use that as well.

99
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.620
I don't assume that you do, so
we've got sketchbooks instead.

100
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.850
And you're gonna basically be
drawing out these compositions and

101
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.580
just taking some good old fashion lines
and coloring some good old fashion

102
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.610
squares to play around with layout
concepts in a way you that might not.

103
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.530
And I think that's important to do
away at first from the browser.

104
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.010
Designing in the browser is
something that people can do but

105
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.540
I think that you shouldn't start there.

106
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.270
And the reason why is when I'm developing,
I'm in problem solving mode.

107
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.120
I'm trying to find the quickest,

108
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.310
most efficient path to making
things layout on the page, right?

109
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.214
That doesn't make for a very good design
cuz the quickest, most efficient way

110
00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:42.445
of laying things out on the page is
[SOUND] just putting it on the page,

111
00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:45.582
and design takes a little
bit more care than that.

112
00:06:45.582 --> 00:06:50.525
So in order to kind of compartmentalize
and think differently about things,

113
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:54.740
I have to kind of put on my designer hat,
think of it one way.

114
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.550
And then think of it from
a developer's perspective and

115
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.780
say, okay now how do I get that done?

116
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.480
Its almost like setting up challenges for
yourself.

117
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.360
So you have to not think of the developer
as yourself in some ways because

118
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.370
you don't want it to be
the most efficient path.

119
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.139
Laying any one of these things out
might not be the most efficient

120
00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.122
path if you're thinking about
it in terms of CSS lab.

121
00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:23.805
But it will really payoff when you're
starting to create these designs that

122
00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:27.316
people are like, wow,
that is much more interesting and

123
00:07:27.316 --> 00:07:30.259
unique than something
that I've seen before.

124
00:07:32.092 --> 00:07:35.962
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So I like this quote,
the grid is like a lion in a cage, and

125
00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:38.151
the designer is the lion tamer.

126
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:39.861
It's fun to play with the lion, but

127
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.889
the design has to know when to get
out before the lion eats them.

128
00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:46.657
[LAUGH] So the book is called Making and
Breaking the Grid.

129
00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:51.617
It's important to actually break the Grid
as well to kind of break the rules as

130
00:07:51.617 --> 00:07:56.522
you set things up, because if it's
too systematic it's too predictable.
