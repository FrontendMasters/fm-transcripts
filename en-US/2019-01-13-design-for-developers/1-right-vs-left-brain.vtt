00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
let's start off talking about

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.020
right brain versus left brain.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.935
And you can see that before it says
right brain versus left brain,

4
00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:11.120
there's a big orange thing that says myth.

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.733
And the reason why it says
myth is because it's not true.

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.649
There are a bunch of resources here.

7
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.014
There's actually tons of resources out
there that show that this is just not

8
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:25.590
a real phenomenon, Harvard, Encyclopedia
Britannica, a bunch of studies.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.140
The reason why this is so

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.240
important is that people really convince
themselves that they can't do something.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.659
People say, like,
I'm in development, I can't design.

12
00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.966
I'm a designer, I can't develop.

13
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:43.420
We get put into these two camps and
your brain doesn't work like that at all.

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.630
There's no semblance that when
you're good at one thing,

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.960
that keeps you from being good at another.

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.758
I commonly see developers actually
bragging about how bad they are at design

17
00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:56.910
because they think it means
that theyâ€™re better developers.

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.367
It doesn't, it just means
they're bad at design [LAUGH].

19
00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:04.410
Actually the more you use your brain,
what these studies do show is,

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.167
the more you use your brain in different
types of ways, the stronger it becomes.

21
00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.930
It actually strengthens
the corpus callosum.

22
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.790
So there's this band in
between the hemispheres and

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.190
there are synapses that
fire in different ways.

24
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.330
And the more you learn
different types of things,

25
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.120
you're able to make connections
that other people can't make.

26
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.010
So the more you learn outside of your
own discipline, it's actually better for

27
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.500
you as a developer as well.

28
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.430
So some of the reason why this
is important is because we

29
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.996
kind of consider this for
our personal limitations.

30
00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:44.480
We are like, well, I just can't do that
thing because I'm not set up that way.

31
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.000
And that's not true.

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.416
And if you think that you're not set
up that way, chances are you won't be.

33
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:51.480
Because you're gonna talk
yourself out of it as well.

34
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.098
So, this quote, there's no direct
scientific evidence that supports

35
00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:59.372
an analytical logical thinking style for
the left hemisphere, which predetermines

36
00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.833
the left hemisphere for
mathematical tasks or reading and writing.

37
00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:06.402
In contrast,
I probably can't pronounce this name,

38
00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:09.507
Stanislas Dehaene found
that both the right and

39
00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:14.370
left hemisphere are active in
the identification of Arabic numerals.

40
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
Similarly, other data showed subsystems
in both hemispheres are activated for

41
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.960
parts of the reading process.

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.690
So basically what they're
finding through using MRI scans,

43
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.840
through CAT scans,
through analyzing the brain is that

44
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.400
all of these different areas
of the brain are illuminated.
