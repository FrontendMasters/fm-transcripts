&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so for color,
let's talk about color modes first.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.040
And we're also just gonna talk about
color mixing and color in general.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.060
Because color mixing and
color modes are kind of interrelated.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.541
So, the way that you might know color in
terms of like the way that it usually

5
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:25.423
taught in schools is like red,
yellow, blue are primary colors.

6
00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:27.007
What if I told you that's not true?

7
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.890
[LAUGH] What if I told
you all of that is a lie?

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.350
And that it really actually matters
what kind of color mixing you're using.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.360
So there's different
types of color mixing.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.820
One of them is called
additive color mixing.

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240
And one of them is called
subtractive color mixing.

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.900
So when we talk about red, yellow, blue,
well, we're actually really talking about

13
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.430
cyan, magenta, and yellow, plus black.

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.920
And that is a subtractive process.

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.160
And the reason why it's
a subtractive process is

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.910
you're basically subtracting light.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.220
And it's a little bit more
complicated than that,

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.870
but that's kind of a base
thing to understand.

19
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.340
When we talk about additive color mixing,
additive color mixing is actually red,

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.680
green and blue to make all of the colors.

21
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.655
So here's additive and
subtractive color mixing.

22
00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:22.279
When you're working on the computer,
you're not working with red, yellow and

23
00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:26.564
blue, you're working with red, green and
blue to make all of the colors.

24
00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:30.898
And all of the colors blended
together lead to white,

25
00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.702
instead of lead to a darker color.

26
00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:37.592
Sometimes we do things in Photoshop,
or Illustrator, or Sketch,

27
00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.093
those kind of documents,

28
00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:43.890
they know that your brains will think
you're using subtractive color processes.

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.780
So it will kind of compensate for that,

30
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.080
and make it seem like it
goes in the other direction.

31
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.570
But really, it works like this.

32
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.840
So if I took a bunch of flashlights,
if I had a flashlight that was red,

33
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.010
a flashlight that was green,
and a flashlight that was blue,

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.870
and they all lined up,
you get a white flashlight in the middle.

35
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.300
Or if I took red and green flashlights,
and I shown them each other at the wall,

36
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.000
it would turn into a yellow light.

37
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.300
Unlike subtractive color mixing,
and we have C, M, Y.

38
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.040
And really when we mix up C, M, Y,
we get some sort of deep brown,

39
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.390
which is why, in printing processes,
we actually add K, which is black.

40
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.730
That gives us a richer black than we
could get by mixing all those pigments.

41
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.820
And it's called subtractive color mixing
because basically you have a vehicle.

42
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.230
So if you're painting,
you have a vehicle of oil or

43
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.940
gum Arabic if they're using water color.

44
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.860
Or Acrylic 65 if you're
using acrylic paint.

45
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.150
And you have that vehicle.

46
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.910
And then inside that you have all these
kind of particles and pieces of pigments.

47
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.000
And those pigments will
be those pieces of color.

48
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.390
So if I'm using red,
I might use cadmium rock.

49
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.420
Break up the cadmium rock until it
has all of these little pieces.

50
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.050
And then maybe add some alizarin crimson,

51
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.940
some different types of rocks until we're
mixing together and making new colors.

52
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.930
So, we're actually subtracting
light in that instance.

53
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.140
And that's why it's called
subtractive color mixing.

54
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.400
The reason why I'm telling you all of this
is not because you need to remember it

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.250
necessarily.

56
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.778
But that's why when you're working
with Photoshop or Illustrator,

57
00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:23.390
or anything like that and it asks you
the color mode that you're working in.

58
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.430
You're always working in
a color mode whether or

59
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.150
not you're deciding to, it always has
a defined preset for a color mode.

60
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.220
RGB is for the screen,
and CMYK is for printing.
