&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The next thing that
you're gonna do is you're gonna do it.

2
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.900
[LAUGH] So let's fire up your editors,
you can also use CodePen, or whatever.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.930
I suggest working off of
one of her examples, or

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.280
one of mine that I just
had in the slide deck.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.651
All of the slide decks
are in the GitHub repo.

6
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:22.907
But you don't have to, if you would rather
do the grid from scratch, absolutely cool.

7
00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.212
It just might get you
going a little bit faster.

8
00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:30.690
So take one of your compositions that
you made and try to recreate it in code.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.170
If you have diagonals and

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.210
stuff, don't worry about doing those yet,
we'll work on those together, okay?
