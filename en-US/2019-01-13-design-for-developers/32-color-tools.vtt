00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.190
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So,
let's talk about tools.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.110
Everybody likes tools.

3
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.090
I like tools.

4
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.340
They make our lives easier.

5
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.530
On Dribble, you can steal palettes.

6
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.110
You see that little drop right there?

7
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.350
There's like a little drop, and you can
click that, and you can download it, and

8
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.830
you can import it right into Photoshop and
a bunch of swatches appear, and

9
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.900
then you can just steal
other people's palettes.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.245
Awesome, you can also click on one
of the colors and bring up color

11
00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:31.500
palettes of like a spectrum of designs
that work within those color parts.

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.040
So, if you are like I wanna see
everything in this type of blue,

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.160
show me that and
it can just show you that, especially for

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.140
a lot of us, we don't get to decide
what our brand color is, right?

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.000
You can't come into a giant application,
you have a brand color.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260
What you can make me a new
design from scratch but

17
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.930
you've got a brand color
that you're working with.

18
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.610
So this is a kinda nice tool to see what
other combinations people are making.

19
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.370
What other accents people are using
with that color in particular.

20
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.050
It's pretty cool.

21
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.380
This is my favorite,
especially for side projects.

22
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.650
For side projects that
I'm working on alone,

23
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.450
I'm not super great at
building color palettes.

24
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.170
I just go to colors and keep hitting the
thing until I find something that I like.

25
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.640
And even once you steal a color palette,
I keep saying the word steal,

26
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.250
they're yours, it's fine to use them.

27
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.780
It's not like you're gonna go to jail or
anything.

28
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.680
[LAUGH]
Once you have a color palette, you'll

29
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.950
probably deviate from it a little bit but
I would never make this color palette.

30
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.420
This is awesome, look that yellow
like that yellow fits, it's awesome,

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.780
it works but I would never
think to make this by myself.

32
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.100
So you can kinda just keep hitting,
I'm hitting the space bar, and

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.150
you can kinda keep hitting the space bar.

34
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.220
But let say I come across this and
I'm like I like everything,

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.660
except I don't like that brown.

36
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.170
It's like lock all of these and then
just change that one color if I want to.

37
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.920
Let's say I like that,
I can go to Export and

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.610
it gives me all of these different options
like SVG, URL, PNG, PDF, blah, blah, blah.

39
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.450
Awesome, I can also decide, I really
like this but it's a bit too bright for

40
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.770
my liking.

41
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.660
Actually on my screen,
it's bright, it's not bright here.

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.150
I could say like I wanna
bring that saturation down.

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.296
Like I wanna bring the brightness up and
they have all of these little

44
00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:37.540
slider thingies.

45
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.670
Pretty cool?

46
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.150
Like you can just keep working with this
until you have something that you like.

47
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.920
Especially if you don't
know where to start.

48
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.920
And that's why I say for
side projects because usually for

49
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.200
other kind of projects,
you are starting with some base colors.

50
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.440
But if you're working alone,
you might not know where to begin and

51
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.440
that's not a really good place to be in.

52
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620
So Paletton is a really nice one.

53
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.510
Paletton is kind of like what we saw
before with the colors, Adobe Color CC or

54
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.030
whatever they call it now, cooler.

55
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.080
It will always be cooler in my mind.

56
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.060
But what it allows you to do is build
up a palette based on some proportion.

57
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.100
So let's say you want mostly blue,
you can add

58
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.330
monochromatic, you can see all of
those ones on the top and the left.

59
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.620
It's allowing you to
decide between amalgous,

60
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.530
triad, compound,
all of those kind of things.

61
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.300
But then you can kind of build
a palette up in this square.

62
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.870
So say I just need a little
bit of this one color but

63
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.010
I need a lot of this color and
it will give you shades.

64
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.480
If it takes up more of that color,

65
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.004
then it'll give you more shades
that are kind of in that range too.

66
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:51.270
So, pretty cool.

67
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.710
So yeah, you can switch it up say,
triadic and

68
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.540
then it'll show you the kind of allow
you to build up the palette that way.

69
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.570
Like we showed you before, that color,

70
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.510
Adobe Color CC also allows you to build
up palettes that way and save them.

71
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.680
My friend Tim Holman made this, Palettab.

72
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.740
So if you don't have any like,
when you have a new tab,

73
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.510
you're not using some fancy extension,
you can use Palettab.

74
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.520
And every time you open up a new tab
on your browser, it will show you a new

75
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.220
color palette and it will also
show you some fonts and stuff.

76
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.710
So, you could just, every time be like
that's a kind of cool one and steal those.

77
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.920
So, Adobe Capture is pretty
cool because what you do is you

78
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.370
load in a photo that has colors that you
like, so sometimes you see an image and

79
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.975
you're like that's got a really
cool palette but I don't know why.

80
00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:50.410
[LAUGH] I don't know why I like this.

81
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.160
I just know I like this.

82
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.480
So you can put it into Adobe capture and

83
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.610
it will analyze the photo using machine
learning and pick out different colors.

84
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.620
But the other thing it does is
allows you to pick out moods.

85
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.721
So if I'm using this on that flower,
I could say I'm in a happy mood, so

86
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.556
it'll pick some of the brighter colors.

87
00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.567
I want like dark mood or moody mood, and

88
00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:13.963
it will kinda pick out some of
the darker colors in there.

89
00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:14.946
So you can kind of,

90
00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:18.325
even though it's picking out
a color palette within that thing,

91
00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:22.517
you can keep adjusting from that one image
until you find a palette that you like.

92
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:30.500
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: For gradients, I always
use ultimate CSS gradient generator.

93
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.540
This is like a really,

94
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.510
really old tool that I've never given
up on because I really like it.

95
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.210
And it's not great for
finding a gradient but

96
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.540
if you already have two colors and
you need to make a CSS gradient,

97
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.420
it outputs the code for it really nicely
and gives you fallback and sorts of stuff.

98
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.730
If you need to find the gradient,
use UI gradients.

99
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.850
UI gradients is really nice.

100
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.810
Basically, it's the same thing as coolers,
where you hit the space bar,

101
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.220
hit the space bar,
just keep finding gradients.

102
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.870
Or you can pull down show all gradients
and it'll show you all of these gradients.

103
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.700
Gradients can be a really nice
way of sprucing up designs and

104
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.000
making them look really beautiful as well.
