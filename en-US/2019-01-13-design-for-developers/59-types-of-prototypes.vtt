00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So Types of Prototypes.

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.130
There are actually a number of ways
that you can create prototypes.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.830
One of them is called Thumbnails.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.760
And thumbnails are kind of similar to
what you did a little bit earlier today.

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.610
But they're a little bit messier,
thumbnails are messages to yourself.

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.300
And they're not really intended to
communicate with anyone but you.

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.860
It's a really quick scribbling drawing so

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.850
that you can understand something really
quick and toss out ideas really fast.

9
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.830
So you can ot something down,
put something in a corner.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.320
Some of the thumbnails that I've made,

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.220
I don't even remember what they're for,
[LAUGH].

12
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.190
I look at them, and
I'm like, what is this?

13
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.140
Did the dogs make this, this is crazy.

14
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.030
Storyboards are one step
up in fidelity from there.

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.950
So once you've made a few thumbnails,
you can toss those ideas out and

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.370
make something a little
bit higher fidelity so

17
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.350
you can explain some concepts
to coworkers and stuff.

18
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
What I like about the thumbnails is
that there's such a low commitment.

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.070
So you don't feel bad
about trashing an idea.

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.480
So you really wanna get into this thing
of like this idea is not valuable,

21
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.660
and I'm not so

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.970
attached to it that if I decided to go in
a different direction it's a big deal.

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.880
You want it to be very
disposable at this stage.

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.100
Storyboards have a slightly
higher commitment because you're

25
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.750
actually making them in a way
that you can communicate.

26
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.040
But they don't have to be super crazy,
either.

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.426
I used to think of storyboards and
I'm like I'm not gonna make a comic book

28
00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:33.700
before I make an animation or user flow,
that sounds like a lot of work.

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.709
So maybe make it just enough fidelity
to people to kinda understand

30
00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.577
where you are coming from and know higher,
again if they wanna throw that idea out

31
00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:46.890
that's okay you are not like crying
sin you soup later, that evening.

32
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.710
I quite like making low
fidelity prototypes.

33
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.760
I made this for a client once because,

34
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.610
they had some concepts that they had for
how we should do a welcoming user flow.

35
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.790
You know when you go to Slack and
you first join and

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.870
it shows you a bunch of things.

37
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.770
So I was doing this kind of like, well,
we could show it this way and this way and

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.010
this way and I made this in code and
animated it.

39
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.200
It's like an SVG animation, but
it's super low fidelity, right?

40
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.470
If tomorrow they were like no,
I don't want that, no big deal.

41
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.660
However, if they did want that, since
it's in code I could steal the eases and

42
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.910
some of the animation and make it fix it
up a little bit for production kind of.

43
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.530
And I know that the eases are the same
thing that they wanted too.

44
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.220
So it can be a really effective way
of communicating without building

45
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.120
everything into an entire system.

46
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.080
Some systems are actually really,
I worked on some applications that

47
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.980
are really big for really big clients,
where they have all sorts of legacy code.

48
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.358
You're pulling through React and Angular,
[LAUGH] and it's like, is that Backbone?

49
00:02:58.358 --> 00:03:03.166
My God, [LAUGH] and so
you don't necessarily want to in order to

50
00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:07.328
show an animation,
go through all of those layers and

51
00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:11.690
really figure it out before
showing a concept, right?

52
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.220
Even if you have a dove branch.

53
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.310
So, other people make low-fi
prototypes on code pen two.

54
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.900
This one by Yoseph Becker is really
cool because it is actually interactive.

55
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.020
So that little hand,

56
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.810
that's me actually going through
this pen and moving things around.

57
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.230
So, that's an effective way of
showing what a gesture might look

58
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.590
like to a client.

59
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.260
They get the idea of what
that might look like.

60
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.930
I also do more high fidelity prototype,
so here's an example.

61
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.100
It's not in the whole code base again,
it's just a small piece.

62
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.770
But I make all of the little pieces so

63
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.010
that they can see how that one
thing might work once it was built.

64
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.860
And if they like it, then again, I clean
it up and make it a little bit more.

65
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.448
I mean in this case, it's a React
component so I could kinda put it in, and

66
00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:08.377
work with it that way, right?

67
00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:14.314
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: You can also do
stuff like screenshot the site and

68
00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:19.030
absolutely position just the piece
that you're trying to animate.

69
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.550
I used to have a really
good example of this,

70
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.710
but I think I'm probably not
allowed to show it anymore.

71
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.970
I just haven't to ask them instead of
like having everything like putting

72
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.545
it all into your code base you can
screenshot the site and then absolutely

73
00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:39.415
position just what you need to show, and
then they really get the sense of it.

74
00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:42.705
And the funny thing about that one is,
like, showing this to CEOs,

75
00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:46.165
like they really believe it's the site,
so then they're like,

76
00:04:46.165 --> 00:04:50.625
have you ever seen someone walk
into a glass window or something?

77
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.145
They're like, wait,
why can't I click on it?

78
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:53.295
I'm like, it's just a screenshot, man.
