00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.230
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: You probably
know about monospaced fonts,

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.110
we use those all the time as a programmer.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.420
You might know its counterpart,

4
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.800
which is proportional fonts
which is not monospaced.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.976
The reason we call it monospaced is
because every letter takes the same amount

6
00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:19.565
of space, whereas proportional, it's
proportional to how big the letters are.

7
00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.290
That's probably easily known.

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.380
Kerning and no kerning, you've probably
heard people talk about kerning, right?

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.320
Kerning is the space between the letters
and whether or not they kind of tuck and

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.230
nest into each other appropriately or not.

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.460
So kerning applied, and no kerning.

12
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.180
So no kerning, they're just,
here's a letter and a space for

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.730
that letter, here's another letter.

14
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.013
But you can see how A and
V would then look visually very far

15
00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:47.745
apart from each other and then probably to
close for some of the other characters.

16
00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:51.598
Whereas kerning applied kind of
compensates for that with your eye, so

17
00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:53.984
it looks a little bit
more evenly balanced.

18
00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:57.697
Leading is a space up and down.

19
00:00:57.697 --> 00:01:01.667
So kerning would be like
letter spacing in CSS world,

20
00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.850
leading would be like
line height in CSS world.

21
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.571
The reason why we call it leading is
because when you're typesetting a book,

22
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.251
you use lead letters.

23
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:17.284
And then in order to make the letters
further apart from each other,

24
00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:20.892
you put a tiny little piece lead
that's like a little strip,

25
00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:24.300
like you see right there
in between those blocks.

26
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.070
So you'd add more leading,
you're adding more lead literally.

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.040
So some of these old things.

28
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.061
So leading is the space between
the baselines, ascender, midline,

29
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.327
baseline, descender, that's for
all of those letters.

30
00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:43.130
And [LAUGH] there's all these jokes,
I love this XKCD one.

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.750
If you really hate someone teach
them to recognize bad kerning.

32
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.710
It's one of those things where
before you know what it is,

33
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.980
you don't really notice it, and
once you do it's really bothersome.

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.820
It's just one thing that
can really drive you crazy.

35
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.590
It's important to do, [LAUGH] to work with

36
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.230
kerning well because you can make
accidents happen if you don't.

37
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.360
So make sure that there's adequate
spacing between your letters.

38
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.410
If you're working with Photoshop or
Illustrator, something like that.

39
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.740
In order to change it from,
basically it's always gonna

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.070
assume you want metrics as the default,
you see in the character palette.

41
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.270
Switch to optical, and then it will be
well kerned, it will kind of understand

42
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.260
kerning better, of course,
this doesn't translate to the web.

43
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.975
For the web, you pretty much have to look
at whether the fontographer who made

44
00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:40.379
the font took that into
consideration when they made it.

45
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.913
But in Photoshop, if you're making
something for print that works.

46
00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:50.185
So kerning encode letter-spacing,
leading encode, line-height.

47
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.155
And then there's also vertical alignment,
whether or

48
00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:57.130
not you're aligning with the baseline,
mid, things like that.

49
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.380
Widows and orphans, this is another thing
that I probably shouldn't teach you,

50
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.925
because you'll start to
notice it everywhere.

51
00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:07.270
[LAUGH] A widow is when you have this one

52
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.850
word that just kinda hangs out
at the end of a paragraph.

53
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.790
I used to do layout for
magazines, and widows and

54
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.440
orphans were what I worked on constantly.

55
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.840
An orphan is when you go
to the next paragraph.

56
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.570
Orphans really bother people,
they don't know why.

57
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.010
But it just doesn't,
you're trying to read the paragraph and

58
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.960
then ends really awkwardly because
there's just another piece there.

59
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.982
Widows are not as big of a deal, I think.

60
00:03:33.982 --> 00:03:39.600
If you have content that's
generated from an API,

61
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.090
you probably can't do
anything about these things.

62
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.420
But if you do have some
kind of text lockups or

63
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.980
things that are kind of titles and
things like that that you can work on,

64
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.800
it's good to keep an eye on this stuff and
make sure just knock it into place.

65
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.830
So if I was working on this widow one,
that it is,

66
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.410
I would probably break after the it is.

67
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.060
You see that on the second line,
how it kind of jets out?

68
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.680
I would do a hard-break there and
that would push that line out, so

69
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.800
I would no longer have a widow.

70
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.514
So widows and orphans,
that what those look like.

71
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.494
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, again,
more widows and orphans good versus bad,

72
00:04:19.494 --> 00:04:23.360
it actually is easier on your eyes
to read without those widows and

73
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.720
orphans hanging out there.

74
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.970
Ligatures, ligatures are different for
code and

75
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.250
code editors than they are for
books and things.

76
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.436
So there are some fonts that take these
types of things in consideration.

77
00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:41.750
So if you you have the one on the right,
they understand that if you have and f and

78
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.640
an i next to each other that they should
be joined and it would make more sense.

79
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.660
Then it kinda looks clumsy
in the first example,

80
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.490
they're just kind of
glopped next to each other.

81
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.282
Code ligatures are pretty cool and
I actually really like them,

82
00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:58.052
some people don't like them.

83
00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:02.720
You can work with different symbols and
it actually turns them into that symbol.

84
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.540
So for instance, if you're making an arrow
function, it would be an equal and

85
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.920
an arrow, but
it actually turns it into an arrow.

86
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.650
Or the one that I really
love is the three equals

87
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.300
becomes a solid block of three equals.

88
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.910
Some people say that for them it's less
legible, I think it's more legible.

89
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.840
Everyone is gonna be,
feel a little bit different about them.

90
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.425
So if they're talking about, if you hear
someone talking about their code editor,

91
00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:31.559
and ligatures, that's what they mean.

92
00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.570
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm not going over
all this terminology, don't worry.

93
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.300
It's just in here in case you wanna get
super nerdy, and you wanna dive in.

94
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.729
Again, not gonna go over all of this,
but if you wanna dive in.

95
00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:49.647
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: One thing that Burke's
figured out a while ago is that you can't

96
00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:51.693
center things in the middle of a page and

97
00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:54.065
actually when I learned this I was,
no way.

98
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:58.510
[LAUGH] And I went and opened up all
of my books, and was, is this true?

99
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.670
And it turns out that it is true.

100
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.980
I opened up every single one,
all of the text

101
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.130
always has a bigger space
on the bottom than the top.

102
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.240
They center it in the middle of the page,
and then they push the text up so

103
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.140
that there's more space on the bottom.

104
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.350
Because if it's centered,
it looks like the text is falling down.

105
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.210
It doesn't look,
it's like the circle for some reason.

106
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.290
The circle needs a line,

107
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.310
it needs to be outside the line in
order to look visually consistent.

108
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.690
This is another one of those
things where if I took a book and

109
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.150
I put the text right in the middle,
you'd be, why is the text so low?

110
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.570
Go home and open up all your books,

111
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.850
they all have way more space
on the bottom than the top.

112
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.460
And you can use that in
your web designs too,

113
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.330
although I don't know that
it works the same way.

114
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.750
In terms of font performance, this is
something that you should care about.

115
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.140
Zach Leatherman writes a lot of
materials about font performance, and

116
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.190
he just has a blog that's full of
really good materials on how to get

117
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.010
the most out of font performance.

118
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.940
I think I followed one of his blog
posts on this giant application I

119
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.480
was working with.

120
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:15.320
I made the performance of the site better
by two seconds, two seconds is a lot.

121
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.500
Completely shaved that
off just by changing

122
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.990
the way that we were loading
the fonts in our fonts strategy.

123
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.010
So definitely check out
his writings about that.

124
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.061
Peter Mueller took some
of what Zach wrote,

125
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:32.034
there's a lot of stuff
that you have to do.

126
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:37.022
So he created this thing called
sub-font that kind of automates some

127
00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:39.150
of these tasks for you.

128
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:45.010
So definitely check out his work there,
there's a lot of really good stuff in it.

129
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.790
Robin Randall who I worked
with at CSS Tricks has

130
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.974
a newsletter all about typography.

131
00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:54.050
And he's super good at typography and
he knows everything about typography and

132
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.460
he should probably teach
this section of this course.

133
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.500
He has newsletter about it, and
it's a really great newsletter.

134
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.460
He kind of muses on typography,
and things he's seen, and

135
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.960
he goes to conferences and
all sorts of stuff.

136
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.440
So if you're interested in type,
he's someone to follow.

137
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.980
When we're creating, remember how I
was using Lorem text when I was using

138
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.090
Emmet and I was just dumping some
text in there as placeholder.

139
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.390
There's all sorts of ways of
generating text, Bacon Ipsum,

140
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.750
Hipster Ipsum, Cat Ipsum.

141
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.680
By the way,
Hipster Ipsum has some bad words,

142
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.950
which I didn't realize until I was in
the middle of a review with the CEO.

143
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.849
So just letting you know.

144
00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:33.120
[LAUGH] They're like, does that say this?

145
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.502
I'm like [LAUGH] no, [LAUGH] HodorIpsum,

146
00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:46.111
[LAUGH] Pirate Ipsum,
Slipsum to Samuel L Jackson Ipsum.

147
00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:48.320
[LAUGH] So
there's a lot of options out there.

148
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.303
So there's no need for

149
00:08:49.303 --> 00:08:52.009
your Lorem Ipsum to be super
boring if you don't want it to be.
