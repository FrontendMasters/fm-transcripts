00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.860
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So monotone,

2
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.290
monotone is kind of what you
would kind of, think it was.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.230
We talked about monochromatic,
monotone is just one single tone,

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.520
that you're making for the entire image.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.710
And you can even play around
with different monotones.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.520
So you can see how different this
skeleton is based on what two colors,

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.270
or what color is being used, or
even the shadow that's being used.

8
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.720
Maybe this is against code conduct or
something.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.563
This is the thriller dance [LAUGH].

10
00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:38.470
So Duotone is like you've probably seen
a bunch of those Spotify ads and stuff.

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.980
This existed before the Spotify ads, but
they made really good use of duotone.

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.430
So if you look up duotone
you get Spotify ads.

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.500
It's basically taking two tones and
matching them up against each other.

14
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.875
And you can do those kind of things
in photoshop pretty easily too,

15
00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:56.655
they have these kind of filters
that you can work with.

16
00:00:56.655 --> 00:01:02.605
That don't affects the layer you can
like play with different channels and

17
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.124
things like that.

18
00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.105
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: In real life, they way
that light works is whatever color light

19
00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:13.780
is shining on an object,
this shadow is the opposite.

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.390
So if I shine a yellow thing on a box,
the shadow would be purple.

21
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.190
You don't have to use that, but
if you wanted to use that to

22
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.080
make your designs, or things that you're
working with, appear more realistic.

23
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.680
Like if you wanted to make
bright red light on someone,

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.520
you could cast some cool green
tones in the shadow, and

25
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.820
then it would kind of pop and
look a little bit more real.

26
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.180
Another thing to note is things
that are far away from you

27
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.870
are going to be in low contrast and
are gonna be blurrier.

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.380
And then things that are closer to you
are gonna be in sharp contrast and

29
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920
they're going to be more vibrant.

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.690
So if you are trying to make a layout.

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.290
Even if you're trying to make
a layout that subtly plays with that

32
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.350
concept of near and far.

33
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
You could use bright colors and
something that's bigger and

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490
then a smaller thing
with some blurred tones.

35
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.230
And people would, it would feel right to
people because that's kind of what we see.
