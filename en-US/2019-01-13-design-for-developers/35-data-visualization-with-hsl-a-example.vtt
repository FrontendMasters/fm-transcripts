&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Remember we were talking
about HSL and generative color and stuff?

2
00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:07.248
Someone who uses that a lot is my friend
Nadi Bremmer who does these amazing data

3
00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:08.205
visualizations.

4
00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.945
If you've ever seen one of Shirley Lou's
classes, she's a collaborator with Nadi.

5
00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.903
The two of them together is
like genius crazy awesome.

6
00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:21.350
So now that you know a bit about HSL color
and how that all works you can kind of

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.869
understand how something like this
might be built when they're using these

8
00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.966
kind of generative colors that
are definitely the same lightness and

9
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.591
saturation but
they're moving across the color spectrum.

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.929
Right, pretty cool.

11
00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.632
Awesome.
