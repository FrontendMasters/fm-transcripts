00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.050
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
demo time, so let's go into

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.800
Photoshop here and let's go like that.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm gonna go to create new and then we're
gonna create a new composition here.

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.200
I already put a grid onto this and that's
one of the preferences I have set up.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.670
If you need to do that, you go view, and

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.681
you go show, and
you go grid or if you get good

7
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:36.254
at those quick keys,
command and single quote.

8
00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:40.286
You can also snap to grid and
right now we're going to snap to grid,

9
00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:43.070
you can see that we also have rulers here.

10
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.563
If I got CTRL R,
it removes the rulers, if I bring,

11
00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:49.017
let's say Ctrl R brings them back.

12
00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:53.681
Also, if I have the rulers on the board,
I can bring guides, so

13
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:58.060
I can use these guides to,
how we're lining things up.

14
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.830
So if you don't wanna use a grid,
you don't have to, you could also say.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.304
View, Show, Grid, and then you can
just use these kinds of anchoring

16
00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:13.592
guides instead, so
let's do View, Show, Grid again.

17
00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:18.025
So let's make a couple of compositions,
just with some circles and

18
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.300
squares and things like that.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.070
So I'm actually gonna do a darker grey,
so that you can see.

20
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.906
So maybe we'll just start with
a giant square or rectangle.

21
00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:39.490
Actually, I'm gonna go all the way across,
here you can see how it's snapping,

22
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.700
and then I hit G and
Draw something, right?

23
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.585
So here we've got a boring rectangle.

24
00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:52.087
All right, so
then if I wanna make a new square,

25
00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:55.600
I would have to get out of that,
that move tool.

26
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.410
And so I hit V and then M, so
now I'm back into the marquee tool, but

27
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.190
I have to toggle between tools.

28
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.180
You can see this toolbar here,
has all the tools,

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.770
so here's the marquee,
here's the elliptical marquee.

30
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.410
Here I'm gonna hit Shift and M,

31
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.340
and that will give me a circle, Shift and
M will give me a square, right?

32
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.739
This Move tool is the thing that
will allow me to move things,

33
00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.067
convert to a normal layer,
let's do this again, go back.

34
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.613
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And make a new
layer here and [INAUDIBLE] layer.

35
00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:40.586
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, cool, so now maybe
I wanna cut this up a little bit cuz I

36
00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.839
don't want just one image
spanning the entire thing,

37
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.440
we talked about how that
might be a little bit boring.

38
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.310
So maybe I want some text here,
except maybe going up and

39
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.130
down or something instead of just normal.

40
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.875
So I can actually turn
text on its head and

41
00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:03.845
then I'm gonna make the column here,
no maybe here.

42
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:09.555
All right, so I'm deciding right
now that this is probably a photo,

43
00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:13.030
and this is gonna be a column of text.

44
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.200
Maybe I have another little
piece of text down here that

45
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.520
fits along with this column, and
I probably need a nav too, right?

46
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.000
So first I'm gonna just go
across like that as well and

47
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.360
then we've got a really boring grid.

48
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.170
But so maybe we wanna break up this
nav a little bit and I wanna do,

49
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.710
probably I don't span all
the way with this content.

50
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.480
I don't have that many allies in my nav,
but we talked about those circles.

51
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.540
So maybe we do Shift and M to make
a circle, and go a little bit bigger.

52
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.430
We talked about how we make it a little
bit bigger, so then I can make the circle,

53
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.810
and then maybe I wanna move it into place.

54
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.030
So that's a composition, I'm actually
gonna group all of this stuff,

55
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.420
that's how I group, so I selected all
of these and I put them in a group.

56
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.670
So now I can toggle these compositions,
okay,

57
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.790
that's a composition,
that's a composition.

58
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.720
So maybe I try to make something like this
in code just to try things out right.

59
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.790
Lets try one more.

60
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.663
I'm gonna remove these rulers,
maybe this time,

61
00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:32.676
let's just do something
that's skinny across it.

62
00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:43.049
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's start
with something like that,

63
00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.005
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay,

64
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:52.520
so maybe we want to have
columns of texts under.

65
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.980
Maybe this is a few different images or
something like that.

66
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.505
So let's break up the images,

67
00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:05.444
I think this time let's try to break
up the images over here on this side.

68
00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:09.353
And then maybe we have
a column of text over here.

69
00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:17.478
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And actually,
let's put this on its own layer so

70
00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:21.279
that it can duplicate, so
maybe we want another column of text.

71
00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:31.320
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Over here, and
then maybe we want a nav kind of thing but

72
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.101
we want it to line up with this guy,
with the anchoring,

73
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:43.426
so maybe we do,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Something

74
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:47.466
like that, well, a new layer, and

75
00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:53.230
then we probably want a circle somewhere.

76
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.009
So let's do Shift + M, and I'm gonna put
a little logo in the corner here, shift,

77
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.095
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, cool, but

78
00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:14.660
we talked about diagonals, maybe we wanna
introduce a diagonal somewhere in this.

79
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.310
So maybe we don't want it to be
part of the composition, but

80
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.040
something that's a piece of
the background or something like that.

81
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.861
So I'm gonna grab this
Polygonal Lasso Tool and break that grid.

82
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.270
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And we're gonna put
this on it's own layer, add it in.

83
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.930
And then I'm gonna reduce the opacity
of this layer so that it's just

84
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.210
a piece of the composition
instead of a thing.

85
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.740
Maybe I wanna duplicate or mirror that
somewhere else in this composition so

86
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.680
that it's not the only diagonal.

87
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.704
I could also maybe take
a bite out of this one,

88
00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:03.040
actually that's wrong.

89
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.990
By the way, you'll get stuck
in these diagonal lasso tools,

90
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.460
it will keep going until
it finds its first part.

91
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.580
And you'll know it found its first
part because a little circle will come

92
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.430
on the side, so if you go down,
around here and

93
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.080
then you see the little
circle up here in the corner?

94
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.030
It's like a little circle.

95
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.111
Now I can go find
the layer that this is on,

96
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:35.535
I think it's this one, yeah,
and go into there and delete.

97
00:07:35.535 --> 00:07:40.341
I don't know, maybe it's, again, not the
best compositions in the world but still

98
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:44.440
a bit more interesting and intriguing
than what you usually start with.

99
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.160
So you can start to see how
thinking just about the layout and

100
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.100
just about the composition without
thinking about everything else.

101
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.780
Without thinking about the typography or
the color or

102
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.620
anything else,
simplifies that process a little bit,

103
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.570
you can just think about the shapes and
take them and remove them.

104
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:10.320
And maybe I'm presenting this to somebody
and I can just go, well here's one idea,

105
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.610
here's another idea, here's another idea,
and we can talk through these concepts.

106
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.800
And which one's the strongest or
what needs to be built off of it,

107
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.770
maybe we work off of these
things a little bit later.

108
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.552
None of these are final or anything, but
you can see how its a conversation-opener

109
00:08:26.552 --> 00:08:31.520
to like, do we wanna have this circular
layout, or how would that work?
