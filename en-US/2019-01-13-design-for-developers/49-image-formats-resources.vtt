00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:07.073
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: You can't be a web
performance expert without also being

2
00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.360
an image expert.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.490
This is a really true statement,
if you think about it.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.420
Images are really heavy, they're a huge
part of what we transmit on the web.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.980
This is the HDP archive, this is all of,

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.560
it's a breakdown of what we
transmit on the web on all sites.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.850
So how much the average site loads, and

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.320
what amount of content on average
people do of each one of them.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.580
Look at images.

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.030
Images is huge.

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.597
That's a huge amount for
each one of those.

12
00:00:36.597 --> 00:00:38.860
So if you want to reduce.

13
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.600
But, create better performance for
your site.

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.280
Learning how to properly optimize
images and work with images,

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.670
is a really big piece of this.

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.887
So there's a number of sources
to get free images from, so

17
00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:56.650
some free ones, Unsplash,
Google Image License Search.

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.020
I don't know if you know how to do this.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660
Let's go do that really quick.

20
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.270
So let's look at, look for a mountain.

21
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.560
Go to images, and then,
I go to tools, and then,

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.620
I go to usage rights,
and labeled for reuse.

23
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.950
So these are all of the things
that are definitely licensed for

24
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.230
me to use, so I can still use these and
not have a problem.

25
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.329
It's important that you do this, so that
you don't accidentally take somebodyelse's

26
00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.800
image off of Google Image search, but
that tool is really, really a nice one.

27
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.364
Great, Freepik is a good one, I think
you have to give them your email, but

28
00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:43.205
you guys know how to give fake emails,
right?

29
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:47.846
[LAUGH] Freeimages, and Pexels,
I think same kind of thing,

30
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:52.497
there's free images, but
you have to sign up or something.

31
00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:56.560
Low cost, creative market is great,
adobe stock is good.

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.550
Costly, it's not that costly,
but Shutterstock and iStockPhoto,

33
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.960
if you're not gainfully employed
somewhere, 50 bucks and a minch can kind

34
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.660
of set you back, especially if you have to
buy a whole bunch of them, or something.

35
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.000
The thing though is,
that there is a cost, right?

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.030
So if I'm looking for

37
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.370
something in Shutterstock and iStockPhoto,
I can find that image really fast.

38
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.970
If I'm working for a big company,
that actually makes sense for

39
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.490
them to do, right?

40
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.810
They don't want me, that they're
paying way more than the $50 image,

41
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.720
to spend three hours through looking
through, Unsplash or Freepick.

42
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280
It's more cost effective for

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.200
them to use something like iStockPhoto
where they can get a subscription plan,

44
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.850
and I can use that,
because some people cost a bunch per hour.

45
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.460
So it really depends on if you're working
for a company, or if you're not, or

46
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.850
if you need to get
something done really fast.

47
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.170
Time is money.

48
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.280
Raster and Vector.

49
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.320
So there's a big difference between raster
and vector, and you might have heard those

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.070
two terms, but maybe, you don't
know the difference between them.

51
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.350
Raster, imagine that you, again, we're
always imagining a piece of graph paper.

52
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.106
Imagine that you have a bunch of graph
paper where you plot every dot of

53
00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:16.862
that graph paper, and you kind of
encode it with a different color for

54
00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:20.142
each little square,
that would be raster, and

55
00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:23.765
that's how we build up
things like JPEGs and stuff.

56
00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:28.283
And vector is really where you are giving
it some mathematical commands, and

57
00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:32.941
allowing it to draw things for you, so
it's kind of like more declarative, and

58
00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:34.740
it never loses resolution.

59
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.720
So if you're working with a billboard or
something, you probably wanna work with

60
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.190
vector, so that you can, you're not
crashing your computer, and you're

61
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.190
working with a small graphic that can be
blown up to any resolution, basically.

62
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.420
This isn't comprehensive, there's
a couple things missing off of this,

63
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.650
but it was, it's probably the most,
it had the most amount of things on there.

64
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.280
So raster images, the first three
are things that you would deliver

65
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.120
over the internet, the last three are not.

66
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.200
So JPEG, GIF, PNG,
we're gonna break down each one of these.

67
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.130
But the, photos, and things that
have lots of gradients and tones.

68
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.910
Especially, not programmatic gradients,
not like from here to here, but like lots,

69
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.970
like my face, or something.

70
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.920
JPEG, GIF and PNG, PNG having
transparency, while the others don't.

71
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:36.173
GIF has transparency, too, but PNG is
kinda better at gradient transparency.

72
00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:40.909
TIFF, RAW, both being stuff that you
might get out of a digital camera, and

73
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.740
then, convert to one of the other,
to kind of transmit that over the web.

74
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.500
They tend to be larger files.

75
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.990
And PSD is what we were just working in,
there's also sketch format.

76
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.310
So those are, kind of like for

77
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.940
that program in specific
kind of file formats.

78
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.640
Vector images, it doesn't say SVG in here,
but it should, cuz SVG is Vector.

79
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.782
PDF is not necessarily vector.

80
00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:14.802
EPS and AI are both things that you
would kind of use within Illustrator,

81
00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:17.363
especially AI is only Illustrator.

82
00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:19.955
EPS can be opened and things like sketch.

83
00:05:22.776 --> 00:05:25.224
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So JPEG,
there is a thing that we use,

84
00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:28.760
a term that we use with JPEG called,
lossy.

85
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.360
And the reason is that it does look
like there is gloss in those image.

86
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.560
So some of the way that we're
gonna talk about these images,

87
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.200
is what happens to them
when they're too small.

88
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.970
Like what happens to them when you
reduce the quality of the image?

89
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.300
So when you reduce
the quality of the JPEG,

90
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.640
since it's all of those little squares
that are building up the image,

91
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.440
the squares get kind of globbier, and
bigger, and try to carry more surface.

92
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.353
And so, what you end up with, is an image
that kind of deteriorates or falls over,

93
00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:05.266
so, the one on the left, might look really
crisp, but it might also be too heavy to

94
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:09.897
transmit easily over the internet with
a certain amount of seconds, maybe,

95
00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:14.916
you load up a site, and it's just like,
doh, ba doop, da boop, like that, and.

96
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:18.320
So you don't want that happening, you
also don't also want those blocked by it.

97
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.760
Again, we talked about that scale and
cropping.

98
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.130
You can use JPEG, and PNG, and

99
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.130
things like that, for
some of these background images, too.

100
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.970
So not just the images, but
placing them in the background, and

101
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.830
pushing them back in space and
have other content on top of them.

102
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.568
GIF or JIF, not JIF.

103
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:47.455
[LAUGH] Is a different way,
it kinda a similar to JPEG's in someways,

104
00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:51.350
because it's still blocking
out little pieces.

105
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.670
But it's really rather restricting it
by the amounts of color that you're

106
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.640
going to designate.

107
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.310
So here is a color table we're creating
this image with all of these little

108
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.240
pieces of color, and we're using 256
colors, as you can see in the top there.

109
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.060
We can also make the image so
much smaller by limiting the color, but

110
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.890
you can see what happens to the image.

111
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.720
It looks quite different, right?

112
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.440
There's like a lot less information.

113
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.610
It doesn't look like the same way that
it's deteriorating as the JPEG though.

114
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.443
The JPEG turns into those bits,

115
00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:35.041
the gift looks like it has less tone of
variety, and less color is transmitted.

116
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.880
GIF's also have the amazing ability
to communicate very important things,

117
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.020
like this dog, [LAUGH].

118
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.740
All jokes aside, it is really important
on the web, because of the way that you

119
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.280
can kind of create tiny movies,
that have all these tiny tonal varieties.

120
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.410
GIFs, these kind of animated GIFs,
are pretty heavy, though.

121
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.480
They're actually like really,

122
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.720
really heavier things to
communicate over the web.

123
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.880
So paying attention to,
if you do use animated GIFs,

124
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.840
what compression you're using,
is important.

125
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.711
PNG, like I mentioned, has the ability for
transparency, so if you wanna make some of

126
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:18.186
those masks, we were talking about
earlier when we're working in Photoshop,

127
00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:19.610
or something like that.

128
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.765
PNGs are a really good example of that,
