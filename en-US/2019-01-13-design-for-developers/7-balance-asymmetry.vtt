00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.570
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's
talk about asymmetry.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.600
And asymmetry isn't used as much,
cuz it's harder, right?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.240
Creating balance in an asymmetrical
canvas can be a little bit more tricky.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.920
Because unlike symmetry,

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.090
where you're just lining it up, and
then it's the same on either side.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.410
And that's all you have to do.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.070
Asymmetry kind of asks you
to be more thoughtful about,

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.390
you're still balancing things.

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.690
But you're balancing them
a little bit more carefully.

10
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.100
So they did this study a little
while ago of what people thought

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.920
the greatest compositions were.

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.180
So they showed people paintings after
paintings after paintings after paintings,

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.130
and it turns out that most people
picked this kinda composition.

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.140
This is The Starry Night from Van Gogh.

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.420
Where there's like a tree on one side,
and then there's like a sun or

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.150
a moon or something and
then the canvass comes out there.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.008
So even given all the canvases in the
world, and all of these ideas of symmetry,

18
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:05.257
people do actually gravitate more
towards an asymmetrical canvas to,

19
00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:08.230
as a kind of particular preference.

20
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.880
Probably because the world,
as you look at it and

21
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.900
the world as you see it,
is naturally not perfectly symmetrical.

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.580
There are some beautiful
symmetrical things in nature, but

23
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.910
as you look out over a landscape, it's
never gonna be like perfectly aligned.

24
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.080
That just doesn't exist.

25
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.668
So it doesn't just happen in Western art
either, in Eastern art there's a lot

26
00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:38.096
of really close attention paid to
the ideas of balance and asymmetry.

27
00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:39.561
Fun fact,

28
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:43.900
Edo period prints are my favorites that's
why my name on Twitter is Sarah Edo.

29
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.507
So this is one of
an example of Edo prints,

30
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:51.586
actually it's on my phone too there's
little pugs in the waves, [LAUGH] anyway.

31
00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:56.211
So this kinda balance and asymmetry is
something that you will see, once you

32
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:01.140
start to see how people are employing it,
it's a very distinct choice, right.

33
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.510
He could have just had the wave right in
the middle and like maybe even facing you.

34
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.600
But I bet that this print
wouldn't be famous if he did.

35
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040
And we see that in architecture, as well.

36
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.430
Remember, I'm gonna keep showing
you architecture references.

37
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.520
This is the Sydney Opera House that has
this idea of balance and asymmetry.

38
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.680
And Wabi Sabi,
I'm not sure if you know this concept but

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.660
it's kinda like this beautiful risk
idea of like beauty in imperfection

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.350
that the pieces of imperfection
are what make something beautiful so

41
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.280
here is a pop that's crack and it's fill
with gold in those areas of its crack and

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.500
it becomes more beautiful
because instead of just being.

43
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.840
A pot that's the same as all the other
pots and now has its own distinct history.

44
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.520
There are some beautiful things that
you can check out on triple two with

45
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.310
really amazing compositions that again and
again are asymmetrical or

46
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.190
playing with ideas of asymmetry.

47
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.670
I think Horizon Design does a really good
job of all of these pieces, if you look at

48
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.080
each composition, they really break
down this beauty in asymmetry.

49
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.524
There's an idea of this kind of
way that your eye goes through.

50
00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:21.150
And you see something like that Sable one,
kind of at the top right.

51
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.405
And it's not only is it asymmetrical but

52
00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.332
they're also breaking out
of the grid a little bit.

53
00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:28.892
Everything else has an idea of grid but

54
00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:33.052
then you have some of these nice
ones like the one with the car,

55
00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:37.212
the one with the baseball player,
where they make a system and

56
00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:42.582
then they break the system, as a way of
calling your eye and calling attention.
