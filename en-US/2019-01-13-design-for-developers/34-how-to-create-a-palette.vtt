&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay so
how many work with color?

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.886
How can we start building a pallet?

3
00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:08.530
Cuz you're gonna build
a pallet in a minute so

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.120
you might want to know how
you're going to do that.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.640
One thing that's nice to
do when you're really,

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.040
really focused on that side project and
you want to make it really good.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.580
You can anchor it from one color.

8
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.620
So if you find your like brand color.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.030
Like let's say it's your brad blue,
you can find kind of

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.540
energetic versions of that color and
more corporate versions of that color.

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.310
Kinda make a color spectrum of
that color and start there.

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.940
Then from there you can desaturate and
get your greys.

13
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.740
So it just in corporate land and world.

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.200
You end up using a lot of grays and
blacks, right?

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.890
That's just something that happens pretty
frequently, so you can kind of desaturate

16
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.120
and find stuff that kind of works along
with your color but they're still grazing.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.022
By having it be a little bit
like your color, it can,

18
00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:07.591
your greys are a little bit richer, like
you could absolutely use hash 333 totally,

19
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:12.860
but like we said, colors are only
colors in relation to other colors.

20
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.610
So if you really want it to be truly grey,
if it's next to that blue,

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.550
then having a grey that's close to that
blue will seem more grey, funnily enough.

22
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.720
And then you wanna gather some accents.

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.280
Any one of these accents
could work against that blue.

24
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.656
We've got yellow, red, pink.

25
00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.510
And each would,
if you kind of go like this,

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.350
each one would kind of
communicate something different.

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.590
That orange as an accent communicates
something different than using the pink

28
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.140
as an accent,
than using the red as an accent.

29
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.840
So, I wouldn't use all of these accents,
but

30
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.350
I would find a nice accent
color to anchor it against.
