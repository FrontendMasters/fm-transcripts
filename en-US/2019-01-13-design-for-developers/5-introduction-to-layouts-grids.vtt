&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's talk about layout,
layout is gonna be our longest section.

2
00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:09.069
So as we work on layout and you're like,
this section is taking forever,

3
00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.088
not all sections are gonna be this long.

4
00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:14.060
But layout is probably one of
the most important concepts.

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.180
So we are gonna spend a bit of time and
give you some background here so

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.030
that you know how to
create beautiful layouts.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.720
Both from the design side and

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.360
then we're also gonna do stuff with
code and talk a bit about CSS Grid.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.350
So why do we talk about grids
when we talk about layout?

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.816
Well, it's kind of an old concept,
actually,

11
00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:39.290
this is not a new thing,
using grids for layout.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.392
So we're gonna do a lot of
designing with grid systems today.

13
00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:47.690
One of the reasons why is it
kind of brings order to chaos.

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.560
When you're constructing
a bunch of disparate things and

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.930
putting them all together,
it really helps your mind focus and

16
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.280
navigate a space if it's
laid out in a grid.

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.270
You can see this in things
like ancient city planning.

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.750
We've always kind of,
as humans, thought of things,

19
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.180
organizing things in systems of grids so
that we can go find them, right?

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.745
It's a lot easier to go find someone's
house if you know where it is on Avenue A,

21
00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:15.279
Street 1 than, I don't know, wherever.

22
00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:19.570
I used to live in the Greek islands,
and that is definitely like,

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.610
you live wherever, and
[LAUGH] you just find your way around.

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.650
And that's the charming part, but also
this is the reason why we've kind of moved

25
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.520
towards more organizational data for
these types of systems.

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.420
It's also so
that we can kind of play around with

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.390
the base concept of the entire
layout with just a few blocks.

28
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.810
Rather than figuring out everything at
once, instead of taking a design and

29
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.600
understanding fonts and colors and
where everything goes and everything,

30
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.020
we're breaking it down into steps.

31
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.795
You only think about the layout,
then you only think about the color.

32
00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:57.530
Then you only think about the photos,
then you only think about the fonts.

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.015
Things like that, it helps your mind kind
of compartmentalize and problem-solve.
