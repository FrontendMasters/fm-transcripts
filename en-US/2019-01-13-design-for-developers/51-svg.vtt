00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: SVG, all right, you
probably heard me rumble about SVG before.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.830
But in case you haven't, SVG is awesome.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.430
Look, we're talking about that piece
of graph paper we talked about earlier.

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.790
And you have points that you're creating,

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.120
you're basically saying, go here,
go here, go here, go here.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.790
And then the browser makes a curve for
you, you've just plot in,

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.530
you've just communicated a few numbers,
and

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.830
the browser knows to make
these beautiful curves and

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.690
all these different fashions based on
some letter you stuck in front of it.

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.190
How cool is that?

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.890
There's so
many ways that you can play with SVG and

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.930
one of the things that I really like
about SVG that has a navigable DOM.

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.010
So, if you're used to
working with the DOM and

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420
you don't wanna learn, with Canvas,
you're learning Canvas.

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.830
But with SVG, you can really literally
slap a class on one piece of the DOM and

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.370
start to move it around.

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.662
And it's in these layers
that are kind of intuitive.

18
00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:06.460
So if you have, let's say you have my
face and my body, and you have my hands

19
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.490
that's separate from my arm, you can move
the hand around separately from the rest.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.530
Cuz they're not all flattened together,
right?

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.620
Like if it was an image that's a JPEG,
you would have to cut my hand out,

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.470
find the background to replace it on top
of and then absolutely position my hand

23
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.180
on to that area but if you just have
little eyes that are on that canvas,

24
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.810
you can just move the eye around,

25
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.240
all you need to do is find it in the DOM
and if it breaks, it's in the DOM link.

26
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.310
And like, you're like yeah,
okay, I see you and

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.670
you can see, you can debug directly
in your browser, super cool.

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.380
SVG can be super performance too.

29
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.100
So it can be like the most performed, like
a lot of the things that I make are like

30
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.150
under 5 kilobytes,
even though they're totally crazy.

31
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.680
But it depends on how many
path points you draw.

32
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.730
So, unlink those other ones where
we're plotting every pixel,

33
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.960
we're plotting all of those points.

34
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.660
If you have a million
bazillion path points,

35
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.780
then that's going to be really expensive.

36
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.770
Whereas, just a few is cheap.

37
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
So drawing a circle, very cheap,
drawing a few lines and stuff, very cheap.

38
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.226
If you have like a texture, that's like
that's probably gonna be really expensive.

39
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:27.453
You can reduce path points for
SVG and make them much smaller,

40
00:02:27.453 --> 00:02:31.434
I have a article in CSS tricks,
it's not linked up here but

41
00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:35.901
if you wanna see it later,
it's increase performance with SVG or

42
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:41.020
something, write performance SVG,
it'll probably come up.

43
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.350
CSS tricks has pretty good SEO and

44
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.070
it runs through all of the tips
that I use to reduce the file size.

45
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.700
I worked for one company where
we actually got a project and

46
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.370
used a lot of SVG, and
I reduced the load time

47
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.850
from 12 seconds to 2 seconds by
optimizing all of the SVGs correctly.

48
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.820
So, there are ways of like,
even if it visually looks the same,

49
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.000
there are ways of working with the SVGs
that can completely change file sizes.

50
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.460
And you can do so much fun stuff with it,

51
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.110
like, this is a huggy laser
panda factory that I made.

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.050
Because that's where all the huggy laser
pandas are made is this factory, and

53
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.550
then you can kind of scroll it down and
it reconfigures, and

54
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.600
it works on responsive,
even old mobile phones and

55
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.960
stuff because it's just click events and
the DOM, and that's it.

56
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.650
It's just some small
request animation frame.

57
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.560
[LAUGH]
SVG actually can make

58
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.580
other images smaller.

59
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.200
This is a tool from a friend of mine named
Shaw, who's definitely worth following.

60
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.250
I just grabbed a random image.

61
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.300
I didn't even carefully
select an image for this and

62
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.270
the output size went from 88
kilobytes to 16.75 kilobytes.

63
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.020
So this is a really cool
tool to check out, too.

64
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.220
And I mentioned before,
SVG can be parts of your layouts, so

65
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.390
if you learn how to draw those bits,
again,

66
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.000
SVG can constrain to any proportions and
it can even take up any spaces.

67
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.293
So if you want to like absolutely position
an SVG within a DIV to make a diagonal or

68
00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:34.717
some other line, that's a really
cool way for you to be able to make

69
00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:39.475
interesting shapes that people can't
usually make in their browser.
