00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Here and the thing
that I really wanted to show you was,

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.560
let's bring this image back, and
I know that it's kind of weird right now.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
I'm gonna ditch the mask,
delete, and do it again.

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.540
It's gonna be sloppy,
just live with it, that's fine.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.050
Okay, so I can take this and
I'm gonna go into the mask and

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.210
kinda rough and tumble fix it up.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.636
I wouldn't do that in real life.

8
00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:33.020
[LAUGH] All right, cool.

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.930
So, let's say I wanted to affect this
image, and change this image, and

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.160
do some cool imagy things in Photoshop.

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.670
One thing that I could do is
I could take one of these

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.326
color things that I kinda
showed you earlier.

13
00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:51.360
And I could adjust the levels, so

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.760
I can take,
levels is a really good way of affecting

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.920
images because you can see the beginning
and end of what we call a histogram.

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.380
So you can see the range of colors and
usually it kinda starts low,

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.470
there are some sort of peak and
then there's some peak on the other side.

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.730
This is not a good image to use because
it usually goes kind of like rounded and

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.310
you bring those in.

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.220
But let's maybe use the other image
that they had, maybe it's better, right?

21
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.480
Let's try this again.

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.040
We're going to bring this down.

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.990
The other thing I want to do is I don't
want to affect the rest of what's

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.680
going on here.

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.036
I only want to affect this layer,
so I'll do,

26
00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:42.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Create Clipping Mask,

27
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.431
and then it will just affect
the layer beneath it and

28
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:45.799
not all of the other layers.

29
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.930
So, okay, we'll go into levels and
there's that histogram.

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.520
So you can see I can pull this up.

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.760
That's a much better histogram,
so I can kinda slide these bars.

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.180
And you see how it's affecting
the entire range of the colors.

33
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.716
So, we probably do actually
wanted to be like a dark image so

34
00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:07.293
that we can see that text.

35
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.895
But if you needed to change it so that
it had a completely different exposure

36
00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:15.837
without really messing with what
the image quality is too much,

37
00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:18.630
then that's kind of
a good way of doing that.

38
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.457
Another one we could use,
I just toss that one for now.

39
00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:25.617
Another good one we can use,
we looked at black and white earlier,

40
00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:28.495
that one was pretty cool because
we can slide these around and

41
00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:31.102
it really affects the way
that those black and whites.

42
00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:34.209
So instead of it just turning,
some of the other black and

43
00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.820
white filters that you use might
just turn it black and white.

44
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.050
This one has more finite control
over all of those properties.

45
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.050
Let's toss that one.

46
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.410
Invert always an interesting one.

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220
If you ever get really bored
while you're designing and

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.750
you're like, lets just see
what it looks like backwards.

49
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.680
Sometimes cool things can happen,
sometimes you're like, its way better now.

50
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.720
You're burnt out on the design and
you don't think it's going anywhere and

51
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.240
you invert the whole thing.

52
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.680
And you're like, actually I like it now.

53
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.163
This is much better.

54
00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:12.702
So if I pulled this invert up,
because I didn't do a clipping mask,

55
00:03:12.702 --> 00:03:15.665
it would actually invert the whole design.

56
00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.190
But I could also drag it back down and

57
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.900
it's just affecting what's
beneath it right now.

58
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.090
Here's another one.

59
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.450
Let's do brightness,
contrast is kind of what you'd assume.

60
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.869
Posterize is kind of interesting,

61
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:37.071
it kind of breaks up the color
in this really stylized manner.

62
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.613
You've probably seen people
use posterize on the web for

63
00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:42.618
more magazine quality things.

64
00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:46.570
So if you want to spruce up your design,
you can try that, that way.

65
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.230
Another good one is we
can go to Hue Saturation,

66
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.950
and then we have all of these sliders
where we can saturate the color.

67
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.050
You can also play with hue and
get all sorts of crazy effects as well.

68
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.600
Another way to play with it that's not one
of those overlays is like what we showed

69
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.120
before where we're doing these kind of
color overlays or gradient overlays.

70
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.610
I'm going to use a color overlay, but
there's this blend mode option where I can

71
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.750
say, okay, I'm going to do color burn and
it's probably more obvious with overlay.

72
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.152
You can do linear lights,

73
00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:36.560
pin lights, hard mix, difference.

74
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.110
So you see how all of those

75
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.750
create almost like a completely different
image as you're working with it.

76
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.210
So if you have an image that you think
the composition of it is great but

77
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.670
you're not in to the color.

78
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.800
Or you're not into the way that it works,
you can play with it this way.

79
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.760
You can add these effects,
you can even add them as

80
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.690
masks on top of the image and delete
parts of it and bring parts of it back.

81
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.090
So there's tons of ways that you can
work with images that are really

82
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.880
super flexible, awesome!
