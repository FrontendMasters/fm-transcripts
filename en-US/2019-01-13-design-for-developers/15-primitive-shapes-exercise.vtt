00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We're
approaching our first exercise.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.010
One thing I want to touch
on before we do so is,

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.820
obviously when we're working inside of
Photoshop to do this kind of exercise,

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.430
I am doing the most basic and
quickest of layout examples.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.510
You can make them more stylish and
eventually make them kind of look and

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.280
reflect a real layout.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.010
So here's an example that I
really like that I found.

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.830
That these little blocks of text,
I took the blocks of text and

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.300
I made a PNG out of it.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
So that you can actually use it in
your layouts and grids, if you want.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.620
It's in the Git Repository.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.100
So if you want to lay out your grid
with more than just rectangles.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.440
You can actually have
something that kind of

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.140
shows what you mean a little bit better.

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Especially if you're communicating
design to somebody else,

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.910
they might not know what's a photo and
what's a block of text.

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.560
So it kinda visually indicates
which things are which as well.

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.170
All right, exercise, get out your pens.

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.080
We're gonna create three compositions
with just primitive shapes,

20
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.600
circles, rectangles, triangles,
lines, things like that.

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.350
Just like we just did.

22
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.170
So let's try this on paper first.

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.880
I do think it's great to do it inside of
things like Photoshop, and Sketch, and

24
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.180
all of those things.

25
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.360
But for now, I think it's kind of nice,
if you're gonna do just a few a time,

26
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.580
to try this on a piece of paper and
really feel more tangible about it.

27
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.210
You all have pencils so you can erase too.

28
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.770
And for those following along online or

29
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.150
in the recording,
you have to do the exercise.

30
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.610
None of this stuff works if
you don't do the exercises.

31
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.320
If you just follow along then you
won't get as much out of this course.

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.440
You really have to try it too, okay.
