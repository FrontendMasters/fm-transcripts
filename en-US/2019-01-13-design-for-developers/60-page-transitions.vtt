00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.590
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Another thing that
you can do once you're kind of done

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.760
making prototypes is you can do
things like page transitions.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.690
And so
I made this demo that shows how to create

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.720
these kind of smooth page transitions even
with interaction on a view application.

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.810
And basically, the way that it works is
within middle ware and the Vue X store,

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.550
Vue X is a little like redux.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
I'm storing what's page it's on and
then I have CSS transitions that work

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.020
from page to page and
I have the same things transitioned.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.150
So basically, that if I restart this,

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.290
this piece is consistent across
a bunch of different routes.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340
But the nav it stays for
each one of those routes.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.650
So I did a write-up of how
this is all made for Vue, and

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.800
then a friend forked it to React, and
then another friend forked it to Angular.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.330
So if you're working within any
one of those frameworks, and

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.660
you wanna try to make these kind of smooth
page transitions across your applications.

16
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.233
If you're using one of those three
applications those examples exist and

17
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.201
are all open source for you to check out.

18
00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.753
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Another way
that I kinda plan these out,

19
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.620
I thought I would show you something
that's like, a work in progress.

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.920
And I'm changing,
I'm in the middle of changing this.

21
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.990
So, this is an original dribble shot
that that somebody made, and I'm going

22
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.940
to completely redo all of these pieces
like we showed about the remixing before.

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.150
But the first thing I do is I take
the similar objects, and I keep

24
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.610
some of them static across things, and
then for some of them, I make them bigger.

25
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.800
Some of the pieces stay consistent,
some of them drop down,

26
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.770
some of them go away, but basically, I'm
just keeping that all in one art board so

27
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.020
I can move little pieces around.

28
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.270
And I can see how it would change and
adjust for

29
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.630
either different screen sizes or
for different views of those pages.

30
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.287
So that's how I made that
page transitions one as well.

31
00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:14.866
Is I kept some pieces consistent across
each of the things and just changed maybe

32
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:20.100
their scale or maybe it has a rounded
corner now, or something like that.

33
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.590
So that's one that you
could work with that.

34
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.740
Lee Long if you don't know his work,
does this awesome dribble shots,

35
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.400
he's not a developer, these are all
just imaginations of things, so

36
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.310
he makes these an After Effects.

37
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.610
So he makes all of these an After Effects
and exports them as gifs so

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820
he hasn't really made them in code or
anything.

39
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.830
But if you wanted to like practice or

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.020
even just get inspired by some of this
stuff that he makes, they are really cool.

41
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.390
Rally does really great
things with Motion too.

42
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.060
Where they just have these subtle
little transitions between effects.

43
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.260
This is real,
this is on websites and stuff, so

44
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.880
you can go check out their code as well.

45
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.600
Everything Rally does is gorgeous, and

46
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.420
their typography is also
really well done as well.

47
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.620
They do things like this for
their site where you have these

48
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.250
different sections and this floating
ribbon between each one of them.

49
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.920
And if you click it kind of expands and
changes.

50
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.700
This was always on a site that
was like their beta site.

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.690
They kept futzing with it and

52
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.770
they wouldn't ship it because they
were being too perfectionist about it.

53
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.070
So if you go to their site and
this isn't it,

54
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.890
you have to go to like beta.rally or
something.

55
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.019
They just never were happy enough with it,
but I think it's gorgeous.

56
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300
There's also, this one's not rally,

57
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.440
I miss attributed it this is
somebody else on dribble.

58
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.310
I should change this thing, but
I thought it was a really nice transition.

59
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.176
It's a nice way,
it's another time where you can use SVG or

60
00:03:55.176 --> 00:04:01.160
SVG filters to kind of make
page transitions come to life.

61
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.210
Codrops, how many of you know Codrops?

62
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.350
Just like three, not that many of you.

63
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.320
Go to Codrops immediately,
they're amazing.

64
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.470
This is one example of 1,700 and

65
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.090
they show you how to make
all of these things in code.

66
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.630
So all of their examples
are like this good.

67
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.120
And they're all different, and
they all are just fantastic.

68
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.790
And a lot of them use CSS Grid, too.

69
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.470
So if you wanna learn CSS Grid
a little bit better, and

70
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.920
some of these great effects, man,
they're geniuse, check it out.

71
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.850
Cool, if you do wanna check it out and
create these kind of animations tomorrow,

72
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.310
I have a whole course where we
go into some of this stuff.

73
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.550
But there's this idea
called flip on the web, and

74
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.520
its a way to get really
performing animations.

75
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.852
So the way that you do that is you get
the bounding client rec, which is just

76
00:04:56.852 --> 00:05:02.358
like the x, y, width, height coordinates
of the first state of the thing.

77
00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:06.334
And then you get the end state and
how big that is.

78
00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:08.960
And then you find
the space in between there.

79
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.940
If that doesn't sound like fun to you,
which it might not, David Khourshid,

80
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.890
who you should definitely check out
his work, he's also a great animator,

81
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.060
has a thing called Flippy.

82
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.230
It's a library that he created, so
that you can create some of those effects.

83
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.190
It's really nice, and
it doesn't need the framework.

84
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.690
So if you're not framework person, or

85
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.430
if you're a framework
person you can use them.

86
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.460
In Vue, we do this stuff under the hood.

87
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.690
You can just wrap a thing in
a thing called transition group,

88
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.124
and all of that calculation happens for
you, how cool is that?

89
00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:49.110
That's awesome, Vue is great, [LAUGH].

90
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.080
If you want to use something that also
does a lot of hardware acceleration for

91
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.670
you under the hood, GreenSock or
GSAP does that, and you don't

92
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.140
have to manually hardware accelerate
anything there, already doing that.

93
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.330
They're gonna assume that you
want hardware acceleration, and

94
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.694
they have a flag where you can tell
it not to be hardware accelerated if

95
00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:10.860
you'd ever want that.
