00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.170
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: For RGBA, x is a number
from 0 to 255, y is a number from 0 to 1.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.960
So anytime we use a or alpha or opacity,
we're always going from 0 to 1,

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.980
and we have stops in between, like 0.5
opacity would be half the opacity.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.407
So if we're working with RGB or RGBA,
we would do 0 to 255, 0 to 255, 0 to 255.

5
00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:31.707
So 255, 255, 255 is white,
0, 0, 0 being black and

6
00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:37.500
then if you have all of the numbers
the same, it'll be some form of grey.

7
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.360
And we can adjust each
one of those channels,

8
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.610
how much you want red, green, and blue.

9
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.580
I don't love RGB, to tell you the truth.

10
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.000
And I'll show you why in a second cuz I
think there's a superior color format

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.590
than RGB.

12
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.670
So we start with RGB, it's okay,
it's not my favorite.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.770
Okay, Hex, Hex is probably what everybody
is used to and uses all the time.

14
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.960
That's cuz it's super copy pastable,
right?

15
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.190
You don't have things in parentheses,
and all sorts of stuff,

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.020
you're just copying it, and pasting it,
and there you go, you have hex.

17
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.990
It's not very human-legible though, right?

18
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.020
It doesn't need to be, because it's just
about the computer understanding it.

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.770
But if you need to communicate color,
it's not the best color choice, right?

20
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.310
If I gave you a hex value and
said, make this a brighter red,

21
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.110
you'd be like, okay,
let me open some sort of tool to do that.

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.450
Or like if you're really super nerdy
like me you could probably do that,

23
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.840
but you don't need to get to
those levels of nerdines.

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.618
Nobody does,
[LAUGH] it's not a useful skill.

25
00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:49.760
[LAUGH] So basically most common but
least human readable.

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.760
And really it's similar to the red,
green, blue that we talked about before.

27
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.450
And now you're not even curious why
it's red, green, and blue, right?

28
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.280
Now you know we're working with
additive color mixing red, green, and

29
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.600
blue make all the colors.

30
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.650
Yeah, makes sense?

31
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.640
So we've got the red, green,
and blue on each of those.

32
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.730
And basically, when you're changing
the base colors, if you do want to get

33
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.580
super into the nerdiness, I included
some slides that you can dig into later.

34
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.610
We're not gonna go super over this
right now in the interest of time.

35
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.890
Here's my favorite, [LAUGH] HSLA.

36
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.870
HSLA is human readable, and
it's an awesome color mode.

37
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.890
X is a number from 0 to 360,
y is a percentage

38
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.970
from 0 to 100%, and
x is a number from 0 to 1.

39
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.110
So basically for HSLA, what we've got
is hue, saturation, and lightness.

40
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.090
And hue is that color wheel that
we saw that we were playing with,

41
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.440
which also means that if you have to
generate color, it'll never fail.

42
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.922
So if I had to create some crazy
colors all over the spectrum, and

43
00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:03.744
I used RGB, eventually I'm gonna hit,

44
00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:09.144
I have to basically make sure that it
doesn't ever hit above or below 255.

45
00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:14.600
But if I'm working with H,
1% is the same amount as 361%.

46
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.820
It just keeps going,
it just keeps going around in a circle.

47
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.070
So if you wanna make generative color,
you don't have to set any boundary.

48
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.380
You can just do it up and
it's going to always fall in line.

49
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.230
And if I told you, hey here's a color,

50
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.300
make it a little bit less saturated end
of turquoise, you could do it actually.

51
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.750
Even if I gave you a random thing.

52
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.890
You could be like okay I'm gonna take
it down on the saturation I know that's

53
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.880
a percentage.

54
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.290
So I'm gonna just take
that down from 60% to 40%.

55
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.770
And I'm just gonna move around
the wheel until I get to turquoise, and

56
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.506
you can totally do that.

57
00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:52.410
Cool, I love it.

58
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.238
All right, so you can do these kind
of goofy projects that I do where I

59
00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:00.250
play with lists and colors and stuff.

60
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.280
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a question.

61
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.951
So it seems like most
pre-processors like CSS and

62
00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:10.191
JS solutions will compile or

63
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:14.781
at least turn HSL into an RGBA value, for

64
00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:20.194
one reason or
another which always stomped me.

65
00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:23.630
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah,
a lot will, that's true.

66
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.900
I think what's nice about using SCSS and
SASS is that you can

67
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.380
play with those color values and play
with these formulas like I'm doing here.

68
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.160
In a way that you're not kind of,
you're kind of understanding that.

69
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.870
And also within CodePen even
you can compile it down and

70
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.000
see what it's outputting.

71
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.430
There's just like in this drop down here,
you can kinda click and see each one.

72
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.670
Unfortunately, yeah,

73
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.650
I think that it's become a more
of base comfortable color value.

74
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.870
Because it was supported before HSL was,
so I think in order

75
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.850
to play it safe they kind of convert to
RGB even though it's well supported now.

76
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.750
There's a new color format that's
coming out in a few years that's like,

77
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.510
way more intense and sophisticated.

78
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.300
It's kind of like the CSS
grid of color formats.

79
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.150
I saw a talk on it and I understood
like 10% of what was going on.

80
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.910
So look forward to new color formats
thatare even more spectacular.

81
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.780
If you wanna go look at some of
that material Chris Lily has

82
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.641
a great talk in CSS
conference in Singapore.

83
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:39.380
He's the guy who invented SVG and
he's working on that color spec as well.

84
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.120
But yeah, good question.

85
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.781
It's mostly because the support started
with RGB, and then went into HSL.

86
00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:53.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah, so you can kind of
create these kind of generative colors.

87
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840
I could also do this in JavaScript,
it's just a for loop, right?

88
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.360
I'm just changing things up and

89
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.690
especially if you're using
things like D3 or something.

90
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.010
Then it's really easy cuz you're
basically saying grab the index,

91
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.990
multiply it by 2 or whatever.

92
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.633
And then it's like, [SOUND] and

93
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:17.318
that's the sound it makes
when it comes on the screen.

94
00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:22.915
[LAUGH] Actually now,
that kind of looks like [SOUND].

95
00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:26.860
Named colors,named colors are pretty good
for demonstrations, but not anything else.

96
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.780
You don't wanna use named
colors in your applications.

97
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.900
It's nice if you have to show somebody
something and you just write purple, and

98
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.650
it is purple, and then they know it's
purple, but they're really inconsistent.

99
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:45.410
Grey is darker than dark grey for
instance, Alice blue is basically white.

100
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.150
There's this game that code poet who is,
Chris Heilmann on Twitter.

101
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.470
He made this game where you
have to guess the named color.

102
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.060
And like, even friends of mine who
wrote some of these specs are like,

103
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.070
I can't beat this game.

104
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.300
So, it's just not super consistent.

105
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.128
It is a fun game to play because
you can kind of be, what?

106
00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:07.696
Why, [LAUGH]
