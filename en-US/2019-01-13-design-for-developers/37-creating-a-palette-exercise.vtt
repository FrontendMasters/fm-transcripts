&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
use any of the tools and

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.560
techniques you just learned and
create a palette of five colors.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.120
Then create five grays and blacks.

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.530
Then apply that to your last composition.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.800
So when I say apply that
to your last composition,

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.110
you don't have to put it everywhere,
right?

7
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.960
You don't have to like stick it
everywhere because probably somewhere

8
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.250
in that composition is a photo.

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.642
Somewhere in that
composition is some text.

10
00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:24.297
But if you see little places
where you can add accents,

11
00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:27.730
take one of your primary colors and
apply it there.

12
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.120
All right, if you see a little
place that has accents.

13
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.220
If you don't have a place to add
accents of different colors, add them.

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.900
Cool, sound great?

15
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.400
Okay.
