&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
when you first start designing,

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.110
things might not turn out the way
that you intended, right?

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.260
They might not be exactly like what you
wanted to or come out exactly perfect.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.860
But that's okay, because when you look at
the designs that you see on Dribble or

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.030
some of the fantastic designs for

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.200
applications that you use,
Spotify has a beautiful design.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.150
You might think, I wanna do that.

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.630
It might not look like that right away,
and that's okay.

9
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.860
There's tons of ways
that designs will fail.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.287
And sometimes it takes a couple of
bad designs to make a good design.

11
00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:37.480
You probably didn't learn
how to code overnight,

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.551
you had to write some really bad code and
then you get better and better.

13
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.678
And you look at the code from
a year ago and you go, wow,

14
00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.550
I can't believe I wrote that.

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.560
That's not good.

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.750
So keep trying, keep working on it.

17
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.360
There's even gonna be times where I'm
gonna be live designing for you today.

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080
I might be really bad, and that's okay.

19
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.510
I'll do it a couple of times
until we arrive on something.

20
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.670
This pumpkin is definitely
gonna be me later today.

21
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.070
I like these, so
I [LAUGH] just keep going with them.

22
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.300
I'll do this all day long.

23
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.104
So the last thing I wanna talk about
is this concept of perfection.

24
00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:17.527
And there's this book called Art and
Fear, that I really love, and

25
00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:18.800
it has this stanza in it.

26
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.750
The ceramics teacher
announced on opening day

27
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.540
that he was dividing
the class into two groups.

28
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.000
All those on the left side of the studio,

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
he said, would be graded solely on
quantity of work that they produced.

30
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.030
And all those on the right,
solely on the quality.

31
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.020
His procedure was simple.

32
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.710
On the final day of the class,
he would bring in the bathroom scales and

33
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.740
weigh the work of the quantity group,
50 pounds of pots rated an A,

34
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.400
40 pounds a B, and so on.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.150
Those being graded on quality, however,

36
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.160
only needed to produce one pot,
albeit a perfect pot to get an A.

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.960
Well, it came grading time and
a curious fact emerged.

38
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.820
The works of the highest quality were all
produced by the group being graded for

39
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.970
quantity.

40
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.210
It seems that while the quantity group
was busy churning out piles of work and

41
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.240
learning from their mistakes, the quality
group had sat theorizing about perfection.

42
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.900
And, in the end,
had little more to show for

43
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.410
their efforts than grandiose theories and
a pile of dead clay.

44
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.070
I think that that's great.

45
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.530
That's how we learn.

46
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.040
That's how we grow, is by making mistakes.

47
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.620
By things not looking right at first,
and eventually you get better.

48
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.000
So, if you start to work in this class and

49
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.830
you're like, it's not quite where
I want it to be, just keep at it.

50
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.870
It's okay.

51
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.935
It's only and eight hour class.

52
00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:38.621
This is gonna give you some of
the tools in your toolbox so

53
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:40.515
that you can build great things later.
