00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So one of the things
that we talk a lot about in

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.280
these things is balance and symmetry.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.410
So having something be harmonious
by being mirrored on both sides.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.226
And don't worry,

5
00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:14.500
we're gonna talk about asymmetry too,
this is not the only way of working.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.315
So you can see things that use balance and
symmetry in art.

7
00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:23.006
This is a Damien Hurst painting.

8
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.392
We can see it in architecture.

9
00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:28.880
I'm gonna use architecture references
a few times because I think it's one of

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.060
the older, showing that this has
kind of gone through human history.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.295
But also the investment, right?

12
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:40.133
To build something like this and
decide we're gonna go for symmetry,

13
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.987
and have people work on it for
1,000 years, yeah,

14
00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:47.527
that's an investment in symmetry,
[LAUGH] right?

15
00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:50.002
You feel like you spend a lot
of time on a weekend project.

16
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.621
Woo, this is a lot of
investment in symmetry.

17
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.351
There are some really great Dribble
shots that show things like balance and

18
00:00:58.351 --> 00:00:59.390
symmetry.

19
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.690
But even in these,

20
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.040
we're starting to get a sense of where
asymmetry might start to leak in.

21
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.720
So if you look at the one on the left
by Ben Kocinski, you start to

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.730
have the way that maybe instead of
having all the colors line up exactly or

23
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.540
breaking that symmetry to keep
the rhythm in your eye moving around.

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.040
So it's not super flat.

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.270
And the really nice thing about symmetry
is that when you do break that,

26
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.910
your eye goes right there.

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.880
So if you want to draw people's attention,
and

28
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.898
you're employing something like symmetry,
you can break it.

29
00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:43.067
And then have people call people's
attention to a certain area.

30
00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:46.131
So in this design,
everything kind of lines up,

31
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:49.290
everything kind of lines
up in a Monument Valley.

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.180
But then they really wanna bring
you over to that tunnel, so

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.450
they kind of break that idea of symmetry
and then that's where your eye goes.

34
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.940
So websites can often get these kind of

35
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.920
ideas of symmetry over and
over and over again.

36
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.930
You can also see where they break the
symmetry in order to call your attention

37
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.820
to a call to action.

38
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.390
So anything that's bright that
shows a different piece of

39
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.080
that composition is another
way of drawing attention.

40
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.130
But here's where symmetry
kind of falls flat.

41
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.580
Things can get really symmetrical and
it does look very ordered, but

42
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.665
it also starts to kinda look
a little boring, right?

43
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:34.750
I like these sites, they're okay.

44
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.740
These are demo sites by the way,
I'm not picking on any businesses.

45
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.667
They're okay, but I wouldn't go tell
someone about them later, right?

46
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.563
I wouldn't be like, my God,

47
00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:48.010
you have to see this site [LAUGH]
that I saw the other day.

48
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.630
It looks just like all the other
sites I saw the other day [LAUGH].

49
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.850
So there are really great ways of
presenting yourself professionally

50
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.710
using symmetry, but sometimes it
starts to look really kinda basic.

51
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.090
So breaking out of that.
