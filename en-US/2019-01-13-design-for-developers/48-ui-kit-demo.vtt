00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so
let's do some remixing ourselves.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.800
I have prepared, for you,
I didn't actually do much.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.460
I bought a UI kit called Multicolor,
and it has all of these screens.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.850
And they're great, but I don't wanna use
it just the way that they have it, right?

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.330
So maybe I might say, okay, this one
piece right here looks really good,

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
but I'm gonna take this and
remix it a little.

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.214
So I'm gonna crop it down and
then I'm gonna say okay,

8
00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:40.420
I wanna change, this is too
like you know displayey for me.

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.588
Maybe I want to try, do I have Oswald?

10
00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:51.200
Yeah, maybe I want to make it bolder and
look more large and in charge.

11
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.030
That's an official turn for this.

12
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.728
I go Character and I go Optical and
I'm gonna make them all caps.

13
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.160
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So already that's
[LAUGH] way different in look and feel.

14
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.100
Maybe I'm gonna change these arrows, too.

15
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.380
So I'll go to something
like The Noun Project.

16
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.250
I don't know if you've
seen The Noun Project,

17
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.390
but it's got all of these
awesome icons and stuff.

18
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.313
You can say arrow.

19
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Tons of arrows.

20
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.166
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Maybe I wanna do like a,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Something like that,

21
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:38.856
I don't know.

22
00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:42.153
I'll just download that.

23
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.805
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: SVG, go File, Open,

24
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.209
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm gonna bring
this into that Multicolor [COUGH] and

25
00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.170
when I'm working on the web, I'm gonna
use this SVG totally differently.

26
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.410
I'm gonna optimize it, we're gonna
talk about images in just a second.

27
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.400
But I can take this,
that's not what I wanted.

28
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.426
I'm selecting a group, not a layer.

29
00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:24.500
Go here, take that layer right now,
and go right arrow, left arrow.

30
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.826
Gonna put this here.

31
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:32.360
I can double-click on the layer itself and
do all sorts of things to it.

32
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.900
Right now I'm gonna give it a color
overlay, and maybe I'll give it a color

33
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.400
overlay of maybe like an accent,
that one might be cool.

34
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.670
All right, that's not as cool as I
thought it would be, that's okay.

35
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.554
Then I'm going to take it and
reverse it, so

36
00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:56.695
it'll bring it to the other side,
and I'll transform it.

37
00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:03.802
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: [NOISE]
I messed that up.

38
00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:04.717
Zoom in a little bit.

39
00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:10.176
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right.

40
00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.370
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And now maybe I'm gonna
use a different image for the background.

41
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.300
Let's see, that could work, too, but

42
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.083
maybe I'll take, since we already have
this one, I'll just drop it in there.

43
00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:28.611
And say, okay,

44
00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:32.821
go, [INAUDIBLE]

45
00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:46.276
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Take this,

46
00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.288
bring it back, mask it, all right,

47
00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:54.459
now I'm gonna change this to
black text instead of white text.

48
00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:02.134
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And maybe give it
some sort of thing behind it, so

49
00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:05.166
I can read it a little bit better.

50
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:09.183
Or maybe we'll just peel back the,
let's play with the mask here so

51
00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.370
that you can learn that a little bit.

52
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.390
Remember how there's
black in the background?

53
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.930
I'm gonna go back to the text being white.

54
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.483
And then for this mask, I'm gonna use

55
00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:27.052
this black color and get my brush.

56
00:04:27.052 --> 00:04:32.120
And I'm gonna make a bigger size and bring
the hardness down and the opacity down.

57
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.170
So now I can kind of mask that area.

58
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.000
And the nice thing about masking,
and I always use masking,

59
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.454
the nice thing about masking.

60
00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:47.094
This is not the pen this is the pencil
that's why or the brush pencil,

61
00:04:47.094 --> 00:04:48.220
let's go back.

62
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.960
The nice thing about masking is
you can always bring it back.

63
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.030
So even if you mess up and
you take away too much or

64
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.170
something like that,
you can always turn it back around.

65
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.490
So I'm gonna be like that's too much,
I'm gonna go gray instead.

66
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.390
Then I can bring some of that image back,
then I can switch these two and

67
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.320
bring some parts back as well.

68
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.367
You can kind of get the drift
of what you can do there.

69
00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:27.350
So already this is a completely different
design than what we started with.

70
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.360
Maybe it's not what we want, maybe it is
what we want but it isn't at all the same.

71
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.245
So you can see how you can take something
that was purchased, and kinda play around

72
00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:42.145
with it until it's your own,
until it's not where you started from.

73
00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.935
And you can even take illustrations and
purchase those, and

74
00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:46.585
put them into your designs.

75
00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:51.215
I'll use a purchased SVG sometimes, and
then play around with it and animate it or

76
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.285
something like that.

77
00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.925
That's totally cool too,

78
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:57.355
so you can just kind of manipulate
things until it's your own.
