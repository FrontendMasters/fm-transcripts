00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.110
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The last
thing I wanna say is,

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.980
I mentioned that my name's Sarah Drasner.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.320
I don't actually consider
myself a designer.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.380
I consider myself a developer who
can design because I don't spend

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.400
all livelong day working on designs.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.620
I know people who do do that for a living.

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.300
Out of respect for them,
I don't call myself that.

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.220
I mostly spend my time coding.

9
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.020
But what I do, do is create design so
that people are interested in my code.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.420
So that when I do show something that I
think is really interesting and dynamic,

11
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.090
people are like, whoa, that looks so
cool, and then they dive into the code.

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.570
Otherwise, they're probably
not gonna be that engaged,

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.990
even if it's a really good concept.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.380
I was, however In another life and
art professor for

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.200
college, I have a masters degree in art.

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.220
So I have some background here,
I'm not just like a schlep off the street.

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.900
That said, I'm probably more like you
where I'm a developer who's a designer.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.820
And that's the purview we're
looking at this course from.

19
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.120
It's not gonna be a course for designers,
it's a course for developers so

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.898
that we can design.

21
00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.872
Cool.

22
00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:12.797
Ooh, all right.
