00:00:01.922 --> 00:00:04.650
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Typography, awesome.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.610
Typography is one of my favorite sections,
because it's just like

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.939
actually got more rules that you
can follow and make good things.

4
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.757
[LAUGH] Karl is like, I don't know,
sometimes it works and

5
00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:17.202
sometimes you'll break it.

6
00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:20.980
[LAUGH] Typography is
a little bit stronger.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.430
And also typography is one of those
things where people are into typography.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.360
There are many conferences
about typography.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.150
And if you go and
find typography people on Twitter,

10
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.230
they have like 100 million followers,
people are super into typography.

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.310
So, I'll show you some resources for
people to follow and stuff but

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.430
their's tons of them.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.150
Why is typography important.

14
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.360
I don't know if you guys
heard about this scandal, but

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.269
remember when they said
that moonlighting was,

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.060
there was like a best picture award,
and they got the wrong card.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.451
And the card that they got they said
La La Land instead of Moonlighting.

18
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:09.013
Well, the reason why they didn't
know was because that card was

19
00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:11.133
actually written like this.

20
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.977
So if you're given this card,
you might be confused because you'd say,

21
00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:16.220
Emma Stone's on here.

22
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.390
But it does say La La Land, it just
is big, so you might look at it and

23
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.860
say La La Land which they did do.

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.200
At first they're like, this can't
be right, never mind, La La Land.

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.370
Whereas if it was written like this
instead, if they changed the typography

26
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.380
and the balance of the typography,
it would have been super clear,

27
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.990
I've got the best actress card,
not the best picture card, right?

28
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.940
Because the Oscars is real big,
who cares, you know you're at the Oscars.

29
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.660
[LAUGH] No offense, Oscars, but Best
Actress is a little bit more prominent.

30
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.090
It's very clear that we're
talking about Emma Stone and

31
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.410
that the picture that she was
in was La La Land instead.

32
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.060
So these kinds of typographical balances
are really important for meaning.

33
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.820
It's important for hierarchy.

34
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
It's important for conveying things,
especially because a lot of people

35
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.020
are coming to websites to understand
things, so that's a really big thing.

36
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.220
This is very basic,
probably a lot of you know this, but

37
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.900
the difference between Serif and
Sans-serif is,

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.060
this is a Sans-serif font, it doesn't
have all of these little curlicues.

39
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.540
And then the Serif fonts have these
kind of edges at the end of them.

40
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.988
So that's the difference between Sans and
Serif.

41
00:02:32.116 --> 00:02:35.641
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Slab Serif is kind
of like Serif where it has these little

42
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.766
edges, but instead of them being
these smooth lines and curves,

43
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:44.791
you have them looking a little more like
slabs, like a little bit more chunky for

44
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:48.166
each one of those pieces that
are coming off of there.

45
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:54.450
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
we've got Serif fonts, Sans-serif font.

46
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.430
These are called script fonts.

47
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.290
Handwritten is pretty self-explanatory.

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.790
Display is a little confusing cuz
it can be Sans and can be Serif.

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.520
But it tends to be a font that would be
pretty illegible if it was made small,

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.920
but really good looking
when it's used on display.

51
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.835
Like when it's used as an h1,
it tends to really liven up the place.

52
00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:22.870
[LAUGH] But if you used it for body copy,
it would probably have too much going on.

53
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:27.845
Novelty fonts are like Halloween fonts.

54
00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:30.156
Any font with a heart instead of a dot for
an i.

55
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:33.835
[LAUGH] That kind of thing,
that would be a novelty font.
