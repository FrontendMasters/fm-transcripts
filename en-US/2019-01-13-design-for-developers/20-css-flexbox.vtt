00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There are guides for
both flexbox and grid on CSS-Tricks site.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.900
The guide to flexbox was
done by Chris Coyer and

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.300
the guide to grid was done by Chris House,
I believe.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.890
And they're both up on the site.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.640
It's not just me plugging
the site that I work for,

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.510
it's literally the most viewed
page maybe on the Internet.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.220
Here it says,

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.821
you keep visiting this page, commit
this to memory for God's sake, Sarah.

9
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:34.080
[LAUGH] Cuz if you visit a few times,
it says things to you.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.267
Basically, I have access-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That too.

11
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:37.583
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: What's that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mine says that too.

12
00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:38.669
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yours says that,
too, okay.

13
00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:44.370
I have access to the analytics
on CSS-Tricks site.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.080
It's always the most viewed
page over our home page.

15
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.330
There's always a million
people on our site, and

16
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.400
they're always on the flexbox page.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.930
I don't even know if sites would be built
if that page, like the way that we know

18
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.090
the site is down is because people
are like, wait, I need that page.

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.919
It's a really well done guide,
the guide to flexbox.

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.040
So, I mentioned that there's
ways to make diagonals and

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.410
then circles, then I was really
super hand wavy about it.

22
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.490
So let's talk about some of
those things really quick.

23
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.886
I made this site, Web Animation Workshops,
and I used some of these things.

24
00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:26.310
So, let's see.

25
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.160
So, you can see we have some diagonals in

26
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.690
the layout that kinda go all
the way down the site here.

27
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.000
And then you can see that there's
a couple of images of us and

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.560
then there's kind of cut out
thing that we did with the text.

29
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.576
And if you open up the browser,
what I used for

30
00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:51.600
this was this thing called shape-outside.

31
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.837
So, it's actually a CSS
property called shape-outside,

32
00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:02.702
and you can create circles, and
you can say something like 70%.

33
00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:10.140
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: 60%,
it's too big, actually.

34
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.804
Let me go down, 30% would be too small.

35
00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:17.340
You can kinda see it getting bigger and
smaller.

36
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460
Do you see that as I change the circle?

37
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.490
Let me refresh the page so
that it goes back to normal.

38
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.140
This isn't supported in Firefox or
Edge, that's okay.

39
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.020
I just used an app support and
said, if you don't have this,

40
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.910
turn it into a square.

41
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.480
It actually does progressive
enhancement really nicely,

42
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.885
because it just looks like normal.

43
00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:43.640
[LAUGH] Then it's just two images,
and the text goes around them,

44
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.320
and it's that's also fine.

45
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.660
So it kinda breaks really nicely as well.

46
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.228
It does show up in Chrome and Safari.

47
00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:56.200
And then someday when it's supported,
it will probably just appear and

48
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.620
show up working.

49
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.350
This is just an image with border radius,
right?

50
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.479
These is just like border radius 50%,
and we wrapped that content.
