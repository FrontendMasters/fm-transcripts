&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Typographic color,
no we are not talking about color,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.470
we just talked about color.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.830
What do I mean by typographic color?

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.430
Typographic color is really like
the rhythm and cadence of typography and

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.950
what it really matters for
are things like body text.

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.090
So if you're creating
a large block of body text,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.390
if you blurred your eyes a little bit for

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.670
all of these, you can kind of see what
makes up even grays and what doesn't.

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.130
Stuff that has big chunks
in the middle of it,

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
does not have a typographic color
that fits something like a body text

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.110
very well because it has too much
going on, too much rhythm in it.

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.326
You need something that's
a little bit more even toned.

13
00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:46.426
If I go back you can see it again.

14
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.863
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if you wanna
check out whether something has a good

15
00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:56.710
typographic color for body text, you can
kinda squint your eyes a little bit.

16
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.070
And see if it has that
kind of even cadence.

17
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.120
Responsive typography.

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.290
Mike Reifmueller is a very nice
Australian person who is a friend,

19
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.810
and he invented this kind of formula for
responsive fluid typography.

20
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.720
So it's this wave that you
can work with fonts and

21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.650
kind of like a formula that allows you to,
let's see, it allows you to

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.510
take texts that work well on desktop and

23
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.980
it just like fluidly
responsively skills down.

24
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.710
The good news is, you don't have
to write all of this from scratch,

25
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.360
you can just steal it out of his pens.

26
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.115
He's totally cool with that.

27
00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:46.500
[LAUGH] There's actually like
a one liner you can use for this.

28
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.160
This is kind of like more,
this has a lot of like variables and

29
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.950
stuff In place but it allows you to create
really responsive fluid typography,

30
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.990
we actually use it on CSS tricks too.

31
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.090
So if you ever on CSS tricks and
you scale that window up and

32
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.010
down, you can see the type contract and
get bigger and smaller.

33
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.880
Text Lockup,
this is another CSS tricks thing.

34
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.140
This is kind of cool, right?

35
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320
You've got all of these
different pieces of text.

36
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.190
Let's say you wanted to do something more
creative with the placement of text.

37
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.140
You could do that with different pieces
of an SVG, and then have it scale.

38
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.990
So, you can have it
completely locked up and

39
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.750
still be legible fonts and readable fonts.

40
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.890
Cause SVG actually has text inside SVG and
it's successful as well.

41
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.710
So that's pretty cool.
