00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.154
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Some of the things,
when we're starting,

2
00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:05.810
we're gonna talk about prototyping.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.800
But we're also gonna talk about motion
in general and why you might use motion.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.270
Because when we're prototyping and
when we're adding motion to our site,

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.440
it's kinda like, why would you do that,
why not just deliver a static mock?

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.830
Loaders and perceived performance, and
the reason why we might use motion is that

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.100
humans overestimate
passive wait times by 36%.

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.850
So if you are judging the amount of
time on your site that it takes to load,

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.730
you actually have to
multiply that by 0.36.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.260
Because people are actually thinking
that it would takes longer,

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.530
because they don't have anything to do.

12
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.720
But notice that, that word or
that phrase has the term passive in it.

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.230
So if they have nothing to do in that
time, they'll overestimate that time.

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.840
But not if they'll occupied.

15
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.760
So by adding something like a loader or

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.550
something that they're engaged with,
people feel like the performance

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.460
of the site that they're
visiting is better than it is.

18
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.750
So, perceived wait times,

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
Viget did a study where they showed all
of these different loaders to people.

20
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.890
People are willing to wait twice as
long on a site for a custom loader,

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.090
than they are for one of the ones that
it's just a GIF that goes around.

22
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.190
And part of the reason that
they think that this is true,

23
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.326
is that they assume that
somebody cares about them.

24
00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:29.120
That they assume someone cares about
them enough to have something for

25
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.460
them at the end.

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.060
So if you give someone just a standard
GIF, they'll bounce after 12 seconds.

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.860
But if you even stylize that loader
a little bit, people will wait

28
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.388
twice as long, they will wait until 24
seconds before they will leave your site.

29
00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:50.860
Uncertain wait times feel longer
than known, finite waits.

30
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.400
So these are actually kind
of two different ideas.

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.320
Uncertain wait times are longer
than known, finite waits.

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.500
That's why people tell you how long
it'll take for a line, in some lines.

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000
Like, sometimes you go to Disney World,
and it'll be like an hour long from here,

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.550
or a half an hour long from here,
so that it doesn't feel longer.

35
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.270
Other things that they do is show you
entertainment while you're waiting.

36
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.970
They have all of these cool
little gadgets moving around.

37
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.760
And so you're like, the Star Wars
wait isn't so long, except it's

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.900
way longer than some of the rides, but
people were engaged the entire time.

39
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.130
Airports will also make you walk around a
really long way before you get to baggage

40
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.570
claim, and then when you show up to
baggage claim you're like, my bag is here.

41
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.750
Really, they made you walk around.

42
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.130
You probably could've gotten to
baggage claim really quickly but

43
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.700
felt like you were waiting for
a long time.

44
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.140
If you're walking around,
you're kind of busy and

45
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.150
entertained, not really,
but it feels like that.

46
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.190
So if you're walking and
your bag shows up,

47
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.035
you're like, what an efficient airport.

48
00:02:56.035 --> 00:03:01.270
[LAUGH] Anxiety makes wait seem longer,
doctors know that,

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.880
that's why bring you in from
the waiting room to wait in their room.

50
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.580
You know how they bring you in and then
you're like, they're not ready to see me,

51
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.116
I'm just sitting here.

52
00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:13.350
They do that intentionally because they
know you're probably pretty anxious to

53
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.400
seem them anyway, it's not that great.

54
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.780
So they make you feel like you've
already started the doctor journey

55
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.720
by joining them inside the doctor room.
