00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There's clipping and
masking in images, but

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.980
you can also clip and mask with GIFs.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.970
And you can use SVG to do that as well.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.065
So this is like clipping and masking
within an SVG, I just masked this, and

5
00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:14.867
then you can reveal a pattern and
things like that.

6
00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:24.280
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: This is that scale and
cropping, clipping and

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.700
masking thing that I
showed you from earlier.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.100
Again, really, really useful resource,
so check that out.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.600
I also wrote an article called
Clipping Versus Masking,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.720
When to Use Each because I could
never remember until I wrote down.

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.770
Sometimes I write articles just so
that I can commit it to memory.

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.180
[LAUGH] Or that I know that CSS tricks
has good SEO so I can it later.

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.540
Basically the difference being,
clipping is when you're

14
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.920
taking the geometry of a shape and
using that to cut out another image.

15
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.500
Masking is when you're
respecting the gradients

16
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.220
that you're seeing in those things.

17
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.510
So that one where you saw
the gif going around and

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.680
stuff that had some gradients and
stuff inside of it.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.830
I'm using that to mask a pattern in SVG.

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.888
So, actually, let's go to the,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Clipping and masking.

21
00:01:39.624 --> 00:01:43.464
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So this first CodePen
kinda shows that if this is the original

22
00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:48.540
shade It's got a star, but I also have
a stroke with some dashes and stuff.

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.380
If I'm using a clip path, it's really
just taking the geometry of the star.

24
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.030
Whereas if I'm taking a mask,
it's going to cut out,

25
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.790
it's gonna see the tone,
basically the tone between the.

26
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.280
That green is darker, so
it's cutting it out and making it lighter.

27
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.580
And then the dashes kinda
come through as well.

28
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.590
So that's a nice way of
kind of looking at it.

29
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.410
Noel Delgado did this cool pen where he
was layering two images on top of each

30
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.030
other and using a clip path.

31
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.910
To kind of explore those two images,
which is I think a really,

32
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.120
really popular code pen,
because it's super awesome.

33
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.840
So there's different ways of using images,
the image tag, the background source.

34
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.070
For SVG if you haven't worked with it
before, you can use it inline, and

35
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.470
that's how I would actually
suggest you use it.

36
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.380
Instead of applying it as
a background tab, tag,

37
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.750
or an image source because
when you write it in line,

38
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.170
that's when you can navigate that dom and
apply things.

39
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.060
So that in line is the way that you're
going to be able to access it for

40
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.090
things like animation and stuff like that.

41
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.280
Sprites, you might be
familiar with sprites.

42
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.280
It's when you can have a whole lot
of images and PNGs on one thing.

43
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.220
And then you're exposing one piece of
a background in order to show each piece.

44
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.470
Part of the reason why we do that is
because it's very expensive to make

45
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.570
multiple HTTP requests.

46
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.090
So if you have a lot of images you
wanna put it on this sprite sheet and

47
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.000
there's even things that creates
bright sheets automatically for you.

48
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.850
But when we move in to HDP2,
things like that won't be an issue anymore

49
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.570
because that handles those multiple
request in a much more responsible way.

50
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.980
So if you upgrade your site to using HDP2,

51
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.130
you no longer have to use stuff like
image sprites full page backgrounds.

52
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.800
This is a pretty important one because

53
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.670
there's a lot of times where people
want a full bleed hero image.

54
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.220
Even if you don't want it,
everyone else does.

55
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.420
Or sometimes you want to use it for
some of the geometry of something.

56
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.810
I used it because we created
something with grid and

57
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.160
I wanted it Just sticking
in that one spot, right?

58
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.210
I wanted it to kind of be flexible.

59
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.084
So basically the trick here,
actually some of these prefixes,

60
00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:18.581
we don't need anymore like the O one.

61
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:20.131
I should go update that article.

62
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:23.181
So we use background no repeat,
center, center, fixed.

63
00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:25.211
And then we have background size cover,

64
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:27.651
which basically makes it
take up that whole space.
