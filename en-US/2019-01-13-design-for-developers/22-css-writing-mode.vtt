00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: CSS writing-mode.

2
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.654
Remember, when I put that block
of text that was transformed,

3
00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:06.520
it's turned on its side?

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.330
So one way to do this is CSS writing-mode.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.090
It's also a really good
thing to know about

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.700
if you're doing internationalization for
your site.

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.900
So if you need to support Hebrew, or
if you needed to support Chinese or

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.930
Japanese, it's a really
good thing to know about.

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.300
But you can also use it for regular text.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.970
There's a bunch of different resources
that you can check off of that.

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.100
Jen Simmons actually wrote an article for
24 ways last year, and

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.160
it was really excellent.

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.960
So that's a really good breakdown.

14
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.970
It isn't as well supported
as just transforming.

15
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.770
Just transforming is supported everywhere,
writing-mode is not necessarily.

16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.525
So sometimes,
I'll just use a transform instead of using

17
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:53.190
the writing-mode if it's just for
making it look cool.

18
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.340
Because I know that it will go
the same way across all browsers.

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.352
Css writing-mode, if you're actually
using another language through,

20
00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:03.945
CSS writing-mode is a must.

21
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:11.155
It's not just for cute displays and
stuff, or breaking the grid or whatever.

22
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.428
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So you can use
CSS writing-mode for these kind of,

23
00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:18.870
you see that little
thing on the side there?

24
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.529
That's kinda nice, or
you can use a transform like we

25
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:27.260
saw Jen Simmons do with that whole,
that whole layout that she used.
