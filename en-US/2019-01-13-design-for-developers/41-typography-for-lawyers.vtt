00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Typography for lawyers
is as great book that's kind of old but

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.010
a lot of things still hold through.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.400
So if you're interested in learning
some really good rules for

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.330
type, this is a really good book.

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.300
And it's written with the assumption
that you're a lawyer.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.630
But did also applies for
things on the lab as well.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.440
So in this book it has
these kind of cool charts.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.600
In fact,
your reader is quite different from you.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.520
The attention span for
the writer is long, the reader is short,

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.440
interest in topic is high,
the reader is low, and things like that.

11
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.920
Legal writers, unfortunately, imagine
that their comparison looks like this.

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.900
Attention span, whatever it takes.

13
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.780
Interest, boundless.

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.450
The only reader who might match that
description is your mother or father.

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.060
But one thing that they talk about because
of that attention span is line length,

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
which is really great.

17
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.490
When you have a piece of text that goes on
for a really long time across a screen,

18
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.230
your eye gets pretty fatigued
moving across the page.

19
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.390
And in fact, it's even hard for you to
figure out which line it goes to next so

20
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.370
the longer the line the more it has to
you have to spend some cognition figuring

21
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.280
out where you are on the page.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.760
You might not think of it that way.

23
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.670
You don't think like that was
such a long line of text.

24
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.990
Now where am I but

25
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.550
you kind of notice that you're getting
fatigued a little bit faster like wide.

26
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.520
This is a good article.

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.420
Why am I getting so bored?

28
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.950
[LAUGH] Why don't I like it?

29
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.220
So constraining your
line length to 45 to 90

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.790
characters is a really good rule of thumb
that people try to use across the web.

31
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.630
So that's also actually
why we use columns.

32
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.030
A lot of times in order to display text so
that we don't have

33
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.410
super long line lengths that's something
that newspapers decided a long time ago.
