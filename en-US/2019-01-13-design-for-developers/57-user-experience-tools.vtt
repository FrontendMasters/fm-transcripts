&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So Jeff Graham,

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.780
who I work with on CSS Tricks, had this
article called On Future Requirements,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.780
and I think what's really cool
about this article is this table.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.270
Figuring out some of the end
goals of your users,

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.410
where they're trying to go and
what they expect.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.500
Is a really good way of reimagining or
reintroducing these concepts for yourself.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.880
So many times we think of the site and
we think of it this way right.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.360
We think about it like,
I'm making this and putting this out.

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.940
But what is it like for
people to actually experience the site.

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.400
So, as identify the user who is
visiting your site, I expect that,

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.290
describe the task so
that explain the anticipated outcome.

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.010
And you would do this for many types
of user that might visit your site.

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.820
Because maybe their goals change.

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.230
I do feel like some of
the larger applications,

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.930
sometimes it feels like there are product
teams that own every page of the site.

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.350
And they might not talk to each other.

17
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.140
Have you ever been on an application
where you're like, why did it do that?

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.610
It's because they're not actually

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.120
experiencing the end to
end of their product.

20
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.290
Each area is focusing
on that one specific.

21
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.020
You know, page or goal and they're not
really understanding that whole flow.

22
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.240
So if you can be a user for your own site
and try to put yourself in that mindset,

23
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.320
you can kind of understand what
places motion might be acceptable or

24
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.640
how layout might adjust or how your
goals on that site might adjust as well.

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.100
There's this great
article about story maps.

26
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.850
Again, this section could be a whole
new course on its on as well.

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.090
I think I do have a course
on some of these things.

28
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
And the story maps is like basically
showing how you can plan out

29
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
wire frames and drawings so that you're
considering every step of the process and

30
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.720
What it would look like from start to
finish for someone using your site, and

31
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.410
what they would expect or
want at every step.

32
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.190
You can also create these kind of
end-to-end website flows like I mentioned

33
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.810
those UI kits exist on Shutterstock,
iStock Photo.

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.350
These wire frame kits also
exist on the site too, so

35
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.450
you don't have to make every
little square in here and stuff.

36
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.720
You can drop in pages so
that you can play around with like,

37
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.110
all right if they came
to New York times and

38
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.240
they clicked on this one area maybe they
want to experience some, you know, food.

39
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.240
And maybe from food they wanna go here and
so on and so forth.

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.440
If you want to make these
kind of user flows and

41
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.420
work with pen and pencil,
there are these things called

42
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.000
UI stencils where you can kind of
just draw them up really quickly.

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.230
I like working with them maybe
just because I like the stencils.

44
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.030
[LAUGH] Sometimes it's a little
bit more motivating for

45
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.970
me to create these website flows if I'm
working with tools that get me excited.

46
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.100
And there's no other reason for it but,

47
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.760
except that I wouldn't do that task if I
wasn't like excited about the materials.

48
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.650
There's also stickers,
that you can use as well.
