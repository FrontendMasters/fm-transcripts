&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
let's talk about Scale.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.740
This is a really good one
because this is one that is so

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.170
simple, but it's so effective for
changing things up and

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.250
getting a new kind of concept for
your designs.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.620
So if we have an image and we change the
scale of that image instead of plopping it

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.940
on the page, it becomes a piece of the
layout, or it becomes a piece of the grid,

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.020
or it becomes a little bit more dynamic or
interesting.

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.390
So, any one of these things, like the O2,

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.660
let's say somebody said, okay,
make me a composition with an O and a two.

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.720
You might put that on the page and
be like, nah,

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.310
I don't know what to do with this, but
that's actually a pretty good composition.

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.970
You look at the like,
hand with the vectory skeleton.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.250
That's a pretty boring image actually, but

14
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.760
they made it really dynamic by blowing
up the scale, by turning it diagonal,

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.670
by cropping it in a really awkward kinda
way that's a little bit unique or unusual.

16
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.650
Even with the woman in the dress,
that's just one image.

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.770
They took her, blew her up,
don't care about noise, she's cropped.

18
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.910
You're not even seeing her full body.

19
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.550
And then they took her again and
duplicated her again and

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.640
kind of pushed her out of there a bit.

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.560
And all of a sudden you have
a beautiful composition or

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.690
as if it was just a picture of her on
the page, maybe not so interesting, right?

23
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.813
So that can also be a great way to
introducing something that's a bit

24
00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:40.025
more unique and something that other
people don't do quite as much.

25
00:01:42.474 --> 00:01:46.251
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I was given this project
there was somebody giving a keynote for

26
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.820
Microsoft, and they had this table.

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.110
And it was kind of like just a table and
so they were like, okay, four hours.

28
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.310
Make a design, go.

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.360
So I just kind of skimmed the table,
and that's pretty boring.

30
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.020
So I took this image and

31
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.350
I turned it on its side,
I blew it up really big.

32
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.300
It's actually like a giant image, I'm only
showing you a tiny little piece of it.

33
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.057
But we get that background, the kind of
texture that most people wouldn't have

34
00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:22.758
even noticed in the image, and
it's not important, right?

35
00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:27.060
It's not important that people understand
every bit of what's in that image.

36
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.150
What they need to see and
understand is that their's a little

37
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.520
bit of coffee beans and also that
maybe it's not the most important,

38
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.390
it's not the focal point of this design,
it's a table, right?

39
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.760
Really they're paying attention
to the table and they should.

40
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.410
So, it's pushed into the background.

41
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.335
The other thing I'm gonna show
you today when we're working in

42
00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:52.310
Photoshop is how to make these masks,
and how to work with an image.

43
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.470
Crop scale, mask it so that you can have
it kind of fade into the background and

44
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.260
not just be plopped onto the page.
