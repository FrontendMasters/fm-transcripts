00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.910
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Demo Time, so
how might I use one of these palettes,

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.470
how might I make one of them?

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.286
Well, let's say we're
starting with an image even,

4
00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:15.694
so if you have an image
that you're working with.

5
00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:19.498
And you're like, that is absolutely
the image the image that comes on my home

6
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.400
page, then it's even easier
to work with color, right?

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.320
Because if you start
with one of these images,

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.180
you can build out your
color palette from there.

9
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.416
So maybe we'll go to Unsplash, we'll find,

10
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:39.068
I kind kinda like that one,
maybe download that.

11
00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:41.168
Have you guys used Unsplash before?

12
00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:46.561
Sometimes, yeah, it's nice,
I actually wanna see if they

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:52.610
have turquoise images,
that's kinda a nice turquoise image.

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.316
Sure, all right, let's use this one,
I kinda like it.

15
00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:03.041
All right, so if I go back into Photoshop,

16
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:10.133
let's say we're using this
composition that we made earlier,

17
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:16.592
I'm going to add in File &gt;
Place embedded and Downloads.

18
00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:24.916
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so
now I've got my image and I scale it down.

19
00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:31.111
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Will that fit,
yeah, something like that,

20
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.320
it doesn't have to be perfect.

21
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.660
I think I'll do something like that maybe,
okay, so

22
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.770
you might notice that this
isn't the same as that, right?

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.150
So I might move that over, so
I'm gonna get rid of the Grid for now.

24
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.030
So now I'm gonna go and I'm going to grab,

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.340
I'm using a tool called
the Magic Wand tool.

26
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.480
And I'm gonna go grab the Unsplash image,

27
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.560
you see this little thing
with a circle in it?

28
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.910
I hit that and it becomes a mask, so

29
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.880
now I can use that image in my design,
and then I'm gonna.

30
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.940
Right now it's linked, so the mask and
the image are working together.

31
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.760
But I'm actually gonna unlink this so
that mask will stay in one spot.

32
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.160
And I can move that mask around,
right, or I can move the image around.

33
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.370
Yeah, so
I can move it around inside my design and

34
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.680
be like, I like this, okay, cool.

35
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.034
And then maybe I would pull a color out
of here to kind of play with and look at.

36
00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:40.254
All right, I like that color,
let's make a color palette, so

37
00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.575
I might open up another document.

38
00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:53.657
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's see, we're gonna
just make a kind of narrow and tall thing.

39
00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.120
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right.

40
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.539
Cut like that, and

41
00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.317
I'm gonna do just one at the top here,

42
00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:12.660
here, here, okay, nope.

43
00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:25.395
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, I like that color,
so I'm gonna start there,

44
00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:29.293
maybe I take it, Duplicate, bring it down.

45
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:34.033
And I'm gonna hold onto the Shift
because it'll lock it to that grid, and

46
00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:36.020
I'm gonna take this.

47
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.849
Maybe I bring it down on the color
spectrum a little bit, and

48
00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.368
then I'm gonna do that again.

49
00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:56.222
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Now

50
00:03:56.222 --> 00:04:03.910
on the other side I'm gonna decide
on an accent color, so I have this.

51
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.120
And maybe I wanna go on the other
side of the color spectrum, so

52
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.350
I drag this Hue up, maybe up here?

53
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.080
I kinda want it to get to be
like across the color spectrum.

54
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.711
So I think I'm gonna go for
a brighter color,

55
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:27.691
that's more orange, reddy,
something like that, maybe?

56
00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:31.498
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
you can also see how I would,

57
00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:34.704
actually I'm gonna put
this in a different layer.

58
00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.405
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
then I can kinda do the same thing.

59
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:03.118
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool,
now I'm gonna take all of these guys and

60
00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:05.837
I'm gonna put them in a group.

61
00:05:07.317 --> 00:05:08.829
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm
gonna duplicate the group.

62
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:16.312
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And I'm gonna auto
Auto select by group instead of layer,

63
00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:22.880
pull that down, and
on here I'm gonna use an Adjustment.

64
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.434
So I can do all of these adjustments
with it, so I can basically say.

65
00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:31.097
Okay I want this to change hue,
saturation, and

66
00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:36.807
I want the saturation to be
dropped almost all the way down.

67
00:05:36.807 --> 00:05:40.041
This group goes above,
this group goes below, and

68
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:42.609
we're starting to get a color palette.

69
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.930
So right now, I'm working with
a really limited color palette, but

70
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.040
that's okay, I actually kind of like that.

71
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.250
I might bring this down more, or

72
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.600
I could even add another one, that's like
what if I wanted it super black and white?

73
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.910
Well, I could actually use a black and
white filter, and

74
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.340
I could kinda adjust these cyan screens.

75
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.089
And I could even decide that I want
the opacity of this to be less, so

76
00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:13.013
like maybe bring it all the way up.

77
00:06:13.013 --> 00:06:17.355
And then say like, that's too far,
I do wanna see some of those colors there,

78
00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:19.630
I'm gonna drop it back down.

79
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.610
So now I'm building out my kind
of primary and then my accents,

80
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.100
and all of the grays that I
might use in that application.

81
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.810
Okay, cool!
