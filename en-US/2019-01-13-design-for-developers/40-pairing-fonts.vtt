00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.370
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay.
So some rules that you can follow.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.010
Again, you don't have to listen to me.

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.100
You don't have to follow these.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.040
But if you're looking for rules to follow,
that kind of do well for you,

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.880
these are good ones.

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.380
You pair topography.

7
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.060
You don't just use one font for
the entire site.

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.280
It's nice to use a couple
of things together.

9
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.720
Just like a color, right?

10
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.290
You might use like a blue but
you probably want an accent.

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.840
So when you're pairing using one
display and one sans serif or

12
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.500
using one serif or in one sans serif.

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.950
Kind of finding things that are a little
bit opposite from each other works with

14
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.830
typography too.

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.990
Not more than three.

16
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.890
Don't use more than three for
a number of reasons.

17
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.433
First of all, it makes your
design look like a ransom note.

18
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:48.090
[LAUGH] Second of all, it actually
is really costly performance-wise.

19
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.530
Fonts can really weigh down your sight.

20
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.010
It's up there with loading
a lot of scripts because for

21
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.190
every character you're loading a number
of glyphs that are like SVGs and and

22
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.990
things like that like it has draw
all those lines onto the screen.

23
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.610
So don't load up your site
with too many of them.

24
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.070
Not more than three specially in
the beginning, just try for two.

25
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.670
Unless you're using some sort of
accent somewhere or something.

26
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.945
Don't pick types that are too
similar to each other.

27
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.800
You might think these look kind
of like each other, they match,

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.700
that's not a good thing actually in
font pairing and I'll show you why.

29
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.430
This is actually animated, I will show
you that part later when we get to

30
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.350
the prototyping section, but I carefully
chose those two fonts because they

31
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.130
are very different from each other, right?

32
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.700
The body is like a sans serif, that's
very, very different from this kind of

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.380
display serif that has these kind of
curvy edges and they work well together.

34
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.670
You can even see how you can use the sans
serif in two different ways, I used it

35
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.400
as some body and then also with the small
caps version in some small areas.

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.480
So even if it's just those
two fonts you can change up

37
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.810
the way that you use them in the letter
spacing to change the way that it works.

38
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.120
You can also see some elements of
the complimentary colors thing here too.

39
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.580
So Google Fonts has this
nice pairing thing.

40
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.010
You can kind of test it
out first on their site.

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.350
So if you go to the specimen you can see.

42
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.480
So these are these two fonts put together.

43
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140
So we've got Playfair display and

44
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.380
then Josefin Sans and I can use that or
flip them around or anything.

45
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.420
I think this was supposed to be the
flipped around and I didn't do that right.

46
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.980
Here's an example of doing it wrong,
Leto is really good for body text because

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.280
it's kind of a little bit boring,
like not super boring but pretty boring.

48
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.310
And Oswald is this kind of condensed
font that's a little bit harder to read,

49
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.410
it's really good for titles but
if you look at, if you use it,

50
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.150
if you don't use it as a display, you can
see how that would be really illegible.

51
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.420
Whereas if I switch them that's nice,
the Oswald is bigger and

52
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.790
bolder so it works really well for
something like a title.

53
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.950
And Leto is a little bit boring so we've
got it in a body text, which is a good

54
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.970
thing for a body text, you don't want
to much going on in a body text, right?

55
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
Leto and Open Sans, this is bad,
they're too similar.

56
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.820
They almost look the same.

57
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.680
It's kinda like when you meet somebody's
sibling and they look a lot like them, but

58
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.420
just a little different.

59
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.280
And you're like,
it's like you took your face and

60
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.339
messed it up a little,
[LAUGH] like, not exactly right.

61
00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.270
So they're almost the same, but
just slightly messed up a little bit.

62
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.870
Your eye kind of knows that
they're a little bit different.

63
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.016
So it just ends up feeling not cohesive.

64
00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:46.820
If you don't want to pair things
yourself because you're not good at that

65
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.170
king of thing or your not interested in
that kind of thing, Font Joy is pretty

66
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.400
awesome cuz it allows you to make all
these different font pairings, so it kind

67
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.960
of uses machine learning to figure out
different font pairings that will work.

68
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.600
And just like the coolers generator,
you can just keep going and

69
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.170
hitting the space bar until
you find stuff you like.

70
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.040
Still has that lock option too.

71
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.230
If you find a body copy you really like
and you wanna change the other two out,

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.320
you can keep going out that way,
super nice.
