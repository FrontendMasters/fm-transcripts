&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I think it's good
to make motion design language, and

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.362
a lot of people when you talk about
motion design, so this is like a fake,

3
00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:12.610
you know idea of what a motion design
language could be that I made,

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.150
and I made a GIF of it, it's actually
a codepen demo that you can see.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.930
A lot of people think of
motion design language and

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.930
they think Google material design.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.120
Which they're not wrong, Google material
design is a motion design language and

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.050
it's a well-documented
motion design language.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.440
Probably one of the most well-documented
motion designed languages out there.

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.740
But that doesn't mean that
you should use theirs.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.000
Just like you shouldn't
use their branding.

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.720
It works for them if you do though, right?

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.380
If you, as someone else on the web
uses google material design, and

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.530
someone goes to your site and
they go Google, that's great for

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.270
Google, that's not great for you.

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.910
That's great for them,
like they see that kind of motion, and

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.440
they're like I recognize that,
that's strong branding.

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200
But that's not your branding, so

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.230
by having your own opinions about all
of the ways that motion can work and

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.490
some does and don'ts,
there are things that you decide, right?

21
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.920
There are things that you decide,
choices that you make.

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.590
We always bring things in from the right.

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.402
We never use popping eases, we always do.

24
00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:21.510
You know, and it's,
they might be slightly arbitrary but

25
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.130
they might also be in line with some
of the things that you saw earlier like

26
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.990
if I'm using colors that are more vibrant,
maybe I use more bounces and

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.820
kind of excited things and
maybe if I use more muted tones.

28
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.301
I only use signed eaves and things that
come in kind of less dramatically.
