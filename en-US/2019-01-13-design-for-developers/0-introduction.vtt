&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm Sarah Drasner.

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.230
I'm really excited to be here today.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.145
I, this is the first course I've ever
taught that I made the materials because

4
00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:12.421
people asked me to.

5
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.822
So this course is called Design For
Developers.

6
00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:20.081
I worked for
Microsoft as a Senior Developer Advocate,

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.830
I also worked for
CSS-Tricks as a staff writer.

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.079
We're gonna see some of the CSS-Tricks
in the slide decks today.

9
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.762
And I also, I'm on the Vue Core team.
