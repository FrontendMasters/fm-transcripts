&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: If you need to animate
gradients, don't just animate them.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.176
If you animate a gradient,
it will actually like really cause a lot

3
00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:11.102
of performance issues because
it's really expensive to do that.

4
00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:14.900
There's a lot of repaints
when you animate a gradient.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.630
So I made this pen for

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.230
you to check out and use,
which is an animated transparent mask.

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.910
So what I do is I create
two blocks of colors,

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.440
create a mask of one of them, and
move the color with transforms.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.820
So one of the things is
moving with transforms, and

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.730
then it's an animated gradient, but
you're not causing any layout triggers.

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.259
It's all really performing, transforms are
a lot less expensive than some other types

12
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:44.045
of things, like margin and lift.

13
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.763
And especially changing background colors,

14
00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:51.160
all cause repaints in your browser
which makes them very expensive to run.
