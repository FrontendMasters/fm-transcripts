&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so
we just learned all about images and

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.660
a bunch of things that we can do within
our compositions to do use those images,

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.570
so we have an exercise.

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.230
Take your last composition and

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.600
fill in one area with an image and
there's another little challenge in here.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.030
Let's try to make a mask or clip,
or a background shape, somehow.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.490
So we talked about diagonals,
we talked about circles.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.804
Let's try to do something that's
a little bit more unique in here.
