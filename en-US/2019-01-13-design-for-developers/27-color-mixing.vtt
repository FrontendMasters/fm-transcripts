00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.270
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
there are these special cases where you

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.830
have crossover events.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.810
This Serop painting are a little,
it's actually a painting.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.990
So you'd think it's
subtractive color mixing.

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.710
But the way that he painted it
was with all of these points.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.110
And so all of those bits
of points mix in your eye,

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.790
and create additive color mixing.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.650
So if you actually look at some
of the yellows in this painting,

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.420
you'll see a lot of red and greens next
to each other, which is really cool.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.330
And also, part of the reason
why I'm telling you this,

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.980
is because there's a color
wheel in either case.

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.880
And we're gonna use that color wheel to
discuss some of the ways that you combine

13
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.090
colors.

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.800
So some of the ways that you might
combine colors are monochromatic,

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.150
meaning just dealing with one color and
highs and lows of keys in that one color.

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.070
Complementary would be
across the color spectrum.

17
00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.040
Analogous would be next to each other,
and triadic would be across three ways.

18
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.290
And I'm gonna go over this a few times.

19
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.920
One of the things that makes color so

20
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.910
difficult, is that a color is only
a color in relation to another color.

21
00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:16.650
So that gray becomes a very very bright
color when it's next to darker colors,

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.980
and that gray becomes darker when
it's next to a lot of light colors.

23
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.870
And this goes across
different color spectrums.

24
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.000
Something that seems blue next to another
blue might turn turquoise or green.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.400
Something that seems blue next to
a yellow will become really bright.

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.225
So that actually makes color
a little bit difficult actually,

27
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.670
cuz it's kinda squirrely.

28
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.040
You might have a palette.

29
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.220
You're like I have a palette,
and it's all squirreled away and

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.300
you add another color and you're like,
why does the palette not work anymore?

31
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.160
[LAUGH] Partially because of this.

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.200
And that contrast is actually
a really important piece.

33
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.840
That's why someone will create something
that's really an accessible color palette,

34
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.450
and then be like,
why did it become not accessible?

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.110
Well, it's because of
the contrast to another color.

36
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.330
So if you're creating a website and
you're using different colors,

37
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.540
you should check the contrast for
accessibility purposes.

38
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.540
And there are some really
good tools to do that with.

39
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.340
Colorable is one of my favorite ones.

40
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.580
You enter two colors and
it tells you basically if it AAA,

41
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.970
if it's really great, AAA and then A.

42
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.040
And then sometimes it will just be
like fail, and then you're like, no.

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.630
But it's also really great if you're
working with someone else and

44
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.340
they're like, we can totally use this.

45
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.680
And you can copy the URL,
it has the colors in the URL.

46
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.630
Copy and send it to them and
be like, and it will be like, fail.

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.890
[LAUGH] And it will be like, we can't
use these colors next to each other.

48
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.530
That won't work.

49
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.850
So contrast A, accessible colors.

50
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.578
And then there's text on
the background image AI checks.

51
00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:53.911
So those are all linked up in
the slides that you can check out too.

52
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:57.200
So let's talk about,
we're gonna talk about all of those.

53
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.810
I mentioned some color combinations.

54
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.330
Now, let's kind of dive into
those color combinations.

55
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.520
So monochromatic is what you might think.

56
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.250
Mono meaning one,
chroma meaning color, one color.

57
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.790
So you can actually make really beautiful
color palettes by just sticking to

58
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.600
one color, honestly.

59
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.820
All of these are really nice palettes
that I might work with myself.

60
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.050
Analogous is, remember, we talked
about analogous being a color and

61
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.140
then the colors that
are next to that color.

62
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.570
So not exactly just monochrome, but

63
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.990
colors that are kinda near
it on the color spectrum.

64
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.710
So this one in particular is an analogous
color mixing, where they're all

65
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.710
the same key, key meaning how bright,
how light and bright it is.

66
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.730
And this is that same color
palette adjusted for web design,

67
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.680
where you might change the keys a bunch,
and then you have things that are kinda

68
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.140
complements and
have a little bit more contrast.

69
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.620
So here's an example of an analogous
color mixing in a design.

70
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.300
You can actually look at it and
know, okay, well,

71
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.550
actually the screen makes it look
a little bit more turquoise.

72
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.070
On my computer,
those greens are a lot more blue.

73
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.844
And you can see how it looks really
of the same kind of color scheme,

74
00:04:18.844 --> 00:04:21.410
and holds together really nicely.

75
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.920
There's also split or split complementary,
triad complementary and triadic.

76
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.830
Don't worry, we're gonna go through and

77
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.070
I'll show you a tool where you can
play with all of these things.

78
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.440
So here's an example of
split complementary.

79
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.040
We've got all of these blues, but

80
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.550
also it's not even an accent because we're
really heavily leaning on the orange too.

81
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.250
So you could just use all blues and only
use orange as a tiny little bit of color.

82
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.650
But instead, they've decided to go and
almost split

83
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.900
all the colors up between the blue
spectrums and all these oranges.

84
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.390
So this cooler, well actually,
it's called color CC now, but

85
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.220
it was called cooler for a decade.

86
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.768
So I can never not call it that, even
though they don't call it that anymore.

87
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:14.527
So we can go to color.adobe.com and
check it out.

88
00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:20.480
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: It's pretty nice.

89
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.110
It starts off with all of
these different shade.

90
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.320
It starts off with all these different
shades, so I can go Analogous.

91
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.380
You see how it draws along here,
and I can kinda pull this around.

92
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.100
And I can even make it higher key,
lower, and kinda play around with it.

93
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.684
I can also go monochromatic,
stays within the same color.

94
00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:50.464
You see how they're the same, but
all of these dots are different pieces,

95
00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:57.093
like it's basically changing how high the
key is, triad, so I can move this around.

96
00:05:57.093 --> 00:06:01.370
Triad is when you do it really well,
it's awesome, but

97
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.560
it's easy to mess up and look really bad.

98
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.045
There's something there, right?

99
00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:10.035
I could probably make a decent
composition and color with that, but

100
00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:13.680
there's definitely some fails
in here before that, right?

101
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.570
But there's triad.

102
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.590
We got complementary.

103
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.830
So complementary can be really nice.

104
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.580
And I do suggest that actually when we
start moving towards the exercises,

105
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.100
even if you use a monochrome palette,
I'm gonna make you pick an accent.

106
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.470
So we're kind of always gonna
be working with complementary.

107
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.675
Because it's important to have
accents within your color palette so

108
00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:40.803
you can draw people's attention
to certain things and

109
00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:44.409
just accent tiny little details and
offset it.

110
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.275
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Compound is kind
of whatever you want it to be.

111
00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:55.150
[LAUGH] And even within this,
you can explore.

112
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.760
So they have all of these different

113
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.590
color palettes that other people
have played with and worked with.

114
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.710
And you can fork them.

115
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.940
I'm sure they don't call it forking.

116
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.070
They probably call it something else.

117
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.530
But I don't even know the word for

118
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.000
whatever fork is in real
life [LAUGH] anymore.

119
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.770
So you can fork it and
change all of the colors.

120
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.110
And you can submit your own, and

121
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.160
people can vote on it and
you can see how much it was used.

122
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.840
And you can also download it and
edit it, and all.

123
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.270
All sorts of cool stuff.

124
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.970
You don't have to be a color genius,
you can just steal color palettes.

125
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.710
So even within monochromatic, you can
have a bunch of different color palettes.

126
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.039
And this slide,
I added in because of the link.

127
00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:43.969
There's color theory for designers,

128
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:46.679
creating your own color palettes
is a smashing magazine article.

129
00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:50.443
So if you wanna kind of design some of
these color palettes, that's really great.
