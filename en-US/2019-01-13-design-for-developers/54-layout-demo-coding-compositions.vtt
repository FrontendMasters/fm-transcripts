00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so let's go
back to this CodePen that we were working

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.309
on before during the five minute break.

3
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.532
I added in a cursive font at the bottom
and a little line here [LAUGH].

4
00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:16.316
And I just wanted to add in some of the
accent colors that we talked about before

5
00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:21.025
and change some of the body text from
being dark black to one of the colors that

6
00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:22.230
we found before.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.200
And then also,
let's add in a logo using SVG.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.250
And so I'm gonna show you
how we optimize an SVG and

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.980
actually put it into the design as well.

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.096
So the first kind of like
low hanging fruit we've got,

11
00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:36.000
let's go back to our colors.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.870
I think this was the color
that we had chosen for,

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.720
I'm stuck in black and white right now.

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.562
This is the color that we had chosen for
that accent.

15
00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:46.384
So let's grab this.

16
00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:51.459
I'm gonna go back to the layouts,

17
00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:56.884
and we're gonna add it as brand red,

18
00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:02.135
and, I need to add the hex in there.

19
00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.567
So let's grab brand red.

20
00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:11.021
And in terms of accent, what might
be nice is, maybe if we do it for

21
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:16.500
the sideline here, and we do it for
the bottom, let's try that.

22
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.200
So we've got the sideline.

23
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.176
I think we put it at the bottom here.

24
00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:27.524
Let's go, color, brandRed, and

25
00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:34.330
that turned red, but
also the line did too.

26
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.660
Why did the line turn red?

27
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.690
Because actually if we look at the line
here, what I did was I created an SVG and

28
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.540
I stuck a line in it [LAUGH],
[COUGH] just as simple as that.

29
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.160
What I did was I called the stroke
currentColor camelCase.

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.380
When I say current color on an SVG,
it actually inherits the body color.

31
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.550
So if you need to use an SVG icon system,
and you need the SVG icons to pick up

32
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.750
the color of whatever text is around it,
this is how to do that.

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.700
That's how to make sure that
you're dealing with SVG and

34
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.850
it's not being styled in a different way.

35
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.460
So it gets,
if I stuck it in a different area,

36
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.900
that line would turn black again, right?

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.220
Cool, all right,
let's go back to Photoshop.

38
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.970
I'm gonna grab this darkest
gray that we have here and

39
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.890
I'm gonna use that for
our text instead of just using black.

40
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.202
So in body I'll say color,
and we'll add that in.

41
00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.200
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
it should get a little bit darker.

42
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.390
Maybe it's not dark enough though.

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.200
So we could probably go
a little bit lighter.

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.080
Let's try this one.

45
00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Is that
a little bit lighter?

46
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440
Yeah, that's a little bit lighter.

47
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.010
So it's still high-contrast, but
it's just slightly different tones, so

48
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.370
it looks a little bit more natural or

49
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.230
like something that's a little
bit more intentional.

50
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.440
Cool, I'm also gonna add that
accent color at the bottom.

51
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.720
So we'll use the brandRed.

52
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.560
Since we're reusing it,
we're gonna store it as a variable.

53
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.560
So that was the footer, right?

54
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.600
Cool, and we'll go color,
and we add brandRed.

55
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.450
Save it out and then we see that accent.

56
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.160
So it's not overwhelming, it's just
little spots of color here and there and

57
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.580
it kind of makes it a little bit,
pop a little bit more, right?

58
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.510
It's not crazy or over the top but
there's just like little bits.

59
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.360
So the next thing we want here
is if we look at our original

60
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.910
thing that we were creating,
we had a circle in the corner.

61
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.611
So just for fun,
let's go over to the Noun Project again.

62
00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:58.130
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
I'm gonna actually write in, circle.

63
00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:03.547
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So many to choose from.

64
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:09.816
Actually any one of these would be really
nice as a fake logo, let's keep looking.

65
00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:19.320
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I kinda like that,
that's like kinda a little bit more raw.

66
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.799
That one's also quite nice.

67
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.390
What do you think?

68
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.130
This one or this one?

69
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.320
Okay, we'll do a raise of hands.

70
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.960
For number one, raise your hand.

71
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.310
Okay, for number two, raise your hand.

72
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.770
I think number one wins.

73
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.940
All right, so we're gonna get this SVG and
pull it down.

74
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.182
Then I'm gonna go into SVG OMG.

75
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.533
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And I'm going to say
open SVG, go into my download folder, and

76
00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:51.000
we've got this circle in there.

77
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.230
I'm gonna open that up.

78
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.212
And here is the image but it also gives
me the mark up, that's pretty nice.

79
00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:04.021
Because what we can see is it's changing
the amount of bytes from 876 to 701.

80
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.050
That's not a lot because it's
probably previously optimized.

81
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.817
But sometimes you come in here and
you bring an SVG and then it's like, saved

82
00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:16.035
like two mix, like some people just dumped
all of illustrator in there or something.

83
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:20.200
[LAUGH] So
sometimes the savings are quite big.

84
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.630
So you can actually do a few
different options here.

85
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.540
You can say compare gzips,
you can also prettify the markup.

86
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.070
The difference for prettifying
the markup is just basically minifying,

87
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.540
concatenating kind of thing.

88
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.930
If you have many, many different paths and
you're just delivering that SVG and

89
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.950
that's all you're doing,
then don't petrify the markup.

90
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.170
But if you have many, many paths and
you wanna grab an armada there or

91
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.530
something, then you definitely
want to prettify that markup so

92
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.060
that you're not looking through
something that looks like this.

93
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.710
I mean, for this it's one path so it's not
that big of a deal in order to find it.

94
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.972
Another thing that you
might wanna know is,

95
00:05:58.972 --> 00:06:03.460
these Clean IDs will pull the IDs off if
you're exporting from illustrator and

96
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.270
you've named all of the layers very nicely
so that you can go find them again,

97
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.616
which you should if you're gonna animate,
it will remove them.

98
00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:14.530
So in a situation like this where I'm just
dropping it on the page, no big deal, but

99
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.260
if you remove the, if you clean
the IDs from something like that,

100
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.790
that situation, you're gonna be like,
where did all of my IDs that I spent so

101
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.120
long carefully putting them on for?

102
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.400
We probably don't wanna
remove the viewbox,

103
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.720
because if we ever pull off the width and
the height, we wanna be able to use

104
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.670
the viewbox to kind of constrain and
understand that sense of space.

105
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.380
Things like round rewrite
paths is really awesome for

106
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.740
something like this where we just
want it to be one big glob of thing.

107
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.610
Instead of it being many, many different
paths it's gonna be all one path.

108
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.350
But again, if you're animating, you
probably, and let's say we had these three

109
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.880
circles and we wanted them to all move
away from each other, this would make them

110
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.500
all one big path and you wouldn't
be able to move them independently.

111
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.870
So those are some of, not all of
the things to pay attention to and

112
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.710
some of the choices that you'll
make when you're working with this.

113
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.339
So we'll download this, and

114
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:17.138
then I'm gonna just open it in VS Code.

115
00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:24.454
If I'll open, and downloads, this one.

116
00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:26.824
And then I'll just grab this.

117
00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:31.870
And I think you can drop it directly but
I kinda like to look at it before I do.

118
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.204
So here we go into our header.

119
00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:43.505
And I'm gonna drop in the SVG and
maybe Tidy HTML.

120
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:47.297
And I'm gonna say class logo.

121
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.700
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool,
right now it's huge, right?

122
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.830
It's just like, I am gigantic!

123
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.705
Because it doesn't have a width and
a height on it to constraint it so,

124
00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.950
SVG's are awesome and they will fill
up all the available space, and

125
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.770
all the available space is a lot of space.

126
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.540
So now we wanna constrain it
down to what we want it to be.

127
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.940
And we can do that in the HTML or
in the CSS.

128
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.980
I'm gonna just do it in the CSS.

129
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:20.015
So I'll go into the header and,
actually let's just do logo outside and

130
00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:25.330
say, width is maybe 80 and

131
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.254
height, we'll just start there,
and height is 80.

132
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.780
That's probably about, right?

133
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.450
But it's stacked to the side here.

134
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.090
What we wanna do is we wanna absolutely
position it to the side here.

135
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.550
So one thing that if you don't know,
this is a really important thing to know,

136
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.110
is if I absolutely position
an object on a page,

137
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.860
it will go directly to
that area on the page.

138
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.570
So if I say, top a 100, left a 100,

139
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.150
it will find those coordinates
on a page and go there.

140
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.020
But if I have a containing unit around
that thing, and I give that a position

141
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:05.350
relative, and then make the object in
that position absolute, it will find

142
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.470
that position with, it will absolutely be
positioned within the relative object.

143
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.492
So if I right now said right 0,

144
00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:18.153
top 0,
it would go to the right top of the page.

145
00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:24.581
But if I make this header
position relative.

146
00:09:24.581 --> 00:09:29.827
And that's a really important thing to
know for making these kinds of designs

147
00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:35.411
because if you don't know that, it's
really hard to position things properly.

148
00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:37.606
It goes into all of these weird areas, and

149
00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:41.690
you're like why doesn't it go to
the place that I want it to stick to?

150
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:48.502
So I can say, right 0, top,
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: 0,

151
00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:54.470
and let's check it out on the,
cool, that's looking good.

152
00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.144
Maybe I wanna do top,
like negative something, -20.

153
00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:04.555
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No, that's too much.

154
00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:07.460
[LAUGH] I go back down to 10.

155
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.724
And then I'm also going to make the fill
of that area, that accent color.

156
00:10:13.724 --> 00:10:17.164
So I'll say path cuz that's
what we have inside of there.

157
00:10:17.164 --> 00:10:22.447
And the fill is brandRed, right?

158
00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:23.288
With camelCase.
