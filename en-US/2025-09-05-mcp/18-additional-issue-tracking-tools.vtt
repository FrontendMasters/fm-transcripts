00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we just did all those different tools for

2
00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:08.240
like the list tags as
well as the create issue.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.061
Luckily for you, I did the rest of
them because there's 16 APIs and

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.040
who here wants to write
all of them by hand?

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.480
That is someone that
doesn't value their time.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.145
We are just gonna go in here, in mcp,

7
00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:34.030
I put api-based-tools here and
this has all of them.

8
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.721
You can just copy and you can paste
this into API based tools and

9
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:43.230
this will have everything.

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.670
Tags, delete, users list.

11
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.470
This even has a health check
which I thought was pretty funny.

12
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.060
Health ready, health status.

13
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.220
It just literally took everything
out of my API and put it in here.

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.860
I think I took out a few, but
I don't even remember if I did that.

15
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.040
Let's save this and
then we're gonna come back to Claude,

16
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.540
we're gonna quit and start it again.

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.940
Hopefully it'll just work out of the box.

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.860
Upstream connect error.

19
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.740
That's a new one.

20
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:25.710
Try one more time, see what happens.

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.830
I don't know what that error means.

22
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.030
Did anyone else see that?

23
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.028
It's the ghost of Claude past.

24
00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Was the server restarting
still after you saved the file?

25
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Might be.

26
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190
Well, it starts its own
instance of the server.

27
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.510
It's not running off of your server.

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.130
Right.

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.650
That's why I have to
give it the node binary.

30
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.330
I don't know, but I can only assume that
it was no problem and everything is fine.

31
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.130
Now we have all of our API
tools available to us.

32
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.690
Do I have some long stupid
prompt to put in here?

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.530
I don't, but
let's just make a long stupid prompt.

34
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.660
So, we're gonna get another
api key cuz I lost it and

35
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.100
we're gonna say,
create a new issue for me.

36
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.162
Assign it to the admin user,

37
00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:28.150
mark it as a bug and

38
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.140
a feature request and a auth issue.

39
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300
What other things can I do to it?

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.440
Mark it as urgent.

41
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.502
I want to add GitHub as

42
00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:57.760
an auth provider.

43
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.892
Add step by step instructions to

44
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:09.650
the issue description on how to do it.

45
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.010
Your api key is blocked.

46
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.490
Let's see how it does yolo.

47
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.021
So, it's gonna grab users,
it's gonna grab tags, there's no auth tag,

48
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:37.630
so it's gonna go create one and
it's gonna create an issue.

49
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.830
And it did it.

50
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.950
I was not sweating that at all.

51
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.040
So, let's go take a look in our Auth
provider now, our issue tracker.

52
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.200
This is obviously not reading as markdown,
but that's fine.

53
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.680
It's urgent.

54
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.327
It's assigned to the admin user.

55
00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:18.600
It's not started,
it's created at this time.

56
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.680
Pretty cool, right?

57
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.370
And yeah, it created an auth one down
there as well, which didn't exist before.
