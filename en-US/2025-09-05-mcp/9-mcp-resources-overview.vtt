00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.253
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Resources are a little
bit different paradigm, but

2
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:05.520
I think you'll see some value in this.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.031
So the first thing I want
to throw out there is,

4
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:14.040
as of right now, Tome does not
support resources or prompts.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.320
The next thing that
we'll talk about either.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.640
So if you're using Tome, just sit back,
crack a cold one, chill out.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.560
You can just treat this like Netflix,
basically.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.550
They are supported in
cloud desktop though.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.694
Tools are basically like, hey, LLM,

10
00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:36.510
here's a brand new capability
of a thing you can do.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.774
You have the ability to
go fetch the weather or

12
00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:40.510
the ability to do something else.

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.485
A resource is more like I'm going to
provide you with additional context of

14
00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.430
what I want you to be able to do.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.380
So frankly, so
far these are way less used than tools.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.202
I think this was anthropic, just kind
of guessing in the dark of what do

17
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:02.740
we think that people could
want from an MCP server.

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.100
And so,
they provided these other kind of things.

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.060
But a resource, you can think of an LLM
providing additional context to an LLM.

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.500
So it's you opting to give
the LLM additional context.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.054
Whereas a tool is kind of the inverse
where it's like an LLM going out and

22
00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:22.150
fetching either more context or
more, something like that.

23
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.484
But the volition lies with the user,
with the resource,

24
00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:30.830
whereas the wanting to do so
lies with the LLM with tools.

25
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.990
Does that kind of distinction make sense?

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.470
Resources are not dynamic.

27
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.990
That is one thing to know.

28
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.670
It's basically a static thing.

29
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.081
It's not that you can give it an
additional give me a resource about this

30
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:44.670
thing.

31
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.290
It's just one thing.

32
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.930
Now, that they're changing that.

33
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.430
There's a thing called resource
templates that do make them dynamic,

34
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.050
that are supported in some clients.

35
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.970
We're just going to talk about
resources or static resources.

36
00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.930
Yeah.
You have a question?

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.754
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
I was just curious, how does this,

38
00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:06.367
is this basically a way of
just giving it more context?

39
00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:12.979
And also, how does this differ from doing
a Git interaction information tool?

40
00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:18.179
Like is it essentially the same idea,
just kind of a more formalized approach?

41
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.139
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a good question.

42
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.038
Let me answer the second question first,
which is what's the difference between

43
00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:24.419
like giving it a tool that
can go get the information?

44
00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.579
This is you, the user saying,
I want you LLM to have this.

45
00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.979
So you are deciding to give
the LLM more information.

46
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:31.499
The tool?

47
00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.939
Is the LLM deciding that it wants more
information or wants more capability.

48
00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.940
So it will call the tool it's
who's invoking the tool?

49
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.380
You, the human are invoking the tool and
giving it to the LLM.

50
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.940
The tool is the LLM saying
what I have is insufficient.

51
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.180
I'm gonna go do something about it.

52
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.853
So the example that I'm about to
give you is we have this MCP issue

53
00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:57.380
tracker project that I've shown you.

54
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.026
We're going to go create a resource that
gives it the entire schema of the database

55
00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:06.430
so that you can ask questions
about the schema of the database.

56
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.672
Now you could definitely give
it a tool that says, hey,

57
00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:11.550
here's how you could go get to
the schema for the database.

58
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.448
But in our particular
case we can just say, no,

59
00:03:13.448 --> 00:03:15.310
I definitely wanna ask
questions about this.

60
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.270
Here's the resource.

61
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.750
Now answer questions about this.

62
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.861
If you're asking yourself like this
doesn't really seem that useful,

63
00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:24.564
I'm going to say that I've never
used these too much myself and

64
00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.750
I had to learn a lot about
it to teach this course.

65
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.350
But I wanted to share.

66
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.790
Yeah, go ahead.

67
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.022
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So it sounds like this is
just basically a way to provide additional

68
00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:33.550
context.

69
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.048
Is there any like mechanisms to do
like vectorized, like retrieval,

70
00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:43.580
augmented generation with resources or
is it just kind of eating up tokens?

71
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You could
definitely do RAG for sure.

72
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.700
RAG is resource augmented.

73
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.055
I can't remember what RAG stands for,
but it's essentially like you can search

74
00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:55.500
a vector based database and
get a bunch of context out of it.

75
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.042
So I'm going to show you how to just dump
SQLite schema and provide it to the LLM.

76
00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:02.117
But you could definitely do
a whole vector search, is like,

77
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.652
give me everything that's
related to weather and

78
00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:08.170
then we're gonna feed that into
the weather asking question thing.

79
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.953
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: With something
like the vector database,

80
00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:14.530
that would fit better into
a resource than a tool.

81
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.070
I guess.

82
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.568
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It just
depends on what you're doing.

83
00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:19.810
There are two different things that
are meant to accomplish different things.

84
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.570
RAG would fit well into a tool.

85
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.373
If you're saying, hey, I want to provide
the LLM the capability of being able to go

86
00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:32.410
out and
fetch information about some keyword.

87
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.570
Right, that would be
a great tool use case.

88
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.501
Whereas I would say a resource could
be a good use case for something like

89
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:45.410
here's all of the vector search
databases that I have available to you.

90
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.610
Here they are available to you.

91
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.410
It's kind of like a push
versus pull model.

92
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.010
Right here we're pushing into the LLM.

93
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.130
Here's stuff that I want you to have.

94
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.590
And the tools is like, hey, LLM,
you can go pull this later if you want to.

95
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.611
Again, I have not found much use for

96
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:08.950
resources and
neither has basically anyone else.

97
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.430
They're kind of clunky, and
I think they're going to get better.

98
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.169
I think they're going to figure out,
especially with resource templates,

99
00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.110
the most annoying thing right now
with resources is it's just static.

100
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.870
You can provide one thing and that's it.

101
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.510
That's all you can provide to it.

102
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.210
With resource templates, eventually we're
going to be able to say, here's this.

103
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.284
Like, I want to be able to provide
you all of the databases for

104
00:05:33.284 --> 00:05:36.050
rag that have to do with animals, Right?

105
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.850
Right now you just have to say,
here's all of them.

106
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.890
Because you have no ability
to customize the response.

107
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.330
There's no input parameter.
