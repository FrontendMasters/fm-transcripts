00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I just wanna put some
general thoughts on AI before I know all

2
00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:09.760
of you are gonna have all these
questions about what I think about AI.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.829
So I've been doing development for
professionally but

4
00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.070
I've been paid to be around tech for
about 15 years and then you can say about

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.480
10 years before that I was
thinking about and working on it.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.308
All this to say is I've been
around databases and tech for

7
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:28.630
a very, very long time and
I've seen a lot of fads come and go.

8
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.269
There was the JavaScript framework wars,
and there was blockchain and

9
00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.037
all these other things that some of
them ended up being really important.

10
00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:38.150
React ended up being one of
the things that was really important.

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.786
And then other things like some of the
blockchain stuff became less important and

12
00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.670
less emphasized as time went on, right?

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.750
I don't think AI is a fad.

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.182
I mean, I think if you're here or
listening to this,

15
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.510
you probably somewhat agree with that.

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.248
I think some people are thinking that like
that the trade of software dev is gonna go

17
00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:56.070
away overnight.

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.051
And I don't think that's true.

19
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.234
I do think that people that adopt AI and

20
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.987
AI techniques are going to do
better than people that, perhaps,

21
00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:08.480
have more experience or
would be able to hand code things better.

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.506
I watch some of my engineers
just at databricks and

23
00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:11.720
what they can do with cursor.

24
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.851
We have a site license for Cursor and

25
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.840
they are just churning out good
code at just an unbelievable pace.

26
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.657
Something that I just wouldn't have been
able to match when I was at Netflix or

27
00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:22.480
something like that.

28
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.115
And it's just because they're really good
at finding the balance of writing their

29
00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.535
own code and
writing really good prompts, and

30
00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:34.010
then inspecting what the LLM is
putting out, and then feeding that

31
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.570
code into another LLM for judging it,
and all these kind of things.

32
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.610
They're doing pretty advanced techniques.

33
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.763
It's much more than just like
this broken help fix please,

34
00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:45.930
which is what I do when I head
to my AI coding agents, right?

35
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.050
I do think we're in for a lot of change.

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.768
And I think the people that
embrace the change and

37
00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:54.690
learn how to harness the change
will do really well.

38
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.709
And I think the people that
just fight it tooth and nail,

39
00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.097
they're just not gonna go as fast, right?

40
00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:03.370
It's gonna reflect on their opportunities.

41
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.988
I think we're gonna continue
seeing a Cambrian explosion of

42
00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:07.290
progress in AI tools.

43
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.290
I don't think it's gonna be the same
sort of progress you've already seen.

44
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.349
Cuz basically what they've been doing for

45
00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.238
a while now is throwing more training data
and more compute at all these different

46
00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:20.330
LLMs to train them to do better,
different things.

47
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.570
And we're kind of got to the end
of the Internet [LAUGH].

48
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.651
These LLMs have now just seen the Internet
and we don't get new Internet at a very

49
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:32.387
quick pace, particularly new
Internet that's not generated by AI,

50
00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:35.130
which is just kind of
the LLMs feeding themselves.

51
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.544
So it's all gonna come down to
new techniques that we innovate,

52
00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:40.770
new ways of using LLMs.

53
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.890
Those are kinda gonna be
the ways of progress forward.

54
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.647
So it's gonna be rather than just
LLMs getting smarter and bigger and

55
00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:51.181
faster as we've seen them, we're gonna
see them be using different techniques,

56
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:55.410
using less tokens, being more
efficient here, coming in the future.

57
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.090
This is one thing I did wanna emphasize,
I think I say it twice in here.

58
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.130
I should tell you that I am
somewhat serious about it.

59
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.997
Regardless of if you wrote it or your AI
agent wrote it, you are responsible for

60
00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:08.610
all code that you ship.

61
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.053
And if I ever hear from any of you
that like, my agent wrote that, I'm

62
00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:16.134
not responsible for that, I'm just gonna
throw you out, we're on the 36th floor.

63
00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:19.407
I'm just gonna throw you one of
the windows here, right, absolutely not,

64
00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.300
right, you are responsible for
everything that you ship.

65
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.671
The best coding people or

66
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:27.265
the developers that I work with
take personal responsibility for

67
00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:32.060
everything they ship, regardless of
whether an agent wrote it or not, right?

68
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.314
If it's less important code, it's okay
to have a cursory glance at it, but

69
00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:40.168
if it's important stuff that you're
shipping and while it works and

70
00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:43.350
it compiles,
I'm just gonna open my pull request.

71
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.630
That's the wrong way about going
about using all these tools.

72
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.282
I wanted to just spend
a moment on the word agent and

73
00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:52.070
agentic cuz it's the biggest,
hottest buzzword.

74
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.498
And you'll notice that I'm kind of
interchanging the words LLMs and agents,

75
00:03:56.498 --> 00:04:00.470
which is not totally accurate, but
it's also what people are doing.

76
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.964
So the first thing is that it is
a marketing term that is not well defined,

77
00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:09.875
which means that marketing companies
are just going hog wild with it and

78
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:14.372
applying it to everything, which is why
I'm just using the word agent everywhere

79
00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:16.560
when I really actually just mean LLM.

80
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.080
It's because that's what
everyone's marketing is doing.

81
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.600
And so it's kinda just burned
into my brain that way.

82
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.336
The idea with an agent is it's some
autonomous framework of a network of LLMs

83
00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:30.924
that just you give it a task and then
it'll apply one LLM to do something and

84
00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:35.068
then it'll pass that to another LLM and
then you'll have all these

85
00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:39.670
various different, basically many
brains working on the same problem.

86
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.350
That's the intention of the word agent,
right?

87
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.150
Just to take for example replit,
which is a coding agent.

88
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.567
It's a very cool product,
if you have not played with it,

89
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.830
definitely go give it a shot.

90
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.550
Powered by neon and databricks,
that's why I'm a big fan.

91
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.350
If you give them like, hey, generate
me a to do app that has multiple users.

92
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.096
It'll give it to a engineer LLM that
will then pass it off to a product

93
00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:14.030
manager LLM that they'll pass
it off to a designer LLM.

94
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.122
And it has actually many Personas in
every part of its little agent framework,

95
00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:21.780
that then it gets planned out by
the product manager, it gets passed to

96
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.470
the designer which makes a mock up for it,
which then gets passed to the engineer.

97
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.378
And then there's a judge
LLM at the end that says,

98
00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:32.280
does this fulfill what the user asked?

99
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.318
And then there's a DevOps,
one that'll help you deploy it and

100
00:05:34.318 --> 00:05:37.160
manage your database and
all these kind of different things, right?

101
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.920
That is really the core of what
an agent is intended to be.

102
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.840
But then marketing got a hold of it.

103
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.091
It's like anything that has AI
applied to it is now agentic, right,

104
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.120
because that's such a hot word right now.

105
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.640
So, I just put this in here
because I was confusing myself.

106
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.920
I was like, how am I defining
agent throughout this course?

107
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.196
And so, I kinda wanted to just write
it down to make sure that we're all on

108
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:04.570
the same page of what an agent is.

109
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.210
This is the intent of what the word is.

110
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.247
But I probably will somewhat use it
interchangeably with the word LLM, for

111
00:06:10.247 --> 00:06:13.690
which I future apologize and
also cannot stop myself.

112
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.010
I left several of these here.

113
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.770
I actually got to work on app build.

114
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.330
This one's free and open source.

115
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.970
It's actually meant to be a reference
architecture for one of these agents.

116
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.690
So if you're curious about this,
just pop on over to GitHub.

117
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.730
You can see, look, there's my little face.

118
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.910
I did some docs,
don't be too impressed [LAUGH].

119
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.063
But you can actually see here, we
actually outline here of how we built it,

120
00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:39.790
how you do it.

121
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.430
It's meant to be a reference
architecture for one of these.

122
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.266
Yeah, maybe I'll come back
one of these days and

123
00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:48.990
do a complete intro to making agents.

124
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.710
That would be fun.

125
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.030
But here's a bunch, I left them here.

126
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.276
Replit, v0, Create, which is now
create anything they rebranded,

127
00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:00.058
Same.new Databutton, all very cool stuff.

128
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.956
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll be using
some coding IDE agents, so

129
00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.640
you would call cursor an agent.

130
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.581
Probably you would call the agent mode
of VS code an agent as well, right,

131
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:17.651
because they're essentially LLMs that
have this iteration loop, right,

132
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.600
that's really the crux of
what an agent is meant to be.
