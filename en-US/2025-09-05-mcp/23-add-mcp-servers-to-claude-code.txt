[00:00:00]
>> Brian Holt: We are going to hop into Claude code now. So if you haven't already, just Google install Claude code. It's an NPM call. It's this NPM install G anthropic AI Claude code and that should leave you with the Claude command, which is all of this. We are gonna do Claude MCP and there's a bunch of stuff on here for adding removing all those kinda things from an individual project because this all involves a bunch of API keys.

[00:00:40]
I've done this because I don't want anyone to steal all of my stuff, which has definitely happened to me before, and I'm not, fool me four times, shame on you. Fool me five times. Still shame on you. Why are you doing that? MCP list so you can see here I have installed already Neon, Playwright, Context7, and GitHub.

[00:01:06]
So if you pop over to our docs here, I left you links to all of these. So if you go to the GitHub one you're going to go and Claude applications, you're gonna run something that looks like this claude mcp--- transport http, which is the streamable one. GitHub.

[00:01:33]
GitHub is just whatever you're going to call it. This is the MCP server link. And then you're gonna have to get a GitHub PAT personal access token GitHub.com, that's gonna be under settings. Developer settings I think personal access tokens. I am trying to remember exactly which one it is.

[00:02:01]

>> Speaker 2: I think the regular tokens are being deprecated so it's all moving towards fine grained tokens.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, I remember I spent some time on it. So generate new token and you need all repositories. This is where I got tripped up. You need all repositories and then you need to add permissions for content.

[00:02:24]
You might need more. But I remember this one is essential because I spent like an hour trying to find this out and hopefully I save you. But all repositories essential and then contents essential. And if you don't trust me, I don't blame you [LAUGH] but you might need more than that.

[00:02:44]
But I'm trying to get it so that I can do issues pull requests. Was that on here as well? You need content if you can do actions and stuff like that. Code spaces, those are all available secrets. Maybe web hooks, I don't know. But certainly issues pull requests and contents.

[00:03:13]
Make sure those ones are all on there. I already have one and it all works. So I'm not going to question Anything. Can I see what I've actually put on that? Cuz that actually might be helpful. I might have just done everything because I was panicking and wanted to finish my course.

[00:03:27]

>> Speaker 2: Yeah, it's down there .dependabot alerts actions, yeah.
>> Brian Holt: There you go, so I did. I just did everything because that is wise when it comes to security. Okay, but I did do a fine grain tokens and the classic one is going away. Okay, so that's number one.

[00:03:54]
Yeah, so sorry, it's gonna give you some token and you're gonna run this command here, authorization bearer with your GitHub PAT right there. That's how you add the GitHub one linear. I asked about the docs there, link to the linear or the NEON ones. This one's not terribly hard.

[00:04:20]
You do have to get a API token as well. I think it's relatively similar where it's Claude MCP add and then it's like MCP.neon.tex MCP is the actual endpoint. I remember. Yeah. It's going to say unauthorized and then you just do the same thing here where it's just like Claude MCP add.

[00:04:48]
Let's just see what it actually says there. Option, yeah, they say the name and then you have to add the header for authorization bearer and then your NEON API token, which you can just get out of your neon.Tech.login GitHub. That's fine. So you can see when I have here from a previous iteration, but there should be a account settings and you should be able to grab a personal API token here, which you can see I have as well.

[00:05:33]
Create new API token. Grab that. That should be good enough for the NEON one. Okay, then playwright, this one's extremely easy. It's just like Claude Mcp cuz this has no authentication to it, so it's literally just this. That one's going to run locally. It wouldn't make sense to run that as a HTTP cuz it's actually gonna spin up your browser to do things.

[00:06:11]
Easy peasy, and then context seven. We were just discussing this one install in Claude code and it's this one right there. Okay, that'll install context seven for you, Figma and Vercel. Those ones Venture Drone. Vercel one doesn't work for cloud code and Figma, you have to pay for it.

[00:06:39]
So we're not going to use it today. All right, so that is the ones I have open here. So if I say MCP or Claude McPlist, it's going to go out and make sure everything works. Everything works.
