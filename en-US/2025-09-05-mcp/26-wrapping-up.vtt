00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congrats.

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.320
That is the intro to mcp.

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.520
Hopefully this was helpful for you.

4
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.240
Hopefully you learned a little
bit about Vibe coding.

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.496
You learned a little bit about just
AI in general, how to use LLMs,

6
00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.640
how to use MCPs,
how to write tools for their usage.

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.774
At the end of my courses,

8
00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:19.122
I always like to give people kind of
some directions of like, here's some

9
00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:22.480
stuff you could go do afterwards to
kind of like solidify your learnings.

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.814
So a really good thing is like if you
built something with me in the previous

11
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.640
section in the Vibe coding one, like the.

12
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.070
The Todoist clone, or maybe you had
some other deal like a recipe app or

13
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.400
something like that, go make your
own MCP server for that, right?

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.680
You can either Vibe code that yourself or
write it yourself.

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.896
If you're keen on learning more MCP
servers, the best thing you can do is go

16
00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.840
find something like Vercel,
where it doesn't exist yet.

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.826
Well, actually Vercel is probably a bad
example because they do have a standard

18
00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:51.120
I O1, but they don't have a hosted one.

19
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.749
But go find a service that you
do like that has an API and

20
00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.040
make your own MCP server.

21
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.910
A lot of them are just
community maintained ones.

22
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.623
I suggested this before, but I had a fun
time making a personal MCP server that can

23
00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:07.430
read my email calendar, local file system,
discord, all those kind of things.

24
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.430
I use that from time to time.

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.070
Pretty cool.

26
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.886
If you're more interested in
learning about the client side,

27
00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:21.270
which I already have given you,
this homework is like,

28
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.020
go try Cursor Windsurf,
the one that I just showed you crush.

29
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.700
Go try all those and
see which one you like.

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.380
They all are slightly different.

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.704
Yeah, just go check out some of
these more awesome MCP servers and

32
00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:32.860
try installing them.

33
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.940
I went through this,
they were kind of fun to look at.

34
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.540
Data platforms, gaming,
all this kind of stuff.

35
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.820
There's a ton of them out there already.

36
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.260
Go look at them.

37
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.660
Go scrutinize what they did well,
what they didn't do well.

38
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.870
Have some fun with that.

39
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.910
Go try one of the other clients.

40
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.590
Yeah, we talked about that already.

41
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.030
There's a bunch of them here as well.

42
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.590
And specifically the Gemini CLI
is also very cool.

43
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.230
It's like the Claude one.

44
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.910
It's just with Gemini instead of Claude.

45
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.870
And just go Vibe, code some more stuff and
see what your results are.

46
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.310
You'll definitely learn
a lot of how to plan.

47
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.470
That's the thing that I find that
I keep refining the most of,

48
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.470
like how do I preempt the LLM
from making bad choices up front

49
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.400
because one line in an LLM
prompt can save an entire app.

50
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.520
It is wild.

51
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.896
So you'll find a bunch of stuff that
you like that do not drop database and

52
00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:32.880
the one the please use
Drizzle where you can.

53
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.200
That line is the most important
line in my web app prompts.

54
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.920
In any case, please share with me
what you do on LinkedIn, on Twitter.

55
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960
And yeah,
I'm excited to see what you build.

56
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.320
The one thing I just want to put out
there is like, this isn't cheating.

57
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.640
And I feel like a lot of engineers
feel like this is cheating.

58
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.665
I'm gonna go as far to say it's becoming
necessary for us to kind of stay up and

59
00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:59.440
stay as productive as
we're expected to be.

60
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.080
So the more you invest in this,
I think the better off you're going to be.

61
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.480
So yeah, don't feel like it's
cheating because it isn't.

62
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.200
Please read it though.

63
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.520
Please read the code that it generates.

64
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.440
Obviously I was just full on straight
up ignoring that pull request.

65
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.924
I would definitely, if someone opened that
on my team, I would have an LLM read it

66
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:24.480
as well and say scrutinize this and
please find problem areas for me.

67
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.166
But I would also read it like every
pull request that goes into your

68
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.000
code base should be human reviewed
by probably at least two people.

69
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.530
And the more important it is,
the more you should like scrutinize it.

70
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.841
Like, the LLM tools are great, but
they still are not at human level because

71
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.534
remember that it's being trained
on everything on GitHub and

72
00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:45.210
most of the stuff on GitHub not great.

73
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.210
Thanks for coming everybody and
hope you enjoyed the course.
