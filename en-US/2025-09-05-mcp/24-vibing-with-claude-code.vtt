00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.764
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now in my directory
I have this big old prompt and

2
00:00:05.764 --> 00:00:10.874
I'm going to say Claude here and
I'm just going

3
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:16.399
to post that business in there and
say, yo, Logo.

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.920
Now this might take a while because
it's got a lot of stuff to do.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.320
Also, be mindful that Claude
code uses a lot of tokens.

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.157
So if you are on, if you're paying for
this right now or you're on a PRO account

7
00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:38.140
and you don't want to burn all of your
tokens, don't follow along with this part

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.317
because this cloud code uses a ton
of tokens by default it uses Opus,

9
00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:46.780
which is a much bigger and
much more expensive model for you to use.

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.540
But it does make cool stuff.

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.500
So you can see here,
I'm just fascinated by this tool.

12
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a heads up, Brian.

13
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.644
It defaults to Sonnet if you're on
the plus plan and Opus if it's Max.

14
00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:02.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's good to know.

15
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.130
So, yeah,
it's gonna start asking you questions.

16
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.293
I mean, I don't know if we're
going to sit here and wait for

17
00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:13.130
this to happen because this
does take a long time.

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.410
But yeah, you can say yes.

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.130
You can say yes and don't ask again
because that's probably not a bad idea.

20
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.170
Actually, it's a terrible idea.

21
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.076
But I just always say yes because I mean,
if we're being super honest, I'll just say

22
00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:28.730
go and then I'll start doing something
else on my computer and I'll come back.

23
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.890
Yeah, sure, whatever.

24
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.738
Cool.

25
00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:37.210
So let's go ahead and open this.

26
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.847
We let this run for a little while and
I answered yes to a lot of questions and

27
00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:42.210
didn't really read them.

28
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.305
I was vibing, as we say, and

29
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:51.779
we ended up with something like this.

30
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.490
So it came up with its own instructions.

31
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.290
Let's close this of how do you run it?

32
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.450
What other things do we need?

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450
It used Neon.

34
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.718
It used Neon Auth, which is Stack Auth,

35
00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:08.075
which is a different company
that Neon contracts out with.

36
00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:10.570
It came up with its own TS config.

37
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.381
You can see here's some
of the packages that

38
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:20.330
used React, Tailwind, Zod, next Eslint.

39
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.350
It's all TypeScript based.

40
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.050
It's fairly well laid out,
the code makes sense.

41
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.770
It's all really cool that it's
able to use like Stack Auth.

42
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.690
Okay, cuz it's a fairly
new piece of technology.

43
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.770
Again, I'm pretty impressed with
the stuff that it puts out.

44
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.170
It's all usually pretty readable,
but now we have all this done.

45
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.670
Let me remove, because this is
all tied to a GitHub already.

46
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.350
Or I can just have it do that.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.710
So let's open our Ghosty.

48
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.670
Where am I?

49
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.830
Make sure I'm in the right one.

50
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.950
Okay, I am.

51
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.110
So I'm gonna open Claude again.

52
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.745
Let's say Claude MCP list,

53
00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:15.902
make sure all my stuff is still working.

54
00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:21.502
So Claude, and then I'm going to say use

55
00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:27.280
Playwright to make sure the login works.

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.780
Okay.

57
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.040
So it's going to make a plan for it.

58
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.940
It should eventually spin up Playwright,
which should open Chrome.

59
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.180
It should get back some
screenshots from it.

60
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.740
Yeah, sure, I don't care, whatever.

61
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.860
So it sees that the server is running,
it's going to spin that up.

62
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.090
So that is our app that it generated.

63
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.050
So you can see here, it's actually
running stuff behind the scenes here.

64
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.300
Test user.

65
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.540
It's putting in a password.

66
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.500
This is the power of mcp, right?

67
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.700
There's a Playwright MCP server that
it's interacting with to actually be

68
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.500
able to test this.

69
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.340
Then it's getting screenshots back and
evaluating.

70
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.260
Did it do what I thought
it was supposed to do?

71
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.100
No, it's Chrome.

72
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.380
Why would I want to save that?

73
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.670
Pretty cool, right?

74
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.790
It's cool that my agent is testing itself.

75
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.526
So it's signed up, it's gonna test,

76
00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:25.720
log out, all that kind of stuff.

77
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.800
I'm going to stop it now
because I don't really care.

78
00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.452
But we'll get back into this and

79
00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:48.659
say, file a GitHub issue for

80
00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.742
dark mode, wax poetic about it and

81
00:05:53.742 --> 00:05:58.826
make sure that everyone knows that

82
00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:05.340
dark mode is critical to business success.

83
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.700
I think I've already connected
this to a GitHub repository.

84
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.980
We'll see.

85
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.500
I think I did.

86
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.180
So it should be able to
come to Bthold/Todoer.

87
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.010
We should see one in here.

88
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.690
You can see it's able to commit for you.

89
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.610
It's able to push,
it's able to open pull requests.

90
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.668
We're doing one thing,
which is filing an issue, but

91
00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:31.490
it can really manage your
entire GitHub experience.

92
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.970
Then again, I love the fact that
I can say, go create this issue.

93
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.050
Go create a plan of how to solve it,
then open that issue.

94
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.738
And then later I can come back and
say, okay,

95
00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:41.610
now open a pull request
that fulfills this issue.

96
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.370
And it just goes back and forth.

97
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.970
And so you don't end up, like,
not really interacting with Claude a lot.

98
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.829
You end up, like,
leaving comments on issues and

99
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.290
then telling Claude to go do that.

100
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.390
It becomes a much more human way of
Interacting like a way that we've already

101
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.130
been interacting with Claude.

102
00:06:59.925 --> 00:07:01.810
Yeah, here we go.

103
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.792
It wrote a manifesto according to it.

104
00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:05.650
My God, the Dawn of Darkness.

105
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.970
I'm thoroughly enjoying this.

106
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.650
As you can see.

107
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.070
It's just straight up made up statistics.

108
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.288
I just love that you
could really just say,

109
00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:27.816
okay, now go fulfill issue number two

110
00:07:27.816 --> 00:07:33.190
from GitHub and open a pull request.

111
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.600
It's gonna go do that.

112
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.120
It's going to go pull that issue.

113
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.440
I'm going to implement dark mode for
it and it's just going to go do it.

114
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.720
Gives you the plan goes through and
does it?

115
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.400
Yeah.

116
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.984
So with Neon, I would just say like, hey,
I need to add this to my database or

117
00:07:55.984 --> 00:07:58.480
I need to add 10 more test users to this.

118
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.840
It's all stuff that the Neon MCP
server can handle for.

119
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.800
Yeah, sure, whatever.

120
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.340
I don't care for the context 7 1.

121
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.120
It's just useful for, I'm working
with this bleeding in feature or

122
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.800
something that's like
very prone to get wrong.

123
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.603
Like MCP is actually a great example of
something that Claude code is actually

124
00:08:20.603 --> 00:08:21.840
very prone to get wrong.

125
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.666
It's like, hey, make sure you're using
context 7 when you're coding this MCP

126
00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:29.000
server to make sure that you're using
the most up to date information.

127
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:33.463
Yeah, look, it figures out that if
there's already dark mode CSS variables,

128
00:08:33.463 --> 00:08:34.410
it goes and does that.

129
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.410
It's going to go and
end up opening a pull request.

130
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:39.750
Sure.

131
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.571
I'm, like I said,
thoroughly impressed, particularly for

132
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:46.610
something I just need to get done and
get done quickly.

133
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.375
I was writing a campaign website for
one of my friends that decided to run for

134
00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:52.290
city office.

135
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.050
What's hilarious is I was on the call
with him for like 30 minutes.

136
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.110
Let's just talk about what he wanted
to do, what he'd put on his website,

137
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.630
me a big doc of everything
that he was thinking about.

138
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.534
And I just like threw that at Claude
code with all these MCP servers and

139
00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:08.750
just said go.

140
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.998
And by the end of our conversation,
I sent him the website for

141
00:09:11.998 --> 00:09:16.030
what he was thinking about and
he's like, what is this black magic?

142
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.604
I was like,
this is me being profoundly lazy,

143
00:09:18.604 --> 00:09:21.470
that I don't actually want
to go do this myself.

144
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.590
I just let AI write all of this and
it turned out really well.

145
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.910
Jury's out, he's still running.

146
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.042
So I don't know if he's going to win yet,
but

147
00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:33.610
I at least fulfilled everything
that he wanted out of it.

148
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.170
There you go.

149
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.370
Addressing the Critical
business need Retina friendly.

150
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.902
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is more of a general
question, but there's versioning for

151
00:09:48.902 --> 00:09:49.890
MCP servers.

152
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.679
It looks like it's semantic versioning was
that anytime there's a new tool you would

153
00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.218
bump up.

154
00:09:55.218 --> 00:09:58.759
How does versioning work for
an MCP server?

155
00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:02.791
It's considered a breaking change
since an LLM is gonna prompt you for

156
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:04.440
the input it needs anyways.

157
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.028
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I would just treat
it like you treat APIs right?

158
00:10:08.028 --> 00:10:12.598
Just judging on,
if you had an agent relying on this

159
00:10:12.598 --> 00:10:16.957
shape to exist previously
then I would do that and

160
00:10:16.957 --> 00:10:20.696
just kind of rely on patch minor/major.

161
00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:24.200
So if you're just adding something or
fixing something then patch it.

162
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.200
If you are just adding something but
not breaking anything then it's minor.

163
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.692
And if you're removing or
deprecating or something like that,

164
00:10:32.692 --> 00:10:37.598
I don't know if any of them are actually
going to observe the semantics

165
00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:42.190
of it because people are so
unreliable about versioning anyway.

166
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.186
I guess really the answer to your question
is this is no different than normal API

167
00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:52.030
versioning or SDK versioning.

168
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.270
I don't think that the LLMs have any
particular logic around how that works.

169
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.110
I think it's actually more for humans.

170
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.630
But the more important thing is that it
changes so that the LLM knows to not use

171
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.410
the version that it has that
it needs to go get it again.

172
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.490
This is pretty cool though,
look, put screenshots on this.

173
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.370
That's something I wouldn't do.

174
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.850
I'm way too lazy for that.

175
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.560
It added a drop down menus, theme toggles.

176
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.506
Looks very reasonable, right?

177
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.050
All right, very cool.
