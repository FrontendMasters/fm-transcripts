00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk
about future features of mcp,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.920
at least ones that they're planning so
far.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.680
So, first of all,
here's a list of all these clients.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.400
So we've been using Claude Desktop,
this one here.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.007
And you can see it supports the first
three resources, prompts and tools,

6
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:25.950
but it does not support discovery,
sampling, roots or elicitation.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.635
So Roots, what I'm gonna say about the way
that they've been developing MCP cuz it's

8
00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:32.670
developed by Anthropic, right?

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.510
There's a product manager at Anthropic
that's thinking about MCP Server.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.150
They're generally saying, like,
what do we do in Cloud Desktop?

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.430
What do we do in Cloud code?

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.910
What are they doing in Cursor?

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.127
And then whatever the toolmaker
themselves is developing,

14
00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:50.670
let's just expose it as a generic
primitive that anybody can use, right?

15
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.070
So Roots is basically saying,
like, here is a directory.

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.870
Anything inside of this directory,
go ahead and you can modify.

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.510
You can see,
you can do all that kind of stuff, right?

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.870
So imagine it's like opening
VS code in a directory.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.861
You can use VS code to modify
any file in that directory, or

20
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:09.989
the agent mode of VS code can
modify any file in that directory.

21
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.230
That's just a root, right?

22
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.830
It's a root of a directory
of folders that you can use.

23
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.615
So they're going to expose that as
a primitive that now Cloud Desktop can

24
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:21.718
use or anybody.

25
00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:26.534
Here's some subset of the file system
that you're allowed to see, modify,

26
00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:29.810
update, read, delete,
all those kind of things.

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.099
And I left some notes here if you
wanna learn more about roots,

28
00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.690
that's all available here for
you to check out.

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.850
It makes more sense in the context
of something like Cursor, right?

30
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.770
It makes less sense.

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.890
Like you're not gonna tell Claude Desktop.

32
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.410
I mean, I guess you could, he's like,
here's all of my Excel documents.

33
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.610
You can see anything in here.

34
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.061
Now let's answer some questions
about that, right, but as of yet,

35
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:56.150
Cloud Desktop does not
support that sampling.

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.550
When you see the word sampling,
what do you think it means?

37
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.383
It's a trick question, because whatever
you thought of is probably wrong,

38
00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:07.941
because at least I don't like
the name sampling because it

39
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.150
doesn't really inspire
what it actually means.

40
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.290
It's the ability for your MCP server
to prompt the LLM directly, right?

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.413
So let's say you have an MCP
server that looks at code and

42
00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:27.447
then decides things
that are wrong with it.

43
00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:28.610
That's all it does.

44
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.970
You can make a sampling call to the LLM
directly, here's this piece of code.

45
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.770
Here's what's wrong with it,
please fix it.

46
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.370
Now, you, the human, it could just
pass it back to you, the human.

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.011
You, the human could then prompt
the LLM again to go fix it, right?

48
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.250
That would all work.

49
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.604
Sampling allows you to cut the human
out there and just say MCP server,

50
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:57.530
call the LLM to do a thing, right, or
it can say, I mean, whatever you want.

51
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.083
But that's the idea is it just allows
your MCP servers to directly ask the LLM

52
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:03.850
questions.

53
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.434
Now, what's cool about this is you
can see about the MTP server is

54
00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:14.220
about to call the LLM with this prompt.

55
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.703
It'll show that to you, and you,
the human can go in and modify it and

56
00:03:17.703 --> 00:03:20.100
then it'll do it and then it'll come back.

57
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.500
The LLM has responded this.

58
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.940
You can also modify the output before
it goes back to the MCP server.

59
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.180
So you, the human, are in control of
every step there, which is pretty cool.

60
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.258
So, yeah, initiate sampling,

61
00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:40.282
Human Laroop Review Model interaction
response review complete request.

62
00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:42.560
So that's kind of the whole thing there.

63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.187
And at every point you can stop it,
you can edit it,

64
00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:49.200
you can do anything you want there.

65
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.320
So sampling is the name of that workflow.

66
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.747
Again, this word sampling has come up
multiple different ways with AI and

67
00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:04.560
they all mean very different things.

68
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.315
So be very cautious of this word sampling,

69
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.620
it means very different
things in different contexts.

70
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.770
I'm very excited.

71
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.109
This one actually will be very useful
whenever it lands cuz it makes your MCP

72
00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.828
server a lot more powerful that it can
start doing AI interactions itself, right?

73
00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:18.450
Which is cool.

74
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.564
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student: Does it still require human

75
00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:23.690
in the loop for every interaction then?

76
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.557
So every time it's going to prompt you,
you'll say, okay, and

77
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.930
then it'll send that along to the LLM.

78
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's part of the protocol
that the human should always

79
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:31.810
be in the loop.

80
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.770
However the client chooses to implement
it is totally up to the client.

81
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.412
So, for example, CLAUDE code
should ask you every single time,

82
00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.080
like when it's using tools and
all that kind of stuff.

83
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.480
But you can say, yolo, just do it.

84
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.720
I don't care.

85
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.350
Yeah, right.

86
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.360
But it is part of the protocol that there
should be human in the loop review.

87
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.760
Let's talk about elicitation.

88
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.920
I don't know why they chose
such silly words for these.

89
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.680
I feel like there's better words.

90
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.560
They should just ask an LLM,
what's a better word for elicitation?

91
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.125
But they didn't elicitation mean it's just
a fancy word of your MCP server can ask

92
00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:04.390
follow up questions.

93
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.230
Let's say you're like, hey,
please fill out this form for me.

94
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.529
Right now, if I gave it a webpage with
comment, some sort of autonomous browser,

95
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.565
it's like, fill out this form for me,

96
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:19.350
it would have to come back and say,
what do you wanna put in the form?

97
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.150
Right?

98
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.710
That would be an elicitation, right?

99
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.390
It's the LLM or
the MCP server coming back to you.

100
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.820
Say like, I need more information from the
end user for me to complete this request.

101
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.465
So it allows you to pause your
tool call essentially and say,

102
00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:37.500
get more information from
user continue tool call.

103
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.780
That is an elicitation.
