00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
we do have to go import this and use it.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.286
So we're going to say
title came from import

3
00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:11.840
API based tools from API based tools.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.008
And then once we have the server here,

5
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:20.160
we're just going to say API
based tools with server, right?

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.580
So this is going to pass that into
that other function we just wrote and

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.720
it's going to register all
the tools that we write in there.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.130
All right, I think we should be
able to give this a shot now.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.130
Okay, so let's go to Cloud Desktop.

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.450
We have to go.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.610
No, it's already registered.

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.890
Right, cuz we did it before
with the resource, right?

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.370
We already registered this MCP server,
so it should.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.070
We don't have to do any modification and
fix.

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.180
Probably to be expected
that something is wrong.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.220
Open logs for Issues Server.

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.425
By the way, if these logs get too long,

18
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:06.100
you can just delete them and
it will recreate them for you.

19
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.299
Issues Server.

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.940
Let's look down here at the bottom.

21
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.780
Cannot find module API based tools.

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.090
Okay, well, let's figure out why that is.

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730
What did I call this?

24
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think
it just needs the .js.

25
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It doesn't.

26
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.210
Yeah, I always forget that, .js.

27
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.051
Once you start getting into this
world of modules and common js,

28
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.330
it just starts getting
real picky about it.

29
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.130
Not a fan.

30
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.930
Take me back to the simple days.

31
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.680
All right, process is not defined.

32
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.920
No, nothing there.

33
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Only one C in process.

34
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can spell,
[LAUGH] it's Proccus, thank you.

35
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.210
All right, so process has one.

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.810
Yeah, that was here.

37
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.106
If you're following along
with my insane spellings,

38
00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:38.622
make sure you only have one C.

39
00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:42.780
Okay, we're just gonna.

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.500
We're gonna delete all of these.

41
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.340
Move to.

42
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.790
Man, I had quite a few in here, didn't I?

43
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.230
Z.string, I didn't call it as a function.

44
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.270
Where is my.

45
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.470
Where did I put.

46
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.670
String is not a function.

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.590
Right there.

48
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.710
Line 52 here.

49
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.870
This is a function invocation.

50
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.710
I do that all the time with sod.

51
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think tag IDs
too has that on optional.

52
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep,
you are very correct right there.

53
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that nested?

54
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

55
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.363
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you want the number
to be optional or the array?

56
00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:43.091
You might need a parenthesis moved.

57
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.656
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, no,
I think you're right too.

58
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so
the tags array here,

59
00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.740
that actually would be a bit of a problem.

60
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.060
The array is optional.

61
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.060
This is optional, which I had.

62
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.980
The entire thing being optional,
which is not actually what you want.

63
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.100
Now we should be able to see that we have
Issue Server and it does have an issue.

64
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.600
Create.

65
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.627
I'm going to say create a new

66
00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:25.260
issue in my Issue tracker that

67
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.632
says to add Google Login to my app,

68
00:04:30.632 --> 00:04:34.522
mark it as in progress and

69
00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:38.990
market as medium priority.

70
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.430
Here is my API key.

71
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.875
Okay, and
then I'm going to go back over here and

72
00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:57.550
I'm going to go grab an API key
right there and let's see how we do.

73
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.110
All right, let's see.

74
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.680
See if it's reflected now
in our issue tracker.

75
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.600
Add Google Login to app
implement Google OAuth.

76
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.840
I mean,
it's cool that it adds these things.

77
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.077
Like, I didn't say OAuth
anywhere in there, right,

78
00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:28.920
to allow users to sign in
using their Google account.

79
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.040
It's in progress.

80
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.320
It's medium priority.

81
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.640
Pretty cool stuff, right?
