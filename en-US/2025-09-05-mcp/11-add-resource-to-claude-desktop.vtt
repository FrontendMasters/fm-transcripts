00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.995
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go add this to CLAUDE
now, which I still have up over here,

2
00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.240
I think.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.200
Nope, I don't.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.680
So we're just going to do this again.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.760
Claude Settings, Developer Edit, config.

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.960
And then I'm going to drag that to VS
code and then we're going to edit that.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.490
We're just going to do
basically the same thing again.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.530
I put mine in a different place this time,
I think, didn't I?

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.090
This is going to be.

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.570
What do I call this?

11
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.810
Schema Server or
we'll call it Issues Server.

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.010
Because we'll end up reusing
this one later as well.

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.310
And I put this one in,

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.330
it's like MCP Issues Server.

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.170
What did I call it?

16
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.850
MCP Issue Tracker.

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.050
And this was called main, I think.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.220
So an easy way to test that, I guess I
could just say cat, blah and there you go.

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.020
So that is correct cuz that's
the content of the file, right?

20
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.299
So now I should have an Issue
server available in my MCP servers.

21
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.467
So let's reopen Claude Desktop,
just a reminder,

22
00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:41.940
Tome will not work with resources,
so don't bother trying it with Tome.

23
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.546
And I have Developer issues, so
now I can look at my Issue Server,

24
00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.910
Open Logs folder and Issues Tracker.

25
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.150
What did I call it Issues Server.

26
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.110
And we can see what's wrong here.

27
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.920
Cannot find Module Desktop Weather js.

28
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.640
Did I not change the name of that?

29
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.040
Because that would be very embarrassing.

30
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.160
I just didn't save it.

31
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.279
I had changed it.

32
00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.640
I just had not saved it.

33
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.800
Right there.

34
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.918
The dangers of copy and pasting,
which I'll never admit to,

35
00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:36.264
but I guess that's probably helpful for

36
00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:42.850
you to see how you actually debug
a real issue with your MCP servers.

37
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.729
Okay, now, if you were going to
guess how to use a resource,

38
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.610
how would you guess if you guessed?

39
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.170
Plus sign?

40
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.490
I'm impressed because that's
not what I would have guessed.

41
00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.900
Add from Issue Server Database Schema,
another issue.

42
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.700
Let's take a look.

43
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.780
Rows Map is not a function.

44
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.378
So I hit this issue right here,

45
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:24.860
I probably called it the wrong thing.

46
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.595
All right, so it's saying Rows
map is not the right thing.

47
00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:30.898
&gt;&gt; Student: Should just be map,
instead of maps.

48
00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maps, thank you.

49
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.930
Too many S's.

50
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.839
So if you were following along with me and
you put maps one,

51
00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:47.010
shame on you [LAUGH], two,
you were also mutually incorrect as me.

52
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.610
Okay, let's try again.

53
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.405
If you're saying, Brian,
this is a very weird debugging loop,

54
00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.790
I would agree with you.

55
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.910
Okay, put on here, add from Issues
Server Database schema and there we go.

56
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.830
We got 54 lines and you can actually click
on and see what it's going to be provided.

57
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.590
This is what's useful about resources.

58
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.970
So database schema, probably not the most
interesting thing that we could have done,

59
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.870
but what you can see here is like adding
a Google Doc as a resource probably does

60
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.950
make sense, right?

61
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.965
Like you're doing like, hey,
I wanna interrogate this PDF,

62
00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.722
add this PDF as a resource.

63
00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:31.937
Every time that you're attaching
an image or attaching a big old file,

64
00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.480
it's attaching it as a resource, right?

65
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.280
I'm showing you how to do that with just
like database schemas and stuff like that.

66
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.419
But that's the concept here that
you're thinking about, like, okay,

67
00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.480
I could attach like a Google Doc to this
and then ask it questions about that.

68
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.966
Explain to me my schema
in plain English for

69
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:57.660
a GitHub style issue tracker.

70
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.380
See what it says.

71
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.900
Hopefully you're kinda getting like,
this is where this could be useful to you.

72
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.609
If you wanted to be able to provide
these resources dynamically, or

73
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:16.837
you're building some sort of CMS and
you want to be able to ask questions about

74
00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.980
a specific article,
I could see that being useful here.

75
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.702
But you'd have to build some ability
to add those resources individually as

76
00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:29.780
registered resources as opposed to
being some sort of dynamic thing.

77
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.540
So you have to kinda think through that.
