1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are going
to hop into Claude code now.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.200
So if you haven't already,
just Google install Claude code.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.560
It's an NPM call.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.755
It's this NPM install G
anthropic AI Claude code and

5
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:23.600
that should leave you with the Claude
command, which is all of this.

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.756
We are gonna do Claude MCP and
there's a bunch of stuff on here for

7
00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:35.342
adding removing all those kinda
things from an individual

8
00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:40.590
project because this all
involves a bunch of API keys.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.613
I've done this because I don't want anyone
to steal all of my stuff, which has

10
00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:51.410
definitely happened to me before, and
I'm not, fool me four times, shame on you.

11
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.250
Fool me five times.

12
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.090
Still shame on you.

13
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.690
Why are you doing that?

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.964
MCP list so you can see here I
have installed already Neon,

15
00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:05.330
Playwright, Context7, and GitHub.

16
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.529
So if you pop over to our docs here,

17
00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:16.130
I left you links to all of these.

18
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.371
So if you go to the GitHub one you're
going to go and Claude applications,

19
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:27.106
you're gonna run something
that looks like this claude

20
00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:32.940
mcp--- transport http,
which is the streamable one.

21
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.660
GitHub.

22
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.380
GitHub is just whatever
you're going to call it.

23
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.220
This is the MCP server link.

24
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.533
And then you're gonna have
to get a GitHub PAT personal

25
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:49.670
access token GitHub.com,
that's gonna be under settings.

26
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.310
Developer settings I think
personal access tokens.

27
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.910
I am trying to remember
exactly which one it is.

28
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.766
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think the regular
tokens are being deprecated so

29
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:06.150
it's all moving towards
fine grained tokens.

30
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
I remember I spent some time on it.

31
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.890
So generate new token and
you need all repositories.

32
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.250
This is where I got tripped up.

33
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.770
You need all repositories and then you
need to add permissions for content.

34
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.450
You might need more.

35
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.127
But I remember this one is essential
because I spent like an hour trying to

36
00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:32.090
find this out and hopefully I save you.

37
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.170
But all repositories essential and
then contents essential.

38
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.940
And if you don't trust me,
I don't blame you [LAUGH] but

39
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.580
you might need more than that.

40
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.501
But I'm trying to get it so

41
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:56.220
that I can do issues pull requests.

42
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.860
Was that on here as well?

43
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.540
You need content if you can do actions and
stuff like that.

44
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.070
Code spaces,
those are all available secrets.

45
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.750
Maybe web hooks, I don't know.

46
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.190
But certainly issues pull requests and
contents.

47
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.630
Make sure those ones are all on there.

48
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.030
I already have one and it all works.

49
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.830
So I'm not going to question Anything.

50
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.270
Can I see what I've actually put on that?

51
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.590
Cuz that actually might be helpful.

52
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.216
I might have just done everything
because I was panicking and

53
00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:27.290
wanted to finish my course.

54
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.629
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, it's down there
.dependabot alerts actions, yeah.

55
00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go, so I did.

56
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.400
I just did everything because that
is wise when it comes to security.

57
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.520
Okay, but I did do a fine grain tokens and
the classic one is going away.

58
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.080
Okay, so that's number one.

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.147
Yeah, so sorry, it's gonna give you
some token and you're gonna run this

60
00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:03.950
command here, authorization bearer
with your GitHub PAT right there.

61
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.710
That's how you add the GitHub one linear.

62
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.750
I asked about the docs there,
link to the linear or the NEON ones.

63
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.350
This one's not terribly hard.

64
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.190
You do have to get a API token as well.

65
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.507
I think it's relatively similar
where it's Claude MCP add and

66
00:04:30.507 --> 00:04:36.600
then it's like MCP.neon.tex MCP
is the actual endpoint.

67
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.360
I remember.

68
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.524
Yeah.
It's going to say unauthorized and

69
00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:46.320
then you just do the same thing here
where it's just like Claude MCP add.

70
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.232
Let's just see what it
actually says there.

71
00:04:54.232 --> 00:05:01.234
Option, yeah, they say the name and
then you have to add the header for

72
00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:06.458
authorization bearer and
then your NEON API token,

73
00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:12.650
which you can just get out of
your neon.Tech.login GitHub.

74
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.290
That's fine.

75
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.978
So you can see when I have here
from a previous iteration, but

76
00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:28.841
there should be a account settings and
you should be able to grab

77
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:33.860
a personal API token here,
which you can see I have as well.

78
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.260
Create new API token.

79
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.940
Grab that.

80
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.820
That should be good enough for
the NEON one.

81
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.352
Okay, then playwright,

82
00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:49.190
this one's extremely easy.

83
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.472
It's just like Claude Mcp cuz this
has no authentication to it, so

84
00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:55.310
it's literally just this.

85
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.390
That one's going to run locally.

86
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.310
It wouldn't make sense to run that as a
HTTP cuz it's actually gonna spin up your

87
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.430
browser to do things.

88
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.830
Easy peasy, and then context seven.

89
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.339
We were just discussing this
one install in Claude code and

90
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.870
it's this one right there.

91
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.997
Okay, that'll install context seven for

92
00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:32.830
you, Figma and Vercel.

93
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.830
Those ones Venture Drone.

94
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.620
Vercel one doesn't work for cloud code and
Figma, you have to pay for it.

95
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.580
So we're not going to use it today.

96
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.380
All right, so
that is the ones I have open here.

97
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.764
So if I say MCP or Claude McPlist,

98
00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:56.820
it's going to go out and
make sure everything works.

99
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.660
Everything works.
