00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's do a jobs based one here as well.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.360
So this would be very useful.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.960
As you can see here,
Sonnet is doing just fine with this.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.084
We are kind of being slightly wasteful
with how many tokens we're going at with

5
00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.320
this cuz it's having to
do several API calls.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.798
This would kind of optimize
that a little bit, but

7
00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:21.760
not necessarily the reason
that I'm focused on this.

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.400
If you're working in AI, you just have
infinite vc, just go burn their money.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.520
That's what I'm saying, right?

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.460
That's really what I'm saying is just
go burn your VC money with this.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.940
Where this actually becomes very
useful is you're on an edge device.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.340
It can only fit so
much space on this particular model.

13
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.462
It's a Raspberry PI,
it only has a couple of gigs of VRAM for

14
00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.740
you to mess around with.

15
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.220
This becomes even more important so that
you guarantee that your job is getting

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.060
done correctly the same
way every single time.

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.620
Let's go, let's do that.

18
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.460
Yeah, the success in particular
is like night and day.

19
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.273
This went from never working with
the API based MCP server to working

20
00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:05.308
every single time, right?

21
00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:07.152
That's how big of the difference was.

22
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.000
So, we're talking about here how I
would decide to do something like this.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.815
If I see people using the API
the same way every single time,

24
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.520
that's a good way to designate.

25
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.748
It's like, okay,

26
00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:29.590
this is a something I need to go
build as a job into my MCP server.

27
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.410
So one of these things as the NEON product
manager of our MCP server is we saw a lot

28
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.150
of people trying to run migrations
through their MCP server.

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.728
And as we've discussed previously, LLMs
are just not good at managing database

30
00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:49.190
structures and actually giving them
the raw capability of just doing it Yolo.

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.110
They'll just drop tables and
say, whoopsie, right?

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.390
I didn't mean to do that.

33
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.990
What do you want me to do now, boss?

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.581
Right, so we went and
built a tool for migrations so

35
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:04.240
that we could kind of control
some of that chaos, right?

36
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.400
So let's say that you're the product
manager of this particular issues tracker.

37
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.335
Let's say you see that people
are creating new bugs and

38
00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:12.480
marking them as high priority.

39
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.520
And that continually happens again and
again and again and again.

40
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.030
Rather than making LLMs try and
go out and say, okay,

41
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
go fetch the bug's ID and
then create an issue with it.

42
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.980
Just make a create bug job, right?

43
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.271
And so
that it's just built into the server and

44
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.180
it just works every damn time, right?

45
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580
That's my point here with job space.

46
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.530
Thing is like try and condense this
complex cascading effect of like do this,

47
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.100
then this, then this,
but don't do this first.

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.261
You have to do this one first.

49
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.045
And then to just like,
here's the job that you wanna do,

50
00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:48.960
give me the information you need for
this job and just call it good.

51
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
There's not really any
code difference here.

52
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.320
This is just a mindset of how you
build these things differently.

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.960
Let's go.

54
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.403
And we can actually just copy and

55
00:02:58.403 --> 00:03:01.930
paste this whole thing because I don't
really want to make you write it again,

56
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.560
which is to say that I don't
want to write it again myself.

57
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.680
We're going to say copy that.

58
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.880
We're going to go over to my VS code here.

59
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.688
Right here I have API based one and

60
00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:22.668
I'm going to create a new file here

61
00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:27.306
called Jobs based tools.JS and

62
00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:31.610
just paste all that in there.

63
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.410
It works exactly the same way.

64
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.610
Job space tools, make requests.

65
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.930
That one exists in there as well.

66
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.290
We have a create bug.

67
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.890
A it creates a bug with new issue
with high priority and a bug tag.

68
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.151
There's create feature request,

69
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:54.650
creates low priority feature request and
update ticket status, right?

70
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.323
So let's say that I work with a bunch
of customer support people and

71
00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:00.170
I just saw that this is all it was.

72
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.290
It was either feature requests or
bug statuses or updating tickets.

73
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.190
I think you could probably see that that's
probably where a lot of these could go.

74
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.230
I would just create these three tools and
not give them anything else, right?

75
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.330
As opposed to you get bad human actors
that might go in there and say,

76
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.768
I'm gonna create this as an urgent bug
because it's urgent to me and I'm gonna

77
00:04:20.768 --> 00:04:26.150
assign it to you because I know you'll get
annoyed by this, that you'll go do it.

78
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.210
And then you can also guard yourself
against bad LLM actors of like they're

79
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.012
creating tickets willy nilly that
don't fit in any particular way and

80
00:04:34.012 --> 00:04:38.090
they're not being assigned correctly and
all that kind of stuff, right?

81
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.130
So we did jobs here.

82
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.050
We're gonna just comment this one out and
say,

83
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.970
import jobs based tools
from jobs based tools.

84
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.730
And then I'm going to comment that out and
I'm going to say jobs based tools.

85
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.678
So instead of doing API based tools,
we're going to do job space tools.

86
00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:06.620
We're gonna save that.

87
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.540
We're going to come into Claude here.

88
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.620
We're going to restart that.

89
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.900
Come back into Claude.

90
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.940
Now, if we look here at our tools,
we have the issues.

91
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.060
It has three tools.

92
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.740
Create bug.

93
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.860
Create a feature request and
update ticket status.

94
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.706
Create a feature request

95
00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:39.440
to add Dark mode to the admin app.

96
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.515
Fill it out with a very
convincing monologue

97
00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:54.082
about the dangers of white
light in your eyes and

98
00:05:54.082 --> 00:06:00.170
how Dark mode is
the singular path to glory.

99
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.210
I have no idea what's
going to happen there.

100
00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:13.173
Yeah.
So, I have to go get an API key.

101
00:06:24.963 --> 00:06:27.529
[LAUGH]

102
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.980
Add dark mode of admin.

103
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.100
A critical enhancement for human survival.

104
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.560
This one's.

105
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.880
That's amazing that we both
know it should be critical.

106
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.160
This is amazing.

107
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.880
So let's go see what it
actually wrote there.

108
00:07:18.414 --> 00:07:21.566
Man.
Every day countless administrators suffer

109
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:25.610
under the tyrannical glare of
our blindingly white interfaces.

110
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.730
Their retinas burn, their souls wither.

111
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.689
Their productivity crumbles like
ancient parchment in the desert sun.

112
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.930
Jeez, this wax poetic.

113
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.650
Dark mode is destiny.

114
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.890
Dark mode is excellence.

115
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.130
Dark mode is the way.

116
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.250
I'm just gonna put that as
my email signature anyway.

117
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.310
Okay, well, so you can see this is

118
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.210
obviously the best way to do MCP servers.

119
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.250
I have proven this now, right?

120
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.050
This is actually the best
way to do MCP servers.

121
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.890
Thank you, Claude, for your assistance.

122
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.327
Then let's add, so if we look at one
of the other ones we added here,

123
00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:11.734
which is job space,
we had an update status here as well.

124
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:19.430
We need the ID here as well.

125
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.590
And here we can say,
please update Dark mode to done.

126
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.800
So it'll call our tool and we'll see.

127
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.519
You can get an amen [LAUGH].

128
00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:10.330
Good Lord,
this is how I keep my job entertaining.

129
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.090
Praise the dark mode.

130
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.050
Praise to be the shadows.

131
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.258
The way has been illuminated
by darkness itself.

132
00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:18.547
[LAUGH] Glory achieved.

133
00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:20.250
I saved.

134
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.930
That's amazing.

135
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:28.350
Okay, so any questions about jobs
based on tools or anything like that?

136
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.830
Again, it's a paradigm shift.

137
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.150
There's no coding difference here.

138
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.864
It's just like a way about thinking
about creating these things.

139
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:38.291
This is probably one of the most important
things that I've learned in terms of just

140
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:42.543
like authoring MCP servers over the
year-ish that we've been supporting it.

141
00:09:42.543 --> 00:09:43.430
It definitely will help.

142
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.085
And if you Google API based MCP Server,
there's a bunch of thought pieces on this

143
00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:52.537
now as well because a lot of people are
hitting kind of the same results because

144
00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:55.020
it's like a natural way to think about it.

145
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.940
It's like, it's just an API.

146
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.998
Let's just wrap our API in MCP server.

147
00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.500
So don't do that.

148
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.700
&gt;&gt; Student: Can we think of jobs based
tools as more specific API based tools for

149
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.740
particular common use cases.

150
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.059
Or is there something more to them?

151
00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:11.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One,
it's a term that I'm inventing.

152
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.020
There's no official capacity for this.

153
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.744
It's more just like working
backwards from what users want,

154
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.941
which is what we should be doing always,

155
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:24.900
but working backwards from what we
want an agent to accomplish with our.

156
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.922
In this particular case, again, if I was
building this for like a support center,

157
00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:32.720
those are the things that I want them
to be able to do via this service.

158
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.763
So if I just give them an API based
MCP server, they're going to be

159
00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:43.040
able to do anything the API can maybe,
if it succeeds, right?

160
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.440
Or I can work backwards.

161
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.253
Like they create feature requests, they
create bugs, and they update tickets and

162
00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.810
that's all they want to be able to do.

163
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.410
Less tools, less room for
possibilities of going wrong.

164
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.330
It's just cleaner, it's better,
it succeeds more frequently.

165
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.690
You're less subject to the chaos of
the LLM, which is what you want, right?

166
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.770
So again, there might be
a better way of describing this.

167
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.152
Maybe not jobs based, but
the way I got that is jobs to be done,

168
00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:18.010
which is a big framework for
creating product descriptions, right?

169
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.090
I just kind of worked that
into jobs based MCP servers.

170
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.285
&gt;&gt; Student: How do you structure your
MCP API surface for exploration,

171
00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:32.624
for example,
when you don't know all the jobs yet, but

172
00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:36.770
want to provide your company with
as many capabilities as possible?

173
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

174
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.654
I still wouldn't give it the entire
API because at that point you're still

175
00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:49.344
kind of like subjected to all that
chaos and your LLMs are either going to

176
00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:54.290
just waste a bunch of tokens or
they're going to just not be successful.

177
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.679
So more I would just go broad in terms
of here's all the possible things that I

178
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:03.135
would want them to be able to do and then
I would watch the usage of those APIs and

179
00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:07.664
if you create one for auth issues and
no one ever reports any auth issues, one,

180
00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:10.887
maybe they're just not being
able to log into the site,

181
00:12:10.887 --> 00:12:12.850
which might be a problem itself.

182
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.775
But if no one's ever using
that particular tool,

183
00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:20.530
then I'm at that point
might just go remove it.

184
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.010
I just go broad and have 20 tools and

185
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.730
then reduce it down to the seven
tools that actually get used.

186
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.610
Something like that.

187
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.471
We had a problem with that with the Neon
MCP server where we had one tool that we

188
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:40.493
wanted people to use, but the LLMs
are always selecting a different tool and

189
00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:44.640
then composing that to solve for
the other tool.

190
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.022
And so
that tipped us off that the prompting for

191
00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:50.640
the tool that we wanted people to
use just wasn't prompted very well.

192
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.854
So we went back and refined the prompt,
and then once we did that,

193
00:12:52.854 --> 00:12:53.920
that everything worked well.

194
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.760
This all comes down to monitor and
observe how people are using your stuff.

195
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.720
Right.

196
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.520
That's critical.
