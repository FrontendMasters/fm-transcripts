00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.746
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
a resource is essentially handing a piece

2
00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:12.160
of content to the LLM and
saying, interpret this.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.480
This goes with whatever
prompt I'm handing you.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.520
Do things with it.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.804
The key here is it's not really a prompt,
it's not really a command to the LLM,

6
00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:22.720
right?

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.123
So even if I put in my doc here,
hey, LLM, please do this,

8
00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:30.720
it's really not going to be interpreted
as that because it's not meant to be.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.420
It's meant to be not command.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.260
That is different than a prompt.

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.300
A prompt.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.562
You can actually have your MCP server
give canned prompts to the user and

13
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.122
say, hey, if you're going to
be doing something like this,

14
00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:50.525
then you can use a prompt from
the MCP server to do it for you.

15
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:56.639
So a very dumb one that I decided
to build is a style checker,

16
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.340
an eslint style checker.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.962
You can actually have your LLM
do the style checking for you.

18
00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.871
And we can do that with a prompt because
the prompt is gonna have to give it

19
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.850
a bunch of information of,
here's all the rules, check them this way.

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.530
Use these kind of rules and
report them in this particular way.

21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.730
Terrible idea, right?

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.490
Very expensive way to run eslint.

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.650
But we're going to do it because it's for
science.

24
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.530
Let's pop it back over here.

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.070
Resources are meant to be more context.

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.310
Prompts are meant to be more commands.

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.095
And the cool thing about prompts is
that you actually can provide them with

28
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.590
parameters and kind of change things
on the fly, which is helpful.

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.150
And if you're like this,
seems like we're splitting hairs here.

30
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.190
I agree with you.

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.430
It does feel like I'm
splitting hairs here.

32
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.630
But that is the intention behind these
two different things being separate.

33
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.211
Like I said here, I still think there's
some iterations left before you really

34
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.190
settle on what the forever MCP
protocol is going to look like.

35
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.754
So let's say you're having Claude
build some sort of code for you and

36
00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:11.449
you really want it to follow
some sort of coding style.

37
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:12.430
I put some ones down here.

38
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.790
Idiomatic JS, Airbnb standard.

39
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.470
They're all ways of writing JavaScript.

40
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.099
So we're going to copy one of these and
put them in the MCP directory, and

41
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.160
then we're going to tell our
MCP servers whenever you

42
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760
write code to follow
these kind of commands.

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.920
We're going to go back to our VS Code and
I'm gonna make a.

44
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.320
And we're going to leave this
project one behind for a little bit.

45
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.110
The MCP issue tracker One and we're going
to go back to the other one that we

46
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.680
were working on because this has nothing
to do with this particular project.

47
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920
So I'm just gonna minimize that one.

48
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.490
I'm going to go back to this MyMCP one
that I was working on before, okay?

49
00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.509
We're going to make a new one and we're
going to call this style checker JS And

50
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:05.229
I'm also going to create a file
here called, I don't know,

51
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.305
Style Guide MD or something like that.

52
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:12.562
Style-guide.md and
just paste all that in there,

53
00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:16.730
almost or
past 4,000 lines of markdown here.

54
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.970
So feel free to use standard.

55
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.069
It is much shorter.

56
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.801
But YOLO, as the kids say, which is funny

57
00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:29.680
because no kid says that anymore, right?

58
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.560
Like it's just millennials saying
that kids say that, which is me.

59
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.000
Let's go make a little MCP server for
this.

60
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.960
This should be pretty fast.

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.920
So we'll just go ahead and
code this by hand as well.

62
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.400
Your style checker, there it is.

63
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.760
Import MCP server.

64
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.799
We're going to import standard

65
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:59.269
IO server transport import Z from Zod and

66
00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.215
import read file sync from fs,

67
00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:09.180
which stands for file system.

68
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.350
Let's make this a bit bigger.

69
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.990
Just make this full screen.

70
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.630
That's fine.

71
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.282
Okay, and const airbnbMarkdownPath

72
00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:33.830
= /Users/brianholt.

73
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.950
This is wherever yours is.

74
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.135
Mine's at this.

75
00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:40.560
And I didn't put this on desktop.

76
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.602
Desktop/my-mcp/, I called

77
00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:53.000
it what, style-guide.md.

78
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.440
Whatever you put for
your full path needs to go there.

79
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.946
Const airbnbMarkdown

80
00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:09.519
= readFileSync(airbnbMarkdownPath),

81
00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.110
and it is in utf-8.

82
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.310
Okay, now Airbnb markdown.

83
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.070
This should be whatever the content
of that particular file is.

84
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.150
We are going to create a new file or
a new server.

85
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.590
Const server equals new MCP server.

86
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.240
And the name is going to
be Code review server.

87
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.760
And version is going to be.

88
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.680
Doesn't need to be in quotes, 1.0.0.

89
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.280
And then we're going to do
server dot register prompt.

90
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.680
It's going to review code.

91
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.490
It's gonna be the prompt.

92
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.130
And then we're going to
do title code review.

93
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.260
So we're doing something really dumb,

94
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.330
which is just passing it a full on style
guide for that somebody else wrote.

95
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.920
But this actually could be somewhat useful
if you had a bunch of style guide and

96
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.392
ideas and more macro level ways
of constructing your repos and

97
00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:24.500
like, hey, this is a Monorepo.

98
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.034
If you have a new style of server to
Create, please create a new directory.

99
00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:33.354
You could be really broad and
prescriptive with this, and

100
00:06:33.354 --> 00:06:39.220
you could then have Claude code respect
these things via an MCP server.

101
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.220
Hopefully you're seeing ways
that you could apply this.

102
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.100
Or another good one would be Devin,
have you ever used Devin?

103
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.593
Devin's a pretty cool coding agent that
just plugs into your GitHub and so

104
00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:56.660
you just open issues on GitHub and
say, hey, Devin, go fix this.

105
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.776
And then you could use an MCP server to
fix things the way that you want them

106
00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:01.340
to be fixed.

107
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.062
And you could say, before you open a pull
request, please do these things and

108
00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:09.140
then open the pull request and
file it this way.

109
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.820
You can do a bunch of stuff like that,
all using an MCP server.

110
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.140
And you could do it
with probably a prompt.

111
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.370
I have not tried that, but
seems like a good idea.

112
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.059
Okay, ARG schema,

113
00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:31.770
codeZ string.

114
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.851
Okay, and then here we're just going
to give it the function to run once

115
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:39.290
it actually has it.

116
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:46.542
So it's going to take in the code like we
described, then it's going to return back,

117
00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:52.500
essentially something that you want
to pass back to the LLM messages.

118
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.439
This will feel like writing an API call
for ChatGPT or something like that,

119
00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:05.479
where you give it a messages array and you
tell it what kind of role you're using.

120
00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.540
This is role is "User", content is, right,

121
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.950
if you've ever written code that calls
ChatGPT, it looks just like this.

122
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:28.590
Type is text and text is something like.

123
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.676
Please review this code to

124
00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:41.079
see if it follows our best practices.

125
00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:48.439
Use this Airbnb style guide

126
00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:53.399
as a reference and the rules.

127
00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:01.867
Okay, and then we're going to
do something like new line,

128
00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:06.347
new line here and then a bunch
of equal signs because you know,

129
00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:09.290
you want to like, add some separation.

130
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:18.010
Okay, and then Airbnb markdown like this.

131
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.410
And then we'll do the same
thing kind of here.

132
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.260
We'll put the code.

133
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.780
Here is the code to review.

134
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.500
New line, new line code.

135
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.460
I'm not going to pretend this is any
sort of good prompt, by the way.

136
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.125
It's meant to be fairly short, but
a longer prompt would be like,

137
00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:53.780
here's the block and respect it these ways
and apply it in these certain other ways.

138
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.920
But this will be sufficient for our needs.

139
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.800
But you can see here, we're formatting
this like we would format a prompt, right?

140
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.080
And then that's it.

141
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:11.982
We're just gonna say const transport
= new StdioServerTransport and

142
00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:16.600
await server.connect(transport).

143
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.570
Okay, that's it.

144
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.472
That's how you do a prompt.

145
00:10:28.472 --> 00:10:31.410
Let's go add it to our Claude config here.

146
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.530
Again, doesn't work on tome so
please don't try.

147
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.552
Or maybe it does by the time
you watch this, but

148
00:10:38.552 --> 00:10:43.608
as of writing this does not work
on tome and actually we want

149
00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:48.887
to do it because it's going to
be the same as the weather one.

150
00:10:48.887 --> 00:10:54.800
So we'll call this code-style-server and

151
00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.030
this was style-checker.js, and then save.

152
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.910
Okay, let's go restart CLAUDE and
see what happens.

153
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.880
Okay, what did we do this time?

154
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.400
So open logs here, code.

155
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.000
I called it code style, didn't I?

156
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.520
Yep.

157
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.040
Okay.

158
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.320
Cannot find module style check.

159
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.200
So I probably just didn't spell right.

160
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.120
Style checker, right?

161
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.280
Is it style checker?

162
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.920
Yep, okay.

163
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.360
Okay, +, use from

164
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.180
code-style-server.

165
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:15.102
Review code and then it's going to ask
me for the code that I want to review.

166
00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:16.420
So let's review.

167
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.580
Let's get extra meta and
have it review itself.

168
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.660
Seems pretty funny.

169
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.870
So I'm just gonna put all that in there
and I'm gonna say Add prompt, and

170
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.340
now I have this whole prompt in here.

171
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:36.270
Please do the code review,
but be extra polite.

172
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.390
I have sensitive feelings.

173
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.734
I'm going to start doing all my
prompts this way where it's just like,

174
00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.550
you're almost there, buddy.

175
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.830
Pat, Pat, Pat.

176
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.710
It's okay.

177
00:13:11.094 --> 00:13:12.470
This is great.

178
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.310
So anyway, hopefully you're
seeing the value here as well.

179
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.948
What?
You did really well.

180
00:13:18.948 --> 00:13:21.190
I got a gold star from Claude.

181
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.150
Please treat me like a kindergartener.

182
00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:28.800
I'm so happy with this.

183
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320
So does that make sense?

184
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.407
It's basically you're adding like
additional lines to your prompt and

185
00:13:34.407 --> 00:13:37.189
you're just, you're allowing that
to happen from an MCP server

186
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:39.480
where I would actually
probably be more apt to apply.

187
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.662
This is, let's say that I have
a joint project where all

188
00:13:42.662 --> 00:13:46.640
of us are using like cloud desktop or
on it or something like that.

189
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.490
I could see going in there and
say like, hey,

190
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.880
I'm about to do a code review
on a coworker's thing.

191
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.120
Please highlight all the areas
that I should look for.

192
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.588
And then I would put that into like a
really nice self contained prompt that we

193
00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.213
could all kind of collaborate on and

194
00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:02.940
then we could all share all
those things together, right?

195
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.980
Does that make sense?

196
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.860
Yeah.
Question.

197
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.609
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.
Do you get a larger context window

198
00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:08.980
with the max plan?

199
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.780
Cuz I'm getting that this conversation
is 18% over the length limit.

200
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.916
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Probably, yeah.

201
00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:16.340
&gt;&gt; Student: I knew it.

202
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I wrote this entire thing on Pro.

203
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.544
So this was all working for me on Pro.

204
00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:26.140
I then bought Max cuz I was terrified I
was gonna run out of credits mid course.

205
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.020
And so I was like, for $200,
I just don't have to worry about this.

206
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.973
So I went full send on a Max plan, but

207
00:14:31.973 --> 00:14:36.680
I did have to cut down
a bunch of stuff before.

208
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.567
Maybe try Standard.

209
00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:38.200
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

210
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, standard's,
I think, a quarter the size.
