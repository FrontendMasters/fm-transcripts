00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.819
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So Vive coding is really
just adding a bunch of MCP servers to some

2
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.864
sort of MCP client that has the ability
to access the local file system and

3
00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:10.560
just saying, go, get it done.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.160
That's kinda what vibe coding is.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'm gonna give you some
options to get started here.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.727
We are going to use cloud code today
because it's the one that I've used all

7
00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:23.454
these quite a bit and I know it's
blasphemous to say that it's not VSCode,

8
00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:26.080
but cloud code is very cool and
it works really well.

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.080
But Cursor can do this.

10
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.240
I use Cursor at work.

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.720
Windsurf is awesome.

12
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.539
Zed has some cool features that if
you haven't played with Zed, but

13
00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.640
there's a ton of them out there now for
doing this.

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.878
Since I wrote even this page,

15
00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:41.708
which has been out, I don't know,
I wrote this like two weeks ago.

16
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.359
It was very recent.

17
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.867
There's one called Crush that came out

18
00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:51.520
that I'm kind of enamored with as well.

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.350
I've only briefly played around with.

20
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.790
It's very Claude Code esque.

21
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.036
And if you're into Vim and
all that kind of stuff,

22
00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:00.830
Crush does some really cool stuff as well.

23
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.830
So obviously Claude code
is very tied to Claude.

24
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.750
There's also one for Gemini's I think, AI
Assistant or something like that, right?

25
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.390
That does it with Gemini
instead of Claude code.

26
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.990
Crush is one that can do
it across a few of them.

27
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.960
So feel free to try any one of these,
but let's go ahead and try it.

28
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.920
Well, I'm gonna do it with Claude Code.

29
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840
Yeah, what is AI Toolkit?

30
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.120
Yeah, this is another one
that you can try out as well.

31
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.495
Again, not all of these are free, so
I was pretty cognizant of which ones

32
00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:43.320
I tried to choose so that most of
this could be free to try out.

33
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.452
But today I'm going to be
using the GitHub MCP server so

34
00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:53.900
that I can be able to create issues, open
pull requests, do all that kind of stuff.

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.541
I actually really like Linear for
project management kindastuff and

36
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.500
its MCP server is definitely
state of the art as well.

37
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.380
So definitely try that one.

38
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.580
We're going to be using Neon.

39
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.209
I have reasons that I like Neon,
mostly because I work on it.

40
00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:18.489
But yeah, just to very transparently
disclose, this is what I work on at work.

41
00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.609
You don't have to use this one.

42
00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.750
There are other great database MCP servers
out there that are slightly inferior,

43
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.969
just like a little bit.

44
00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.569
But feel free to be the judge of that,
you can be wrong.

45
00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.500
Though I try to rank these a little
bit in terms of the impact on my work.

46
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.780
The GitHub one is huge or linear.

47
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.509
You can basically what we were talking
about before, where you can say,

48
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:44.460
create an issue on this.

49
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.219
Save this here, open the pull request
here, read this pull request,

50
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.780
criticize this, do these things.

51
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.120
It's this extended memory and

52
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.660
knowledge of what's going on in your
code base, how people are working.

53
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.340
It interacts in there like a human.

54
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.630
Because you're kinda telling us,
all right, open this issue,

55
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.290
put these steps in there, very cool.

56
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.210
The Neon one is probably next.

57
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.290
Just because it allows me to say,
go, read this from the database.

58
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.810
Create something that looks like this and
interacts with this table.

59
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.209
Hey, pull this out of here.

60
00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.010
Tell me what this data looks like.

61
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.530
Hey, go grab me the first 30 rows
out of this so I can see what it is.

62
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.130
I'm going to give you probably two
more times before this course is up.

63
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.260
Be cautious with this because
it has access to your database.

64
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.989
So if you're giving it access to
production, with write access,

65
00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.260
agents will do stuff.

66
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.700
And it can be scary, right?

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.611
And in particular, if you're using a lot
of MCP servers, if someone like supply

68
00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:52.900
chain attacks one of them,
they could get nefarious code in there.

69
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.780
They could like dump your database,
they could drop your table.

70
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.698
Just be very cautious of like how
you combine like the Neon MCP server

71
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.160
with other MCP servers or
with agents, right?

72
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480
I'll throw out here.

73
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.840
It's a really good idea if you're
working with agents, to work with orms.

74
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.173
I used to not recommend orms, but ever
since Prisma kind of came on the scene and

75
00:04:19.173 --> 00:04:23.280
they modernized orms,
it became a good idea again.

76
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.520
My favorite now is Drizzle.

77
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.330
Works extremely well with Neon.

78
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.090
They actually let us
directly commit to it.

79
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.210
So the stuff that is Neon
in Drizzle came from us.

80
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.570
And it's not just us, there's other
companies that get to contribute as well.

81
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.761
If you do do that, add things like do
not modify the migrations directly,

82
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.089
only use Drizzle.

83
00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:45.850
You have to put in there several times.

84
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.530
Use Drizzle, don't do it yourself.

85
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.750
The playwright one is very cool because
you can say, hey, go open this page and

86
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.372
make sure that it works, or

87
00:04:56.372 --> 00:04:59.640
write an integration test
that makes sure this works.

88
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.438
It's very cool that it can pop open
a browser, do a bunch of tests, and

89
00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:03.440
then close itself down.

90
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.760
So that's a very cool one.

91
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.640
Context 7.

92
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.058
This is from our friends at Upstash
which does Redis as a service and

93
00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:13.920
stuff like that.

94
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.233
They basically made a rag
database of everyone's docs and

95
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:21.760
they keep it very, very up to date.

96
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.316
So this is basically just
like a superpower for

97
00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:29.920
an LLM to go out there and
grab all the most modern docs.

98
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.631
We talked a little bit about this earlier,
like Neon Auth is a really new feature for

99
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.139
us and so it hasn't been really picked up
in the training data for like Claude and

100
00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.680
ChatGPT, but it is in context 7.

101
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.774
So like if you're working with something
really new, it's really good to say, hey,

102
00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:49.419
use context 7 for this feature to make
sure that you're getting the latest,

103
00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.560
most up to date things.

104
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.540
I really wanted to show you Figma.

105
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.820
The Figma MCP server is so
cool, but it is not free.

106
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.140
So I'm not gonna show you that today.

107
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.545
But you can basically load your design
system in or load any design system that's

108
00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:10.020
open source in there and say, okay,
code this, follow this design system.

109
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.057
And then I have this mock that I made for
you that looks terrible,

110
00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:15.220
that looks like a child drew on a napkin.

111
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.537
But make it cool looking.

112
00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:20.413
And now go and
with the Figma MCP server plus Cloud code,

113
00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.530
it works really, really well.

114
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.168
So if you have some time and
you're okay paying a little bit of money,

115
00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:28.810
this is very cool to play with.

116
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.170
So I left the docs there.

117
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.370
There's several deployment
targets that have MCP servers.

118
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.490
I work a lot with Vercel and
Neon works really well with Vercel.

119
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.193
They don't have a streamable
HTTP one at the moment,

120
00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:52.360
so it didn't work with
Claude code very well.

121
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.160
So we're not gonna show you that today.

122
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.200
But that's another one you can go play on.

123
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.984
Yeah, yeah, and
you can definitely say like,

124
00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:06.760
hey, I don't have a Vercel MCP server,
please write one for me.

125
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.440
And it usually does a pretty good job.
