00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm Brian Holt.

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome to the complete intro to mcp.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm very excited to get
started with you all on this.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.217
This is kind of a new development for
me in my career working on AI stuff.

5
00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:16.301
I'd kind of been around machine learning
and all those kind of previous terms that

6
00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:19.920
we used to use, but no longer kinda
just used cuz we all wrap it up into AI.

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.307
But specifically when I started
working at my last company,

8
00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:27.930
which then got acquired by this company,
I started working a lot on AI.

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.561
So a lot of my biggest customers
are the big agent makers like replit and

10
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.530
V0vercel create same data button.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.290
All of them, they're big users of Neon,
which is now owned by Databricks.

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.850
So today we're going to be talking about
one aspect of that which is called mcp.

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.260
If you don't know what MCP is now,

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.180
by the end of this class
you'll be extremely familiar.

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.565
Then we'll also be doing some working
with some AI, a little bit with agents,

16
00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:03.060
but mostly with the model context
protocol as we learn to vibe code.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.460
And every time I say that,
I feel a little bit older.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.420
Cool.

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.500
So first thing, I'm at MCP.holt.courses.

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.620
That is the course website here.

21
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.380
If you see here, I have a second computer.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.170
It's literally I have the same
website open on this computer.

23
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.690
It's just so that I can refer to my notes.

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.690
So you have all of my
notes available to you.

25
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.290
They are open source, they're shareable.

26
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.250
So feel free to reference this later.

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.953
Feel free to share it
with people that do or

28
00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:35.690
do not have frontend Master subscriptions.

29
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.591
Frontend Masters is really generous with
them letting me open source all these

30
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:40.730
materials.

31
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.250
Just a little bit of
how this course works.

32
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.090
It works like all my other courses,
if you ever watched them before.

33
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.091
So if you look up here,
you'll see welcome,

34
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.900
that's the section intro is
the lesson that we're on.

35
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.917
So if you ever need to jump around in the
notes and you're like looking at my video,

36
00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:55.780
that's how you would figure that out.

37
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.020
So a bit of an intro.

38
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.500
I talked a bit about myself, but
AI has become a big part of my job.

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.940
I don't think it's a fad though.

40
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.180
I do think that some people kind of
overblown what AI is and what it will do.

41
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.940
We'll talk about that.

42
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.500
I have a whole section on that.

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.904
But I do think that every person
that's embarking on work in tech,

44
00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:21.625
whether that be designer, engineer,
product manager, executive,

45
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:26.580
is better equipped if they know how to
use AI correctly, how to use it well,

46
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.570
and also how to build with it.

47
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.996
So those are all things that we're
going to talk about here and

48
00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.077
I'm just going to try and share with you
all the experience that I have gathered

49
00:02:34.077 --> 00:02:35.770
working in this industry for a little bit.

50
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.860
So MCP model Context protocol,
it's not really that old.

51
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.820
I mean,
I think it came out in 2024, right?

52
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.860
Like mid 2024.

53
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.802
It came from Anthropic,
which is the maker of Claude, and

54
00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:56.629
there had been several attempts to
basically, like, expose tools and

55
00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.660
capabilities to AI and
AI agents via different protocols.

56
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.166
Like GitHub had one called Participants
that we built something for that as well.

57
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.288
There was the GPTs and

58
00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:12.475
there was that ChatGPT was doing in OpenAI
that didn't really work out as well.

59
00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:18.030
And then all of a sudden Anthropic dropped
MCP and everybody started using it.

60
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.551
My company, we launched our McP server
in six days after the announcement, and

61
00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:23.910
there's two reasons.

62
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.550
One, we were just like,
we're a nimble team.

63
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.630
But two, they're actually
really not that complicated.

64
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.333
They're actually fairly simple to build.

65
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:34.174
We're gonna build five or
six throughout the life of this class,

66
00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:38.760
and they're mostly just small
modifications of each other.

67
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.767
So you'll see it's actually a fairly
simple protocol, but that combined with

68
00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:49.040
some sort of autonomous agent or LLM is
going to produce pretty cool results.

69
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.319
But that's really all the MCP server is.

70
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.280
It's essentially handing an LLM.

71
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.242
Here's a set of capabilities that
we're going to allow you to do, and

72
00:03:59.242 --> 00:04:02.870
we'll get more into what
that means here in a bit.

73
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.830
Who's this course for?

74
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.870
I'm hoping it's for you.

75
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.070
There's really no AI experience
necessary to take this course.

76
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.750
We'll be going over a lot of it.

77
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.172
This course is written in JavaScript and
Node JS, so

78
00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:16.990
more coding experience is better,
but also not necessary.

79
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.312
I think you'll still be able to
get a lot out of this course,

80
00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:20.950
even without a lot of coding experience.

81
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.110
I work for a company called Databricks.

82
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.330
As you can see here, as tradition, I wear
a new hoodie every time that I come back.

83
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.021
I was at Neon, which got acquired
by Databricks, so that one,

84
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:36.353
I'm not going to count that one,
because I didn't actually leave Neon.

85
00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:40.817
I just continued working at Neon, but
I've been a product manager now for,

86
00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:43.769
I don't know, six years or
something like that.

87
00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:47.294
Before that I was a devrel for
a little bit at Microsoft, and then

88
00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:52.010
before that I was a NodeJS and JavaScript
and front-end engineer for about a decade.

89
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.233
I've worked at Snowflake,
Microsoft, LinkedIn, Netflix,

90
00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.870
Reddit, some other smaller startups.

91
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.030
I was a VP of product at a brand
new startup for a while.

92
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.630
I've kind of been all over the industry.

93
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.070
Please catch up with me on social media.

94
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.270
I dropped my links in there.

95
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.110
I am terrible at responding to DMs,
so just be aware of that.

96
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.990
Where to File issues.

97
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.670
There's two repos for this course.

98
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.578
There's like a app repo that I built for
the sake that we could

99
00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:26.660
build an MCP server for
as well as the actual course website.

100
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.820
And this is where you can open,
pull requests,

101
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.220
you can whatever you need to do here,
file issues.

102
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.260
That's all there.

103
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.060
So the reason why I asked you to do that
instead of sending me a DM is cuz if

104
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.780
you're having an issue,
probably everybody's having an issue.

105
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.050
So it's helpful that I can put those in
the issues and refer people to them and

106
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.620
or fix them.

107
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.720
Okay then I did show you that repo
just now for the MCP issue tracker.

108
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.560
Go ahead and clone that.

109
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120
We'll be using that kind
of throughout the course.

110
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.880
This is basically just like a GitHub issue
tracker, just like that's all it does.

111
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.480
And as always, please start the repo.

112
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.960
It makes it more discoverable,
which is cool.

113
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.840
All right, some setup notes here.

114
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.200
You will need Node JS installed, I think.

115
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.790
Yeah, I have 2218 installed.

116
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.670
I think anything after
18 would work just fine.

117
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.430
You'll see that I have funky paths for
my node binary.

118
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.390
That's cuz I use something
called FAST nodemanager.

119
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.070
This is like NVM or N or one of those.

120
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.790
Or Volta.

121
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.230
I don't know why I chose this one.

122
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.910
If you're asking me why.

123
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.400
It has FAST the name and I like
going Fast so we installed that one.

124
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.240
It works fine.

125
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.520
To be honest with you,
I was totally fine with NVM as well.

126
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.760
So I really don't know.

127
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.110
I believe this course would work with bun,
but I did not try it.

128
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.080
So buyer beware.

129
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.520
I don't think it would work with Deno.

130
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.680
Well, maybe recent versions.

131
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.320
Extra buyer beware if you
choose to try this with Deno.

132
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.490
What tools am I using?

133
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.850
I just put this in here because
I always get asked afterwards.

134
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.375
I used to be a PM on VS code, so

135
00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:18.250
I did sign a blood oath with Satya
that I would continue using VS code.

136
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.450
So that's mostly what I use.

137
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.770
I also use Cursor fairly
regularly which is pretty cool.

138
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.250
Which is based on VS Code so
it somewhat fulfills my obligation.

139
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.280
I'm a Firefox person.

140
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.680
Happened for a long time and I actually
did start using Ghosty or Ghost Tty.

141
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.598
That's from the creator of Vagrant and
all those Hashicorp companies he left and

142
00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:50.640
he's just making a terminal so
it's pretty cool.

143
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.253
Mitchell, very nice guy.

144
00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:56.760
I use the Dark+ Theme, I use MonaLisa.

145
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.749
I actually got reached out to by the Mona
Lisa people and say like we actually get

146
00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:03.390
a decent amount of people that come to
our site and buy it because of you.

147
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.230
So they gave me a code to give all of you.

148
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.110
I get no kickback on this by the way.

149
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.110
I just really like the font so
it is quite expensive.

150
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.310
But I spend all day looking
at this font so I like it.

151
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.790
But if you don't want to pay for
one Cascadia code right there.

152
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.510
It is free, it's open source, it's from
Microsoft, does all the same stuff.

153
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.052
I do have ligatures enabled, which is
like when you put an equal sign and

154
00:08:29.052 --> 00:08:31.950
a angle bracket it combines into an arrow.

155
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.830
That's called a ligature.

156
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.310
I left some notes there
on how to enable that.

157
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.410
Then I have the VS code icons extension
installed which is all the neat icons

158
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.310
you'll see on the side terminal.

159
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:48.070
I use zsh, it comes on Mac and
I can't be bothered to change it.

160
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.110
Dracula theme, Starship prompt
which is the nice looking prompt.

161
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.916
Yeah, where it says you're on main and
you have this package and

162
00:08:57.916 --> 00:09:01.300
you're on Node JS that
comes from Starship.

163
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.860
Then all these special.

164
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.924
Obviously JavaScript is
not in the font package so

165
00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:11.060
you have to use this
thing called a nerd font.

166
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.900
That's what this is.

167
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.500
Something else.

168
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.820
This is an AI course.

169
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.500
Generally when I've taught
these courses before,

170
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.580
I've been pretty careful to make them
fairly minimally AI involved because I'm

171
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.190
trying to impart to you not Claude's
experience, but my experience.

172
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.190
But due to the nature of this course, this
course was infused with a lot more AI.

173
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.687
So I'm going to encourage you throughout
this course to use Claude and

174
00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:38.910
ChatGPT to ask questions
about this course.

175
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.512
One thing I did for you is I put 100%
of the notes into this one very,

176
00:09:43.512 --> 00:09:48.504
very long text document so that you can
feed that into Claude or to ChatGPT and

177
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.390
then you can ask questions
about my course.

178
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.500
Makes it really easy.

179
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.321
You can say like, hey, in this section,
Brian was doing this and

180
00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:58.340
I can't understand why this isn't working.

181
00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.380
Can you help me?

182
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.900
Usually it'll give you pretty good advice.

183
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.402
It's like, I see that Brian did this and
you missed this character, or

184
00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:06.580
Brian got this wrong or
something like that.

185
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.060
It's done pretty well for me.

186
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.620
If you're doing MCP stuff, that's not
beyond what I'm showing you here.

187
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.899
They also do the same thing here
where they make all of their docs

188
00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:22.500
available as one long text document.

189
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.220
You can see a lot of companies
are starting to do this.

190
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.020
We do it at Neon as well.

191
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.980
Stripe does it.

192
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.260
As you can see here,
this is a very long document.

193
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.900
I think my course is
like 1500 lines of text.

194
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.722
This is I think 13,000 lines of code,

195
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.860
which is bigger than
Claude's context window.

196
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.260
So you have to be kind of choosy
of what you put in there.

197
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.700
But all this to say Claude doesn't.

198
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.820
And as you can see, I mostly work with
Claude, But I imagine ChatGPT is the same.

199
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.627
This protocol is moving so

200
00:10:56.627 --> 00:11:02.620
quickly that it loses
context really quickly.

201
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.853
So I would strongly suggest if you start
asking questions about mcp, that you put

202
00:11:06.853 --> 00:11:11.098
some of the docs in there so that it knows
here's the most up to date information.

203
00:11:11.098 --> 00:11:12.663
Otherwise, it will usually
give you outdated information.
