00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's work on the holes.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.630
Notice right now there just
kinda coming out of nothing.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.821
It'd be really cool if we could get them
to come out of like a black hole, right?

4
00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:15.163
So I wanna say hole.

5
00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:19.802
And its background color is black.

6
00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:25.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Border radius, 50%,
cuz we want it to be round, right,

7
00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:26.618
like a hole should be.

8
00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:33.085
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Overflow, so overflow
is what happens if the stuff inside

9
00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:38.096
of an element is bigger than
the element itself, right?

10
00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:41.932
Typically, so just for example,

11
00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:45.777
if i say width 200 VW right now.

12
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice,
I have to scroll side to side here?

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.940
This is cuz this is
saying overflow scroll.

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.850
So because this element is larger than
the viewport, it's saying if this gets

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.170
bigger than that, then allow
the user to scroll side to side.

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.146
If I said overflow hidden here.

17
00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:10.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I refresh.

18
00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.330
Now, notice this is still off the page,
right?

19
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.610
But I can't scroll any more.

20
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.480
So that's what overflow hidden does.

21
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.691
If something overflows here,
just hide whatever overflows here.

22
00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:27.607
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What I'm gonna
do here is overflow visible.

23
00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.607
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which just means if
something goes larger than the element

24
00:01:32.607 --> 00:01:35.893
that it's in, just let it,
don't let them scroll, but

25
00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:38.090
still show whatever is overflowing.

26
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

27
00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.208
I need to get rid of that.

28
00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:53.701
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So with these little
moles in their holes, right,

29
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:59.140
I'm gonna add some height and
width here in just a second.

30
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.560
But if the mole is larger than the hole,

31
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.970
then let them still be able
to see their little paws.

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.386
In fact, I can show you what that
looks like here in just a second.

33
00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:10.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm going to say width.

34
00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:16.972
And I just kind of eyeballed this,
267 pixels, and height 267 pixels.

35
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So notice right now,

36
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.730
the moles are fitting
perfectly inside their holes.

37
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.628
I actually wanted the hole to be a little
bit more constricted than that, and

38
00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:26.865
I also wanted it to be circular.

39
00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:32.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, notice they
are kinda a little more constricted.

40
00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:35.057
Notice that the mole is overflowing in it,
right?

41
00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:41.815
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
notice you can still see him.

42
00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:44.743
So if I did overflow hidden here,
what do you think would happen?

43
00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:50.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice that now
the moles don't overflow their holes,

44
00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:51.740
which is not what we wanted.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.898
So that's why we did visible.

46
00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:57.144
Or we it could you scroll and
force people to scroll on the moles,

47
00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.019
which would be super weird, right?

48
00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.190
Now they have they all have
little scroll boxes on them.

49
00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:06.224
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's actually
a little charming [LAUGH].

50
00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.336
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But now,
we're going for, okay.

51
00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:13.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense so far?

52
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.031
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just
wanna say that this is so

53
00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:23.880
much more pleasant coding CSS like
this than it was five years ago.

54
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.730
This was so much harder to do without
flex box and a bunch of things like that.
