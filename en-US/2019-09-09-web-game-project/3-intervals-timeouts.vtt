00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.898
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's talk about intervals.

2
00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:08.786
So how do I run a function again
in a certain amount of time?

3
00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:15.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, let's come back over
here, and let's put this on the side for

4
00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:16.430
a second, to the left.

5
00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:28.133
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I say set time out,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Function.

6
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.818
Console.log, hi.

7
00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:37.045
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
I want this to run after 5 seconds,

8
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:39.864
I'm gonna put 5,000 cuz it's milliseconds.

9
00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:47.927
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it should come
back in five seconds and logout hi.

10
00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:53.269
That's the hope.

11
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.968
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe not, but
that's what it should do.

12
00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.523
In any case,
I promise you that's how that works.

13
00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:07.156
I don't know why it's not working in
my Firefox console at the moment.

14
00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.138
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But that's what that says.

15
00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:17.697
So set timeout works once.

16
00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:22.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Do I have a,
I don't, that's okay.

17
00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:27.708
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,
I can put it in here, in my calculator.

18
00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:32.342
So I'm just gonna say, Set Timeout here,

19
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:36.737
Function, console.log, heythere,

20
00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.977
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm gonna put 5000.

21
00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:47.800
So now, if I bring back up my calculator,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And refresh the page,

22
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully after five

23
00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:01.469
seconds it comes back and it says, notice
that doesn't immediately come in there and

24
00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.851
say hey there, it waits five seconds and
does that, okay?

25
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:06.824
So that's how set time out works,
it does it once.

26
00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:11.827
Now let's say I want this to
happen every two seconds.

27
00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.685
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,
you can do something called set interval.

28
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:17.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

29
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.106
now if I refresh there,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Every

30
00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.988
two seconds you can see there's
a little number right there.

31
00:02:24.988 --> 00:02:28.442
That means it's happening multiple times.

32
00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:33.397
Notice that every two seconds it's
coming back and calling hey there.

33
00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:38.391
Or you can even do let num equal 1,

34
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:43.051
num plus plus and just call num.

35
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.665
And then we'll do it
like every half a second.

36
00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:53.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's pretty cool, right?

37
00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:58.444
So this how you're gonna check over time
how your application is changing and

38
00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:03.227
when you are going to know when to show
moles and when not to show moles and

39
00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.611
that kind of stuff.

40
00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:06.107
This is gonna go on forever, right?

41
00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [COUGH] You shouldn't
necessarily have to do it, but

42
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.969
I'm gonna show you anyway.

43
00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.586
Sometimes you wanna cancel the interval,
right?

44
00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:16.053
You want it to stop doing
whatever it's doing.

45
00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:21.147
So the way you do that is you
say const interval equals that.

46
00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:22.930
And then let's just say,

47
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.645
I'm gonna set a timeout that after
10 seconds it's gonna stop it.

48
00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:33.572
So I'm gonna say Function,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cancel interval.

49
00:03:36.164 --> 00:03:38.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's
cancel interval, I hope it is.

50
00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.082
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Interval.

51
00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:46.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Clear interval, sorry
it's clearInterval, not cancel interval.

52
00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:56.125
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: clearInterval,
I will do this after 5,000 milliseconds.

53
00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:04.945
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So at some point,
hopefully, it will just stop, and it does.

54
00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:10.496
So that's how you stop an interval
from continuing to run.

55
00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:12.513
You can also clear timeouts as well right?

56
00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:16.207
If you set a timeout and then you want to
prevent it from eventually running you can

57
00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:19.048
also clear timeouts as well
using the same methodology here.
