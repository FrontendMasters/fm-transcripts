00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.764
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next thing here is gonna
be called function getNextStatus.

2
00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:08.081
It's gonna take in a mole.

3
00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna go
codify that kinda state machine

4
00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.723
that I talked about, that flow.

5
00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:21.029
So we're gonna use a switch statement,
which we've talked about before, switch.

6
00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:26.909
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: mole.status.

7
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's start with sad.

8
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, if a mole is sad,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.554
thing we do is we're gonna
update its next status.

10
00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:45.871
So, we're gonna say mole.next
equals getSadInterval,

11
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.110
which we already wrote, right?

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.441
So this is going to put another
SadInterval on top of that.

13
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.821
And it's gonna go to, become leaving.

14
00:00:54.821 --> 00:01:01.479
So mole.status equals leaving.

15
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.280
Now I chose to make the amount
of time that it's sad and

16
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.775
the amount of time that it's leaving
to be the same thing, right?

17
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.629
It does 500 milliseconds of both.

18
00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:13.340
Or what did I put up here,
it's gonna do a second of both.

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.162
But you could have another function up
here called getLeavingInterval, and

20
00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:18.860
you could mess with those times
individually if you want to.

21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.856
For me,
I'm happy to make them the same thing.

22
00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:28.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And so the reason that
we would write mole.next equals

23
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:33.114
getSadInterval again is
because now we are asking for

24
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:38.220
a new 1,000 milliseconds after the date,
after right now.

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.911
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.

26
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.067
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because we already did
that in when we defined the moles.

27
00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.116
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so
it has a set interval right here.

28
00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:47.850
That's gonna put its timing 1,000
seconds into the future, right?

29
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.230
Now when it goes from sad to leaving,
it's gonna be leaving for a second, right?

30
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.134
So we're gonna get a new
Date.now plus 1,000.

31
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.070
Make sense?

32
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.444
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So we could have named
it getNextInterval if we use it for

34
00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:03.687
each of the status?

35
00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.912
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, or
get sad or leaving interval.

36
00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:11.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That works for me too.

37
00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:13.205
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just for
normal English sake.

38
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:14.397
But yeah, got it.

39
00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:15.195
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

40
00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:22.737
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then we're going to say mole.source, or

41
00:02:22.737 --> 00:02:24.964
mole.node.source, right?

42
00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:27.830
We're going to change the image
of what it looks like, right?

43
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.542
And we're going to change that to ./ and

44
00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:39.925
what did I call it here, mole-leaving.png.

45
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.971
If you remember,
each one of them has their node on here,

46
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:46.974
which is like the DOM element that
actually represents the image, right.

47
00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:50.826
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Have we written the code yet
for changing the image?

48
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:54.177
Or how is that connected?

49
00:02:54.177 --> 00:02:57.250
How does it know which
image it's going to next?

50
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.365
Just by the status changing?

51
00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:02.196
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, so.

52
00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:06.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because that's
connected to a specific image?

53
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if it's sad, it's gonna
have a sad image like this one, right?

54
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.100
The next image you're going to show
there 100% of the time after sad

55
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.250
is going to be leaving.

56
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just cuz
that's in the [INAUDIBLE].

57
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.475
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We've constrained
our problem to be like that.

58
00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:27.047
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you scroll down a tiny
bit again to the run again function?

59
00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:28.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then after that, we're gonna break.
