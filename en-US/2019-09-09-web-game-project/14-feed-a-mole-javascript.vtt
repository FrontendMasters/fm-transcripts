00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's
go do the JavaScripts.

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.590
I'm gonna link to a script
down here at the bottom.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.840
I'm gonna call this game dot js or
something like that.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.847
You can call it whatever you like.

5
00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:21.332
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna say new file,
call it game dot js.

6
00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,
we can start working on the JavaScript.

7
00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:30.657
I think the first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna create an object that represents

8
00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:31.897
each one of these moles.

9
00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:36.240
So I'm gonna say const
moles equals an array.

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.345
And I'm gonna have a bunch of objects for
each mole in the array.

11
00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.338
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna say
the status of each one of these.

12
00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:48.206
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm gonna start them out with,

13
00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:53.330
let's say you can have them start out as
hungry or gone or something like that.

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.361
I'm gonna have some start out as sad.

15
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.121
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is like they
had just missed eating a worm.

16
00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:04.386
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
the next time that they're gonna come out

17
00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:07.662
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or rather actually,

18
00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:11.121
the next time that their
status is going to change.

19
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.256
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna say something
that's gonna be like date now plus

20
00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:17.500
2,000, right?

21
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.900
So they're gonna be sad for two seconds.

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.379
Let's actually make it just one second.

23
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:25.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If they're
gonna be a king mole or not.

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.544
So I'm gonna have that be false.

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.446
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, I'm gonna have
the node that represents each one of

26
00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.160
these, right?

27
00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna have this be node.

28
00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:42.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Document get
element by ID whole dash zero.

29
00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.076
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or if you wanted to,

30
00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:51.524
you could totally have the speed
document dot query selector.

31
00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:54.490
Pound whole dash zero.

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.918
Just write that one, cuz I'm so
used to writing it for so long.

33
00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:03.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Either or.

34
00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:03.926
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

35
00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:10.179
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
is this starting off by saying this,

36
00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:15.477
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This object represents just

37
00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:17.380
the first mole?

38
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.051
And then,
you are gonna need to make nine more?

39
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.455
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

40
00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:21.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

41
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I think this is kind
of the easiest way for me personally.

42
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.048
There's, again,
there's 10,000 ways to write this.

43
00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:31.581
And you give even very similar developers,
or even asked me on a different day and

44
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:34.460
I would have written this a different way,
right?

45
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.136
So this is just the way
that I'm choosing to do it.

46
00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.029
Other people would have written
this totally differently.

47
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.726
To me, it makes sense to have an object
with all the metadata about each mole in

48
00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.259
some sort of array here.

49
00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:53.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you have some
different way that you think you can solve

50
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.739
this better or differently or
something that makes more sense,

51
00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.146
then by all means you
should definitely do that.

52
00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.820
So here, I'm just gonna copy and
paste this a bunch of times.

53
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.643
So this is gonna be hole one.

54
00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And actually,

55
00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:12.496
it'd be better if I could have some sort
of function that generated times for me.

56
00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:16.586
So I'm gonna actually abstract
that out into a function,

57
00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:21.184
which I'm gonna call something
like function get sad interval.

58
00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:26.942
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's gonna return to the date now plus

59
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:30.160
some sort of timing right?

60
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.170
So how long do you want moles to be sad?

61
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.400
I think in my game here that I wrote,
I think the sad interval was 500.

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.369
So they're sad for
half a second before they disappear.

63
00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.219
Let's just go with a full second for now.

64
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So rather than
saying date plus now plus 1,000, so

65
00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:50.300
I'm not just doing this everywhere,
I'm gonna say get a sad interval.

66
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.550
Get sad interval.

67
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.460
And now, I have this reusable function.

68
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.000
So if later,
I wanna mess with these timings,

69
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.080
I don't have to go change it in 12 places.
