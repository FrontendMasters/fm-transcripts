00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.006
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So one more thing just
to show I chose to implement our moles.

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.561
So you can see here I have the happy face
and the sad face just looping back and

3
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:09.590
forth to each other.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.713
And the way that I did that is
let nextTime equals Date.now,

5
00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:21.129
this is the same thing
that basically is above.

6
00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:29.880
And you're just saying if he's
hungry then change him to sad, and

7
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.650
if he's sad change him to hungry and then
you just flipping that back and forth.

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.830
We talked about the exclamation point,

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.190
that just means if it's true that's
false and if it's false becomes true.

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.489
It's the opposite of whatever it is.

11
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.196
So this is just flipping his hungry
back and forth every single time and

12
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:52.637
then it's just doing
that every one second.

13
00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:55.878
Yeah, notice that we
grabbed the mole here, so

14
00:00:55.878 --> 00:01:00.834
get document.getElementbyID mole,
which is this one here, ID mole.

15
00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:07.627
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, at that point,
it's just changing mole.source,

16
00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:10.361
which is how you change
the image on something.

17
00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you are going
to need to grab all the assets.

18
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.220
Last piece of advice on the game here.

19
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.526
My best advice for
you is I would make the section or

20
00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:42.330
the div or whatever you wanna do for
the background, just make it a fix with

21
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.020
I have it fixed to 1,920
pixels by 1,080 pixels.

22
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.010
And that way you can kind of depend on
everything being in the same height and

23
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.950
width and all that kinda stuff.

24
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.800
I used Flex, that's why everything's
kinda centered around the middle.

25
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.670
That helps as well.

26
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.855
If you wanna get the cursor, so
you see down here at the bottom, cursor,

27
00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:14.366
if you just give it a URL like that
you can load an image as your cursor.

28
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:18.093
So that's how I got the little
bird to be my cursor.

29
00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:20.956
And then Jen showed you
how to do hover state?

30
00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:23.906
So if something hovers over something,
you can change the cursor to be

31
00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:27.159
something else, which is how it changes
to be the bird with the worm in there.
