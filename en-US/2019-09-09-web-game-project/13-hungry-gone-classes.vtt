00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
if the bird goes over a hungry mole,

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.890
right, it should have a worm in its mouth,
right?

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.470
So that that let's the user know,
it's like if you click on this,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.670
you're gonna get points.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.878
So the way we can do that
is we can say .hungry,

6
00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:25.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When someone's over it,

7
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:33.990
you can say cursor URL dot slash
cursor dash worm PNG, comma default.

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.622
So now whenever someone moves
the mouse over one of the hungry moles

9
00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:43.431
it's going to have a different image
than just this mole right here.

10
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:50.262
So just to test that out, let's go and
just add hungry on to one of these.

11
00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:58.280
Okay, so this one and then we're going
to add the class of hungry, save that.

12
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.890
That's because I'm
modifying the wrong HTML.

13
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.480
That's why, easy to do, hungry.

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.000
There we go.
And

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.510
now I can modify that and there you go.

16
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.560
You can see when the mouse
is over the hungry one,

17
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.390
you've got a little worm in its mouth.

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.420
And then when I move it off,
it no longer has it.

19
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.230
It's kind of fun, right?

20
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.580
And it's cool that this was
all done with CSS, right?

21
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.510
There's no code governing this.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.130
This is just the browser saying whenever
something's over something else,

23
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.380
just change the image behind it.

24
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.670
So we can take hungry off that I
just wanted to make sure it worked.

25
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.096
Let's go back to styles.CSS.

26
00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:43.180
So a mole that is gone we just
want to say display none.

27
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.869
So if we come back over here to
this first mole and I put gone.

28
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.683
And say that I want
nothing to be in the hole,

29
00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:53.371
I just want the hole to be there, right?.

30
00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.146
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that I can
have moles coming in and out.

31
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's good.

32
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll worry
about the worm and the winds later.

33
00:02:13.464 --> 00:02:16.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
this is pretty good.

34
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.300
This should get us started
working on our JavaScript.
