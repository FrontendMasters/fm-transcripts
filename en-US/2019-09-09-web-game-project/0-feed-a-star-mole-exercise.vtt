00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:06.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
we've completed the calculator,

2
00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.350
nice little portfolio piece for you.

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.620
Kinda of a fun thing to do and hopefully
you got a little bit more understanding of

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.050
what kind of engineering
goes into a calculator.

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.760
That's my entire goal.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.765
Just kidding, I don't care.

7
00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:20.700
[LAUGH].

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.650
So.

9
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.330
This is going to be your exercise for
today.

10
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.240
This is definitely the hardest
one I've given you so far and

11
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.250
you're probably thinking like, dear God,
is that like a vendetta against me or

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.860
something like that?

13
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.390
I do.

14
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.920
That's actually what it is.

15
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.850
No, but I'm really excited about this.

16
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.810
I'm super, super excited about this.

17
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.960
We're gonna be making.

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.760
It's not whack a mole
because that's animal abuse.

19
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.910
We're going to do feed a mole.

20
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.314
Which is so much more pleasant.

21
00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:58.777
So we have some artwork for you from
I think your last name is Barretton.

22
00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:00.620
Alice Barretton.

23
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.690
And it's phenomenal and
I'm really excited to show you this.

24
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.250
So I'm going to show you my
version of the game here.

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.570
And I'm just going to
zoom out a little bit.

26
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.083
So you have a little bird here and
the bird is trying to feed the moles.

27
00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.694
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It gets a little sad if you
don't feed it and then it goes away, but

28
00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:26.790
if you feed it then it's got like a happy
face and it goes away and it's happy.

29
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.638
You can see here's a little
guys growing over there, and

30
00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:36.264
sometimes you'll see little king ones that
come out that are worth double points.

31
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's the king.

32
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.770
And then, you have a happy little star
mole at the end, once you fed it all.

33
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.740
Come on though,
this just has to like warm your heart.

34
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.620
It warms my heart.

35
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.260
This is what you're going
to be building right now.

36
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.480
It's probably gonna be tough to build
in the day, but I expect you to,

37
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.700
like go through and
over time be able to finish this project.

38
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.020
So here's my advice to you when
you're trying to build this game.

39
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.660
It's helpful to try and do the HTML and
CSS, more of that kind of stuff up front.

40
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.670
Then after I have like HTML like the
background and a little warm up there and

41
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.130
all that kind of stuff I would probably
just make them moles show up and

42
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.770
disappear.

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.750
Don't make them clickable,
don't do anything like that.

44
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.620
Just make them show up and
then go back in their hole.

45
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.550
So I think something that
bears mentioning here.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.758
If you inspect element here
you can see here that,

47
00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:48.540
let's make this a little bigger.

48
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.370
These have like a background.

49
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.130
They're just black backgrounds.

50
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.610
Did Jen show you border radius stuff and
how to do border radius and

51
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.200
how to make things circles.

52
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.480
Cool.
So you just can use that same

53
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.980
technique here.

54
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.158
And then all I'm doing here is I
have an image inside of it, that I'm

55
00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:13.440
you can see here that it's just changing
the source of the image right there.

56
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.427
There's a little mole butt
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

57
00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:18.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That was my favorite part.

58
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.060
When it's gone then I add like the gone
class to it then when it comes and

59
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.570
it's hungry then it puts the hungry class
on it and does stuff like that and then

60
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.740
you can just change the source
here as things change, okay?

61
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.509
So going back to this.

62
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and then once you kind
of have them coming and going, right?

63
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.870
Then I want you to be able to
like click on one of them and

64
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.610
that will add a point, right?

65
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.060
And don't worry about making them have
the happy face or anything like that.

66
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.190
Just make them show up
with the hungry face.

67
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.070
And if you don't click on them,
then just have them disappear.

68
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.090
Don't worry about the butts or
any of that kind of stuff.

69
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.750
After they click ten times, have them win,
that's another thing that you could do.

70
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.526
Then after that, maybe work on the worm
meter, so it fills up over time.

71
00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:18.273
At that point you can probably make one
in 10 of the moles using math dot random.

72
00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:21.524
Okay, if a user doesn't click a mole,

73
00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:26.270
then you can show a sad mole and
then have them disappear.

74
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.235
If someone doesn't feed a mole or if
someone feeds a mole then show a fed mole,

75
00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.128
that's the pie the next step there.

76
00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:36.000
And then after both sad and fed moles,
you should show a mole button, right?

77
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.456
At that point, you should be more or
less done with the game.

78
00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So feel free to play
around with the game and the timings.

79
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.060
I'm having, right now,
moles show up for two seconds.

80
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.450
If you don't click on them,
then they go away.

81
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.280
But you could try maybe making
that three seconds or one second.

82
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.090
Maybe it's random,

83
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.700
like they only show for maybe one to four
seconds using that math.random function.

84
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.520
That's up to you.
