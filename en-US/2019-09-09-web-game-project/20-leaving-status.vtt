00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the mole.next here is going to

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.153
be getGoneInterval, mole.status = gone.

3
00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:15.270
What I want to do is I want
the mole to disappear.

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.190
So if you remember up here,
we made this gone, right, this gone class.

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.090
So we need to put that
gone thing on the mole.

6
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.080
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.800
mole.node.children.

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.260
This is gonna give you all of
the children of that particular element.

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.420
We're gonna grab the first
one cuz node.children,

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.956
this one right here,
this is always going to give you a list.

11
00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:49.980
Even if there's 1 even if there's 0 it's
always going to give you a list of them.

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.610
So we always get the first one, which is
what this 0 is going to do right there.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.523
And we're going to say
.classlist.add gone.

14
00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:10.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

15
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.940
This is going to go grab the mole,
which actually,

16
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.830
if you remember correctly,
gives you the hole, I think.

17
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.970
Yeah, so the hole is this div right here.

18
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.220
When we're asking for node.children 0,

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.990
the thing that we're actually gonna
get back is the image tag here.

20
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.330
Which is what we actually want.

21
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.067
And we're gonna break.
