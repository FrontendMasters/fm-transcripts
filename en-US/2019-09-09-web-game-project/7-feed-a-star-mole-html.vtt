00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna start up here with a section or

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.030
you could have it be a div,
it doesn't really matter.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.661
And I'm just going to call it bg for
background.

4
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.719
And this is gonna be where
I put my background.

5
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:24.675
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In here, I'm gonna have
a bunch of what I called whole containers.

6
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:33.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gave them each an ID.

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.050
So let's just do that,

8
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:46.456
an ID of equal to something like, hole-0.

9
00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:50.690
Remember from Jen's class that an idea
is unique for each one of these, right.

10
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.520
So each one of them is going to be
hole zero, hole one, hole whatever.

11
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.931
And Inside of that, stadium,

12
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:07.980
put that on the whole container,
put that on the image.

13
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.330
I have multiple divs here, okay.

14
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.430
So inside of that I have another
div that's going to be the hole,

15
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.624
class = "hole".

16
00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:25.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The id = "hole-0".

17
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.805
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here inside
of that, I'm gonna have an image.

18
00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:41.659
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, this is gonna be
an image, and right now I'm just gonna put

19
00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.599
into something like mole-hungry or
something like that.

20
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's all just gonna be mole.

21
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.964
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now I need 12 of these.

22
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:07.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is a lot
of copying and pasting, right?

23
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.990
So I could sit here and copy and
paste this a bunch, and then go back and

24
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.990
change all the numbers.

25
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.910
Let's just go ahead and grab it from,
rather than sit here and

26
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.970
write all of it out, we have mole.html.

27
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.281
I am going to grab it from out of here.
