00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we have this new status
up here that we need to take care of.

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.410
Which is, what happens after a moles fed?

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.715
What's its next state,
after we show the happy face for a mole,

4
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:22.030
what should I do next?

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.430
Yeah, so isn't it the same thing as sad,

6
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.760
in the sense of like, it does the exact
same action afterwards, right?

7
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.250
It goes to leaving, you show the same
leaving you get the same interval.

8
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.560
So we can actually just reuse
this case right here, right?

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.720
So, we can just say case fed right there.

10
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.230
And now we can just reuse all
the logic here, which is quite nice.

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.226
So now, hopefully.

12
00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:03.975
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: mole.node
children is undefined.

13
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:07.735
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Class list.

14
00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:20.856
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's curious,
I wonder if, Inspect Element.

15
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So $0.

16
00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So x.remove.

17
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.520
This was a very subtle bug.

18
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.040
So, class list has a method
called remove to remove a class.

19
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.386
A DOM node also has a method called
remove which removes itself from the DOM.

20
00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:52.020
So I was calling a different remove
method then I was actually anticipating I

21
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.650
was going to call.

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.240
So that's why it was
coming up as undefined.

23
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.010
That's a tough one.

24
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.660
That's pretty subtle.

25
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.790
Normally if you called
the function on something,

26
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.780
you would not expect to accidentally have
a same method called the same thing.

27
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.240
Okay, so now save,refresh, this should
just work the way we were anticipating it.

28
00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see there
it's fed and then it goes away.

29
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.036
This gets fed and it goes away.

30
00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.898
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's all working, right?

31
00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:27.205
Good stuff?
