00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we're going to make it,
so that these,

2
00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:07.027
the moles kind of sit a little bit
better into the center of their holes.

3
00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:10.754
So we're gonna say in the whole
container which if you remember,

4
00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:12.528
the whole was the initiative.

5
00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:17.055
The whole container was the outer div and
you'll find with CSS.

6
00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:20.177
This is often something that you need to
do that you need to have like an outer

7
00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:20.682
and inner.

8
00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:24.612
Just to kinda get things to sit correctly
and be able to do the styling correctly.

9
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:25.844
There's nothing wrong with that.

10
00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.555
Feel free to always add
container div just so

11
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.860
you can get everything set
the way that you want it to.

12
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.569
So I'm gonna say, I want a whole
container to take 25% of the page and

13
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:40.233
the reason being as I wanna have,

14
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:44.824
right now I have six on one
line of foreign and other line.

15
00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:48.045
I wanna have 442.

16
00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:51.385
So that's what this with 25% is gonna do.

17
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.175
I'm gonna say display flex,
justify content center and

18
00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:02.581
align items center to get the mole to
sit in the middle of its hole container.

19
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.826
So now what we should do is
when we refresh the page,

20
00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:08.347
it should be four of them online and they
should be roughly centered on the page.

21
00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:13.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So already this is
looking better and better, right?

22
00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:21.572
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good so far?

23
00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:26.387
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where did you put
the hole-container in your HTML?

24
00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:28.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
here's the hole-container.

25
00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:30.688
Inside the hole-container is a hole.

26
00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:31.895
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For every hole, okay.

27
00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:32.395
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

28
00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:37.024
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
inside of that is the image.

29
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.301
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it preferable to
do that versus make like a row and

30
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:50.821
use flex box for that?

31
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.225
So like a row contains,
the first two contain four holes and

32
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:56.142
the last one contains two holes.

33
00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.198
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's totally up to you.

34
00:01:57.198 --> 00:02:02.210
That's an absolutely
valid decision to make.

35
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.318
And then if you didn't
employ that strategy,

36
00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.868
you could have the two in the middle and

37
00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:12.667
you'd have more granular control
over the organization of the holes.

38
00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.070
In this case, I'm just saying
flex box to do whatever you want.

39
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.903
I don't really care.

40
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.937
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Started out in
a single line, right, vertically,

41
00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:32.383
then you do something to tell it to go
horizontal or that was part of the.

42
00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:34.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that was here.

43
00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.101
The background has display flex on it and

44
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.751
flex wrap allowed it to go
on to multiple lines here.

45
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:45.234
Because each one of this takes 25%
of the line, because 25, 25, 25.

46
00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.985
And once it reach a 100%,
then it wraps to the next line.

47
00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:51.627
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So much easier than doing
the rows like I was trying to thing to do,

48
00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:52.168
so yeah.

49
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:57.363
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, this is just a quick
and easy way to do it for sure, okay?

50
00:02:57.363 --> 00:03:03.492
So now I do wanna get these moles
are still a little off-center, right?

51
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:06.122
So I want them to sit
a little bit more centered.

52
00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:12.301
So I'm just gonna say
mole position relative.

53
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:15.272
So relative position means like
you're going to start here and

54
00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:17.804
then I want you to go in some direction,
some amount.

55
00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:24.119
So I'm gonna say, start where you are and
then just move yourself right 30 pixels.

56
00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.673
So all of these are going to shift to the
right, from the right, rather 30 pixels.

57
00:03:28.673 --> 00:03:30.820
So they're just going to
go a little bit more and

58
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.764
they're gonna hopefully look centered.

59
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.283
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now they look more centered, right?

60
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:43.244
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this looks a little bit better, right,

61
00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:49.104
cuz now their little paws look like
they're like gripping outside the hole.

62
00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.653
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just have to say my
favorite part of about this is the king

63
00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:57.038
moles have little rings on their claws.

64
00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:59.157
I just think thatâ€™s the best, personally.
