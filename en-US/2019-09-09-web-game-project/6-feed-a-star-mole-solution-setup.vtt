00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:07.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we're gonna work on the
solution to the Whack-A-Mole project, or

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.058
Feed-A-Star-Mole project.

3
00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:10.950
[LAUGH] Cuz we're humanitarians here.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.179
So I'm gonna close out all of this and

5
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.677
go back to the Frontend Masters
bootcamp website, and

6
00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm gonna go back to
the Feed-A-Star-Mole project here and

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.384
I'm gonna download the zip file,
whatever that was.

8
00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:35.636
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here,
grab them here at the bottom.

9
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:38.183
[SOUND] Mole that's it.

10
00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:43.676
Okay, so if I'll,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.680
then, just going to open it here.

12
00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:50.254
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just put
that on my desktop.

13
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
open it in Visual Studio code.

14
00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so you can see
here you should have a bunch of images.

15
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.100
And then I also have my CSS and
my HTML and my JS in here.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.680
So that you can kind of reference
it as you're building this as well.

17
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.220
I'm gonna create new files here.

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.564
So I'm gonna call this one, index.html.

19
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.097
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Put html colon 5 in here.

20
00:01:32.862 --> 00:01:33.612
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

21
00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:41.675
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And let's just go ahead and

22
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:46.256
open this in,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here.

23
00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:54.485
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Desktop&gt;
mole-game&gt; index.html.

24
00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.624
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
you don't see anything over there yet.

25
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have this big
project in front of you, right?

26
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.320
This is a decently complicated game
that you have to deal with elements like

27
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.790
time and clicks and a bunch of kind of
interactions in that particular sense,

28
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.720
you have to keep track of the score.

29
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.340
So, it's kinda like standing at the base
of the mountain looking up is how,

30
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.346
what am I going to do from here,
how do I get up the mountain?

31
00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:26.210
And kind of what I've
alluded to previously,

32
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.270
it's much better to rather than try
to climb the mountain all at once.

33
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.860
It's better to like, make it into smaller
hills that you just have to climb

34
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.110
a small hill, solve one problem and
then move on to the next problem.

35
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.820
There's many, many ways you can
kind of attack this problem.

36
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.070
I'm just the way that my brain thinks,
I'm much better if all of the HTML and

37
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.199
CSS is in relatively good order
before I start on the JavaScript.

38
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.992
So let's go ahead and
start with something like that.
