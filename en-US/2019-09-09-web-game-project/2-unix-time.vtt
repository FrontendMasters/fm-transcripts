00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: date.now this is going to
be a very, very, very useful function for

2
00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:08.309
you that you're going
to have to get used to.

3
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.288
date.now, if I call like that,
gives me how many

4
00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:18.876
milliseconds it's been since January 1,
1970.

5
00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:21.040
For real, that's actually what it does.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.050
Why January 1st, 1970?

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.830
That's called the UNIX time or
UNIX Epoch time.

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.054
Whenever they invented UNIX,
they just decided,

9
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:33.030
we're gonna track time since 1970.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.790
So every programming language tracks
time this way, it's not just JavaScript.

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.010
So this is gonna be useful for

12
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.620
you because every time you call you can
see that this is constantly increasing.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.300
This is giving me whatever time
my computer thinks it is, right?

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.976
So that means, if I wanna say then

15
00:00:55.976 --> 00:01:00.987
equals date.now
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

16
00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:05.046
then we'll wait like five more seconds and
then I'm going to say, okay,

17
00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:07.280
how many seconds has it been since then?

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.532
I'm gonna say date.now minus then.

19
00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:13.287
Right?

20
00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:17.677
And I'm going to see that
it's been roughly about 12

21
00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:22.160
seconds since I started tracking them,
right?

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.610
So this is how you're going to track how
much time has transpired since last time

23
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.630
you called the function.

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.518
You're gonna use date.then and

25
00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:33.100
then you're going to minus
whatever date.now was back then.
