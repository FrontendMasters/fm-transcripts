00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the next case is going to be leaving.

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.891
What happens if a mole is leaving?

3
00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So mole.next is gonna be,
how long should a mole be gone?

4
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.814
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, I think in my case,
I did 2 to 20 seconds, right?

5
00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:21.668
You don't want it to show
up immediately again,

6
00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.314
because that would not be a very fun game.

7
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:27.290
But you don't want it to be gone for
much more than about 20 seconds or

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.630
the game gets boring pretty quickly.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.635
So let's write another function
up here called function

10
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:39.580
getGoneInterval, and
we're gonna return Date.now.

11
00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Plus and then we want
some sort of random interval, right?

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.460
We don't want to show up at the exact
same time every single time.

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.760
We want to have them kind of be spaced
out and a little unpredictable, right?

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.466
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say Math.floor(Math.random() *,

15
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:04.330
and like I said I said 2 to 20 seconds.

16
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.164
So we're going to do times 18000, right?

17
00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:15.950
18000 would be 18 seconds, right?

18
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.827
+

19
00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:30.040
2000.

20
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.462
So this is doing this math first,
which is Math.random() *18, which,

21
00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:43.616
if you want to see what that looks like
it's gonna be Math.random() *18000.

22
00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:51.160
So notice that's coming back with various
numbers between 0 and 18000, okay?

23
00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:57.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then if I do Math.floor,

24
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's going to round

25
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.500
a number down.

26
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.553
Put that in there.

27
00:02:08.553 --> 00:02:11.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make it a little bigger.

28
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.091
So notice that now here we
get nice integers, right?

29
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.022
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is gonna be
some number between 0 and 18000.

30
00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:26.689
And then we're just adding
2000 to it to make sure

31
00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.690
that we're always gonna be gone for
at least two seconds.

32
00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.053
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
a little bit of convoluted math there but,

33
00:02:39.053 --> 00:02:45.251
basic gist of get gone interval returns
a random number between 2000 and 20000.
