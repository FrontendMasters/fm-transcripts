00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.727
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Hopefully,

2
00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:04.024
everybody got their database set up
in their environment variable file.

3
00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:07.444
So, yeah, once you get that set up,
you might try to run the app and

4
00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.176
you'll see that it's broken.

5
00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:13.208
Well, the objective today is to fix that,
so it's broken intentionally.

6
00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:18.149
But before we dive into the app,
as I promised, I'm gonna show you how to

7
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.968
set up a Next.js app from scratch,
it's actually pretty simple.

8
00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:26.670
So without further ado, let's do that.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.670
I'm gonna just make a new
window here in my terminal.

10
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.886
And the simple way to do
this is just to do NPX.

11
00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:39.016
If you don't know what NPX is,
I don't know the best way to describe it,

12
00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:42.745
it's like there's global packages
you can download from NPM and

13
00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:46.494
you just don't want to download them,
you just wanna use them.

14
00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:48.694
NPX allows you to do that, essentially.

15
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.560
So I can say NPX and
I can say Create Next App.

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.168
So if I were to do this,
this would create a Next app.

17
00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:59.594
But just to give you a little more tips
on what you could do to make this better,

18
00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:01.648
we are today gonna be
using a Canary version.

19
00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:05.051
So I'm just gonna say Canary, even though
this doesn't matter because we're not

20
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.455
gonna use this app that we're scaffolding
right now, but just letting you know and

21
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:11.304
then typically the directory in
which you want to install this app.

22
00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:14.762
So if I wanted to install this
app in a directory called TODOs,

23
00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.424
then I would put TODOs here.

24
00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:21.228
So this is gonna create a Next.js app
on the Canary branch inside a folder

25
00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:23.356
on my computer called TODOs.

26
00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:27.860
So if I do that, it's like,
yeah, do you wanna install that?

27
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.548
I'm like, yes, and then it starts
asking me all these questions.

28
00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:33.140
Do you want TypeScript?

29
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.237
I don't know why you
would not use TypeScript,

30
00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:37.212
because you don't have to use the types.

31
00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:38.604
Do you want ESLint?

32
00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:39.924
I absolutely do.

33
00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:41.356
Do you want Tailwind?

34
00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:47.010
I don't know if this installs Tailwind
4 or 3, but yeah, I want Tailwind.

35
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.994
This one is asking if you want to embed
your whole app in the source directory.

36
00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:56.370
Some people like that, especially if
you have like monorepos and stuff.

37
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.618
I hate that, so I'm gonna [LAUGH] Say no.

38
00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.536
App Router, we'll talk more about
App Router, but always, yes,

39
00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:08.282
don't use anything else but App Router
unless you are already in a legacy Next.js

40
00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:10.090
app that has a Pages router.

41
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.990
But if you're building one from scratch,
always use the App Router.

42
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.198
I know, Next.js 13 has a bad rep
with bad rep with the App Router.

43
00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:20.606
People hated it, but 15 is so much better.

44
00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.673
It's come a long way.

45
00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:25.222
Give it a chance, guys, stop hating
just use [LAUGH] The App Router,

46
00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:26.910
it's actually really good.

47
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.566
Okay, Turbopack,
Turbopack has come a long way.

48
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.047
If you don't know what that is,
it's like they ditched Webpack and

49
00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:36.529
they made Webpack again, but
in rust and it's called Turbopack and

50
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.920
it's actually way faster,
but it's not compatible.

51
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.976
As far as I know, it's not compatible
with production deployment on Vercel.

52
00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:47.926
So because of that we're not gonna use it,
but in Dev Mode it's pretty good.

53
00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:50.960
But you also lose out on tons of
compatibility with tons of things.

54
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.000
So no, don't use that.

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.648
This is just some
typescript aliasing stuff.

56
00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:57.496
And then there you go.

57
00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:01.968
It'll just go off and
install all these things.

58
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:05.136
And typically, from here you don't really
need to do anything, you're pretty set up.

59
00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.794
There's like one thing that
I do from here and I'll show

60
00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:11.653
you it's just one thing that I have to do,
otherwise I'll go absolutely crazy.

61
00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:16.744
The only thing I do from here is I
just make a prettier file because

62
00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:22.580
if I don't do this, my prettier
extension will freak out prettierrc.

63
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.640
And I hate semicolons, so
I always put semi false, can't stand them.

64
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.610
And I also like single quotes, so I put
single quotes, that's just my preference.

65
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.386
Once I have that, you're pretty much good,
you can start this thing up.

66
00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.266
You can see what you get.

67
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:47.946
So I'm gonna do NPM, run dev that'll
start this up on 3000 by default.

68
00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:50.658
It'll launch a new one if
that port is already taken.

69
00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:52.550
So we can go there and see what we got.

70
00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.171
And you get this, you get a nice Next.js
website that points to the docs has

71
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:06.092
a button here that gets you set up with
deploying it, everything that you need.

72
00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:10.140
So pretty simple, just a tour of
what you get when you go through.

73
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.953
I don't wanna spoil it too much since
we're gonna talk about a lot of this

74
00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:17.766
stuff, but essentially just gives you
a single index page, a layout for

75
00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.285
that page to be rendered in.

76
00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:25.556
And we'll talk about layouts a lot and
some default CSS for the dark theme.

77
00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.882
And then obviously, it set up Tailwind for
me cuz I said set up Tailwind, so

78
00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.968
it went ahead and did all of that.

79
00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:35.560
But other than that,
pretty basic, pretty simple.

80
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.480
They are using, this is Tailwind 4, nice.

81
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.200
Yeah, this is Tailwind 4.

82
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.440
So they do use Tailwind 4, that's great.

83
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.776
So other than that, yes, pretty basic,
really great way to get started.

84
00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:49.534
I feel like it's a good blend
of not doing too much, but

85
00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:53.440
it's mostly like for
the configuration side, right?

86
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.176
Like for the Tailwind and
the ESLint and stuff like that.

87
00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.736
If you look at Next.js,
it's literally just three files here.

88
00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:04.176
They didn't really do much on
the Next.js side, so pretty good though.

89
00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:06.200
But that's probably,
the best way to get started with next.js.
