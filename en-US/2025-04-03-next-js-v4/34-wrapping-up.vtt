00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.169
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I think we covered all
the things that I wanted to cover,

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.203
what's last then is just for
me kind of just to go through and

3
00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:09.539
tell you some of the next things I
think you should be looking at and

4
00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.296
what you should maybe build or
learn with Next.js.

5
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:17.476
Because what I taught you here was
probably like somewhere between 65

6
00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:23.257
to 75% of everything, but that is like
all you would need to build anything,

7
00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.896
everything else is like
special use cases for.

8
00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:29.990
Nobody's gonna use 100% of Next.js,
so that's not the goal,

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.967
most of the time you're sitting at like 60
to 70% of what they offer you because it

10
00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.508
does such a good job, and everything
else is just like specialized stuff.

11
00:00:37.508 --> 00:00:41.389
So you know more than enough to build
something, but I wanna go through and

12
00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:45.518
kind of just talk about just some of the
things that I've learned that I think is

13
00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:46.356
really cool.

14
00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:51.330
So I've talked about this a little bit,
but definitely look up fluid

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.134
compute with Next.js,
they have a whole video and animations and

16
00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:01.350
graphics, talking about it, so
highly recommend checking that out.

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.944
It's really cool, I recommend looking
into serverless databases a little more,

18
00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:08.432
if you don't have that, if you're gonna
be deploying on Vercel with Next.js,

19
00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:11.246
you definitely wanna look into
having a serverless database.

20
00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:14.626
You're gonna run into problems,
I was one of the first,

21
00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.515
like I remember when AWS
launched Serverless and

22
00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:21.868
at that conference in Vercel or
I'm sorry, that conference in Vegas.

23
00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:24.862
And I tried it like, this is really cool,

24
00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:29.911
this was back in like 2016,
2017, something like that, and

25
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.956
then we got absolutely bodied by our,
we were using Mongo database.

26
00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:37.901
The fact that like we just could not have
a database connection in a serverless

27
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:39.836
environment, so
it was kind of like pointless.

28
00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:45.860
And then we made an express server whose
job was to sit in front of our MongoDB and

29
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.274
use HTTP as a mechanism to
transport database commands.

30
00:01:50.274 --> 00:01:54.157
So we made a serverless database and
it was really bad because we didn't know

31
00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:58.474
how to make databases, but it's funny
that that's how these products are today.

32
00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:01.927
It's like billion dollar products that
are serverless databases which are HTTPs

33
00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:05.230
sitting in front of a database, so
highly recommend looking into a serverless

34
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.490
database if you're gonna be using
Next.js and Vercel, things like that.

35
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.611
Other things to look into would be,
everything else is pretty straightforward,

36
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:20.668
I think, I don't think
there's anything that's like,

37
00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:24.780
super crazy with Next.js, let me think.

38
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.624
Everything is pretty straightforward,
I think the documentation is really good,

39
00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:30.842
all the other stuff is so
unique and so specific,

40
00:02:30.842 --> 00:02:34.316
I don't think you really need to look
into it unless you have the problem.

41
00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:39.158
So from here, I would say find a project
that challenges you enough that

42
00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:43.999
you definitely can't do it without
looking things up, getting help,

43
00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.398
doing some research, and
like, go build that.

44
00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:50.408
Go build a full stack thing,
cause like, now you have to,

45
00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:54.190
like you took this course, but
now you have to solidify what you learn.

46
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.105
And the best way to do that,
I think, is like,

47
00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:58.416
just, you gotta go make
something as fast as possible,

48
00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:02.070
otherwise you'll just forget a lot of the
stuff because it's muscle memory, right?

49
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.488
So go make something, go make something
cool, something you always wanted to do,

50
00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:11.018
and use Next.js, use Vercel and have
fun, and that's pretty much how I learned.

51
00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:15.194
I just started making stuff, I started
getting into the GitHub comments,

52
00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:19.567
I started looking at the docs, started
talking to the people making this, and

53
00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:22.578
next thing, it's like,
I can't live without it.

54
00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:28.331
So pretty cool framework and yeah, that's
all that I have, well, thanks for coming,

55
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:34.016
hope you guys feel empowered to go forward
with Next.js and build really cool stuff.

56
00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:37.798
If you end up building some cool stuff,
tag me, we'd love to see it,

57
00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:41.646
love to give feedback if you need any,
but yeah, I mean, the path is go

58
00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:46.840
build something slightly uncomfortable,
not too crazy, just slightly crazy.

59
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.830
And progressively get harder and harder
and harder, and next thing you know,

60
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.534
you'll know this stuff pretty well,
so thanks for coming, thank you.

61
00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:58.804
