00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.778
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's do it.

2
00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:09.198
Go to our Mode here.

3
00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:14.400
Okay, that clearly wasn't the place to
put that form cuz it looks bad [LAUGH].

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200
So we can figure out where to put
it later, it's not a problem.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.728
Let's just test the functionality.

6
00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:24.612
So if I say,
I think I already use this one,

7
00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:29.210
user@user.com password.

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.138
Let's just see if the validation works.

9
00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:33.977
So I think the password says,

10
00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:38.870
there has to be a minimum on the password,
I think.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.070
Password, where is that?

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.976
Thought I had a minimum on the password.

13
00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:50.517
I think it's server side maybe, let's see.

14
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.405
Yep, I do.

15
00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.686
So password minimum has to be at least 6.

16
00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:57.302
So we can test that.

17
00:00:57.302 --> 00:01:02.550
So if I say like admin,
admin, I click Sign up.

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.982
Boom, validation failed,
password must be at least 6.

19
00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:10.650
So I know that that actually hit
the server cuz that's a server validation,

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.390
that happens on the server side.

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.110
Just to show you that it
happens on the server side.

22
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.805
You can see that there was
a route here for post sign up.

23
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:24.176
Wait, I didn't do that, did you do that?

24
00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:26.288
I didn't do that,
I didn't make a route for that.

25
00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:28.100
That's the server,
that's the action, right?

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.984
So now let me go to signUp inside of here.

27
00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:38.704
Let's put a log in here.

28
00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:48.593
Do you think I'm gonna see this
in the console in the browser or

29
00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.837
in the logs on the terminal?

30
00:01:50.837 --> 00:01:52.658
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Terminal.

31
00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:55.887
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right.

32
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.510
Cool, here from the server,
it's running on the server.

33
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.960
user@user.com, admin, admin.

34
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.719
Boom, okay, right here.

35
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:22.739
It made a request,
made a post request 2/signup.

36
00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.799
Here's the Payload, it's a form data.

37
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.164
It submitted a form.

38
00:02:31.788 --> 00:02:33.847
It has to cross the network.

39
00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:38.230
This is no way for
it to not do that, that makes sense?

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.131
In the case of a form action, it's always
just submitting to the route that you're

41
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.002
on cuz that's just how forms submit.

42
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:49.690
Forms submit to the route that they're
on unless you give a different action.

43
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.906
If you use a server action not as a form
action, then it has to make a route.

44
00:02:56.906 --> 00:02:58.145
Yes.

45
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:04.017
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are server actions in NextJS
the same as actions and loaders in Remix?

46
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.097
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I have no idea,
I've never used Remix a day in my life, so

47
00:03:07.097 --> 00:03:08.778
I couldn't tell you, maybe.

48
00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:15.124
Not even gonna lie,
never used it, looks cool though.

49
00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:16.988
Let me see if I can figure
out actually where this goes.

50
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.420
So it's not ugly cuz it's bothering me.

51
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.834
I think it goes into here maybe.

52
00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.743
Yeah, so much better.

53
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:30.082
I was off just by a little bit.

54
00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:33.427
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you have
any recommendations for

55
00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:36.670
type safety with server actions?

56
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.667
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It should be the same
as type checking any function you've

57
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.652
ever made because they're just functions.

58
00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:46.371
So there shouldn't be
anything new you have to do.

59
00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:49.150
I'm just a typescript hater.

60
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.798
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well, it looks like too
you're importing the type from your

61
00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.562
auth.ts, so
it's the same type in both places.

62
00:03:56.562 --> 00:03:57.850
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right.

63
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It lives in one spot,
which is nice.

64
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.530
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, so yeah, this thing.

65
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.066
I don't know why this
thing is freaking out.

66
00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:09.950
Well, other than that,
as soon as I see this, I don't care.

67
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.356
[LAUGH] Before we move on to
actually fetching the data,

68
00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:16.698
I forgot we didn't actually
hook up our sign in page.

69
00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:20.051
But it's essentially
the same thing as a sign up.

70
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:25.219
So let's just get that
filled out right quick.

71
00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.699
Code's already in here.

72
00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.811
Yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.

73
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:36.439
So get our use client, get our imports,
it's gonna bring those in here.

74
00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.745
It's really nothing new to learn
here other than what we just did for

75
00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:41.475
the sign up.

76
00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:45.376
So not missing out on anything,
I just want your app to work.

77
00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:50.847
So I'm just gonna copy that stuff and

78
00:04:50.847 --> 00:04:54.723
I'm gonna hope I put
the form in the right place.

79
00:04:54.723 --> 00:05:00.333
Again, which I think is,

80
00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:07.731
let's see, where would that go?

81
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:09.099
There it goes here.

82
00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:13.188
Let's find out.

83
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.046
Use client rest and replace index.

84
00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:25.336
I put it in the wrong place, my bad.

85
00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:35.040
There we go and then I need to
camel case my sign in method.

86
00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.390
There we go, you might have to do
that if you were following my pushes.

87
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.691
These are either change
them camel case here or

88
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.764
change the imports to not be camel case.

89
00:05:44.764 --> 00:05:47.055
Whichever one you wanna do.

90
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.743
And there we go, there's Sign in.

91
00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:53.598
Okay, so Sign up, Sign in.

92
00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:54.533
Looking good.
