00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What is Next JS?

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.248
So I'm guessing everyone here probably
hasn't used Next JS in production.

3
00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:09.888
Maybe you've dabbled with it, maybe you've
seen some videos, things like that.

4
00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:12.480
So I'm just going to give you my
definition of what Next JS is.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.664
It's not wrong, it's not right.

6
00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:18.496
It's just my opinion after using it for
years now at this point.

7
00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:22.627
But the way I like to think about it is
that if you think of React is a UI library

8
00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:26.450
and not a framework,
Next JS is the framework that uses React.

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.098
And it's great for
building hybrid applications.

10
00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:32.450
So we'll build that definition
of what a hybrid application is.

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.281
But essentially I think of like a hybrid
application is like it's an application

12
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:41.962
that is both, kinda like bleeds between
a static website with static pages.

13
00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:46.169
So like going to a marketing site, but
also an application that's doing like

14
00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:49.658
dynamic things on the client,
but also things on the server.

15
00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:56.770
So and how that happens is very fluid with
Next JS, especially with this new version.

16
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.330
So it makes it really easy to do that.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.642
You could do all of this without Next JS.

18
00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:06.423
You can use React, but you're just going
to be building a lot of your own opinions

19
00:01:06.423 --> 00:01:09.234
and framework around React
to do a lot of this.

20
00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.678
So Next JS gives you a lot of stuff for
free.

21
00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.308
So let's get started.

22
00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:19.522
So first thing is make sure
you have Node JS at least 20.

23
00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:21.578
I haven't tested this below 20.

24
00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:24.562
It might work on 18 if you like bun.

25
00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:26.810
It works on BUN as well.

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.770
But just to keep it consistent and
everything, I decided to just use Node 20.

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.810
So make sure you have that.

28
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.610
If you don't have Node version 20,
I have a link here.

29
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.970
You can click and
install it from the website.

30
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.216
But honestly, you should probably use NVM
if you're going to be using Node going

31
00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:45.802
forward, just use
NVM Node Version Manager.

32
00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:49.476
I just have the link here to Node JS
because it's just simpler to install.

33
00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:53.356
But if you are serious about it,
you should definitely use NVM, I think.

34
00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:56.700
Let me actually show you what you're
going to be doing versus just like.

35
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.612
So here it is.

36
00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:58.692
Here's the static pages.

37
00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:00.620
It's mode.

38
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.960
We got our features,
we got our pricing page, we have our FAQ.

39
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.900
These are all static pages.

40
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.430
And then to sign up I'm
going to click sign up here.

41
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.383
I'm going to put an email.

42
00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:18.975
Password.

43
00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.596
Cool.
Then once you get into that,

44
00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.882
you'll see something that looks like this.

45
00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:28.702
The features that we'll be
building look pretty simple.

46
00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:30.166
You can create an issue.

47
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:35.350
So, hello, hello, got an issue here.

48
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.395
Can create that, and then you
should see the issue, and then from

49
00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:46.112
there you can click on the issue,
you can edit it, Change some things..

50
00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:55.680
Edit successful, and
then you can delete the issue as well.

51
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.437
So basic crud stuff,
nothing too complicated, but

52
00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:02.447
it's going to give you a tour of all
the things that Next JS provides for you,

53
00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:06.890
which is way different than any
other framework you might have used.

54
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.362
Yeah, and there's a lot of stuff
happening in the background.

55
00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:15.386
Like, I'm doing a lot of delaying to
show off, like the loading states.

56
00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:17.794
So if you think like,
damn, that was really slow,

57
00:03:17.794 --> 00:03:19.658
it's because I'm delaying it a lot.

58
00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:21.834
So you can see the loading states and
things like that.

59
00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.842
So there's a lot of stuff happening in the
background that you don't see in the app.

60
00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.978
But the app itself is pretty basic.

61
00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.149
Okay, so, yeah.

62
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:32.882
Pull down this repo, clone it,
and then down an NPM install.

63
00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:36.818
Like I said, if you want to use bun, you
can use bun, but there's a package lock.

64
00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:38.316
There's.
I think there's also a button lock in

65
00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:40.762
there because I accidentally use bun,
because I use BUN for everything.

66
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.106
But for the course,
I'm just going to use NPM.

67
00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:46.674
So NPM install all the packages.

68
00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:50.011
And then for the first lesson, because
technically we're on lesson two right now,

69
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:52.346
we're actually going to start
writing code on lesson 3.

70
00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:56.714
So you can check out to 03, that's
the branch you want to check out to.

71
00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:59.956
That'll start you off kind
of like the beginning.

72
00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.060
There will be some code
that's already done in there.

73
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.548
Like, I'm not gonna sit here and walk
you guys how to use tailwind classes and

74
00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:07.724
things like that.

75
00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:09.916
So, like, a lot of this stuff
is already gonna be done.

76
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.356
We're just gonna focus on
the Next JS specific stuff.

77
00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:16.620
So in order to get a complete app,
there is gonna be some code already there.

78
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.190
But no worries, we'll go through,

79
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.180
like how to like start a next JS app
from scratch and things like that.

80
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.020
So you can kinda get a vibe from that.

81
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.729
But to build the app,

82
00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.344
there will just be this repo that already
has some things already done for you.

83
00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:31.034
So I'm actually just
going to do that as well.

84
00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:35.770
Let me stop this checkout.

85
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.018
There we go.

86
00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:40.352
And then the important thing here is
getting set up is that we're going to need

87
00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:41.874
some environment variables.

88
00:04:41.874 --> 00:04:44.042
If you look in the project.

89
00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:49.710
There is a ENV example and
there's two environment variables in here.

90
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.362
If you don't know what
environment variables are,

91
00:04:53.362 --> 00:04:56.900
these are just dynamic variables that
can be injected server side to your

92
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.204
application that's running on the server.

93
00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:02.516
This is how you keep things secret and
not put them in your repo.

94
00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:05.268
So you typically have a ENV file.

95
00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:09.668
So this example files are showing you what
you need to put in your own ENV file.

96
00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:12.668
So make your own ENV file like I did here.

97
00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:15.348
And you have to add these
two environment variables.

98
00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.028
And don't worry about the database URL.

99
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:20.344
We're going to walk through how to set
that up if you don't have a database and

100
00:05:20.344 --> 00:05:21.210
things like that.

101
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.890
But just make a ENV file and two things.

102
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.170
So the JWT secret, you don't
really need to know what this is.

103
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.554
This is just for authentication.

104
00:05:31.554 --> 00:05:35.551
We will be covering authentication, but
we won't be going into the specifics of

105
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:39.106
authentication because it has
absolutely nothing to do with Next JS.

106
00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.522
We'll just talk about the parts
that relate to Next JS.

107
00:05:41.522 --> 00:05:43.834
But for the JWT secret,
you can put whatever string you want.

108
00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:46.350
It doesn't matter,
just put whatever you want.

109
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.496
Then for the database URL,
here's where you have some options.

110
00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:52.496
They're both super easy.

111
00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:55.240
It doesn't get easier
than these two options.

112
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.873
The first one is if you just have
Postgres running locally like I do,

113
00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:03.088
just start your Postgres server,
go make a database, use that as your URL.

114
00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:04.936
And that's what I'm doing.

115
00:06:04.936 --> 00:06:09.781
On Mac, I'm using Postgres,
the app literally called Postgres, and

116
00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:13.776
then post to co,
which is something that looks like this.

117
00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:15.820
I think I have an older version of it,
so if you have it,

118
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.088
yours might look different.

119
00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:20.133
So I can go connect to my database and

120
00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:25.400
I made a database called Mode,
so I'm running one locally.

121
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.836
The second option,
which is also pretty simple,

122
00:06:27.836 --> 00:06:31.316
if you don't feel like downloading
Postgres, if you don't have it and

123
00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:34.320
setting it up and all that stuff,
is you can use a hosted one.

124
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.128
And there hasn't been
an easier way than Instagres.

125
00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:39.928
So if you go to Instagres,
you can click this link here.

126
00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:42.384
It'll bring it to this page.

127
00:06:42.384 --> 00:06:47.284
And then there is a link here that says
here in your browser, instagres.com/new

128
00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:52.250
if you click that, they're going to
check to make sure you're not a bad bot.

129
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.578
And then voila, you get a database URL.

130
00:06:54.578 --> 00:06:55.441
Just copy that.

131
00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:57.650
That's going to be your database URL.

132
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.867
This database URL is a database
hosted on a product called Neon,

133
00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:03.426
which is a Postgres.

134
00:07:03.426 --> 00:07:08.804
It's a serverless Postgres hosted
database service, essentially.

135
00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:13.797
So they just spin up a database for
you, and they basically allow

136
00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:18.380
it to expire in an hour if you
don't add it to your account.

137
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.934
So you can just keep making these
if you want, throughout the course,

138
00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:22.968
or if you don't feel like
making them after every hour,

139
00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.868
you can just click that button and
make a free NEON account and put it there.

140
00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:27.124
So you have options.

141
00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:30.520
But this is probably the simplest way
to get a database if you don't feel

142
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.884
like downloading things.

143
00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.126
Cool, once you have that,

144
00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:35.860
add that database URL to your
environment variable file.

145
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.176
Like I said, I already have mine.

146
00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.528
It is my local one.

147
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.219
Once you have that,

148
00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.528
you need to run one command to sync
your schema with your database.

149
00:07:48.528 --> 00:07:53.264
So in your terminal,
please make sure you run NPM.

150
00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:56.920
Run db:push.

151
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.820
Like this.

152
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.930
Yours won't say no changes detected.

153
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.786
It'll say changes were detected because
this is your first time pushing it up.

154
00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:07.810
But I already did this.

155
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.770
So mine says no changes detected.

156
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.717
But this is essentially syncing
your database with your schema, or

157
00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:17.130
syncing your schema with your database,
or vice versa.

158
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.842
So you need to be able to
do this to use a database.

159
00:08:18.842 --> 00:08:21.842
Once you have that, your database is set
up, you never have to touch it again.

160
00:08:21.842 --> 00:08:26.528
You're good to go until your Instagres
database connection string expires in

161
00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:30.368
an hour and you got to do this again or
add it to your NEON account.
