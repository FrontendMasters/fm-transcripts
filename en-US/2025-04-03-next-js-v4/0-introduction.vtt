00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.414
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: How's it going everybody?

2
00:00:01.414 --> 00:00:05.337
Welcome to Next.js Fundamentals with me,
your instructor,

3
00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:08.601
Scott Moss here with Frontend Masters and
the crew.

4
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.621
Happy to be back.

5
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.040
Super excited to be here.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.393
And, I mean, what a time to be
a JavaScript developer right now,

7
00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:22.108
with everything going on, especially with
Next.js, with AI and all these things.

8
00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:25.201
So, super excited about
a lot of the changes.

9
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.430
Can't wait to talk about the stuff that
the team has been working on at Vercel

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.759
with the framework, because I think
they've made some quality changes since

11
00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.289
the last time I taught this course.

12
00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.992
Specifically around caching and stuff,

13
00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:36.797
which I think is just
way more streamlined.

14
00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:40.844
So, cannot wait to talk about that and
give my opinions.

15
00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:44.511
You can take it or leave it, but a lot
of this is just based off my opinions.

16
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.538
A little more about me, if you don't
know me, obviously, my name is Scott,

17
00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:48.249
I just said that.

18
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:54.539
Currently, right now, I am co-founder
of a company called Double Zero.

19
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.921
I don't know how to describe it.

20
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.707
[LAUGH] It's funny cuz I talk
about this all the time, and

21
00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.076
now I just don't know
how to talk about it.

22
00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:03.961
It's basically an AI agent that,
let me just go look at the website.

23
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:05.934
How about that?

24
00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:09.537
So, doublezero.tech, you basically
just describe what you want done,

25
00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:10.747
and the agent will do it.

26
00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:11.737
That's literally what we do.

27
00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.856
So doing that right now, it's pretty cool.

28
00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.108
So I spent a lot of time in the AI space.

29
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:22.438
Everything I do is built with Next.js,
everything I do is built on Vercel, so,

30
00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:24.936
still pretty much involved
with a lot of that.

31
00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.295
So I have pretty strong opinions
about some of the stuff.

32
00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:27.970
Like I told Marc,

33
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.595
I don't really like to teach things
that I don't use in production.

34
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.034
If I don't have opinions on them, then I
don't feel qualified to talk about it.

35
00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:36.900
So, I'm here because I feel pretty
qualified to talk about Next.js.

36
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.647
So hopefully you can take
what I've learned and

37
00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:43.982
the mistakes that I've made and
develop your own opinions from that.

38
00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:49.201
Before that, I was a VC,
working at a VC firm in San Francisco,

39
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:53.251
investing in AI companies and
things like that.

40
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:57.707
And then before that, I was an engineer
at Netflix, where I worked on,

41
00:01:57.707 --> 00:01:59.951
literally a bunch of random ideas.

42
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:06.295
That was my job, is just to pick random
ideas to work on and work on them.

43
00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:08.313
Sometimes they got into production,
sometimes they didn't.

44
00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:09.824
Most time they didn't.

45
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:11.476
All the time they didn't.

46
00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:17.563
But [LAUGH] it was really
fun to work on random ideas.

47
00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:22.435
Cool, and yeah, now I'm just in
the trenches building a startup,

48
00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:25.682
which is my second or
third time doing it, and

49
00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:30.485
it's more painful now than it's ever been,
but also pretty fun.

50
00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:34.101
So, having a good time.

51
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.334
Enough about me,
what are we gonna be doing today?

52
00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:40.211
So today, if you've ever taken any of my
courses, you know I like to do two things.

53
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:44.477
I like to discuss high level concepts
about what I think is important for

54
00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:45.195
the topic.

55
00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:47.422
So in case of Next.js fundamentals,

56
00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:52.306
we'll be covering all the things that I
think are essential to learning Next.js.

57
00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:56.629
If you ever looked at the Next.js docs,
they actually do a really good job of,

58
00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.576
if you go look at their Getting Started
section, or how to build an app.

59
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.370
I think that actually does a really
good job of just covering the basics.

60
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.165
But I think the thing that it's missing is
that, how do you apply that to something?

61
00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:08.051
So that's what I'm doing.

62
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.841
So we're gonna be looking at a lot of
those concepts through my lens and

63
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:14.555
then applying it to something
by building an app.

64
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.505
Which for me,
I think once you get there's a difference

65
00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:22.635
between remembering something and
learning something.

66
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.760
And for me, learning something is just
like, you gotta find that zone where

67
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.242
you're building something
that's slightly uncomfortable,

68
00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.963
not too uncomfortable
you'll never achieve it.

69
00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:36.345
But slightly enough uncomfortable to where
you don't really know what you're doing,

70
00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:37.345
but you can figure it out.

71
00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:39.036
So that's kind of where we wanna be today.

72
00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:42.858
So, I'm gonna build something that is
gonna make you a little bit uncomfortable,

73
00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:46.244
but it's gonna force you to grow and
use your resources, ask questions,

74
00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:48.009
look at the notes, things like that.

75
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.592
So it shouldn't feel easy, but it's
not gonna be an impossible task to do.

76
00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:55.870
I mean, I literally have the code in the
notes, so you can see the code too, and

77
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.830
I'll be live coding.

78
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.784
And you might see me struggle, but,
yeah, that's what we'll be doing.

79
00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:03.132
We're gonna be building
this app right here.

80
00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:07.504
It's a clone of an app
that I use called linear.

81
00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:12.420
So if you've never used linear before,
it's just another issue tracking app.

82
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.402
This one is called mode.

83
00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:19.680
It's just a play on that,
we're gonna be covering everything

84
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.761
from auth to static pages,
to creating actual application,

85
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.765
API routes, server actions,
all the things.

86
00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:33.264
So, everything that I think you need
to get started with Next.js is gonna be

87
00:04:33.264 --> 00:04:37.694
covered in this course, but
we're definitely gonna cover, I would say,

88
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:41.163
a good first 65 to 75% of what
I think you need to know.

89
00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:45.168
Everything else depends on your use
case and what you're actually making,

90
00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:47.431
it doesn't actually apply to everybody.

91
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.564
So, that's gonna be my attempt today.

92
00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:55.664
And the format is going to be basically,
I have notes,

93
00:04:55.664 --> 00:05:01.296
which are definitely for you but also for
me, because I get off track a lot.

94
00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:04.420
So actually, let me go to here.

95
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.010
So if you go to the repo, which is
underneath my GitHub handle Hendrixer,

96
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.648
next.js-fundamentals.

97
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.171
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is the repo
that we will be using.

98
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:18.964
Typically, the way that I do it is,
you go to the repo and

99
00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:21.698
I have different branches for
different lessons, and

100
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:24.801
those branches kinda correlate
to the lesson that we're on.

101
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:28.941
So there's gonna be a branch where you
can check out too to start that lesson,

102
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:32.714
if you didn't follow along on
the previous one or you didn't want to.

103
00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:36.110
And then once I do some live coding and
solve it, I'll push up those

104
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.308
changes to the solution branch and you can
check that out too if you wanna catch up.

105
00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:42.168
So that's how we do it.

106
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:46.304
And then as far as the notes, in
the past I put them in Notion and stuff,

107
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:50.953
but I'm probably not gonna use Notion
anymore, cuz I don't like it anymore.

108
00:05:50.953 --> 00:05:56.503
So I decided to just put them in
Markdown files in the project.

109
00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:58.390
So they're just markdown
files in the project.

110
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.250
So this is where we'll be our notes,

111
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.714
it seems like the most
natural place to put them.

112
00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:07.660
And yeah, we'll be following these notes,
one for you, all the code that I'll

113
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.909
be writing will be in here, but
also just a way for me to stay on track.
