00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:01.743
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
all right, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:06.045
So we know about edge functions,
we know about middleware.

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:11.240
Now we need to deploy our app to Vercel,
and it's really easy to do that.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.309
Typically, when I start a project,

5
00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.871
I actually like to scaffold out the
next.js project and immediately deploy it.

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:21.716
But as you can see there's a site so
much after,

7
00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:25.475
we didn't start with
a blank app first of all.

8
00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.217
And then second of all it's like, hey,
just ignore all this stuff and just deploy

9
00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:31.012
it, I think that would have just been
kinda rude, so we're doing deploying last.

10
00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:34.335
But typically,
I do like to deploy immediately,

11
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.559
get the CICD set up immediately.

12
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.067
Because the last thing you want,
in my opinion, is to build all this stuff,

13
00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:45.657
deploy it, and now you have to debug
all the reasons why it's not deploying.

14
00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.759
If you just deployed it as
soon as you scaffolded it out,

15
00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.939
it most likely will work immediately.

16
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.043
And then at that point going forward,

17
00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:56.986
any commit that you change has to
work to deploy, or it won't work, and

18
00:00:56.986 --> 00:01:00.264
you're forced to fix it there or
ignore your deploying.

19
00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:03.989
So I like to deploy early, but
we're not deploying early,

20
00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320
we're deploying right now.

21
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.482
So the way it works is, Vercel is free,
you don't have to pay for anything.

22
00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:15.624
But you do need to make sure
you have this repo on GitHub.

23
00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:18.947
So if you haven't pushed to GitHub,
if you don't plan on pushing into GitHub,

24
00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:20.656
you probably won't be able to deploy.

25
00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:24.623
But if you do go ahead and
push this to GitHub, I would say make sure

26
00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:29.118
that you are on the main branch so
you can make your branch the main branch.

27
00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.283
Or you can just pull down my repo and
check out to the main branch,

28
00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:36.120
which is the complete version of the app.

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.122
So it's already done and
that's what I'm gonna do.

30
00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:42.038
I'm gonna checkout to main, so

31
00:01:42.038 --> 00:01:47.570
that is the full version of the app for
the most part.

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.246
Let me just close this stuff,
don't save that.

33
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.851
And yeah, let's go to Vercel,
let's do this.

34
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:57.753
I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory,
it's not really hard.

35
00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.638
It's just some gotchas, but
nothing specific to Vercel.

36
00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:03.345
That's a gotcha,
it's just deploying in general.

37
00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:05.981
So if you already know how to deploy
stuff, this might be simple, and

38
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:07.760
that's just because
Vercel makes it simple.

39
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.848
If you never deployed anything,
then you're gonna see how simple this is.

40
00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:16.152
So yeah, if you're on Vercel,
go to your personal account,

41
00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:20.034
you can click right here,
go to New Project.

42
00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:24.132
And right here is where it's going to
start to pull in your GitHub stuff.

43
00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:28.938
So on the left, you pick your GitHub
organization, your GitHub project,

44
00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:33.462
pick my personal thing here,
here it is, next.js-fundamentals.

45
00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:40.021
I'm going to import that,
my project, this project name.

46
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.866
I'm gonna keep it the same,
you can change it if you want,

47
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:42.780
I'm gonna keep it the same.

48
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.958
It already detected that
it's a Next.js app,

49
00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.361
cuz you can deploy
non-Next.js things to Vercel.

50
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.726
It doesn't have to be next.js,
they actually support a lot of stuff.

51
00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:55.310
But it detected it through many,
many different ways.

52
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.915
So it detected that.

53
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.169
Our root directory is the root,
so I'm not gonna change that.

54
00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.390
If there were any customizable commands
that I want to change here, like

55
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.025
the build command, maybe there's something
special about how I build my app,

56
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:12.121
I had to pre-process these files.

57
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.734
I have to move this file over to this
location or whatever you wanna do,

58
00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.930
you could override the command.

59
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.680
If the output directory is gonna be
different than what the default output

60
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.030
directory for next.js is,
you would put that here.

61
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.159
And if you had some special install
scripts that you needed to do,

62
00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.262
which I find I do a lot, quite often,
you would override the default install.

63
00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:39.861
So if you'd like to use Bun to install,
you can put Bun here or whatever, so

64
00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:41.694
you can change it by default.

65
00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:44.930
I think it actually looks at what lock
file you have and goes from there.

66
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.484
So for us, we have Bun and package-lock,
so I think it'll probably use NPM, but

67
00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:50.810
you can override that.

68
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.362
Environment variables,
we can add these whenever we want, but

69
00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:56.630
this is where we're gonna add
our database environment.

70
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.711
So if you didn't do the Instagres
thing yet, you have to do it now,

71
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:03.620
cuz you can't add your local database as
an environment variable on a deployed app,

72
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.789
that's not gonna work.

73
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:09.572
So I'll come back and add this,
but this is where you'll add it.

74
00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:14.206
And also, like our JWT secret,
we'll have to add that here as well, so

75
00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:15.306
you can do that.

76
00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:20.535
I'm just gonna click deploy, and
let's see if this deploys or not.

77
00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:24.860
If you didn't turn off the TypeScript
errors and ESLint errors before and

78
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.730
you have those errors,
it's not gonna deploy.

79
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.036
[LAUGH] It's gonna say, go fix those.

80
00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:36.825
So you can see right here, it's literally
running your computer in the cloud.

81
00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:40.821
It's gonna go through, do all the things,
so it's installing the CLI,

82
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:42.380
it's doing all that stuff.

83
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.185
See right here, same output that we get
when we ran the next build command to test

84
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:51.490
out that memorization,
it's doing the same thing.

85
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.503
So, a really good way to test whether or

86
00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:57.514
not your thing is gonna build is just
run the build command on your computer.

87
00:04:57.514 --> 00:05:01.812
If that breaks,
it's probably gonna break up here too.

88
00:05:01.812 --> 00:05:05.722
So there we go,
looks like something broke.

89
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:10.152
And it's the database connection string,
we need to add our environment variable,

90
00:05:10.152 --> 00:05:13.690
which was expected, I just wanted
to show you guys how that works.

91
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.456
So on the first deploy attempt,
if it doesn't deploy,

92
00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.976
there's nothing there to show you.

93
00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:22.908
But the reason I was going head and go and
do it, so we can go to the project.

94
00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:26.120
Even though it didn't deploy,
it did create a project for us.

95
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.189
So now that I have the project,
it's linked to my GitHub, and

96
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.139
all I got to do now to trigger a deploy
is just do a pull request, that's it.

97
00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.869
But let's fix the environment
variables first.

98
00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:42.736
So Instagres, we'll go here,

99
00:05:42.736 --> 00:05:45.991
copy this, go back.

100
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.121
To do that we can go to Settings, you go
to Environment Variables, I'm gonna go

101
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:54.204
down here to All Environments, you can
select different environments here.

102
00:05:54.204 --> 00:05:57.194
I'll talk about preview in a minute.

103
00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:02.417
Got database URL like this,
we'll paste that in,

104
00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:06.918
I got another one which is JWT_SECRETS or?

105
00:06:06.918 --> 00:06:10.579
Forgot what it was, yeah, JWT_SECRET.

106
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.851
So I'll copy that, and actually,

107
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:16.270
what's really cool is you
can copy this whole thing.

108
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.852
If you have tons of stuff in this file,
you can just go in here and

109
00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:24.922
hit Paste, and it'll put them all in for
you like that.

110
00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:27.136
It's pretty cool.

111
00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:28.956
I don't need two of those, though.

112
00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:32.794
And then, obviously, make a real thing
here eventually in production, but

113
00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.790
I don't really care right now.

114
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:41.131
Anything here, cookies,
cool, okay, so we got that.

115
00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:44.526
Once you add environment variables,
you have to trigger a new deploy.

116
00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:49.405
It won't just pick it up and redeploy,
even if it wasn't broke the first time.

117
00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:52.512
You can see right now it's telling me,
they added this, this is cool.

118
00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:56.118
Normally, you just have to go do it, but
now it's actually telling me to go do it.

119
00:06:56.118 --> 00:07:00.006
You can see all my environment variables
here, I can click here to reveal them,

120
00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:00.829
all that stuff.

121
00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:02.769
So I'll click Redeploy.

122
00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:05.712
I want to redeploy production main.

123
00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:09.214
Yeah, just redeploy this, please.

124
00:07:09.214 --> 00:07:12.425
And now, what I can do is I can go to the
top, click on Deployments and you can see

125
00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:15.544
right here, this will be a log of every
deployment that's ever happened and

126
00:07:15.544 --> 00:07:16.998
the status of that deployment.

127
00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:21.133
And I can just click into it and
it'll show me.

128
00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:23.713
If it deploys, we'll see it here.

129
00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:27.261
A preview of our website will
actually show up here if it deploys.

130
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.725
So we'll go through this,
ignore the warnings, see what happens.

131
00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:39.779
I mean, it built on my machine,
so it should work.

132
00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:46.242
You can also bypass Vercel building it and
build it yourself.

133
00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:49.404
And whatever CI you like,
whether that's GitHub Actions,

134
00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:52.634
or Jenkins, or whatever you like,
you can do your own build.

135
00:07:52.634 --> 00:07:56.074
And they have a CLI that you can
use to push it to Vercel, so

136
00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:58.294
there's nothing wrong with that.

137
00:07:58.294 --> 00:08:05.052
During pre-rendering, fetch rejects
to pre-render is complete, typically.

138
00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:09.029
Okay, I guess it just ignored that one,
[LAUGH] I'm guessing,

139
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:11.998
it just went on anyway, yeah, that's fine.

140
00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:14.648
We didn't need that to pre-render anyway,
and

141
00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:18.230
it looks like what it did was
it just made that page dynamic.

142
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.395
And on my main branch,
I have a button on the homepage that it'll

143
00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:28.955
change from login and sign up to go
to dashboard if you're logged in.

144
00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:31.070
So there's a Git current user
fetch on the homepage, and

145
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.648
that's what it's freaking out about.

146
00:08:32.648 --> 00:08:34.799
That's why we didn't have
that on the other branches,

147
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.060
because I didn't add that
feature on the other branches.

148
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.283
So I kinda like that.

149
00:08:39.283 --> 00:08:42.204
Sometimes I hate, some websites
you'll go to, if you're logged in,

150
00:08:42.204 --> 00:08:43.581
you can't see the landing page.

151
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.862
It automatically redirects you to the app,
and I'm like,

152
00:08:45.862 --> 00:08:47.824
I just wanna see the landing page,
I hate that.

153
00:08:47.824 --> 00:08:49.664
So I added the button where
you can do it yourself.

154
00:08:52.714 --> 00:08:56.090
Cool, okay, it built, there we go,
there's a preview of our site.

155
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.085
So if I click on it, so a couple of
things is you get a bunch of domains.

156
00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:04.626
So you get a domain per deploy, and

157
00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:09.188
then unless you add a custom domain,
it assigns you a domain.

158
00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:13.335
So in this case,
this is the domain for the branch for

159
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:17.594
the deploy, you can tell cuz
it has the word git in it.

160
00:09:17.594 --> 00:09:22.622
Git, that's git,
[LAUGH] And then this would

161
00:09:22.622 --> 00:09:28.984
be the fixed domain essentially for
this actual commit.

162
00:09:28.984 --> 00:09:35.954
Let me go to the actual domain,
this one, here we go.

163
00:09:35.954 --> 00:09:42.082
So here's the domain, it'll be the name
of your project something.vercel.app.

164
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:47.690
Then you can assign as many domains as you
want to this as you want, so I'll go here.

165
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.108
This is for sure not going to work,
because I did not migrate the database.

166
00:09:53.108 --> 00:09:55.854
So if I try to sign in and
sign up, it's gonna break.

167
00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:58.862
So what I need to do is
migrate the database.

168
00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:03.648
The simplest way to do that is
just to replace the one that you

169
00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:08.531
have here with the one that you
got from Instagres, which for

170
00:10:08.531 --> 00:10:12.966
me is not that one,
it's the one that I already have.

171
00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.465
And then you just run Drizzle on it?

172
00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:19.638
That one, yeah, say that again And
you just run Drizzle on it?

173
00:10:19.638 --> 00:10:21.545
Yep, you just run Drizzle on it, exactly.

174
00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:29.252
Cool, so I got that, and then from here,
I can just do a db:push.

175
00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:32.822
So npm run db:push.

176
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.854
Cool, my database is migrated now, simple.

177
00:10:39.854 --> 00:10:44.457
So now, I should not have to redeploy,

178
00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:49.621
I'll refresh just because superstition,

179
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:54.923
and I'll try to sign up, email@app.com,

180
00:10:54.923 --> 00:10:58.847
admin, admin, admin, admin.

181
00:10:58.847 --> 00:11:03.655
Hello, there we go, we now have
a working app deployed, super simple.
