00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's create some tests,
these are pretty boring.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.488
We're going to create one
that is specific to Next.js.

3
00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.728
All the other ones are just
straight up regular tests.

4
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.576
So let's create one specific to Next.js so
you can kind of get the vibe for that.

5
00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.658
So we'll create a test for
the dashboard page, and

6
00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:22.840
I think that'll give you
a hint on how this works.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.970
So what we'll do is we'll go to dashboard,
we'll make a new folder in here.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.302
I'm going to call it __test__,

9
00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:35.490
you don't have to do this you can
just literally just make a test file.

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.082
But I'm going to do that and

11
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:48.621
I'm going to say page.test.tsx or

12
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:51.790
sorry, .ts.

13
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.684
And it's important you do page.test for
two reasons.

14
00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:02.124
One, we only told it to pick up
things that have .test in it.

15
00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:07.291
Two, if you don't put .test,
it's going to make a route [LAUGH] called

16
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:12.040
__test__ and it's going to go here and
think that's a page.

17
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.126
Okay, so let's get our imports in here and
we'll go step by step.

18
00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:28.376
So we have some helpers here to
help us like render things and

19
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.390
then observe the screen.

20
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.591
These are the globals that I was talking
about, we don't actually have to import

21
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.478
this because I did globals too but
we're going to import it anyway.

22
00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:39.110
Here's the page that we're going to test.

23
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.758
We pull this in because this page calls
this, we're going to mock it out.

24
00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:43.758
It also calls get user so

25
00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.646
I might just delete that because
I don't feel mocking that out.

26
00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.110
And then just some types and
stuff to help us.

27
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.990
Cool, first thing is let's mock
out stuff specific to this test.

28
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.827
So we didn't add this to the global
because it's specific to this test so

29
00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:58.506
we can grab these three.

30
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.718
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This thing's freaking
out because, why are you freaking out?

31
00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:13.406
Did I set that up though,
in the config to do tsx though?

32
00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:17.050
I did, okay, I did, I did nevermind tsx.

33
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.322
All right, so
we're mocking out the library

34
00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:26.050
call to getIssues and getCurrentUser.

35
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.521
Even though we mocked out the link here,

36
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:32.770
I have one specific to this test
to mock the link out to do this.

37
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.938
And then we're mocking out the utils
call that I was using for like cn and

38
00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:41.265
like I was using one of my format a time
so we're going to mock all that out.

39
00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:50.864
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then from here we can
just describe the test that we want to do

40
00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:55.210
so in this case,
I'm going to say describe('dashboard').

41
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.688
And then what we want to do is before
each test or each assertion block,

42
00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:09.660
or in this case, each "it", we want to clear
all the mocks, as in, like reset them.

43
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.811
So beforeEach,
we want to vi.clearAllMocks() and

44
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:19.492
then we want to start writing some tests.

45
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:24.003
So the first test is going to be it
renders the issues list when issues

46
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.580
are available.

47
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.187
So,

48
00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:35.936
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I feel like I spelled,

49
00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.718
I don't always I feel like I
always feel available wrong.

50
00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.250
It's like such a weird word.

51
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.462
Cool and these can be async.

52
00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:45.809
So we'll make this async.

53
00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:51.824
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then from there we're
going to mock out these issues because

54
00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:54.382
remember, we mocked out the function,
so it's not going to do anything.

55
00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:57.690
So let's grab these fake
issues here like that.

56
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.050
We need to tell the mock that, hey, when
you are called, return these fake issues.

57
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.874
So we can do that by calling,

58
00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:10.050
hey, grab this mocked function
that we already mocked out.

59
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.436
And it's asynchronous so when it gets
resolved, resolve it with this value, so

60
00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:16.370
this array of issues.

61
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.510
So we'll do that.

62
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.010
This was already mocked out.

63
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.550
We're now saying when it resolves cuz it's
a promise, return this array of issues.

64
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.394
And the most Next.js specific part in here
is just this part right here, which is and

65
00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:39.031
I guess it's not even specific to Next.js,
it's just React Server components,

66
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:40.330
which is just this.

67
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.194
So if you want to render the component.

68
00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:46.994
Well, technically,
React Server component is just a function,

69
00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:48.866
it's not like a React component anymore.

70
00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:51.292
It's literally just a function,
an asynchronous function so

71
00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:52.810
you can just call it like a function.

72
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.980
This will render the component and

73
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.897
then from there we can actually
draw it on the screen,

74
00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:06.160
which is like this or
even shorter you could just do this.

75
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.479
You can also wrap this in a suspense and
do some stuff there as well but

76
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.604
then you'll have to await every single
one of these but that's just annoying.

77
00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:21.267
Cool, let's copy these assertions and

78
00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:25.294
we'll run this test and
see if it actually does anything.

79
00:05:25.294 --> 00:05:29.512
So I don't know why this thing is

80
00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:34.710
saying that to be in the document.

81
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.709
I think my typescript
stuff's not set up right, but

82
00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.352
pretty sure that's good we'll see.

83
00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:47.087
Yeah so we're checking to see if pretty
much does the stuff that we have here that

84
00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:49.662
we think is going to be are going
to show up on the page.

85
00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:52.790
We have an issue with test Issue 1,
test Issue 2.

86
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.702
So we think that should
show up on the page.

87
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:57.540
We think these labels should show up on
the page because we gave them the same

88
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.090
labels here.

89
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.991
All the stuff that we think should
show on the page based off this data,

90
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.926
it should be there.

91
00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:07.230
&gt;&gt; Student 1: One thing before we run,
I think the typo and

92
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.230
the vitest setup file name.

93
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.534
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Say that again.

94
00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:14.391
&gt;&gt; Student 1: The vitest.setup.ts
I think it's looking for

95
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.606
not vite like V-I-T-E test.

96
00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:17.330
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I mistyped it.

97
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.796
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I just think in your code.

98
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:20.320
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I did.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yeah, I think it's just.

99
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.580
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
let's try to test this and

100
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.576
see why that thing is messing up and
then use the npm test.

101
00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:35.600
It did mess up because it said vitest.setup.ts
does not exist... import.

102
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.704
I may have forgot to install this.

103
00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:39.590
Let me try to install this, let me see.

104
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.349
Pretty sure I installed that and

105
00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:56.338
then vitest.setup.ts that
looks about right to me.

106
00:06:56.338 --> 00:06:58.430
There we go and this time it passed.

107
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.930
So we can make sure this is working and
go in here I guess it's working now.

108
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.682
And we can say expect that to be on the
document and obviously that fails because

109
00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:13.436
that's not on the document and
here's the actual document.

110
00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:24.380
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
any questions on testing?

111
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.460
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Is there a big
difference between Vitest and

112
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.036
Jest or any other test runner?

113
00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:32.550
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't know who started
it, if it was Jasmine or Mocha or

114
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.318
one of the OG testing frameworks.

115
00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:40.254
And well, I guess they all
inherited from Ruby at some point.

116
00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:43.436
I think they all came from Ruby but
as far as Syntax goes,

117
00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:48.182
there is no JavaScript testing framework
that is gonna deviate from this syntax.

118
00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:49.582
It's just not gonna do it.

119
00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:53.859
So they all have the same syntax,
they all do the same things,

120
00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:56.854
they just do them slightly differently.

121
00:07:56.854 --> 00:07:58.497
So as far as the differences, sure,

122
00:07:58.497 --> 00:08:01.998
there's definitely differences in how
you set it up, the things you import.

123
00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:03.295
But the feel of it,

124
00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:08.256
because they all use the exact same
syntax is pretty much the same thing.

125
00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:10.606
You just got to find like what
is the Jasmine way to do this?

126
00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:12.910
What is the Jest way to do this?

127
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.094
But Jest is the same way.

128
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:15.871
You set up some describe blocks,

129
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:20.126
you can do some beforeEach, you do
some mocking, it's all the same thing.

130
00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:24.910
I just think the community
is backed Vitest.

131
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:30.082
It's faster, it's got more support and
it has better development at this point.

132
00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:35.590
So yeah, but you can use Jest if you OG,
want to use Jest, go ahead.

133
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.650
Any questions?

134
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.421
&gt;&gt; Student 2: The testing
folder name __test,

135
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:47.466
should that be or can that be plural?

136
00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:50.394
Someone's just asking if it's test or
tests plural.

137
00:08:50.394 --> 00:08:51.441
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It could
be whatever you want,

138
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.142
it's whatever you put
in your configuration.

139
00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:58.764
So for me, I'm just looking for
anything that has a .test or .spec in it.

140
00:08:58.764 --> 00:09:01.005
So it doesn't even care about this folder,

141
00:09:01.005 --> 00:09:04.316
it doesn't even see it by default,
if you don't configure it.

142
00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:06.788
I think it does look in this test file for
specs.

143
00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:09.520
But yeah,
you can call this whatever you want.

144
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.428
I just put this here because I know that
Next.js is going to pick up routes and

145
00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:18.540
I want someone on my team.

146
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.926
When they see this,
I don't want them, for instance,

147
00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:25.360
let's say we actually
had a route called test.

148
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.547
Okay, now what?

149
00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:33.336
[LAUGH] This is a route, if I see this, I
know this is not a route, this is testing.

150
00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:36.320
So that's why I do that and plural,
sure, you can make a plural if you want.
