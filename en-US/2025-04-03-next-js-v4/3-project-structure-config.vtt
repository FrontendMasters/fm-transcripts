00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:02.924
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, in this lesson,
we're just gonna talk about structure.

2
00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:07.016
Just like, how do you organize this thing?

3
00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:11.661
What are the opinions that NextJS enforces
versus the opinions that they don't

4
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:12.431
care about?

5
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:19.072
Because it is heavily opinionated and it
uses the file system for those opinions.

6
00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:23.911
Different file names, different characters
inside the file names to determine

7
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.410
different features and functionality.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.735
So, which one of those
are specific to NextJS and

9
00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:31.813
which one of those are just my own
thing and why I do those things?

10
00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:34.689
So that's mostly what
this is gonna be about.

11
00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:35.928
So let's talk about some of that stuff.

12
00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:39.871
So since next JS13, with the app router,
you now have this app directory,

13
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:42.003
that's why it's called the App router.

14
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.455
Because before next JS13,
you had a Pages directory, and

15
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.564
that's where all your routes went.

16
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:51.756
Same concept, way different syntax,
way different features.

17
00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.058
They still support it, as you saw
when I did the CLI scaffoldings.

18
00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:56.238
Do you want the app router?

19
00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:58.533
Because if you say no, you'll get Pages.

20
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:03.184
Don't do pages, it's not It.

21
00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:06.266
It's easier, don't get me wrong,
I think there's less to think about.

22
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:13.895
But with it being less to think about
comes less flexibility, less power.

23
00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:17.000
You're not taking advantage of some of the
newer stuff that a lot of platforms like

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.119
Vercel offer, so always use the App
directory if you're starting from scratch.

25
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.136
As far as what NextJS enforces
with these directories,

26
00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.199
it really only touches three of them.

27
00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:30.082
So the App directory, there's a public
directory where you can put any asset

28
00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:34.811
that you want to be exposed on
the Internet, so images, things like that,

29
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:37.463
files, whatever you want to be exposed.

30
00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.998
And then the API directory, that's it.

31
00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:45.327
That's the only directories that
it pays special attention to.

32
00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:47.747
Everything else you can do
whatever the hell you want.

33
00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:52.053
And then within those directories, it's
only specific file names that have special

34
00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:56.200
attention, and we'll talk about a lot of
those, but so kind of starts with that.

35
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.168
So let's talk about the App directory.

36
00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:02.597
This is the main directory for
your application using the App router.

37
00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:07.325
The way that it works is every
time NextJS sees something called.

38
00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:10.287
And I'm just going over it very lightly
now, because we're gonna dive into it in

39
00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:12.658
more detail, I just wanna just talk,
give you like a preamble.

40
00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:15.223
But these are the specific file names or
some of them,

41
00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:16.651
which is actually a lot more.

42
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:21.446
It's just every time I look at the docs
I'm, yeah, there's another thing for that.

43
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:22.280
Nobody uses that though.

44
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.524
So the main one is Page, so if you have a
file called Page, that's gonna be a route.

45
00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:31.715
So if you ever use a routing library,
like React router, or something like that,

46
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:36.063
and you have to mainly set those routes up
in a component, you don't have to do that.

47
00:02:36.063 --> 00:02:40.284
NextJS has its own router that you don't
touch, although you can if you want to,

48
00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.841
but you should probably never do it,
otherwise don't use NextJS.

49
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:47.528
You just need to make a page inside of
a directory inside the app folder and

50
00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:49.472
that's gonna be configured for you.

51
00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:53.683
Layout Pretty similar,
It's a layout for a route.

52
00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:55.524
So what is a layout?

53
00:02:55.524 --> 00:02:59.087
It's just a piece of UI that wraps
a page and it never changes,

54
00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:00.944
that's essentially a layout.

55
00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:02.557
We'll talk about that as well.

56
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.712
And then you have all these
auxiliary ones, like a loading file.

57
00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:11.579
This is a page that will show when a page
is loading while it's fetching data,

58
00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.844
show this page until that data is fetched.

59
00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:18.118
So it's like a loading screen essentially.

60
00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:22.118
Same thing with error, if that page
threw an error for some reason,

61
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.019
you can show this error screen.

62
00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.711
And then they have tons of other ones for
like not found,

63
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:33.215
they have some new ones in preview for
authentication related things like 404,

64
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:37.719
401, all this different stuff,
so you can show pages for that.

65
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.140
So there's just a lot, there's like
a template, we'll talk about that.

66
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.464
But these are like the main ones,
the ones that we'll mostly be using today.

67
00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:47.762
Mostly just page and
layout loading sometimes.

68
00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:53.263
The API directory is for creating API
endpoints, and it's pretty simple.

69
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:56.759
Any file and error that ends that
starts with or is called route,

70
00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.326
so in this case Route dot ts.

71
00:03:58.326 --> 00:03:59.984
That's gonna be an API route.

72
00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:04.835
NextJS uses serverless functions, so
each route is a function that will be

73
00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:07.915
called and
we'll talk more about the routes and

74
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:11.779
how you can expose different
methods within those routes.

75
00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.186
But just if you don't know what
serverless functions are or lambdas,

76
00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.219
definitely look into that a little more.

77
00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:21.407
We'll definitely talk about it in the case
of how and how it relates to NextJS,

78
00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:25.038
but these are just like service routes,
so you can make API routes.

79
00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:28.462
What's interesting is that we don't
really even need these anymore when

80
00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:29.741
building an application.

81
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.763
With NextJS, I think even in this
course I'm only gonna show routes for

82
00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:39.116
the case of like an external
developer API, but internally,

83
00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:44.242
our app's never even gonna use the route,
which sounds crazy, I know.

84
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.820
Everybody's like, TRPC, no,
I don't use it, I don't need it.

85
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.342
I don't need to make a route, and
you'll see why, it's pretty cool.

86
00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:57.330
And then public static assets,
images, fonts, things like that,

87
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.436
files served by your
app you can put there.

88
00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:02.023
Then here are just some common patterns.

89
00:05:02.023 --> 00:05:06.654
So for me,
you might see me do things like put stuff

90
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:11.187
inside a components directory or
UI directory.

91
00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:14.245
We'll talk about route groups and
things like that, and

92
00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:18.524
then other common patterns that you see
people do, none of this stuff is wrong.

93
00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:22.280
These are just what people might do.

94
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.028
This one actually is specific to NextJS,
but

95
00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:25.733
we'll talk about route groups in a minute.

96
00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:27.878
Just putting this here so
you kind of get a vibe for it,

97
00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:30.988
but we're going into detail about all
this stuff, so don't worry about it.

98
00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:35.384
You don't need to remember,
I just wanted to put it somewhere.

99
00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:41.627
And yeah, that's pretty much as
far as folder structure, TLDR.

100
00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:45.294
Follow these three things,
mostly app and API,

101
00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:49.060
everything else,
do whatever the hell you want.

102
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.523
But this is how I do it.
