00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.597
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We actually are going to
get a little bit into how to performance

2
00:00:04.597 --> 00:00:05.370
profile.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.200
I'm just going to teach you a little
bit about explain which is useful.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.476
All right, so select star from track,

5
00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:16.310
where
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Name

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.089
equals Black Dog, which is a.

7
00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:23.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's Zepton Sol.

8
00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like
we got two versions of it.

9
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:27.991
That's cool.

10
00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:38.277
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, well,
let's just do an explain here first.

11
00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:41.274
So, exact same query.

12
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.990
The only thing I want you to do now is,
I just want you to put explain

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.726
on the front of it and
you'll get something that looks like this.

14
00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:57.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're looking at that
and saying like, I don't get it, me too.

15
00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.063
I don't really understand
what this is saying.

16
00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:04.842
Every time I look at a SQLites output
of explain, it's really hard for

17
00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:07.854
me to make heads or tails of what it is.

18
00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.848
And I started digging into this
because I thought I was maybe I'll

19
00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:10.474
explain it to them.

20
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.331
And I was getting so
far into what the opcodes are and

21
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.404
what you need to be concerned about.

22
00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:20.713
And I was like, yeah, no, this is like
a whole course worth of material here.

23
00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.863
And frankly,
it's stuff that I don't look at,

24
00:01:22.863 --> 00:01:25.233
so I'm not going to really
explain it too much to you.

25
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.703
What I am going to show you is
the one that I do find useful.

26
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:35.194
And they all databases have
their own version of this.

27
00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:41.243
The one in Postgres is explain,
analyze, which does not work.

28
00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:48.774
But the one that exists in
SQLite is EXPLAIN QUERYPLAN.

29
00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.741
And the big bad word to look for is scan.

30
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.193
Scan means I'm going to look at everything

31
00:01:56.193 --> 00:02:00.161
in this table to figure out if
it's called Black Dog or not.

32
00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:06.527
So, if you remember correctly,
in track we have 3500 rows.

33
00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:09.902
So in order to find two tracks,
I had to look at 3500 of them.

34
00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:12.777
I'm gonna go ahead and
say that's probably okay.

35
00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:17.867
Because, again, SQLite is really fast.

36
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.821
Especially in 3500 rows.

37
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:24.454
Now, if you're on a million rows and
it's gonna happen a lot,

38
00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:27.313
yeah, by all means, worry about it.

39
00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But high volume and

40
00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:34.870
frequent those are kind of tip of
your like, okay this is too slow.

41
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.592
Even then,
I saw this while I was doing my research.

42
00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:47.601
We're gonna talk about indexes and
how to index a column.

43
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.101
Indexes are like medicine, that if
you don't need it, you don't need it.

44
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.891
And if you do need it, a little bit helps.

45
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.641
And then, too much of it is
almost always a bad thing.

46
00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.798
So, be judicious about
where you index things.

47
00:03:05.798 --> 00:03:08.928
We looked at query plan.

48
00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:12.097
Something that can be helpful is, and

49
00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:17.047
I'll do this from time to time
when I'm working in SQLite,

50
00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:20.962
you can do .eqp on,
explain query plan Plan.

51
00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:22.880
So you don't have to put
this every single time.

52
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.420
It's now just going to start
telling you every single time.

53
00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:31.649
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you get a scan track right there.

54
00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.104
Kind of helpful, especially if you're
writing a lot of queries here and

55
00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:35.363
you're trying to figure stuff out.
