00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.802
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My name is Brian Holt and
welcome to the complete intro to SQLite.

2
00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:10.333
Please head to SQLite.holt.courses and

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:16.763
you will end up on this website
the complete intro to SQLite.

4
00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:21.262
And you can see here I have 2 computers
here so What you see right here is

5
00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:25.470
literally my notes, so
you can feel free to follow along with me.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.068
You can copy and paste the code examples,
sometimes it's fun to

7
00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:35.282
actually type them out, but it's all here,
so feel free to share this.

8
00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:39.553
This is open source, yeah, cool.

9
00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.381
So as way of introduction
of how to use this website.

10
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.179
If I click into one of these sections, you
can see this is the welcome section and

11
00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.100
the intro lesson.

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.727
If you click in there, you'll see,
up here, it'll say welcome intro, so

13
00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:54.121
you can kind of figure out
where I am in the course.

14
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.035
If you wanna jump around in the video, or

15
00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:01.765
you wanna you just lost track of
where I am really easy way to tell.

16
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:08.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
let's talk about SQLITE.

17
00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.561
I'm teaching this for Frontend Masters.

18
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.170
Thanks Frontend Masters for
inviting me back yet again.

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.749
And today we're gonna learn
a little bit about SQL.

20
00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.895
There's no SQL experience
required to start this class.

21
00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:22.775
We're gonna talk about
the core features of SQLite,

22
00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:27.204
we're gonna do a little bit of building
some Node.js applications with SQLite.

23
00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:33.085
We'll talk about what's unique to SQLite,
some advanced features with JSON,

24
00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:36.802
and then we'll talk about
what the future holds for

25
00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:41.393
SQLite with things like Lightstream,
LightFS, and LibSQL.

26
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.608
All things that we will talk
about when we get there.

27
00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:45.852
Who is this course for?

28
00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:47.286
Hopefully it's for you.

29
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.737
This course is most helpful.

30
00:01:49.737 --> 00:01:51.996
If this is not your first
programming exposure,

31
00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:54.156
a little bit of JavaScript
would go a long way.

32
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:58.809
I don't expect you to be like Node
developers for this, except for

33
00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:03.060
maybe the one little exercise
we have a node, that's fine.

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.846
I've taught a few courses
that would help you,

35
00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:09.198
if you wanted to brush up
before you start going forward.

36
00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:12.402
Wanna be intro to Web Dev,
intro to Linux and the CLI,

37
00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:14.548
if you've never used a CLI before.

38
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:18.907
And then we will use a little bit of
containers at the very end of the course.

39
00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.764
You don't have to have use container,

40
00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:23.252
you don't even have to
really kind of follow along.

41
00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:26.969
You can just kind of watch at that point,
so

42
00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.152
that's more optional, but
I do think it's a cool course.

43
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:36.420
Cool, I have also taught
the complete intro to SQL,

44
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.402
which is really the complete
intro to Postgres.

45
00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:43.626
So if you If you're interested
in learning more about that,

46
00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.532
I have a whole thing on that as well.

47
00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.307
They both cover the basics of SQL, but

48
00:02:48.307 --> 00:02:53.957
this one will obviously get more into the,
better parts of Postgres as well.

49
00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:56.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Who am I?

50
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.122
That guy, if that wasn't obvious I'm
a staff product ,manager at Neon,

51
00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:06.648
which is a serverless Postgres company.

52
00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.442
So you can tell that I kinda like
databases, this Neon is now my third

53
00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:15.322
database company that I've worked at, and
fourth, if you wanna count, Microsoft.

54
00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:19.092
So I like databases, I keep working on
them, and I get excited about them.

55
00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:23.241
So I guess I'm just gonna
keep going with it.

56
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:26.379
I've been a PM and
an engineer at SQLite Cloud,

57
00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.792
Snowflake was the other database company
that I worked at, Stripe, Microsoft,

58
00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:36.578
LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit and
some other smaller startups I've been

59
00:03:36.578 --> 00:03:41.383
teaching at front of masters for
it's probably been about a decade now.

60
00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:45.019
And I'm gonna keep doing
it until they kick me out,

61
00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.907
this might be the time, we don't know.

62
00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:52.539
Recently moved to Sacramento,
previous to that, lived in Salt Lake,

63
00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.327
San Francisco, Seattle.

64
00:03:54.327 --> 00:04:00.467
I was born and raised in Montana, and
I also lived in Italy for a while.

65
00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:04.285
And feel free to catch up with me on
the socials, I left my links there.

66
00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:08.097
Do recognize that I am terrible
at answering DMs, but yeah,

67
00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:10.128
please feel free to tweet at me.

68
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.489
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I always get these
questions, so I just try and

69
00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.828
answer them up front of like, Hey Brian,
what technologies are you using?

70
00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:22.149
I will be using VS Code,
I used to work on VS Code, so

71
00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:26.771
I did a blood oath that I must
continue using VS Code, or

72
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.003
the ghost of Bill Gates will haunt me.

73
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:35.301
I'm using Firefox, Chrome's cool too,
I just like supporting Firefox.

74
00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:40.581
I am using the default terminal app here,
but there's lots of other cool ones.

75
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.217
I have Docker desktop installed,
I'll be using that for Docker.

76
00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:48.244
Here's all the themes and
fonts that I am using.

77
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:52.929
They are all linked there,
feel free to click through those if

78
00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:56.633
you're curious about any
of these things work.
