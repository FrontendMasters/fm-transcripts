00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are gonna go ahead and
get this running.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.400
You're gonna notice that
everything today is SQLite 3.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.689
As you might guess,
it's the third major version of SQLite.

4
00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.310
That's where the 3 comes from.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.063
Feel free to hop over to I'm gonna be
using probably 346 today for my version.

6
00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.843
But SQLite is so slow to change.

7
00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:26.527
Unless it says SQLite 4,
your version's probably gonna work for

8
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:30.343
this because I'm not gonna show
you anything too crazy here today.

9
00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.753
So if you want to,
feel free to pop over here.

10
00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:35.403
I linked you to the download page.

11
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:38.213
You can see that 346 is
still the correct version.

12
00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:42.903
Looks like they've,
that have updated it, I think to point

13
00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:47.418
one which I don't think I'm on,
I think I'm on point, doesn't matter.

14
00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:51.828
I did it through brew install SQLite,
that worked as well.

15
00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:57.668
And then I just aliased it,
because all I did was like, what is it?

16
00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:00.104
Homebrew?

17
00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:04.205
Info, SQLite 3.

18
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:11.957
Or brew, sorry,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It tells you where it is,

19
00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:16.642
and then I just went ahead, and
then I made a alias for it.

20
00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:20.248
So you can see here, this is just an alias
that Brian Holt is using for his class.

21
00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:23.076
But you can see I'm using 346 here.

22
00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:29.185
If I just do SQLite 3,
I'll get this up a little bit.

23
00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:36.740
You can see this is 340 3.2 from 2023,
you're gonna be fine with both.

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.946
There's no reason that you
need to be on you know,

25
00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:44.963
346 that's just gonna
be totally up to you.

26
00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:47.651
If you wanna an alternative way,

27
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:53.495
I think this is the OS X version,
if you click on that link there.

28
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:57.235
But yeah, I would just get it directly
from their website, if you care.

29
00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:00.251
Otherwise, just stick with whatever's
installed on your OS by default.

30
00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:05.705
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They should have
instructions for Windows and

31
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.154
Linux on there as well,
but it works everywhere.

32
00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:12.771
You could run this class totally on
a Raspberry Pi, no problems, right?

33
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:17.525
Or an Arduino, probably,
that would be a lot more difficult for

34
00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.821
no little gain, but go for it.

35
00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:22.821
Okay.
And then we're gonna be using something

36
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:23.485
called Chinook.

37
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:28.398
So click here, it's just a data set.

38
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.033
I have you linked to 1.4.5.

39
00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:33.656
I don't know how frequently
they update this, but

40
00:02:33.656 --> 00:02:36.831
this is just a guy that basically
put together a free data set.

41
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.765
You'll find it everywhere,
everyone uses it for all their examples.

42
00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:41.647
It's just consistent.

43
00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:45.567
It's basically an invoicing system for
buying digital media.

44
00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:49.416
So there's like stuff in there
about Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, and

45
00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:52.247
Lost the tv show, and
a bunch of stuff like that.

46
00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:59.484
Go down here and click on
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one here,

47
00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:02.374
Chinook, SQLite.SQLite.

48
00:03:02.374 --> 00:03:07.257
I would download that, and
then I call my databases .db.

49
00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.944
I don't know why they went with .SQLite.

50
00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:11.021
I don't really see too
many people do that.

51
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:13.971
I'm not doing the auto increment one.

52
00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:15.781
We're just doing the SQLite one.

53
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:20.473
You can also download the .sql one, which
is going to be a really big SQL file, and

54
00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:22.250
you can load that into SQLite.

55
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.683
Both of those will be just fine.

56
00:03:25.683 --> 00:03:28.721
But you can see they have it for
Postgres, they have it for DB2,

57
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.590
a bunch of stuff like that.

58
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.114
That should get you all set up, and

59
00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:37.395
we're gonna hop into actually
getting something going.

60
00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:45.765
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

61
00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:52.285
have a fresh copy of it here
that the Chinook database.

62
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:57.254
And you can just do SQLite3, and the name
of the database, which I have called

63
00:03:57.254 --> 00:04:02.241
data.db, but yours, might be called,
like Chinook, something or other.

64
00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.695
You can also do it with
just the SQLite extension.

65
00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:11.536
Doesn't matter, and that should drop you
into something that looks like this.

66
00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:14.735
Let's first talk about dot commands.

67
00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:16.525
They're just really
helpful to know up front.

68
00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:21.398
So if I do dot help, it'll just give you
a bunch of like a dot commands that you

69
00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:24.903
can run, they're kind of
like administrative ones so

70
00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.965
that you can figure out what
the name of the tables are, right?

71
00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:30.455
Dot tables, right?

72
00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:35.785
You can do it like what is the name
of the schema of album, right?

73
00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:40.413
Tab completion does work,
at least on my computer, so

74
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.070
that which is pretty nice as well.

75
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.587
Version, there's a bunch of stuff
that you can do with those kind of

76
00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.800
administrative commands there.

77
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.255
We won't do it today, but
you can do like .connect and

78
00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:55.520
you can connect another database.

79
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.860
You can have multiple databases
connected at the same time and

80
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.940
you can be reading and
writing to two different files.

81
00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:02.923
Bunch of really cool stuff like that.

82
00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:05.693
And then, as always,
you can hit .exit to get out of it.

83
00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:12.088
Another thing you can do is you can
just do, I can do Control D, and

84
00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:14.930
that will also get me
out of there as well.

85
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So those are dot commands.

86
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.483
They're all super helpful.

87
00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:23.335
I use dot help all the time, because I
can't keep all this stuff in my head.

88
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.397
Dot exit is useful.

89
00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:31.076
If you run SQLite3 and just give it
nothing, you can see here it's doing

90
00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:35.370
transit in memory, which means,
like, if you want to just like,

91
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.995
open a session to like, no database, if I
put dot tables, there's nothing, right?

92
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:45.547
This can be helpful to kind of just be
a playground to try stuff out as well.

93
00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:49.543
And you can also do dot read.

94
00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:55.574
And do what is it I
called the data dot DB.

95
00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:59.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe that won't work.

96
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.291
Yeah because that's a database.

97
00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:04.357
It's not an SQL, but if it was an SQL
file, which I did not download, but

98
00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:07.576
if you download the other dot SQL one,
you can actually read it in there, and

99
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:10.847
they can start doing stuff without
actually modifying any sort of database or

100
00:06:10.847 --> 00:06:12.132
leaving anything at the end.

101
00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:13.880
Because when you just do exit here,

102
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.276
anything that was in this transit
in memory database is now deleted.
