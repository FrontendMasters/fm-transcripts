1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.890
In order to get it deployed
we gotta do a couple things.

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.860
I'm actually just going
to stash all of this.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.068
Let me see.

4
00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:12.051
I'm gonna check out one of
the branches that I know is solid, so

5
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.190
I'm now fixing some of my bugs.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.256
We're gonna check out the master.

7
00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:21.166
I don't want this, okay.

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:21.868
What we got.

9
00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:28.408
I got all these extra files.

10
00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:44.889
Okay, so, check out the master,
and then what I need to do is.

11
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:45.836
Go away.

12
00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:50.810
I need to change those
hard coded fetch calls.

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.890
So what I'll do is,
I'll add some environment variables.

14
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.140
So, instead of having things here,
I don't know what this URL is gonna be, so

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.570
I have to add an environment variable.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.970
So I'll go down to our next config here,
and make it take an environment variable.

17
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.271
So what I'll do is, I'll add some
environment variables here, and

18
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.917
I'll call it API_URL, and
for local host is localhost.

19
00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.220
Well, so we've got the API_URL.

20
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.746
And then what I can do is,
I can head back into.

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.398
These things, or
these things right here, and

22
00:01:36.398 --> 00:01:41.424
I could just use the URL instead,
so I'll just do this.

23
00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:45.698
Process.env.API_URL, like that.

24
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.023
And do the same thing on the id one.

25
00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:57.570
Cool, so we got the API_URL's there.

26
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.447
We just need to make sure we set
these environment variables on Vercel

27
00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:01.880
only deploy.

28
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.220
So, all that's good.

29
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.293
Looks really good here.

30
00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:09.917
I'm just gonna make sure I have Vercel
on my machine, on this version of Node,

31
00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:10.909
looks like I do.

32
00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.940
You can do vc for short,
you can also just type in vercel.

33
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.538
I'm just gonna type in vc, so
we can make these changes.

34
00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:27.129
All right, now let's type in vc.

35
00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.519
Got an update here, and it's saying,
cool, do you want to set up and

36
00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.170
deploy this thing?

37
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.760
Yeah, I do.

38
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.008
And, I could pick which
organization I want to deploy to,

39
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.541
I wanna deploy to my
personal organization.

40
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.060
Link to an existing project?

41
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.720
I don't have any existing projects on
Vercel for this app, so I'm gonna say no.

42
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.636
What's your project's name?

43
00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:54.780
Nextjs-course-app.

44
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.860
In which directory is your code located?

45
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.990
Right at the source.

46
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.147
So I'm just gonna say,
that's setting up projects.

47
00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:05.490
And you can see right there,
auto detected project settings.

48
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.400
This is the Next.js app, cool.

49
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.611
And this is like.

50
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.491
We got these commands here that say,
for our Next.js app,

51
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.102
we think you should run npm run build,
or next build.

52
00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:17.070
This is the same stuff
that I already have.

53
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.520
And they're saying, hey,
can we overwrite it?

54
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.550
And I was like, sure, I don't care,
it's pretty much the same thing.

55
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.340
This is gonna override it.

56
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.820
You can just say no, and
it will totally work the same way.

57
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.457
Which settings would you like to override?

58
00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:36.310
I guess they're all the same,
I'll just put build command, sure.

59
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.859
So right now it's building.

60
00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.902
They pretty much upload your thing,
and they have like their own ci,

61
00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:42.326
where they build it in their ci.

62
00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:46.638
And you can look at this link and you can
go inspect it to see how it's building.

63
00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:50.208
All right, so you can check it
out right here, I like their ci.

64
00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:56.118
And you can see, if this thing
doesn't break, we'll see what happens.

65
00:03:56.118 --> 00:04:01.550
[LAUGH] Usually, the first time you
deploy something, it never builds, so.

66
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.540
Looks like it built.

67
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.840
And you can see right here it's like,
yeah, SSG, static site generation.

68
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.820
So it isn't static.

69
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.930
Some static stuff right here.

70
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.560
It even tells you to build like, yep.

71
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.672
Yeah, we did some stuff right here.

72
00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:28.234
All right.

73
00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.776
And it's now-.
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Completely recognized your

74
00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:32.874
variables?

75
00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:35.400
&gt;&gt; No, it's.

76
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.260
I mean, no, it doesn't have the values,
but I'm gonna add them in here.

77
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.432
But we can see right herem for
this page it loaded up, and there we go,

78
00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:46.310
nextjs-course-app.vercel.app.

79
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.880
Easy.
I think if I go to the next page it might

80
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.960
break, let's see.

81
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.320
Yeah, that's gonna break, because I
don't have the variables in there,

82
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.340
so I need to go add
the variables in Vercel.

83
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.130
But this one didn't use any variables,
so, it was totally fine,

84
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.160
it rendered fine, but
the other ones didn't.

85
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.570
So I gotta go add the variables in there,
and.

86
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.134
Forgot to do that in next somewhere,
I think it's like, yeah.

87
00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:15.883
Where'd you do that?

88
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.967
Here we go.

89
00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:27.899
Yeah, so
it's breaking because it's trying to.

90
00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.050
Still trying to get localhost.

91
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.070
So, yeah, it still failed because I
don't have the right variables in here.

92
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.060
So, I need to just update the variables,
which again, I think you do that

93
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.410
here in Settings, you go to Environment
Variables, bam, and you can add them here.

94
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.900
So, if we do API_URL, and then.

95
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.089
if I get the URL of my API,
which is this thing.

96
00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:05.223
Put that there.

97
00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:06.239
Maybe do the same thing.

98
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.607
Like that, and Preview, why not?

99
00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:18.698
No, the Preview is gonna have a different
URL, so, and so does Development.

100
00:06:18.698 --> 00:06:20.310
This one's the only one we want.

101
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.864
So I think that will fix it.

102
00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:23.466
I think now you gotta do a redeployment.

103
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.962
I'm pretty sure I gotta
redeploy this thing.

104
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.085
Yeah, you gotta redeploy, well,
I'm in the wrong thing, where did it go?

105
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.352
Yeah, I gotta redeploy this thing, so.

106
00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:45.549
I guess I'll just redeploy it, why not?

107
00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:47.760
But yeah, that's pretty much Vercel.

108
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.582
Very simple to get started, very easy.

109
00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:54.890
As is everything else,
everything else is pretty simple too.

110
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.650
But I think Vercel does the best job when
it comes to deploying their own stuff, so,

111
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.350
yeah, highly recommend it.
