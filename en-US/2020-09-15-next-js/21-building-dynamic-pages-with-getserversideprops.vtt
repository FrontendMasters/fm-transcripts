00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.371
Now, we're gonna talk
about getServerSideProps.

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:06.787
So, getServerSideProps is really simple,
you can think of it as the API handlers

3
00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:09.479
that we've been working on but
inside your page.

4
00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.801
At the end of the day,
that's kind of basically what it is.

5
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.650
So, you get access to the request and

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.240
the response objects inside of here,
you get access to all that stuff.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.420
You can do whatever you want
that's valid on the server.

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.993
Very much like getStaticProps, you just
need to return an object with props.

9
00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:26.033
That's it, and
that's gonna be passing to your component.

10
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.670
The difference between this and
getStaticProps is that this function,

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.326
getServerSideProps, is
always executed per request.

12
00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:38.154
So when you hit this request,
it's gonna run this function.

13
00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:41.705
Whereas getStaticProps only
happens once at build time,

14
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:45.530
getSeverSideProps happens
every time on the request.

15
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.944
So it's true server side rendering.

16
00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:50.699
And so this might be a better place to put
something dynamic like a user ID, where

17
00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.642
you don't want to generate every single
user ahead of time, which is ridiculous.

18
00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:57.682
And instead, you just wanna render
them when they're asked on the server.

19
00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:01.131
Or even better, just do it on the client,
use an SWR or react query, and

20
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:02.811
don't do anything on the server.

21
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.928
Just render the HT, just render the JSX,
and do the data fetching on the client.

22
00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:08.774
So those would be better alternatives.

23
00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:09.787
But yeah, that's basically it.

24
00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:13.245
And like I said, you get access to
the request and response objects,

25
00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.403
which we will be using
in the next example.

26
00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:17.440
And yeah, it's really powerful.
