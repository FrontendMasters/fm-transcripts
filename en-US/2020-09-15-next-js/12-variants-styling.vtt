00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:02.550
All right,
let's continue to make our app look good.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.210
So, the next thing is,
let's get our index page looking good.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.126
So you can just copy and
paste this to the index.js.

4
00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:10.232
And again, if you don't feel
like copying and pasting this,

5
00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:12.500
you could just check out to the branch.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.883
There's a lot going on,
but I'm just gonna do it.

7
00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:16.400
Cool.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.096
So here's one little break.

9
00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:22.010
I talked about variants before,
so here's an example of that.

10
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.241
So I'm able to use this word variant,

11
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.534
which points to something
that I defined in theme-ui.

12
00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:31.023
So you can see I'm saying, I want this
variant to point to containers.page.

13
00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:34.900
Well, if I go to theme,
I have containers and I have page.

14
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.750
So basically take these styles,
and apply it here.

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.210
That way I don't have to write them all.

16
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.630
So you could imagine, you could get rid
of all these in line styles, everything

17
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.320
that's in line, and just mask them
behind variants, and then you're done.

18
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.170
You just go add variants to
all your JSX elements, and

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.490
then all you ever have to do
is just change them here.

20
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.440
That's it, you're done, you never
have to touch JSX again for style,

21
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.370
unless you're changing a variant name.

22
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.390
That's all you gotta do.

23
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.460
Very simple.

24
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.410
I can't think of a simpler way to
style this and make it look good.

25
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.730
So, yep, that's the variants,
and then, let's see.

26
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.390
Then we'll go down to the notes index
page, we got some stuff here, so

27
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.700
we can copy this and zoom out, so
I can copy it, and zoom out some more.

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.328
There we go.

29
00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:24.875
Don't forget to copy that JSX pragma
comment at the top of this code,

30
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.550
if you're following along,
you gotta copy that comment.

31
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.580
Otherwise it won't tell
the compiler how to compile,

32
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.145
and you won't get all the JSX
properties and stuff like that.

33
00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:42.246
And then the last one is just the id page,
so, copy that id page.

34
00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:45.257
And we'll put.

35
00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:46.269
Yeah, was that right?

36
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.571
Yeah, there we go, id page.

37
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:51.584
Should be good to go there.

38
00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:56.290
And here's just an example
of the root app.

39
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.938
So we already added a ThemeProvider, and

40
00:01:57.938 --> 00:01:59.780
now you can see I just
added the nav component.

41
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.391
So then we got asked the question earlier,
it's like, yes,

42
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.200
this is a good place to do a layout.

43
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.882
Exactly, that's exactly
what we're doing here.

44
00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.990
You can see I'm adding the nav
component to the root here, so

45
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.070
we're gonna just copy that.

46
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.123
And add that to our _app, like that, boom.

47
00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:20.531
So now we got our nav,
we have our theme, we got our page.

48
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.331
Everything's themed up, ready to go.

49
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:27.189
So now,
if I were to just save all of this stuff,

50
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.925
and go back to localhost,
boom, now you get,

51
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:35.818
a decent looking app, I guess [LAUGH]?

52
00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:39.936
So, yeah, we get something that
looks more like an app now.

53
00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:41.213
And everything just works.

54
00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:44.705
So, yeah,
this is where you should be at this point.

55
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:49.063
And you're almost ready to go get
funding for this note taking app, so,

56
00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.930
let me know if you wanna
talk to some investors.

57
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.396
[LAUGH] All right.

58
00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:57.337
The last thing I wanna
talk about with Theme UI,

59
00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.733
something that's very similar to it,
which is Baseweb.

60
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.745
I've used Baseweb once or twice, and it's

61
00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:07.140
the closest thing I can think of that's
Theme UI, I think it's created by Uber.

62
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.400
And they're very similar.

63
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.680
They take a different approach,
but the result is very similar.

64
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.620
And they're also meant for
theming and stuff like that.

65
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.207
It's a very good framework.

66
00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.244
However, I recommend checking it out,
it's very well maintained as well,

67
00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:21.200
documentation is pretty good too.

68
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.350
So you can check this out, it does
a really good job of getting you there.

69
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.879
And the other last thing is,

70
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.032
Theme UI also has built-in components
that actually are really good [COUGH].

71
00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:34.114
You can actually build an entire
application just using their built-in

72
00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:34.740
components.

73
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.235
I've done it,
I've never had to make a custom component,

74
00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:38.802
just using all of their stuff.

75
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.680
So I highly recommend checking it out,
because, I mean,

76
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.720
they have everything from flex
boxes to grids, buttons, cards,

77
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.650
forums, you name it, they've got
all the basic stuff that you need.

78
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.821
It's basically just div styled with
themes already that are already hooked

79
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:53.741
up to variants.

80
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.030
So all you gotta do is just change
the variants in your theme object.

81
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.430
So, really cool, so,
highly recommend checking that out too.

82
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.420
So, we left off on Theme UI,
and how I style components

83
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.750
in my React applications, just know that
theme-uiI is not specific to Next.js.

84
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.745
It can work in pretty much
any React environment.

85
00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.335
I worked very well with Gatsby, it was
I'm pretty sure Gatsby is the team behind

86
00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:20.242
Theme UI, so there's tons of
integrations and plugins there.

87
00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:21.750
It works good with create-react-app.

88
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.742
It works good with react-static, which
is another static running library for

89
00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:27.360
React, which is very popular.

90
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.490
So it just works in React in general.

91
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.280
And I think there might be plans to
make it work in other places as well,

92
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.030
like View and stuff like that.

93
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.040
So, yeah, Theme UI, pretty dope.
