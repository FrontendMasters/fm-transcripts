1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.230
Plugins, all right so
because the Next.js config

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.520
file is dead simple and
it has a convention,

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.000
usually when there's conventions
there's also gonna be plugins, right?

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.628
Conventions usually equals plugins
because where there's a set or

5
00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.263
rules that everyone has to follow,
that means it's predictable.

6
00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:23.617
And if it's predictable,
you can create common logic and

7
00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:28.204
plugins are just common logic is like,
all people just use this anyway, so

8
00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.272
we'll just make a plug in, right?

9
00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:35.117
So Next.js has plugins, but honestly
they don't even feel like plugins,

10
00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:38.153
they're just like extended configurations.

11
00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:41.549
I mean, they call them plugins, it doesn't
even feel like they had to made it,

12
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.272
it was so free that it was just like yeah,

13
00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.571
it's like they didn't really
make a plugin system.

14
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.592
It was just, the way that you
configure your Next.js or sorry,

15
00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:54.284
your next config file, makes it so
that plugins are possible, but I don't

16
00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:59.293
think they went and designed a plugin
system because it's very, very simple.

17
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.865
But basically it kind of looks like this,
the convention is,

18
00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:03.942
most of the time you'll
see something like this,

19
00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.271
like with under the name of the plugin,
so kinda like a higher order component.

20
00:01:07.271 --> 00:01:11.706
So withOffline, withSass,
withLess things like that, and

21
00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:14.871
that's kinda how you would use the plugin.

22
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:18.960
And all you really do for
most the time is you gotta just wrap

23
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.481
the configuration that
you have with the plugin.

24
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:27.178
Because what most plugins do is that
they might take in some options, so

25
00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:32.035
withOffline might take in some options
as the first arguments like this,

26
00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:33.782
let me just demonstrate.

27
00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:39.825
So if I had to plug in like withOffline,
or SSL, say this withMyPlugin,

28
00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:46.332
All right, let's just say we have that.

29
00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:50.944
And then what I'll do is get
rid of this right click, and

30
00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.657
I'll make my config here so
this will be my next configure

31
00:01:55.657 --> 00:02:01.290
here, Object right here.

32
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.313
And then what I'll do is, let's say
I have a plugin call withMyPlugin.

33
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.997
Sometimes this plugin might take
some arguments for the plugin so

34
00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:16.537
the args for the plugin go first.

35
00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:23.911
And then it's usually almost
always your next config goes here.

36
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.689
If your plugin doesn't take any arguments,
it's usually just the next config.

37
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.775
And the reason that happens is
because at the end of the day,

38
00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.633
you have to return a config
object inside of this file.

39
00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:37.668
So if you're using a plugin, then you
pass your config object to the plugin and

40
00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:39.515
the plugin just returns it for you.

41
00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:42.890
So that's usually the convention and
that's why it works that way.

42
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.496
And that is actually really
useful because it allows you to

43
00:02:47.496 --> 00:02:52.478
basically creates this system
of plugins consuming plugins,

44
00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:56.390
right kind of like middleware in Express.

45
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.494
So various Express is
very similar to that.

46
00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.112
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do now.

47
00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:03.952
So there's this really cool plugin
called withPlugins, that allows you to

48
00:03:03.952 --> 00:03:07.492
compose plugins together a lot easier
than if you did it yourself, and

49
00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:09.717
that's actually what we're gonna do now.

50
00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:14.363
So, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna add a plugin that allows us to

51
00:03:14.363 --> 00:03:19.489
easily add environment variables to
our next app, so without this plugin,

52
00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.397
the way you would have to add environment
variables will look like this.

53
00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:30.127
With Next.js, so if I have this config,
I will say module.exports = this object.

54
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:36.224
I can say { env: and I could put, my {EVN:
here, I can put whatever value I want.

55
00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:40.026
It's pretty simple, this works very fine,
you might even ask yourself, why do I need

56
00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:43.591
a plugin, because everything you have
here is gonna be injected into your code.

57
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:50.257
So that means I'm able to use
process.env.whatever you want,

58
00:03:50.257 --> 00:03:54.021
and it's going to give me the value.

59
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:58.445
And if you ever use this plugin a web
pack, what actually happens is when

60
00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:03.018
this file gets processed, it's going
to replace this whole value here,

61
00:04:03.018 --> 00:04:05.841
this whole statement
with the actual value.

62
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:07.637
So as far as the browser is concerned,

63
00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:10.233
this is gonna be replaced
with whatever the value was.

64
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.655
So it's never gonna see process.env,
it's never gonna see that,

65
00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.603
this thing gets completely replaced.

66
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:19.477
So it's not the same thing as using
process.env in a node environment which

67
00:04:19.477 --> 00:04:23.410
actually reads from the environment,
this is just a simple replacement just

68
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.332
replacing it as far as from
the browser's perspective.

69
00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.237
So yeah, like I said,
you might be asking well,

70
00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:30.381
why do we need a plugins
it's actually pretty simple.

71
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.436
Well, it's it's because this was a SECRET,

72
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.212
You're not just gonna put this
in here like this, all right?

73
00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:41.920
You're not gonna just hard code
your secret API key here, and

74
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.214
then check it in Git.

75
00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:45.153
Now you just wouldn't do that,
hopefully not.

76
00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:49.122
So most likely you'll have a .env file,
so we actually have one right here.

77
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.739
So you should have a .env file in your
repo, if you don't, you can make one,

78
00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:57.165
it's literally just a follow
on the roots called .env.

79
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.387
And the syntax for
the env file kind of goes as this,

80
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.430
you put the name of
the variable that you want.

81
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.511
And most environment variables are all
caps and they use a underscores to or

82
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:11.847
is it, was I called snake case like caps,
snake case or something like, well,

83
00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:13.113
it's not snake case.

84
00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.440
Is it snake case?

85
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.922
I don't know, so it'll do all caps like
that followed by the equal sign and

86
00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:21.821
then whatever value you want for
that environment variable.

87
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.744
That's typically how a .env file works,
and

88
00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:30.480
you can put more on the next
line if you want, like that.

89
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.056
All right so that's how .env files work,
and then would you want to do is you make

90
00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.896
sure this file doesn't get checked
in to GitHub, all right, so

91
00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:39.653
this file is not checked into GitHub,
and you're good to go.

92
00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:43.876
So, now you can safely put your secrets
in here, and then inside of here,

93
00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:48.253
you need to load up that .env and put it
here and that could be pretty manual.

94
00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:50.051
So there's a plugin that kind
of helps us with that, and

95
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.331
that's what we're going to install.

96
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:54.805
So in order to get this to work,
please install two dependencies,

97
00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:58.853
we're gonna install next env, and
then we're gonna install .env-load.

98
00:05:58.853 --> 00:06:02.412
So if you got NPM, you can copy
that script, if you have yarn,

99
00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:03.514
you can copy that.

100
00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:05.423
I'm using yarn, so I'm gonna copy that.

101
00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:09.880
I'm gonna add that, And actually,

102
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.820
you should just install
this as a dev dependency,

103
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.650
because it's only gonna use for building
so, definitely save the new dev there.

104
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.930
And once you have it, then all we're
gonna do is just load up this plugin so

105
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.806
it's actually pretty simple.

106
00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:28.915
All we have to do is imports or

107
00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:33.378
I'm sorry require what is it?

108
00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:39.236
Like nextEnv = require('next-env'),

109
00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:46.301
and then .envLoad =
require('dotenv-load').

110
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:50.101
So then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say .envLoad like this, and

111
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:53.586
what this does is, this is gonna look for
a env file in your folder,

112
00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:57.888
grab every environment variable in there,
and inject it into the environment for

113
00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.044
you, so you don't have to do anything.

114
00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:04.904
And then from there, all we're gonna do is

115
00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:09.498
use this nextSnv, plug in, like that.

116
00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:12.390
And that's going to allow us,
or I'm sorry,

117
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.410
you call the plugin I got it backwards so
you had to do it that way.

118
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.680
So what we'll do is we'll say,
withEnv = nextEnv.

119
00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:30.725
There we go, nextEmv, and then that,
we can use that plug number here with Emv.

120
00:07:30.725 --> 00:07:34.642
So what this is gonna do is, it's
basically gonna look at the Emv file, load

121
00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:38.993
up all the environment variables in the
environment, inject them, this right here

122
00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:43.494
is actually creating the plugin with the
environments loaded into it automatically.

123
00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:45.145
So in the background you can imagine,

124
00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:47.733
there's gonna be a config that
looks something like this.

125
00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:56.204
So, There's gonna be a next
config that has env on it,

126
00:07:56.204 --> 00:08:00.861
just like we had before, and
then every variable that's here, so

127
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:06.117
in this case, this HELP_APP_URL is
gonna be here with the actual value.

128
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.802
Like that, right?

129
00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:14.593
So all that is being done for
us with these plugins and

130
00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:17.771
the combination of that little,
so that's just for free.

131
00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:19.412
So now we get to do that.

132
00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:24.064
Pretty free, pretty easy way to load
yourself up for development, and yeah,

133
00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:28.717
I have a warning here, don't check that
into Git if you never use .env files,

134
00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.265
please don't check them into
Git that's the whole point.

135
00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:35.060
And then the last thing we'll
do is we'll just update,

136
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.214
we'll use this environment
variable somewhere, so I'm just

137
00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:42.098
using it as an anchor tag inside of
the nav component, so we'll just do that.

138
00:08:42.098 --> 00:08:46.541
And I'm just gonna copy this, and we're
gonna go into our nav component here.

139
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:51.070
And I'm just gonna add that
anchor tag after the link, and

140
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.700
fix that formatting, and
some more indents, there we go.

141
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.963
And basically, it's just a link to
like an external help app desk or

142
00:08:58.963 --> 00:09:02.513
something that you have for your
customers on your note app, that's it,

143
00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:04.481
just to demonstrate how this will work.

144
00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:05.226
So remember,

145
00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:09.453
this gets completely replaced with a
string as far as the browser's concerned.

146
00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:17.385
So we got that, I might have to start
the app again, [SOUND] there we go.

147
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:24.397
And you can see I'm still getting,
you have no export configuration,

148
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.973
that's because I did not put
a configuration here, right?

149
00:09:27.973 --> 00:09:30.652
So I don't have an export so
I'm totally fine with that warning.

150
00:09:30.652 --> 00:09:34.831
I have nothing to export there,
so it's totally fine.

151
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:35.886
Go back here and

152
00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:41.332
now you see I have this Help thing here
that points to Frontend Masters, right?

153
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:45.781
So whatever URL that you put in that
Emv file, is what's gonna be there.

154
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:51.381
And like I said, you can do all different
types of stuff with these plugins,

155
00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:54.282
very legit, very simple to work with.

156
00:09:54.282 --> 00:09:57.772
Any questions on plugins and

157
00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:03.013
configuration with the next config file?

158
00:10:03.013 --> 00:10:07.708
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is there a place like in
the documentation that lists all

159
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:12.062
the plugins that you can use,
or just how do you find them?

160
00:10:12.062 --> 00:10:15.141
&gt;&gt; Yeah so there are official ones,
and I'll show you those right now.

161
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:18.714
And then most of them are just like any
other plugins, their community plugins, so

162
00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:20.052
everyone has their own thing.

163
00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:25.659
But if you go to Vercel &gt; Next Plugins,
here's all the official ones,

164
00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:31.462
that they that they have, are they
here are some notable community ones.

165
00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:35.521
But I'm sure you'll find dozens of
more that aren't even on this list.

166
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:40.475
And the other thing is that Next.js has
as recently released a new version 9.3,

167
00:10:40.475 --> 00:10:45.359
and these new versions, I've actually
changed how some of these plugins work and

168
00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:46.441
stuff like that.

169
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:50.196
So just be careful about when the last
time one of these plugins was updated,

170
00:10:50.196 --> 00:10:52.556
make sure it was,
updated last couple months.

171
00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:54.874
Cuz if it's like a plugin
from two years ago,

172
00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:58.414
it might not work with how Next works now,
so just be careful of that.

173
00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:01.984
But yeah, they got some pretty
good plugins here, like Preacts,

174
00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:06.412
if you're anti-Facebook, but you like
React then Preact might be the way to go.

175
00:11:06.412 --> 00:11:09.023
It's a drop in replacement,
things like that.

176
00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:13.583
TypeScript was actually you don't need
anymore because TypeScript is supported

177
00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:15.234
from Next.js out of the box,

178
00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:18.351
which is actually I'm about
to show you how that works.

179
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:20.412
So yeah, stuff like that.

180
00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:22.924
So yeah pretty good,
some really nice plugins out there.

181
00:11:22.924 --> 00:11:25.722
But at the end of the day, most of them
just kind of modify the Webpack config,

182
00:11:25.722 --> 00:11:26.511
at the end of the day.

183
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:28.423
They take some Webpack logic,

184
00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:32.990
they wrap it in the Next.js configurable
plug in and boom, there you go.

185
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.160
Most of them that's what they do.
