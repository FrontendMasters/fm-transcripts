1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.690
Now let's just talk about my approach
to styling in React applications.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.870
So, for
what we're gonna use in this course and

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.140
just my recommended approach,
I like to use something called Theme UI.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.590
So if you've never heard a Theme UI, this
will be a soft introduction into Theme UI.

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.290
This is not a Theme UI course.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.742
I think it could literally
be a course by itself, so

7
00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:25.276
I won't be going into every detail and
nook and cranny about Theme UI, but

8
00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:27.922
I will be using it and
you'll learn through examples.

9
00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.160
And I'll talk about it as we go.

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.350
But this is actually how I
prefer to style my React app.

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.590
So if you were to click on a Theme UI
website, which is really cool,

12
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.742
which by the way, they do support
Black Lives Matter, which is really dope.

13
00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:43.490
They got all the names on here, but if you
click here and go to the documentation,

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.240
which is also a really good
documentation website.

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.880
You can see here that it says
Theme UI is a library for

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.240
creating thinkable user interfaces based
on constraint based design principles.

17
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.540
What does that actually mean?

18
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.860
We'll find out, but basically TLDR you can
create an object representing a theme and

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.230
then you can use that theme for
all your components.

20
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.650
That's basically it.

21
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.890
And to me, it's a lot simpler for

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.790
me to style using Theme UI
than anything I've ever used.

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.310
So that's what we're gonna be doing.

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.230
So we are gonna add this to our app.

25
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.520
So if you're using npm,
you can npm install all the things here.

26
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370
There's really only two
dependencies that we need.

27
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.380
We need the actual Theme UI and
then we need the @theme ui/presets,

28
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.670
which is basically going to give us
some default themes to start from.

29
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.420
So we're not starting from scratch.

30
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.407
You can think of it as the equivalent of
like, I'm creating a brand new React app.

31
00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:40.498
I wanna import some Normalize.css.

32
00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:45.560
I wanna import Tailwind,
just a CSS library, basically.

33
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.070
This is the equivalent of that except for
our CSS, our styles,

34
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.620
are represented in JavaScript,
which, that's how React does things.

35
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.840
So what we'll do is we're going to create
a theme and a file called theme.js.

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.857
So what we can do is we can go
to the root of our app, and

37
00:02:01.857 --> 00:02:05.710
we're gonna make a file called theme.js,
like that.

38
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.550
And we're gonna create a theme here.

39
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.900
Luckily for you,
already have everything you need.

40
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.070
So you can just copy this theme and
then I'll paste it and

41
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.140
I'll talk about it a little bit.

42
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.010
So, what's going on here with this?

43
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280
First thing is we have this preset here.

44
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.250
And like I said, preset is just
a starting point to our theme.

45
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.644
A theme object, there's a Specific

46
00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:34.310
set of properties that should
be on here and stuff like that.

47
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.710
You can go look at the spec if
you're interested on Theme UI.

48
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.450
So there's a spec for
a theme, like colors,

49
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.670
sizes, font, different things like that.

50
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.610
So I'm just using the Roboto
one that I got from Theme UI,

51
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.600
you can go check it out.

52
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.300
Actually, I'll just show
you what that looks like.

53
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.610
So if I go to the documentation, I can go
to packages, and then I can go to presets.

54
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.620
I'll make this a little bigger.

55
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.220
And then I can click on Roboto.

56
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.280
Some I'm using this preset.

57
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.110
It comes with these colors by default.

58
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.700
Here's the text.

59
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.590
Here's the background.

60
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.450
Here's the primary, secondary, muted,
highlight, gray, accent, darken.

61
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.380
All this stuff.

62
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.500
Here's the fonts.

63
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.580
Here's the font scale.

64
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.180
It's got all this stuff ready to go.

65
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.810
Literally fonts, everything ready to go.

66
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.210
I don't have to do anything.

67
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.920
I just install it and I'm done, right?

68
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.541
So I'm using this preset.

69
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:21.550
You can pick any preset or
none if you want to.

70
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.340
And I'm just going to extend over that and

71
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.860
then I'm going to just add
my own properties here.

72
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.850
So the thing about Theme UI is it's
like making components almost, right?

73
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.710
So just like you can make custom
components whereas I might make a card

74
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.240
component or

75
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.810
I might make a page component, and then
those components will have these styles.

76
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.010
I'm doing the same thing here.

77
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.290
You could think of these
as like CSS components.

78
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.615
I'm making the components in just CSS.

79
00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:51.720
So I make a CSS component called card and
CSS component called page.

80
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.690
And I can add these,
what they call variants,

81
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.210
these are actually called variants,

82
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.830
I can add these variants to any component
that I want inside of my React app.

83
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.450
I guess another way you could think of it
is like these are just CSS classes, right?

84
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.220
You could think of this as like
containers-card or containers-page.

85
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.310
That's a CSS class.

86
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.235
And that's basically what I'm doing here.

87
00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:15.190
And you could put whatever
CSS property you want here.

88
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.880
The other really cool thing is that
you can refer to predefined values.

89
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.660
So muted is not a color
that's in a browser, but

90
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.620
I'm able to use it here because I know
Roboto defines a color called muted.

91
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.050
And I'm able to refer to that here.

92
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.330
So you can actually put theme
values in here as well.

93
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.870
So not just CSS values, but theme values,
which is where the power comes from.

94
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.810
And this is a lot to take in,
but you'll see in a minute.

95
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.720
And then styles,
this is just for global style.

96
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.300
So this will basically allow us
to style things that are global.

97
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.030
For instance, if you were doing
Markdown or MDX or something like that,

98
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.050
this will just apply the styles to that.

99
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.950
So, really cool.

100
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.373
So if you really wanna see what's
popping here, you just log this.

101
00:04:53.373 --> 00:04:54.869
So I think it's better we just log this.

102
00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:57.642
So I'm just gonna log this theme and

103
00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:02.925
then the next thing is we need to
actually add this theme to our site.

104
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.621
Oops, why did I do that?

105
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:09.248
The way to do that is we need a provider.

106
00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:15.530
So Theme UI comes up with a provider
to wrap our entire document.

107
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.320
So there's two ways we can use providers
in Next.js, that brings us to this point,

108
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.270
is you could, because if you think about
every page in Next.js is its own app.

109
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.710
I didn't really talk about this,
but you get code splitting for

110
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.830
free based off routing, right?

111
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.900
Again, if you've ever configured Webpack
that's not something you can easily do.

112
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.260
You really got to understand
a lot about the build systems and

113
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.130
performance and all the different features
and plugins out there and trade offs and

114
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.590
environments that you're running in.

115
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.030
You get this for free with Next.js.

116
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.680
You get that nice code splitting.

117
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.110
So you can think of every single
page as its own application.

118
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.020
So in that case, yeah, we could just add
a provider around every single page.

119
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.960
I could just go into every single page and

120
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.120
wrap every single one of these in a theme
provider but that's kind of annoying.

121
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.600
And I only have a couple pages.

122
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.730
If I had more pages,
it would just be so annoying.

123
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.905
I wouldn't want to do that.

124
00:06:07.905 --> 00:06:10.090
So, where's one place where I can do this?

125
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.990
Well, in the app.

126
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.430
The app is the route.

127
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.090
It takes every single page, which is this,
and it returns it, right, with a prop.

128
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.940
So this is the perfect place to add things
like providers and stuff like that.

129
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.440
So that's exactly what we're gonna do.

130
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.950
We're gonna import the theme provider and

131
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.730
we're going to wrap our
entire application.

132
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.930
So let's do that.

133
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.660
So I'm gonna say import from Theme UI.

134
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.131
And what I want is a theme provider,
like that.

135
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:40.560
And I'm just going to
cut that right quick and

136
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.330
then I'm going to add the theme provider,
like this.

137
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.231
And I was gonna put that back in there.

138
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:49.900
And then the only thing that the provider
takes that we really care about is gonna

139
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.459
be a theme.

140
00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:51.990
And guess what?

141
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.140
We just made a theme.

142
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.440
It's right here on
the routes called theme.js.

143
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.960
It's the thing that we're exporting here.

144
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.960
We can just import it here.

145
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.472
So we'll just import this
theme From Where is it at?

146
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:10.060
Where am I at?

147
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.428
Source.

148
00:07:12.428 --> 00:07:13.439
There we go.

149
00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:19.410
Theme, and we'll just paste them or
we'll just type in theme there.

150
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.700
So now we have our theme.

151
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.420
We have our theme provider,
it's gonna wrap every single page.

152
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.613
If we go look at our

153
00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:34.543
App now, Hold up.

154
00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:35.462
Something break?

155
00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:37.633
Nope, nothing broke.

156
00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:38.914
Hold up.

157
00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:40.880
Theme provider theme.

158
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.883
Okay.
If we look at our app now,

159
00:07:42.883 --> 00:07:47.956
we should be able to see, you know I
think I got to, yeah, there we go.

160
00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:49.208
I was about to say something.

161
00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:50.760
Let me rebuild this.

162
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.732
Let me rebuild this.

163
00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:57.073
Okay.

164
00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:00.750
There we go.

165
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.630
Okay.

166
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.547
So, if we rebuild as you'll see instantly,
it just looks better [LAUGH].

167
00:08:06.547 --> 00:08:09.290
The fonts got changed.

168
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.270
Yeah, we still need some spacing and
stuff and we're gonna get to that next.

169
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.310
But I mean, you can see the font
got changed, the color,

170
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.420
the text changed a little bit.

171
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.220
Everything just got
instantly applied here.

172
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.240
And if we look at this
object that we're logging,

173
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.630
which is our theme, we can actually
see what is on this object.

174
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.790
So like I said, there's colors.

175
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.010
So you can see some
predefined colors here.

176
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.792
You see the background is this, muted is
that, primary is this, secondary is that.

177
00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:32.900
It's pretty simple.

178
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.198
Here's even a text and
just to show you the power of this,

179
00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:41.027
if I were to go to my theme, and let's say
I wanted to change the colors right quick.

180
00:08:41.027 --> 00:08:46.281
I could say colors, I'm just gonna
take whatever Roboto had there for

181
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:49.754
their colors,
I'm gonna spread over that and

182
00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:54.269
then I'm going to change
the background to be yellow.

183
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:56.510
That's kinda nasty.

184
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.087
So if we do that now
the background's yellow.

185
00:08:59.087 --> 00:08:59.797
Right?

186
00:08:59.797 --> 00:09:03.140
Very easy, very simple.

187
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.080
I didn't even touch any component.

188
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.950
I didn't do anything.

189
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.176
It just happened automatically.

190
00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:12.137
All I did was just touch this object,
which was super simple, right?

191
00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:15.126
And if you think about it,
because this is just JavaScript,

192
00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:18.174
what's really cool about this is,
let's say for instance,

193
00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:20.869
you wanted to test the theme,
the way your site looks,

194
00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:24.678
if your entire site, every single
component used properties on this theme,

195
00:09:24.678 --> 00:09:28.940
testing how your site looks could be
as simple as just testing this object.

196
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.310
Does this object equal this object?

197
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.080
You can do a snapshot test on this object
to see if it equals what it was before

198
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.000
to make sure your site always
looks the same, right?

199
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.390
There's something that you can do there.

200
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.120
So it gets really powerful.

201
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.930
And obviously, you can see the power
when it comes to extensibility.

202
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.110
You can extend themes and
do all types of stuff like that.

203
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.440
But yeah, very powerful.

204
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.880
Actually, that looks really good yellow.

205
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.130
Kinda reminds me of Kill Bill,
so that was really nice.

206
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.301
Okay, that strangely worked out.

207
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.560
I thought that was gonna be ugly,
but it was actually really dope.

208
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.000
So yeah, that's Theme UI.

209
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.200
You can see other things like
font sizes and font weights.

210
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.960
It also handles responsive
design very well.

211
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.980
I'm not gonna to get into that but
honestly,

212
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.470
it's the best use of responsive,
like the best mechanism to

213
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.380
handle responsive design that
I've ever seen in my entire life.

214
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.880
I think they do it so
well that I don't dread it anymore.

215
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.250
So, really dope there.

216
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.010
Highly recommend checking out Theme UI.

217
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.240
But enough about that.

218
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.910
Let's make our app look pretty, cuz
right now it kinda just looks gross and

219
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.190
it doesn't really do anything.

220
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:35.670
So I have all of that stuff ready for
copy and paste down here.

221
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.600
So because it is a lot of stuff,
I'm just going to copy it.

222
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.270
So the first thing is we actually are
going to create a navigation component.

223
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.660
So, go to your components folder and make
a nav.jsx and then paste this stuff in it.

224
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.110
There we go.

225
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.297
All right, so
we're gonna make a nav.jsx here.

226
00:10:57.297 --> 00:10:58.960
And I'm just gonna paste that in here.

227
00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.460
Okay.
