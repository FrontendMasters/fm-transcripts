1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.674
All right, so course, format.

2
00:00:01.674 --> 00:00:04.160
Basically, in this course, like I said,

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.520
you're gonna be following along with me as
I go through these topics in real time.

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.390
But like I said, there's no pressure for
you to keep up with me.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.370
Not that I'm going to be going fast or
not that you can't keep up.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.772
It's just there's no pressure because most
of the stuff is gonna be in this actual

7
00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:19.662
curriculum here that you can copy and
paste.

8
00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:23.906
And if not, we actually do
have a repo here at my GitHub.

9
00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:29.918
So hendrixer/nextjs-course-app, you can go
there, you can actually go to the repo.

10
00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:33.294
And what I've done there is for
every major checkpoint,

11
00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:36.044
I've made a branch that
you can check out too.

12
00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:39.690
So for instance, all throughout the
lesson, you'll see something like this at

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.370
the end of the lesson that says, hey,
you can check out to this branch.

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.350
And you'll be at
the completion of this lesson.

15
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.816
So this this is what the lesson
looks like when you're done.

16
00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:49.535
So if you didn't feel like
following along, it was too much,

17
00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.697
or for whatever reason,
if I'm going too fast.

18
00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.409
You can always check out to that
branch and catch up to where we are or

19
00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.013
whenever you would like to.

20
00:00:57.013 --> 00:00:58.213
So that's there for you as well.

21
00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:03.674
But we will just be starting from scratch
this repost here as a reference for

22
00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:04.893
you to catch up.

23
00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:08.032
And as far as what we're going
to be making in this course,

24
00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:12.210
because I like to tie in learning
something with actually making something.

25
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.060
Even if it is trivial, I still think
it just solidifies some of the topics.

26
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.651
We'll be building a SaaS note taking app
basically, it's very simple and I kept it

27
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.870
simple on purpose because I really want
to focus on the Next.js specifics.

28
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.240
And not have some really complicated
feature-heavy application get in the way.

29
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.970
I feel like we've all know
how to build apps before.

30
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.392
So let's just keep it simple and
focus on the actual framework.

31
00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.752
So that's what I'll do.

32
00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:39.101
And that's actually my philosophy
throughout this whole course is just try

33
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:42.407
to keep everything else out of the way and
focus on the Next.js specifics.

34
00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:46.687
So you'll see me glossing over
things that are required by Next.js,

35
00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:50.350
because I don't think it's
important to learn Next.js.

36
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.183
But obviously, I'm here to answer any
questions, if you feel like I'm glossing

37
00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:55.296
over something that's important,
you can ask a question.

38
00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.178
And I will be,
interacting with you all to ask, hey,

39
00:01:58.178 --> 00:02:01.205
do you want me to go back and
talk about this a little bit?

40
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:05.167
But I can assure you that you'll get what
you need from this course when it comes to

41
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:05.757
Next.js.

42
00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:10.548
Here's a little legend that you'll might
want to check out because I'll have like

43
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:14.942
these little asides or these little
quotes all throughout the curriculum.

44
00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:16.760
So if you see something like this,
it's a tip.

45
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.850
I'll usually say something like,
hey, I recommend using this or

46
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.350
doing that or go check this out.

47
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.096
So you'll see this sometimes.
A reminder is when I'm just reminding you

48
00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:28.439
like, hey, by the way, remember,
this is how this works, so don't forget.

49
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.365
Careful, you might see me warn you like,
don't do this for this reason,

50
00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.595
or be careful this might happen.

51
00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:39.003
We talked about the lesson branch,
check out the git branch name.

52
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.791
Summary is sometimes I'll just have
a really long explanation about

53
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:47.163
something and if you don't feel like
reading it, you'll just see a TLDR here,

54
00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:48.488
too long didn't read.

55
00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:53.800
And then extra wow first typo,
I just noticed that.

56
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.720
And then the next thing is
you'll see some extra info here.

57
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.790
So sometimes I will deep dive on stuff,
because I just can't help it,

58
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.730
and I think it'll be very helpful.

59
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.580
So you'll see me just take off and
deep dive on a topic for

60
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.830
a little bit that I think people
would like to know about.

61
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's go into the setup.

62
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.945
So what are you gonna need
to actually do this course?

63
00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.130
This is it.

64
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.217
You really only need
Node.js greater than 10.

65
00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:23.740
I'm using version 12.8, I believe, so
you can go to that version if you'd like.

66
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.580
But I believe anything
over 10 should be fine.

67
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.310
So you should be good there.

68
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.866
I like to use nvm or
n to manage my node versions.

69
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.794
So I recommend you do that as well.

70
00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:38.909
You can easily switch between them and,
you avoid the whole,

71
00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.755
permissions issue when you install
node globally and things like that.

72
00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:46.640
And then you also need npm or yarn.

73
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.890
npm comes installed with node,
so you should have that already.

74
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.540
I'm going to be using yarn.

75
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.220
I don't think yarn is
specifically better than npm,

76
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.660
is that I switched a long time ago.

77
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.610
And now that npm is better,
I just don't feel like switching back.

78
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.340
That's it,
I think they're both great tools.

79
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.590
You can use whichever one you want,
but I'm just going to use yarn here.

80
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.910
So that's pretty much what I'll be doing,
and that's it.

81
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.017
You don't really need anything else for
this specific course.

82
00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:14.187
So now what are you gonna learn?

83
00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:17.480
Yeah, you're learn Next.js.

84
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.460
But what specifically because there's
a lot there's so much into Next.js.

85
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.950
And I don't say that to say that
it's a complicated framework.

86
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.340
It's definitely a complicated
framework to make but because of that,

87
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.889
it's easy for us to use.

88
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.480
And there was so much that went into me
deciding what I wanted to teach in this

89
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.975
course because, like I said,
I know this framework from so many angles.

90
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:45.140
From integrating with it on lower
level primitives to using it,

91
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.170
building static sites.

92
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.000
So I kinda know it from all angles,
so I'm always trying to pick and

93
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.310
choose which will be best to talk about.

94
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.360
So here's pretty much what I
decided to cover in this course.

95
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.960
And again,
this is not like a strict list of

96
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.227
these are only things I'm going to
be talking about because I'm not.

97
00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:01.490
If you know me,
I'm gonna go off on tangents and

98
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.880
just ramble about things that I think
would be really cool and I'll do that.

99
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.020
But as far as like the text and

100
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.420
the stuff that you see on this
website it's mostly gonna follow this.

101
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.690
So, what is Next.js?

102
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.120
How does Next.js compared to React?

103
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.571
When would you use it, getting started,
creating pages and components.

104
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:27.902
Things like SEO static and dynamic
routing, navigating, styling, API routes.

105
00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:32.839
Yep, API routes, fetching data,
prerendering, deployment,

106
00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:35.492
and a little bit of JAMstack stuff.

107
00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:40.407
So it's a lot, going to happen they
were just going to see that it's just so

108
00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:45.570
delightful to work with Next.js,
they make all of this pretty easy.

109
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.150
So I'm super excited to just have
everyone know how to use it.

110
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.284
Any questions on that with the Next.js and
what we're gonna learn?

111
00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:59.082
Is there something specific that
someone was looking forward to learning

112
00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.376
that I didn't say here?

113
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.316
&gt;&gt; Think just a lot of people
are using Gatsby it sounds like so.

114
00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:09.135
&gt;&gt; Lot of people using Gatsby.

115
00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.957
&gt;&gt; You'll get into that later.

116
00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:14.413
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely get into Gatsby
because as much as I use Next.js,

117
00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:18.182
I also use a lot of Gatsby, and I work
with the Gatsby team on integrations.

118
00:06:18.182 --> 00:06:19.900
The same way I work with the Next team.

119
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.420
So I feel pretty versed in Gatsby as well.

120
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.160
In fact, this website is built on Gatsby.

121
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.290
So yeah, I can talk about Gatsby
as much as you all need me to.
