00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.985
So before we move on to API routes,
I want to talk about Typescript support so

2
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:05.622
do you want to use TypeScript?

3
00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:13.560
And they say yes, they made it super easy
to do all you have to do is make a.ts.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.163
config, or is it let's see us.com
was it Ts, Ts config dot JSON.

5
00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:20.938
&gt;&gt; Jason.

6
00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:25.850
Yeah, okay, I can't remember yeah,
there we go that's all

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.773
you got to do and then from there
if you just start this, oops.

8
00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:38.012
Right here, you can see, hey, looks like
you're trying to use type script but

9
00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:39.884
don't have a required package install.

10
00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.553
So it just by adding that file,

11
00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:44.204
It detected that I'm
trying to use Typescript.

12
00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.588
And it's trying to like
automate some stuff for me, but

13
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.221
it needs me to install some packages.

14
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:51.819
So if I just installed it, it looks
like it even detected I was using yarn,

15
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.841
which is really impressive I think you're
using NPM I might say NPM here instead.

16
00:00:55.841 --> 00:01:01.276
So I'm gonna just install that
because I do like Thai script

17
00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:07.701
I prefer Thai script and then now if
I run, you're on Dev look at that.

18
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.213
So it says we detected
Typescript in your project and

19
00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:12.210
created a Ts config JSON file for you.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.006
Like wait, what you mean so
if I go look at this Ts config boom,

21
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:18.853
they just populated with
everything I need for

22
00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:22.286
Typescript I don't have to
do anything like that to me.

23
00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:24.419
It's pretty amazing because for
the longest one,

24
00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:27.494
I was kinda like on the fence about tie
skirt, one of the biggest things for

25
00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.293
me, it was always configuring this file.

26
00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:34.063
Like, wait, how do I configure this thing,
and what's the difference between this

27
00:01:34.063 --> 00:01:38.652
target and this live versus babbles target
and live versus WebEx target and live.

28
00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:42.176
I don't understand so I always kind of
just avoided it and we'll just go copy and

29
00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:44.611
paste someone else's and
not know I do understand it.

30
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:49.141
So it's not so intimidating but
still this is very nice and

31
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:53.403
it's insurance will work
very well with a next stuff.

32
00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:59.026
Our change one of these to TSX I
guess you can see it's already

33
00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:06.203
breaking because Typescript doesn't
know anything about this sx, right?

34
00:02:06.203 --> 00:02:12.180
So, it's already working it's already
breaking so this will obviously fail

35
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.533
if I tried to run this let's see I guess
they just ignore those types of errors.

36
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:24.027
That's really cool there we go so
yeah, it still works with Typescript

37
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:29.352
out of the box really good to go so
pretty nice can't argue with that.

38
00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:34.266
That's the easiest Typescript
setup I've ever seen [LAUGH] if I,

39
00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.779
find me better one, I'll wait.

40
00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.145
I'll wait for you let me know because
I haven't that's pretty legit in fact,

41
00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:44.600
I don't know why everyone
doesn't do that like ridiculous.
