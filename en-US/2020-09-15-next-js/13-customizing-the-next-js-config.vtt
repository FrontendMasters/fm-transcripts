00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.474
Now, we're going to talk
about customising Next js.

2
00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:08.972
And the configuration of it and
stuff like that.

3
00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:16.150
So, like I said out of the box, Next.js
has a really good experience, right?

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.102
Because it handles a lot of things for
us like the Webpack, Babel.

5
00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:24.887
So all the different rendering modes that
we'll talk about, pretty much everything.

6
00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:28.873
But if you wanna hook into that,
and change some of it, opt in,

7
00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:31.443
opt out, extend, do things like that.

8
00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:34.169
We actually have this next config js file,

9
00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.630
that you can put on
the root of your project.

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.124
And that allows you to hook
into the next day as, and

11
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.384
you can pretty much do
whatever you want there.

12
00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:47.452
Specific to the Next js or
not specific to next year,

13
00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:49.490
is things like changing Webpack.

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.823
And this is where you would add
support for sass or stylus.

15
00:00:55.823 --> 00:01:02.170
Or less or maybe there's an SVG Loader for
Webpack that you want to turn, react.

16
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.066
SVG files into react components,
something like that,

17
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.035
like literally everything you
normally would have done.

18
00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.920
You would do it here.

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.891
For like create react app,
the equivalent would be, okay.

20
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:15.923
Create react app,
doesn't have the loader that I want or

21
00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.345
doesn't have have it configured
the way that I want from there.

22
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:23.591
I think you'd have to do like the eject,
the configuration,

23
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.725
yourself that you can modify.

24
00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:27.962
And then you can no longer
use create react app.

25
00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.746
Well, there's no eject feature here,

26
00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:31.852
because you're always
gonna be using nextjs.

27
00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:35.911
You just can extend it by
doing something like this.

28
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:40.773
So, to me, this is a better experience,
than having to opt out of something.

29
00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:44.016
And that's because next
js as is a framework and

30
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:49.861
not a set of built in opinions, that are
managed by some scripts, it's a framework.

31
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.171
So that's the difference.

32
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.879
Other frameworks kind of
do something similar.

33
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.407
I know knucks,
which is a view version of Next js,

34
00:01:56.407 --> 00:02:00.613
basically it's very inspired
by next as is called knucks.

35
00:02:00.613 --> 00:02:03.021
They do something very similar
with their configuration file,

36
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.172
where you can just configure
everything from that file.

37
00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:06.743
So pretty legit.

38
00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:13.532
And obviously, Gatsby does something
very similar as well, so yeah.

39
00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:17.115
So yeah, like I said,
you can create this config file, and

40
00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:19.990
basically there's a couple
ways you can do it.

41
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.316
So if we come down here,
we can say next.config.js,

42
00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:31.472
and you can module.exports.

43
00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:36.350
This object like this all right, and
you really don't have anything else.

44
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.812
In fact, if I were to restart this you
can see the first right there it says.

45
00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:44.000
Found a change and the next day is config,
restart the service changed in effect.

46
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.232
That means next as is looking for
this file, like it knows it exists.

47
00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.911
It's a special file name, so
the name is very important.

48
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.560
So restart the server here,
you'll see I get a warning.

49
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.725
So warning, detected next config.js, but
there was no export configuration found,

50
00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:01.392
is basically saying there's nothing here.

51
00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:04.782
Now, I don't know if you did that
intentionally, or not, but hey,

52
00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:06.017
there's nothing here.

53
00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:07.851
We should probably figure some stuff out,
right?

54
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:09.951
So there are a lot of different
things we can do here.

55
00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:13.181
Like for instance, and in my site here,

56
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:18.240
the course curriculum,
I'm talking about Webpack.

57
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.302
And I'll just kind of do that here.

58
00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.852
So if you wanted to change
some things about Webpack.

59
00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:25.753
Like, I don't know, maybe there was
like some really dope Webpack plugin,

60
00:03:25.753 --> 00:03:26.904
that you wanted to do.

61
00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:29.822
You can add that here,
because everything in this object.

62
00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:33.026
Is the same objects that's
on the Webpack config,

63
00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:35.864
except they're gonna merge it with theirs.

64
00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:37.910
So it's not gonna
completely blow out there.

65
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.353
So what they have is gonna merge the two.

66
00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:44.205
So you can see that I'm pretty sure it
uses a package called Webpack merge,

67
00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:46.172
that merges Webpack config smartly.

68
00:03:46.172 --> 00:03:47.392
So you can add whatever you want here.

69
00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:49.977
So versus if you have some plugin,

70
00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:53.913
that you want to add it to
my webpack plugin, right?

71
00:03:53.913 --> 00:03:56.221
You can do that.

72
00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:58.490
And this is how you can
add functionality to it.

73
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.734
So for all my Webpack people that love
getting crazy, you can still do it.

74
00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:07.122
You can do it here, and not have to opt
out of everything that they give you.

75
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.480
Pretty legit.

76
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.212
So that's one way.

77
00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:14.341
The other way is that gives you
just a little bit more power,

78
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.918
as you can return a function.

79
00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:20.915
And this function has two arguments
you get, what's called the face.

80
00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:25.208
Then you get this object here,
that has a property on it called.

81
00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:30.769
I think it's called default config, maybe
I'm pretty sure that's what it's called.

82
00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:34.444
So the default config is literally
the default configuration for

83
00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:38.803
your next config, the one that gets
created for you, if you don't make one.

84
00:04:38.803 --> 00:04:42.023
So with this, we have this phase here.

85
00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:44.492
This phase is gonna be a string,

86
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:49.076
is actually gonna come from
something called, let me see.

87
00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:53.376
I think like imports from next.js,

88
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:57.822
constants, yeah, next constants.

89
00:04:57.822 --> 00:05:00.255
And, basically,
there are some phases in here.

90
00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:05.880
There we go, so
you can see phase production builds,

91
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.152
phase production server, server prop,
different things like that.

92
00:05:10.152 --> 00:05:13.410
So, I'm gonna say, phase production build.

93
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.932
And basically,
I can do something like this.

94
00:05:14.932 --> 00:05:21.503
I can say, if phase triple
equals phase production build.

95
00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:23.927
Basically what this means is,

96
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:29.343
if I'm running a production build
inside of next js, run this code.

97
00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:34.072
So this allows me to change
the configuration depending on

98
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.912
what next js is doing.

99
00:05:35.912 --> 00:05:40.089
So a better example, would be let's
look at phase development build, and

100
00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.161
see how that goes.

101
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:46.441
So I'm pretty sure that one
is phase development server,

102
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:48.710
or something like that.

103
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.632
So we say,
phase equals phase development server, and

104
00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:55.724
then we do something
like this console log.

105
00:05:55.724 --> 00:05:57.710
I'm in dev mode here.

106
00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.864
And you can return an object here,
which will be your config.

107
00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:05.792
But for now it's gonna return
the default config, and

108
00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:08.542
also return the default config down here,
right?

109
00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:12.105
So we can do that and
then when we start this.

110
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.073
Yeah, I forgot you can't do.

111
00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:21.535
This config file doesn't
get compiled by Babel, so

112
00:06:21.535 --> 00:06:24.374
you can't do imports and stuff like that.

113
00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:30.640
So we got to go back to common js,
and use some good requires.

114
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.110
There we go.

115
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.198
So require that.

116
00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:41.500
And you see right here,
I'm in dev mode, right?

117
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.618
So you can see I'm in dev mode again,

118
00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:48.652
that's because it loaded up a bundle,
right?

119
00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.024
This is a full stack app.

120
00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:52.955
So we have a server side build,
and we have a client side built.

121
00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:54.563
And this was a demo for both of them.

122
00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:57.171
So a lot of that that twice.

123
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.532
And yeah, it's pretty powerful.

124
00:06:58.532 --> 00:07:02.079
So you can do some pretty,
pretty interesting stuff here.

125
00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:06.122
And this is just one use
case of what you can do.

126
00:07:06.122 --> 00:07:09.553
So yeah, pretty interesting convention.

127
00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:11.241
Wow, I did not mean to close that.

128
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:16.616
You open that back up, there we go, okay.

129
00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:21.122
All right, and then I added a link here,
that links to all the different phases.

130
00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:24.553
It's not documented in their docs,
at least not where I could find.

131
00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:29.663
But if you just go look in their
source code, you can find them here.

132
00:07:29.663 --> 00:07:32.896
So, all different types of stuff,
these four phases here, so

133
00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:36.015
we got export,
we'll talk about export production build.

134
00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:40.248
I talked about that, production server is
when it's live running on a server and

135
00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:41.003
production.

136
00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:45.233
And develop the servers when
you run next by itself.

137
00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:47.191
So yeah pretty hot.

138
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:48.793
Pretty nice here.

139
00:07:48.793 --> 00:07:50.933
I'm a big fan of is
looking at source code.

140
00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:52.081
I go look at source code.

141
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:58.412
I think more than I do documentation,
so it's just I prefer sometimes.

142
00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:02.692
So yeah, I'll do that,
any questions on that?

143
00:08:02.692 --> 00:08:04.151
On the config.

144
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:09.891
&gt;&gt; You have to modify the default config,
or you just return a config object?

145
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.267
&gt;&gt; For question, so I'm not,

146
00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:17.633
I usually don't modify arguments.

147
00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:22.675
I try to keep things mutable,
because you might cause side effects.

148
00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:25.892
So and especially because I'm pretty
sure they do the merging for you.

149
00:08:25.892 --> 00:08:27.979
So I think it's safe to
do something like this.

150
00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:31.683
If you're gonna do some modifications,
as you can just spread over the default

151
00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:33.854
config, and
then you can make your mods here.

152
00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:36.443
So whatever your mods are,
yeah, you can make them here.

153
00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:39.173
So if you were gonna do
something like Webpack,

154
00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:42.121
then you would do your Webpack stuff here,
right?

155
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.719
So you just spread over
the default config, before and

156
00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:47.333
it's brand new object and
then you do your stuff here.

157
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:51.030
And I think that's a little safer
than trying to modify this thing.

158
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.058
Which yeah,

159
00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:57.672
I would stray away from modifying
arguments in JavaScript in general.

160
00:08:57.672 --> 00:09:02.630
I would always steer away from that,
especially objects and things like that.
