WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.430
API routes.

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.420
This is where it gets crazy,
what is this next.js thing?

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.348
Yeah, it gets crazy,

4
00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:12.150
this is where it flexes a little bit,
it just kind of shows off.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.167
So yeah, API routes, and

6
00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:16.260
I talked about a little bit but yeah,
next.js is a full-stack framework.

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.880
So fullstack as in it has a server too.

8
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.205
And I'm not just talking about
the server it uses for development.

9
00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:25.790
No, it's a webpack dev server.

10
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.193
I'm not also talking about the server
uses to render your pages.

11
00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:34.336
Because yeah, it does have that, but
I'm literally talking about you can

12
00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:38.825
make an API, and serve data right next
to your code like a monolith, basically.

13
00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:42.668
And it does it in a way where you don't
have to worry about which framework you're

14
00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:43.864
gonna use on the server.

15
00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:48.263
So not only does it help you get started
on the front end to build things faster

16
00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:50.002
using something like React.

17
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.493
It actually helps you get started on
the back end by just creating handlers.

18
00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:55.840
You don't have to create routes.

19
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.960
You don't have to create anything.

20
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.352
You just make the handlers,

21
00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.724
which you can think of them as
the components of the back end, right?

22
00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:06.188
So it's really beautiful how it works,
actually.

23
00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:08.338
And you probably already know how it
works because we've been doing it

24
00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:08.890
this whole time.

25
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.780
So if you wanna make API routes in Next,
which I do recommend

26
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.520
doing if you have an API that's only gonna
be used by the app that you're making.

27
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730
Then I'd say say,
you should just put it there.

28
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.240
All you have to do is head
over to your pages like this.

29
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.230
Make a new folder inside of the pages and
you call it API.

30
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.050
That's it.

31
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.830
So now everything that you put inside,
I don't know, it may be a folder.

32
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.890
What is that?

33
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.630
That's supposed to be an API?

34
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.620
What is that?

35
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.150
I don't know.
[LAUGH] It reminds me of

36
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.390
the green slime from Nickelodeon
back in the day as a reminder.

37
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.008
So anything we put inside of
the API is going to be a route,

38
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.340
it's an endpoint that we hit on our API,

39
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.850
very similar to the way that we
added pages inside of pages.

40
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.812
So again, this also hints at
that you can't name anything,

41
00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:06.791
you can't just put whatever
name you want inside the pages.

42
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:09.449
So we know we can use _app for a page.

43
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.989
And now we're learning we can use API for
a page.

44
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.090
So we have an actual page called API.

45
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.875
This isn't gonna work for you.

46
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:21.401
[LAUGH] I'm pretty sure you can change
this configuration in the next config.

47
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:25.381
But I would just maybe just change your
route and put it in a sub path somewhere,

48
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.510
so that way doesn't conflict with this.

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.088
Cuz I think if the API is not on
the route of pages, it's fine.

50
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:35.931
And if we put API inside of notes,
I think you're good to go there.

51
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.809
But putting it here, no,
it's gonna treat it is an API.

52
00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.020
So that's how that works.

53
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.856
And then as far as,
how do the routing work?

54
00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.298
The exact same way as pages.

55
00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.596
The exact same syntax.

56
00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:49.272
So for instance, if I were to make
a route to the index of my API,

57
00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.496
guess what I'd have to make?

58
00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:56.591
Index.js, and now I can go to /API and
do a request there once I

59
00:02:56.591 --> 00:03:01.930
actually fill this out, and
we'll talk about that in a minute.

60
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.881
If I want to make some sub-paths here,
for instance, I know for

61
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:12.490
our note taking app, I think I have
it listed down here, or is that Next?

62
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.671
Yeah, I think that's the Next.

63
00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.483
Yeah, we'll get there.

64
00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:18.252
So for a note taking app, we're gonna
have /notes and stuff like that.

65
00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.514
It's the same thing.

66
00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:27.060
So if I have user, and
then I wanna be able to get all the users.

67
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.420
So I'll make an index for that.

68
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.880
And then maybe I just wanna
get one user by an ID.

69
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.658
So I'll say give me the ID of that user.

70
00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:34.591
It's the same thing.

71
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:36.315
It's the same thing as the routes.

72
00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:40.520
May even have the catch all routes too,
so everything's exactly the same.

73
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.980
But this allows us to do an API rally.

74
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.110
So pretty powerful.

75
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.178
And that's how you create the routes.

76
00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:51.342
And when you start it up,
you're gonna get those routes as well.
