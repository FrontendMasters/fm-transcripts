00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.280
I love Next.js.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.700
I think that the conventions and

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.210
opinions they put in a framework make
it a pleasant framework to work with.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.920
And I think at this point you know enough
to be able to build an application.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.480
Because, like I said, the application
side of Next.js is just react,

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.310
which is why we didn't cover a lot of
that because there's nothing new there.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.996
It's just react.

8
00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:26.940
I just wanted to focus on
the Next.js specific stuff, which is

9
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.160
everything that's around reacts and
around data fetching and things like that.

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.194
So we breeze over a lot of that
stuff because it is just react, and

11
00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:37.900
even front end masses has
tons of courses on that.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
So I kind of just breezed past it.

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.343
But at this point, yeah,

14
00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:45.390
you do know about 80% of what
it takes to build a Next.js app.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.076
Everything else is very advanced or
altering integrations and plugins and

16
00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:49.960
stuff like that.

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.171
But as far as building an app,
you pretty much got it.

18
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:56.880
And it feels like, that was pretty easy,
that's because it was meant to be easy.

19
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.020
They did a really good job with
the framework, it should be pretty easy.

20
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.975
So, yeah, that's kind of what I wanted
to share with you guys on Next.js.
