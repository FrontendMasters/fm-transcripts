1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.014
So I'm gonna go ahead and
pull down that repo, I have it here.

2
00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.542
I'm gonna check out to the start branch,
if you're on the master branch,

3
00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:11.340
you'll actually see the complete repo,
completely done.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.290
We don't wanna start there,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.744
we actually just wanna start at like
a very blank bare minimum repo.

6
00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:19.546
I mean, you could even just
make a brand new one here,

7
00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:20.880
you don't even have to pull this down.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.136
If you don't wanna follow along or

9
00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:25.272
wanna follow along no this you just wanna
have your own separate repo, that's fine.

10
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.462
cuz I'm basically starting
from scratch here.

11
00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:33.823
If you open this up, you can see what
I have here is literally nothing.

12
00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:38.142
So [LAUGH] there's no source code and
there's just some dot files and

13
00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.362
a package.json.

14
00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:42.542
So this is where we're gonna be starting,
we're really gonna do this from scratch.

15
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:48.474
So, let's talk about what you or
how you can get started with Next.js,

16
00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:53.444
and there's really two ways and
they're both stupid easy.

17
00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:56.647
So let's talk about the easy way and
then we'll talk about the other easy way.

18
00:00:56.647 --> 00:01:01.366
The first easy way is to use
the create-next-app, ere,

19
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:06.179
like here, forgot it,
used to create-next-app CLI, so

20
00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.692
if you're familiar with npx,
you can use npx create-next-app.

21
00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:16.189
If you don't know what npx basically
you can think of it as like

22
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.362
a inline installer for a CLI.

23
00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:23.342
So instead of installing the CLI first,
and then calling the CLI you can just put

24
00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:27.503
npx in front of it and it'll one
time install the CLI right now, and

25
00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:31.914
then execute the command without it
actually being on your computer.

26
00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:36.183
So if you're npm you can do that, if you
like yarn, you can yarn and do that.

27
00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:41.311
So that's very easy way it'll
scaffold out a lot of stuff for you.

28
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:45.050
Really good, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna do this other way,

29
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.733
which is also still pretty easy,
we're just gonna do it manually.

30
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:53.292
So, to set one up from scratch, all we
need to do is install three dependencies,

31
00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:57.919
so if we're using npm, you can do
npm-instal-react-react-dom, and next,

32
00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.141
which is the big one.

33
00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:03.809
If you're using yarn you can use yarn,
add these things, so I'm using yarn,

34
00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:08.433
someone's gonna copy that, and
I'm just gonna yarn add those things here.

35
00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:13.351
And like I said, it's really just three
dependencies, react, react-dom, and next,

36
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.043
there really is nothing else.

37
00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:17.746
There's no router, at next router, or

38
00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:21.962
there's none of that, it's all here,
it's all ready to go.

39
00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:27.775
So next, we need to add some helpful
scripts through our package.json,

40
00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:30.692
so you just copy these scripts here.

41
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:36.260
And we'll just go ahead and
put those into our package.json.

42
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.740
And don't forget to put your commas there,
otherwise your thing will break.

43
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.902
And let's talk about
the scripts a little bit.

44
00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:46.647
So the first one here is the dev script,
which just runs next, and

45
00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:52.257
basically what this does is it's just
going to run your Next.js application

46
00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:58.066
in a development mode, using something
very similar to hot module reloading.

47
00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:02.813
If you've heard of that before,
well I think Next.js calls it like

48
00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:07.326
fast reloading or something like that,
so we get that for free.

49
00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:11.164
If you run the build command,
it's gonna build your application and

50
00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:12.831
get it ready for production.

51
00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:16.007
And then you run the start command
is actually gonna start that build.

52
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:19.484
And so basically only use these two when
you're ready to go to production and

53
00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:22.542
you'll almost always just use
this one when you're developing.

54
00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:28.324
So, but my computer just booted up
cuz VSCode like just eats up my CPU,

55
00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:32.153
so I'm just gonna just
kill that right quick.

56
00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:37.402
Let me see, I actually its zoom,
I thought it was VSCode this time.

57
00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:43.912
Usually it's VSCode that has like 110%
of my CPU but okay, it's all good.

58
00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:48.222
Okay, let's go back to the actual thing
here, where we talk about those commands.

59
00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:51.464
And like I said, remember,
Next.js is a full stack framework.

60
00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:55.242
So by default, it needs to be hosted
on a platform that supports Node,

61
00:03:55.242 --> 00:03:59.866
and the reason I'm saying that is because
you'll see this next build his next start.

62
00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:03.403
If you've ever only been shipping static
websites, you wouldn't have a start

63
00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:07.071
command, like why would you just start
a static website doesn't make any sense?

64
00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:09.827
Well, that's because this
is a node framework, and

65
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:12.962
by default, cuz you can opt out of this,
you don't have to.

66
00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:16.745
But by default, it does the need to
be deployed somewhere with Next.js,

67
00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.401
or I'm sorry, with Node.js.

68
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.192
And we'll talk about deployment later on,
but just remember that.
