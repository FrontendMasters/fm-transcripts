1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
All right, let's talk about deployment.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.960
So depending on how you build your app,
we'll determine where you can deploy to.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.290
So we talked about the different
rendering modes and stuff like that, but

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
we didn't really talk about like the
different ways to build the Next.js app.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.652
So by default,

6
00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:20.570
a Next.js app has to be deployed to
an environment that supports Node.js.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.330
I did talk about that.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.290
And that's because this is a full stack
framework that uses as you've learned,

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.890
server side rendering, API's,
all different types of stuff.

10
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.970
So you need a Node.js environment
because it is a live server that's

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.390
actually running.

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.630
So yeah, you will need that.

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.180
If you don't make any API routes,
you still need a Node.js app or

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.210
a Node.js environment by default.

15
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.840
So if you don't want that you can use you
can build your app in a different way.

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.090
And that is something new,
it's called Next Export.

17
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.120
Basically what that does is it's
going to export your Next.js

18
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.520
app as purely static,
it's literally going to build it static.

19
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.282
No server, no runtime, deploy straight
to a CDN, deploy wherever you want and

20
00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:10.670
Netlify, Vercel, anywhere,
you can deploy it.

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.020
But there are some gotchas with using
the export that you can check out here,

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620
and I'm not really gonna, there's a lot.

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.280
This is a lot of gotchas.

24
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310
So you can check them out there.

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.400
But honestly, at the end of the day,
if you just go at Vercel,

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.050
the people who made next as to deploy your
site, they pretty much handle everything.

27
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.920
I mean,
if anyone knows how to handle a Next.js,

28
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.150
it's definitely people who made it.

29
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.440
And it just so happens they also
made a deployment platform.

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.480
So it kind of just works.

31
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.900
I'm pretty sure they use AWS
as their infrastructure.

32
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.710
So it's on AWS anyway,
which is pretty good.

33
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.580
So yeah, I would just use
Vercel to deploy your stuff.

34
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.318
And with that being said, like I said,
if you need to deploy to a Node.js

35
00:01:55.318 --> 00:01:57.570
environment that's gonna
rule out certain places.

36
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.930
So I know Netlify is a popular one for
a lot of people.

37
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.240
You can't use Netlify by
default with a Next.js app,

38
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.600
there's like plugins and hacks and
different things you can do.

39
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.475
But the only way I've been able to see
it work is if you find some way to get

40
00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:16.804
Next.js, you got to make like
a custom server with Next.js.

41
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:20.193
Which you can, we didn't talk about that,
but you can make your own custom server,

42
00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:22.601
your entire custom server instead
of the one that they use.

43
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:26.593
And then hook that up to Netlify
serverless functions and

44
00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:30.690
have the service functions
act as the Next.js' server.

45
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630
And it's just to me just a lot of work.

46
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.830
Like why would you do that?

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.120
So it's really not worth it.

48
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.470
I guess if you work at a company that
only ever uses a certain technology and

49
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.330
you have to use it, then yeah.

50
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.850
But I would just use
a different technology.

51
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.460
I would either change the provider or
I would change the framework.

52
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.830
I wouldn't really do all of that.

53
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.740
So yeah, I would use Vercel.

54
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.050
It handles everything out of the gate.

55
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.090
One thing though in our app is,
yeah, we did hard code those API URL.

56
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.720
So before you deploy, use the environment
variables to switch out to the live URLs,

57
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.070
otherwise, that's obviously
not gonna work, right?

58
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.550
It's gonna say like local host,
or stuff like that.

59
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.630
So, we're gonna deploy to Vercel, and
like I said, is actually pretty easy.

60
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.500
All you have to do is install the command
line and then run this command.

61
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.160
That's it.

62
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.220
You don't have to do anything else.

63
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.870
And then you're done.

64
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.260
It's really that easy.

65
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.010
Have you ever heard of a tool
called Now a couple years ago?

66
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.550
These are the creators of Now.

67
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.140
And Now as a CLI that basically
deploy your website right now.

68
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.910
It was that easy.

69
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.470
I think that's kind of where they started.

70
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.954
And then they integrated to and
now they're Vercel.

71
00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.941
But that same philosophy of like getting
something out there as fast as possible is

72
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.693
still there with inside of Vercel.

73
00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.510
So how do you recommend doing that?

74
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.700
So, I think that's what we're gonna do.

75
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.100
The other way to do it is,
if you already have a project on GitHub,

76
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.430
if you already push this up,
it's on GitHub.

77
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.560
You can just go into
your Vercel account and

78
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.410
you can just say, connect to this repo.

79
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.960
And then it also just
works that way as well.

80
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.820
And that will give you a better
development workflow because you'll

81
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.760
get like preview branches on every PR.

82
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.720
They'll send you, it'll post screenshots
to your PR for you by default to show you

83
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.200
the diffs between pages that changed,
visual diffs which is really dope.

84
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.640
There's a lot of stuff you can
do there that you get for free.

85
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.660
So yeah,
highly recommend to get that workflow.
