00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.120
Hey everybody, thanks for tuning in, and
welcome to introduction to Next.js with

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.005
me, your instructor,
Scott Moss in Frontend Masters.

3
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.670
So, this course has been highly
requested in Frontend Masters, and

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.190
I feel really honored to
be the one to teach it.

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.403
And it means a lot to me, because I have
so much love for this framework, and

6
00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:21.851
I have so much love for
this company, Frontend Masters.

7
00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:26.254
But as far as when it comes the Next.js,
I mean, I use it in a lot of ways,

8
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:30.011
whether it's for building out blogs and
static websites, or

9
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:33.500
even full blown full stack applications,
even API's.

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.990
I also do tons of integration with
it at the company that I'm at, and

11
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.130
we work closely with the team at Vercel,
who are the creators of Next.js.

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.800
So I really love this framework from
all angles, and I know there are so

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.240
many people that are qualified to teach.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.360
So, I feel really honored to be the one
to deliver this framework to you, and

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.380
just express my love for this framework
as you'll see and hear a lot from me.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.070
So, let's just get started.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.050
Let me bring my mouse back over here.

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.370
So, this course is gonna
be a little different,

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.200
compared to how I would
normally do my courses.

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.690
Whereas before I might have a repo
with some text and some branches, and

21
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.780
you go through the text and
you get them to pass and

22
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.130
you move on, this one is gonna be
more of a follow along type format.

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.620
But don't worry, no pressure,
you're not forced to fall on,

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.880
you're encouraged, but there are a ton
of resources are gonna keep you.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.932
So the first thing is this website here.

26
00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:35.234
So if you navigate to hendrix.github.io,
which is my GitHub Pages URL,

27
00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:42.060
my username is Hendrix Sir after my son
Hendrix, and the URL is Next.js course.

28
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.443
Fun fact, if you just go to the route,
you'll actually see this website,

29
00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:50.895
which is the first open source library
that I ever made six years ago when I was

30
00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:52.026
learning to code.

31
00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:56.046
It was an animation library for Angular,
and it ended up getting 10,000 stars or

32
00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:57.100
something like that.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.560
And this is actually
the open source library that

34
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.290
introduced me into the Angular team,
into the open source world,

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.860
and allowed me to speak at conferences and
stuff like that.

36
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.480
Literally, this is the first
thing that I ever made.

37
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.611
And I was taken back when
I went to this website,

38
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:12.331
because I haven't seen it in so long.

39
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.992
And the fact that it still runs on Angular
version, I don't know, like one dot two or

40
00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:19.230
something like that, I don't know,
it's still pretty impressive.

41
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.790
So, I was kinda taken back by that.

42
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.930
But here we go to the actual course.

43
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.520
So, yeah, if we go to here,

44
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.660
I'll be using this as a reference
to everything that we do.

45
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.210
So, I'll try to stay on topic
of what's actually here.

46
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.120
And you'll see there's gonna be
a lot of things in here to help you

47
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.910
stay up to speed as well, you can just,
there's gonna be tons of things for

48
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.560
you to copy and paste,
and stuff like that.

49
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.560
So, what we'll do is,
we'll just jump right in and go into these

50
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.590
table of contents, and we'll see all the
other resources we need to get started.

51
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.240
So I'm just gonna start with
this introduction here.

52
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.501
Basically, so, this course is gonna
be an introduction in Next.js, and

53
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.298
we're gonna talk about all
the things we're gonna cover, but

54
00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:03.481
we won't be going into
really advanced things.

55
00:03:03.481 --> 00:03:07.836
At least not consistently, I will be
talking about advanced things because I

56
00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:11.993
just can't help it, but the curriculum
isn't designed to go that deep.

57
00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:16.165
So this is gonna be a really nice
introduction from my perspective,

58
00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:19.982
on how I think someone would
benefit from learning Next.js.

59
00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:23.115
And of course, there's other guides and
tutorials, and even their documentation.

60
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:27.286
And Next.js website is actually really
good, they have this follow along thing,

61
00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:30.983
where you get points and scores for
going through the documentation, and

62
00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:32.722
you get a quiz and stuff like that.

63
00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:34.380
It's actually really good.

64
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.440
So there are tons of really good resources
out there, this is just my twist on it,

65
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.930
my flavor.

66
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.740
So, who are you?

67
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.700
Basically, you know some react,

68
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.440
if you know some react then
this course is perfect for you.

69
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400
But it's also perfect for anyone who
maybe doesn't really know React, but

70
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
they do know web development,
maybe they've come from another framework.

71
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.360
I think you're gonna be fine here.

72
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.857
I'm doing my best to stay on topic
with Next.js specifics, and not so

73
00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:05.141
much of the things that are required
by Next.js, which is React.

74
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.349
So I won't be talking too
much about React in general,

75
00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.089
I'll just be focusing
on the Next.js stuff.

76
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:15.040
If you wanna learn React, Frontend Masters
has tons of courses on React.

77
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.730
I think Brian Hold actually just taught
one recently, so you can check out his,

78
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.670
I wanna say it's V5 intro,
V5 if am correct Mark, is it V5?

79
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

80
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.280
&gt;&gt; So check that one out,
it's really good.

81
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.710
There's tons of others on there as well.

82
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.863
But if you are a React pro and you're just
like, yeah, I've been doing React forever,

83
00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:34.064
I'm on the React core team.

84
00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:38.377
Okay, this course is still for you as
well, because again, this is just my spin,

85
00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:40.503
my perspective on what Next.js is, and

86
00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:44.300
I have no doubt that you can read
documentation and go from there.

87
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.671
This is just how I feel would, this is
how I would have liked to learn Next.js.

88
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.320
And I just wanted to share
my path towards that.

89
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.007
And this course is also gonna cover
a decent amount of JAMstack practices,

90
00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:01.042
and the reason I put this series is, a lot
of people ask me, JAMstack, JAMstack,

91
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.177
what about JAMstack?

92
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:06.404
And I think I just wanna talk a little
bit about that, because as you'll see

93
00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:10.578
the company that I'm at actually just,
is JAMstack, that's all we do.

94
00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:14.750
So I feel like I know a lot about that,
and that's pretty much all I do every day.

95
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.570
And how to use JAMstack with
Next.js might not be obvious,

96
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.480
although new things are coming
out that make it obvious.

97
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.590
So, I'll talk a little bit about that too,
but

98
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.630
that stuff is also kinda advanced
right now, but we'll get into it.

99
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.585
And a lot of the learnings that you'll
see, like said are specific to Next.js,

100
00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:35.120
but they're also very generic
things that you can carry along

101
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.960
to other frameworks as well.

102
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.090
So, what can you expect?

103
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.755
The class's goal is basically to walk away
with the ability to create an app using

104
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:47.250
Next.js, and have a great foundation
to learn more advanced topics.

105
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.040
That's basically it.

106
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.180
So I feel like after you take this course,
you should be able to make the Next.js app

107
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.220
from start to finish, production ready,
because it's actually free with Next.js.

108
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.284
And not have to worry about what's going
on, and you'll see how in a minute.

109
00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:05.200
And a lot of that isn't going to do with
the fact that I think my curriculum is

110
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.372
good, is actually because
the framework is just that good,

111
00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:10.740
that it kinda gives you that for free.

112
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.910
This is an open source website.

113
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.470
So, if you see some typos,
which I'm famous for typos,

114
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.660
but I did use Grammarly this time, so
maybe there aren't that many typos.

115
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.620
But if you do, you can make a pull
request and help me fix them.

116
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.830
So, thank you.

117
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.220
A little bit about myself.

118
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.540
This is me trying to get super sane,
because I just love dragon,

119
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.920
it's one of my favorite enemies,
I watch it all the time.

120
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.890
Yeah my name is Scott Moss, I'm the CEO
and co-founder of a company called Tipe.

121
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.200
We are a headless CMS,
if you don't know what that is,

122
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.100
you can just think of word
press without a page builder.

123
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.500
So we just, we let you design a schema,
any shape, any form,

124
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.420
any way that you want.

125
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.910
And we allow you and your team to create
content based off that schema, and then we

126
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.710
just delivered to you over an API to any
app, any platform, anywhere you want.

127
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.900
Anything that has internet connection,
we can send content to it.

128
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.340
And at the end of the day,
that's basically what we are, and

129
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.990
we've been doing this for a little over
two years now, so it's been a blast.

130
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.130
Outside of the code, I'm in so
a lot of things, specifically fitness,

131
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.310
especially basketball.

132
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.980
Recently I picked up hot yoga
because I'm not flexible, and

133
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.180
I'm trying to get flexible,

134
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.570
and hot yoga is actually the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life, but I love it.

135
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.160
So I'm doing a lot of that.

136
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.260
I do like calisthenics,
I don't really lift weights anymore,

137
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.530
something like a lot of body weight stuff.

138
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.670
I'm also into building gaming computers,
it's kind of my thing now.

139
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.200
Lately, I've been into building the most
powerful computer I can in the smallest

140
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.670
form factor, without sacrificing things
like thermal quality and stuff like that.

141
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.300
But I also play games.

142
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.320
So if you play first person
shooters like Overwatch,

143
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.850
Call of Duty, I always play with people,
I even just tweet out sometimes,

144
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.420
like yo who wants to play and
I literally just play with anyone.

145
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.760
So, if you wanna go a couple rounds,
let me know down to play.

146
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.950
And then if you also know me,
you know that I'm really into fashion,

147
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.360
specifically collecting sneakers.

148
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.670
Haven't got any lately with
the pandemic and stuff,

149
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.840
because I mean, I don't even go anywhere.

150
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.721
I haven't actually put on real
shoes in quite some time.

151
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:22.135
So I still collect sneakers,
I'm still watching, I'm still looking.

152
00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.400
So, we'll see how that goes.

153
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.550
Currently I'm living in Sacramento,
California with my family.

154
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.100
And before that, I was living in
San Francisco, Oakland, LA, and

155
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.740
San Diego, but I'm not from California.

156
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.850
I'm originally from Atlanta, but
joining the military, the Navy brought me

157
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.220
out to California a little over ten years
ago, and I've been here ever since.

158
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.550
So, I don't think I'll leave this place,
I kinda love it.

159
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.559
And yeah, that's basically a lot about me.

160
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.570
[LAUGH] And
special thanks to Frontend Masters.

161
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.460
Like I said,
this wouldn't be possible without them.

162
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.300
If you've never met the team or interact
with the team of Frontend Masters,

163
00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.900
I'll just tell you this.

164
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.270
They're the best team out there.

165
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:07.130
Just, I mean, it's more than a
partnership, they really are family to me.

166
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.830
I hang out with these folks all the time,
we play games together,

167
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.470
they help me with all
different types of things.

168
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.050
It's just really a great environment
with them and it's always fun.

169
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.230
So, I just feel honored to
be part of the team, and

170
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.212
to be able to offer any type of
value like teaching this course.

171
00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:26.740
So I'm super thankful and big thanks for
them for getting all this set up.

172
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.670
Look at this studio here in my house.

173
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.020
So yeah, it's really awesome.

174
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.980
Thanks Frontend Masters,
you guys are awesome.

175
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.730
And let's head over to
the course overview.

176
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.180
Also I realized I forgot to mention,

177
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.170
if you prefer a lighting, if you haven't
clicked this yet, you can click that.

178
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.220
You can get a nice lightning
if you prefer that way.

179
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.823
I like to keep things dark, so
I'm gonna go back to my dark theme here.
