00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:00.906
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so

2
00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:04.619
let's get started actually
getting into our application.

3
00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:08.009
I'm gonna walk you through what
we're gonna be building first and

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.534
then what the finished product will
look like and what's expected.

5
00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.021
And then we're gonna go in and
write the mutations and

6
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:18.134
queries in GraphQL to
enable that experience.

7
00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:21.664
So let's do that.

8
00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:24.826
I think I have it fully running here.

9
00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:25.793
No, I gotta start it.

10
00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:29.301
So if you are on the main
branch of the repo,

11
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.006
you'll have the fully functioning app, and

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.701
you can run it by doing npm run dev and
you can check it out.

13
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:42.573
But we're gonna be working on the client
branch because that branch has all

14
00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:44.284
the client code removed.

15
00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:47.671
But the main branch is a great
resource for you to go back and

16
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.888
check out to see how I did it the first
time I built it because when I build it

17
00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:55.792
here now it might be different,
but you'll have a version there.

18
00:00:55.792 --> 00:01:01.650
So I'm just gonna run the main version
here, and I'm gonna start this up.

19
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.789
And for me, for

20
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.795
you as well it should just redirect
it to some sign in or signup page.

21
00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:11.818
I'm just gonna do a signup right quick.

22
00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:15.585
So I'm just gonna go to /signup,
you can put whatever you want here.

23
00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:18.675
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Doesn't matter.

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.221
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
then I'm gonna hit signup, okay?

25
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:27.823
And then it'll bring you to this page
here where it's gonna be an Issues page,

26
00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:29.472
you're not gonna have any issues.

27
00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:32.683
So basically the whole point of
this app is called Parallel.

28
00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:36.267
It's a play on one of my favorite apps
I'm using right now, called Linear,

29
00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:39.683
which is a productivity tool which you
can keep track of all your tasks and

30
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:40.583
things like that.

31
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:45.221
I really love Linear, so
I made a very slimmed down version but

32
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:50.856
heavily inspired by Linear called
Parallel, so that's what this app is.

33
00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:54.593
And so if we wanna create an issue I
can click the Create Issue button.

34
00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:59.290
I can give the issue a name, I'm teaching
a course, that's what I'm doing today.

35
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.107
Teaching client side ql, and
then I can create this issue and

36
00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:06.857
then it'll show up here, right?

37
00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:10.592
And that is the whole point,
I can make another one.

38
00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:12.730
Hello, I can create that, and

39
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.099
you'll get all these issues that pop up,
they have a issue ID.

40
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.537
And then you can click on this status ring
here and you should be able to change it,

41
00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:25.405
no, change the status from whatever
it was, so changed this to Done.

42
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:29.398
I can change this to In Progress.

43
00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:31.665
And we need to enable that, so

44
00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:36.950
that seems like if you build apps before,
this is not too difficult.

45
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.855
We didn't really do anything crazy,
it's a simple CRUD operations.

46
00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:44.489
But within that whole flow from sign
up to being able to edit these issues,

47
00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.659
there's probably five queries or

48
00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.725
mutations we need to make in
GraphQL to enable this experience.

49
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:54.978
And then there's some setup we have to do
inside the repo to even make the GraphQL

50
00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:58.928
work in the first place, so there's
a couple things that need to happen.

51
00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.462
So we're gonna explore that setup.

52
00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:05.188
We're gonna talk about the different
patterns of how we create the queries,

53
00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:09.043
where do they go, how do we bring them in,
how does it glue together with React?

54
00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.132
How does all that work?

55
00:03:11.132 --> 00:03:13.883
That's what we're gonna do now, but
I wanted you to see the experience.

56
00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:16.911
There's also some other links on here, we
won't be covering any of this other stuff.

57
00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:20.578
I left this here for
people who want to build further and

58
00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:24.645
expand on this app after they've
integrated with GraphQL,

59
00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:29.525
and they wanna take that knowledge and
actually add some more features.

60
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.453
You can totally do it.

61
00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:33.747
But, yeah, I left that there for
extra credit, but

62
00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:36.668
there's not enough time in this
course to cover all of this stuff,

63
00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:39.508
and it's mostly just more of
the same of what I'm teaching you.

64
00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:43.552
So you won't be learning anything new,
you'd just be getting more reps, and

65
00:03:43.552 --> 00:03:45.524
you can get more reps on your own time.

66
00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.198
It's not probably a best
use of your time here.

67
00:03:47.198 --> 00:03:52.346
You're not gonna be building any UI stuff,
no CSS stuff, it's all just GraphQL.

68
00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:57.213
You won't even be touching JSX,
a small smidge of JSX.

69
00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:00.719
I really wanted this to
just focus on GraphQL and

70
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.268
not let's go make an app, right?

71
00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:07.669
So if you're worried about no,
I'm a fraud, I'm not good with Tailwind,

72
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.352
I'm about to be found out, no,
that's not gonna happen today.

73
00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:15.745
It's okay, nobody's good with CSS,
unless you're really good with CSS,

74
00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:17.172
there's no in between.

75
00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:18.415
We're only gonna do GraphQL.

76
00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:20.886
So I'm gonna stop my server.

77
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:25.449
I'm gonna check out to client, so
I'm gonna check out to client/0.

78
00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.855
So the way I'll do the branches is
every time I do a specific topic or

79
00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:33.414
whatever, I'll cut a new
branch on the client side.

80
00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:34.856
So this one will be client 0.

81
00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:38.052
When I make a new checkpoint,
it'll be client 1, I make another one,

82
00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:39.028
it'll be client 2.

83
00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.386
And I'll keep pushing those branches up so
you can go back and

84
00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:43.524
look at them on GitHub if you
wanna see what we just did.

85
00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:47.487
If you wanna see the full complete app,
like I said, you can just check out Main,

86
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.663
the full code front and
back is done on Main.

87
00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:52.763
So if you're curious and you wanna
see what's happening on the backend,

88
00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:54.418
you can check it out, it's all there.

89
00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:59.732
But we're gonna start here on client 0,
which, if you were to run this,

90
00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:04.991
I think the app still runs,
you just can't do anything, so let's see.

91
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.234
But yeah, it should still run,
I just think it's broken.

92
00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:09.722
I think I'm gonna have to sign out,
though.

93
00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:14.415
So to quickly sign out, I'm on Arc,
which is basically Chrome.

94
00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:18.109
I can open up my dev tools, go to
application, and I can delete this JSON

95
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:22.433
web token out of local storage, that'll
sign you out, so I'm just gonna do that.

96
00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:27.801
And if I refresh, it should redirect
me back to, there we go, sign in.

97
00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:29.043
So that's how you sign out.

98
00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:33.574
Again, that button wasn't in the budget,
so that's how you have to sign out.

99
00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:36.675
So yeah, if you're on the client 0,
you should see this page.

100
00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:39.379
If you try to sign in or
sign up, it's not gonna work.

101
00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.028
There's no client-side
query happening here, so

102
00:05:42.028 --> 00:05:44.143
it just won't effectively do anything.

103
00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:47.690
I don't even think there's even a handler
for the function at this point, so

104
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.557
it's just effectively not gonna work.

105
00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.507
But we're gonna work through
the app from a UI perspective.

106
00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:55.954
So first, we need to get the authorization
part enabled, so we got to write

107
00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:59.859
the queries and mutations for that, and
then we'll write the stuff for the issues.
