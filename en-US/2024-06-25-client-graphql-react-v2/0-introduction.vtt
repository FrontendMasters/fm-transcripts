00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.870
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: How's it going, everybody?

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.031
Welcome to the course, super excited
to be back here with the team at

3
00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:08.135
Frontend Masters to talk about one of my
favorite technologies, and that's GraphQL,

4
00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:10.690
specifically on the client
side with React.

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.286
So before I get into that and
why I'm excited about it,

6
00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.660
let me tell a little more about myself,
my name is Scott Moss.

7
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.562
I've been a software engineer for
over 10 years now, currently,

8
00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.793
I'm running my own startup right now.

9
00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:27.250
I had previous stints as a venture
capitalist, founder again in another life

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.270
and I've worked at companies like Netflix,
working on all types of exciting things.

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.578
And when it comes to GraphQL,
I've seen many different flavors of it.

12
00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.022
I was around when it first came out and
was wild buy it and even today,

13
00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:44.131
I'm still just surprised of how much value
we can add when you use it correctly and

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:45.358
in the right scenario.

15
00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:49.186
So super excited to talk to you guys
today about how I use GraphQL on

16
00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:51.798
the client side with React.

17
00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:55.076
Before we get into that, I'm gonna talk
about some of the prerequisites that I

18
00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:57.768
think you might wanna know that
to get the best from this course.

19
00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.202
So, like I said, it's gotta be
client side GraphQL with React, but

20
00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:03.373
we're actually gonna be using Next.js.

21
00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:06.718
Now, I get it, you might be thinking,
I never used Next.js or

22
00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:09.473
maybe you did use Next.js,
it's totally fine.

23
00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:12.703
You don't need to know
Next.js to take this course.

24
00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:16.103
We're only gonna be doing
the React integration of Next.js.

25
00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:20.756
So just not diving in too deep,
we're gonna opt out of all the really cool

26
00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:25.641
server side components and server
rendered things that Next.js does, and

27
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.529
we're just gonna use client side React.

28
00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:32.589
The reason I chose Next.Js because it's
the best way to get started with React

29
00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:36.653
it's actually what's recommended on
their website is just to use Next.Js so

30
00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:38.249
that's why I chose it.

31
00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.837
It's just simpler now to just use it so
that's why we're doing it.

32
00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.922
You do not need to know Next.Js,
it's gonna be totally fine.

33
00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:45.389
But you do need to know React.

34
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.779
So if you don't know react, you probably
need to go take an intro to react course.

35
00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.039
Brian hook teaches one here.

36
00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.975
It's very great and there's tons of other
react courses here front end master, so

37
00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.219
please check those out.

38
00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.069
Although you don't you won't be writing
any react in this course we're going to be

39
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.028
focusing purely on the grid GraphQL
aspects and how it integrates with React.

40
00:02:04.028 --> 00:02:07.683
Knowing React is gonna be helpful, so
please take the course if you haven't.

41
00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:11.045
Obviously you need to know JavaScript,
we're gonna be using TypeScript.

42
00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:13.738
You don't need to know TypeScript,
it's all optional.

43
00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:17.063
You'll see in the code that like, I get
lazy and forget to add types sometimes

44
00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:21.221
because I hate writing types, but
I like using types, it's kinda weird.

45
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:25.586
And the other thing that's useful is just
having some experience interacting with

46
00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:27.031
APIs from the client side.

47
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:31.518
So if you've ever used Axios, or Fetch,
or just interacting with APIs in general,

48
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.381
that's quite useful since
that's what GraphQL is.

49
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.351
It's a way to interact with APIs, and

50
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.641
creating APIs on
the service side at least.

51
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:43.283
So having that understanding is gonna be
quite useful, if you don't, it's fine.

52
00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:44.635
We'll breeze over it a little bit.

53
00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:48.943
You don't need to know all the intricacies
about it, but knowing how HTTP works,

54
00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:51.635
how fetch works in a browser
will be quite helpful.

55
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:56.060
As far as the course format,
if you've taken some of my courses,

56
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.445
you know I like to introduce new topics
and kind of riff on them for a little bit.

57
00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:03.592
I try to do some live coding
where I show some examples, and

58
00:03:03.592 --> 00:03:05.452
then I try to apply it to an app.

59
00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:09.196
So that's exactly what we're gonna do this
time, and you're gonna be building, or

60
00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:12.212
I'll say, you're gonna be finishing
an app that I didn't finish.

61
00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:16.708
So it's gonna be an app that's
a play on one of my favorite apps,

62
00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:18.672
which is called Linear.

63
00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:21.258
This app is called Parallel,
so this is what it looks like,

64
00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:23.142
it's basically like a productivity app.

65
00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:25.255
You can think of like,
you know, an Asana or

66
00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:27.437
something like that if
you never use Linear.

67
00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:30.413
And it's where you can just add action
items that you wanna check off and,

68
00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.956
you know, change the status of them.

69
00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:35.153
So it's bare bones, it's slimmed down,
it's nothing crazy, but

70
00:03:35.153 --> 00:03:37.037
this is what we're gonna be working on.

71
00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:40.493
And again, you won't have to write any
of the reacts or do any of the design.

72
00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:43.320
You're gonna just gonna make
the interactions work with GraphQL.

73
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.252
So an example of this is being able to go
in here and make a new issue like this.

74
00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:51.026
You can create a new issue and
then it'll show up.

75
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:54.156
You can change the status of
that issue and things like that.

76
00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:57.724
And there's also some authentication
components, involved with it,

77
00:03:57.724 --> 00:04:00.602
like signing in and
signing up and things like that.

78
00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:02.872
But again, the backend's completely done,
so you don't have to touch it.

79
00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:07.172
We're mostly focusing on the front end, so
those interactions that I just showed you.

80
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:08.299
And then along with that,

81
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.742
we're gonna have some course materials
here that I created in Notion.

82
00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:15.542
So you can get the link in the repo,
read me, but I'm just gonna go to it here.

83
00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.172
I'm just gonna go to one
of the examples here.

84
00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:20.534
So you'll see in the examples that
there's some code blocks, so.

85
00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:24.837
For the most part, these code blocks
are fine, but when we start doing GraphQL,

86
00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:27.558
because the way that we
write the GraphQL queries,

87
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:31.315
they're inside of a string Notion,
adds tap characters sometimes.

88
00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:35.658
And those tap characters literally get
interpreted by the GraphQL parser and

89
00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:36.604
causes errors.

90
00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:41.009
So when it comes to copying GraphQL
queries that I put in notion.

91
00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.049
I would refrain from doing that unless you
want to manually go remove tabs yourself.

92
00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:47.397
So you should probably
get the code from Github,

93
00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:51.299
which I will be pushing up as I teach on
individual branches so to always be there.

94
00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:52.789
So follow along if you can.

95
00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.377
I'll go slow, I promise, but the code will
always be on Github once I'm done with

96
00:04:56.377 --> 00:04:58.201
that lesson, you can copy it from there.
