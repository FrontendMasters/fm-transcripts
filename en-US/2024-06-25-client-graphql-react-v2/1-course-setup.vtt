00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Setup, so
here's everything you're gonna need.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.235
I promise you it's not crazy,

3
00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:07.290
you probably already have all of
this other than this one thing here.

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.080
So obviously, Git, you need Git.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
Go to the repo, I highly recommend
forking it and then just pulling it down.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.330
So here's the link to the repo,

7
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.130
you can just click on it if you didn't
get it earlier, so go there and get that.

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.595
Node.js v20, at least version 20.

9
00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:25.544
It might work with version 18, I just
haven't tested it so I can't guarantee it.

10
00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:30.922
I'm on version 20 and it works on my
machine, [LAUGH] classic engineer thing.

11
00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:35.899
But yeah, I highly recommend v20 or later.

12
00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.267
You could try 18, if someone has 18 and
wants to try it and let me know, cool.

13
00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:41.121
But I'm using version 20.

14
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:45.215
Once you have the repo fork and
pull it down, if you didn't know already,

15
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.680
always do an NPM install.

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.704
I'm using NPM, so
there's a package lock in there.

17
00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.646
I'm not using Yarn,
I'm not using Bun, I'm using NPM.

18
00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:55.184
So highly recommend doing the NPM
install if you want the same versions of

19
00:00:55.184 --> 00:00:57.078
everything that I installed.

20
00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:59.162
If you do any one of those
other package managers,

21
00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:01.179
you might not get the same versions.

22
00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.345
So depending on when you take this course
later on the versions might be mismatched,

23
00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:07.939
so highly recommend just
doing an NPM install here.

24
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:16.909
And then this last one is going to be for
the database that the backend is using.

25
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.721
So I tried to make this as simple as
possible, because depending on what

26
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.898
machine you're on you might
have to download a database and

27
00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:26.838
downloading databases can be different and
all that.

28
00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:29.608
So we're gonna use
a database called Turso.

29
00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:32.257
Who here has heard of Turso DB?

30
00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:33.183
Never heard of Turso?

31
00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:35.929
Well you're gonna be in for treat,
cuz it's actually pretty cool.

32
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.038
It's SQLite for production, it's actually
a fork of SQLite, something called libSQL.

33
00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:45.919
If you don't know what SQLite is,
it's like SQL but light.

34
00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:48.867
[LAUGH] It's file-based,
so it's very portable,

35
00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:52.089
you can kinda bring it everywhere,
it works on the edge.

36
00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:55.879
It's kinda genius being able
to use SQLite in production.

37
00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.039
So Turso is like a hosted version of that.

38
00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.094
So this database is completely hosted, you
don't have to download anything other than

39
00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:04.024
a CLI and
you can make an account for free.

40
00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:09.234
So if you go back to the notes,
I kinda walk you through how to do that.

41
00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:13.416
So go to the Turso, create an account.

42
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.981
Follow the instructions to make a new
database, I'm gonna do this right now.

43
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.345
And then we're gonna download the CLI,
we're gonna do some stuff,

44
00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.024
it should take a couple seconds,
so let's go do that.

45
00:02:23.024 --> 00:02:25.926
So I'm going to Turso, all right,
cool, so I already have an account so

46
00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:26.889
I'm just gonna log in.

47
00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.793
And then I already have some databases.

48
00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:31.276
But once you log in,

49
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:36.175
it'll walk you through setup where
you need to create a database.

50
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:39.456
If you read the instructions that I say
there, it'll ask you create a replica.

51
00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:43.207
You don't need to create a replica, that's
for production, just make the database.

52
00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:45.767
Eventually you'll land on this
screen that you see here.

53
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.984
Once you get to this screen,
you can just click on the Quickstart and

54
00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.880
it'll walk you through everything you need
to do on your terminal to get started,

55
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.430
which basically this involves
downloading the CLI.

56
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.805
So we could do that, we'll go here,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

57
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.898
they have all the instructions.

58
00:03:05.898 --> 00:03:10.400
So Mac, Linux, Windows,
click your appropriate

59
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.541
operating system and
copy the command to install the CLI.

60
00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:20.668
So once you have that installed they tell
you to do a sign up, Turso all sign up,

61
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:25.348
but you already just signed up, so
you don't actually need to do that.

62
00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.648
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You can just say Turso auth
log in, and it'll open up the browser and

63
00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:37.138
ask you to log into your Turso account.

64
00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:41.301
So I'm gonna do it, but
I think I'm already logged in, so yeah,

65
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:42.758
it'll just say cool.

66
00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:47.568
So once you have that, we can follow
the instructions about creating,

67
00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:52.309
or you should already have created
a database in the Turso dashboard.

68
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:57.419
But we can follow these instructions here
with this command to create a token for

69
00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.381
in your database, you need a token
to be able to connect to it so

70
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:03.308
you need to be able to do that.

71
00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:08.527
So what you can do is you can
say turso db tokens create,

72
00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:15.578
and then the name of the database that
you created on the Turso dashboard.

73
00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:18.169
My database is called parallel.

74
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.107
Your database name might
be something different,

75
00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:21.782
whatever you called it
when you created it.

76
00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:32.595
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm not gonna hit Enter,
cuz then it's gonna show my tokens.

77
00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:36.011
But if you do this,
it'll create tokens for you.

78
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.639
Or it'll create one token for
you, it'll be a JSON web token.

79
00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.214
So just remember that, don't clear
your console, just keep it there,

80
00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.494
you're gonna use that in a second.

81
00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:59.253
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then what you're gonna
do is you're gonna go into the repo,

82
00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:00.802
make a .env file.

83
00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:09.997
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And you're going to add
in that token as the Turso off token,

84
00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:14.596
and then the URL to your
database in the .env file.

85
00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.816
And if you don't know what these
environment variables are,

86
00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.632
they're in the course notes, you can look
at them from there, you can copy and

87
00:05:19.632 --> 00:05:20.500
paste them from there.

88
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.471
If you don't know your connection
URL you can use the Turso CLI,

89
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.397
I'll show you how to do it but
it basically it's just this URL.

90
00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:31.917
It's libSQL, the name of your database,
dash your username, dot turso.io.

91
00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:37.357
But if you don't wanna hard code that, you
can actually just go into the Turso CLI

92
00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:42.489
here and do Turso DB list and it'll
list all your databases with their URLs.

93
00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:49.615
It's connected, everything's good to go,
now we just need to push our schema to it.

94
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:53.596
So we need to run the first initial
migration, which is super simple,

95
00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:57.185
it's why I chose this database,
so we'll do that in a second.

96
00:05:57.185 --> 00:06:00.844
But as far as setting the database up,
it's done, you have it, it's there,

97
00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.736
it's deployed, it'll always work as long
as you're connected to the Internet.

98
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:09.464
There is an option to do a local version,
doing a local SQLite, but

99
00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:11.163
I kinda opted out of it.

100
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:14.521
I was like, eh, it was just an extra step
beyond what we just did so I was like,

101
00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:15.886
nah, maybe we won't do that.

102
00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:20.189
But you can run it locally if
you want with a local SQLite.

103
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.262
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the last thing
here to get this database running is

104
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:32.514
there is a command that I have in
a package.json that's called db:push.

105
00:06:32.514 --> 00:06:37.203
So you can just do npm run db:push,
and what that's gonna do,

106
00:06:37.203 --> 00:06:42.083
it's going to push up the schema
that I created to your database.

107
00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:47.573
But don't do this until you have set
these variables in your .env file,

108
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.543
it's relying on those, so make sure.

109
00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:54.604
And then also you should have did your
NPM install to install your modules.

110
00:06:58.057 --> 00:07:02.855
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I'm gonna do this,
I think it's going to destroy what I have

111
00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:06.396
cuz I already have kinda
everything up there.

112
00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:10.571
So I'm just going to say yes.

113
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:12.754
It might have dropped my database,
I'm not sure, but.

114
00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:16.763
Once you do that you are good to go,
never gotta touch a database thing for

115
00:07:16.763 --> 00:07:18.887
the rest of this course, that's it.

116
00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:23.783
So we had some people in person have some
trouble installing the Turso CLI on their

117
00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:24.431
machine.

118
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:29.074
So I'm gonna show you a workaround if that
is the case, because the Turso CLI is not

119
00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.595
needed to start a database,
the database is hosted already.

120
00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:35.237
We use the CLI to generate
the tokens mostly, but

121
00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:37.566
you can actually do it from the dashboard.

122
00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:42.662
So if you go to Turso dashboard and
you click on the database

123
00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:47.345
that you created,
in this case here's my database.

124
00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:50.704
You can see there's the URL, so
that's the one environment variable.

125
00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:53.650
And then there's a button here that says
generate token that you can generate

126
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.883
the token, and
that's the other environment variable.

127
00:07:55.883 --> 00:08:00.084
And that's it, so you don't need the CLI,
you can just grab them here from

128
00:08:00.084 --> 00:08:03.366
the dashboard if you want and
put those in your .env file.

129
00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.890
And then run that db push command,
which has nothing to do with Turso,

130
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.560
it uses Drizzle which is our ORM, and
that will push the schema to Turso.

131
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.945
And then we're good to go,
never have to touch a database again for

132
00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:15.223
the rest of this course.
