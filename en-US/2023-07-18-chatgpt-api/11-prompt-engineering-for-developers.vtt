1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.429
So the next topic where we will
finally understand how ChatGPT

2
00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.130
works is known as prompt engineering.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.372
The definition is the process of
designing and refining prompts or

4
00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:19.651
inputs for language models like GPT to
generate desired outputs or responses.

5
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:23.384
So that's the idea.

6
00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:28.020
I like to say this is more
prompt hacking than engineering.

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.713
That's why I don't like
the term prompt engineering,

8
00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:32.729
it's kind of the buzzword of the moment.

9
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.732
There are people,
experts on AI selling books.

10
00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:39.684
And yeah, but
it's more hacking than engineering.

11
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:42.913
Also because it's really
dependent on the model.

12
00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:44.631
The day they change the model,

13
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:48.340
the tips that they're giving
you are not useful anymore.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.629
It happened a lot with DALI,
with Metjourney.

15
00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.315
In every new version,
the prompt engineering

16
00:00:56.315 --> 00:01:00.409
ideas were not useful anymore, right?

17
00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.247
But the idea is that
understanding how we can

18
00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:08.618
set a better prompt to get
a better answer, okay?

19
00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:10.176
That's the idea.

20
00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:13.257
The more explicit and large the prompt,

21
00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:16.798
more accurate the results
we can get from GPT.

22
00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:20.703
Also, more tokens you're spending,
okay, but that's another thing.

23
00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:25.333
But the idea is that when
GPT has more content,

24
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.980
remember that this has
to do with statistics.

25
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.490
So actually, it try to think
about what's the next world.

26
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.840
And if it has more context,
it can get better results.

27
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.841
Remember, that's the idea.

28
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.993
We have a prompt and it goes to GPT and
then we get the result.

29
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:54.584
And now we mentioned before,
ChatGPT plugins are not actually injecting

30
00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:59.558
new data to the to the black box,
they're injecting the prompt.

31
00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:02.068
So we are always injecting the prompt.

32
00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:05.589
To send the chat history,
we are injecting, in the prompt,

33
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:06.701
the chat history.

34
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.580
Everything is about the prompt.

35
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.096
We never touch the GPT model,
it's a black box.

36
00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:15.570
As of today, it's a black box.

37
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.904
The only thing that we
can touch is the prompt.

38
00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:23.689
Even plugins on ChatGPT,
they're just changing the prompt.

39
00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.427
So now, there are people saying,
I have a super prompt,

40
00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:32.398
there are people selling prompts,
I saw that.

41
00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:37.438
So I'm not going to give you here
super prompts to get your life easier,

42
00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:39.455
to make money with ChatGPT.

43
00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:45.007
No, I'm going to give you hints
like targeting developers, web and

44
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:50.360
app developers, so hints that
will help us get better results.

45
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.380
We want consistent and
deterministic outputs.

46
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.383
So if we are asking A and the answer is B,

47
00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:59.842
we want the same answer on every call,
okay?

48
00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:02.270
So that's kind of the deal.

49
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.191
Sometimes we need the output in
a specific formats for processing.

50
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:13.483
So because we are not going to
use ChatGPT for manual process.

51
00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:18.284
We want to use ChatGPT to integrate
that directly with an algorithm,

52
00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.034
with a database, to automate things.

53
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:27.687
And if I need the JSON we wanna structure,
I need the JSON always on that structure.

54
00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:32.655
So ChatGPT cannot create
its own properties, or

55
00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:36.908
hallucinate about how a JSON looks like.

56
00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:41.244
We are paying for the API, so
we'll need to reduce abuse as well.

57
00:03:41.244 --> 00:03:46.182
And also, we wanna validate that
the user-generated content that

58
00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.443
goes into the prompt is valid.

59
00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:52.963
For example, This can be

60
00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:57.389
just some bad actor trying
to inject the prompt.

61
00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.093
But let's say you have
a translation service,

62
00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:03.683
you wanna translate code from
Java to JavaScript, whatever.

63
00:04:03.683 --> 00:04:04.909
That's your service.

64
00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.469
So you have a text box where
a user will type Java code, and

65
00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.846
you will use ChatGPT to get
that code into JavaScript.

66
00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:19.396
What happens if the user is
pasting whatever, the bible?

67
00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.140
It's not code.

68
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.738
So have you ever think about that?

69
00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:27.549
What will happen if we send the bible?

70
00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:30.150
So what will happen with the output?

71
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.498
So we need to think about that and
how the prompt.

72
00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:35.801
We will see that in a minute.

73
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.470
And also, we wanna stop prompt injection.

74
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.781
So we need to, again,
we cannot automate that,

75
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:50.528
because bad actors will always
find a way to go over our rules.

76
00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:55.608
Well, we need to tell GPT,
we need to tell the model what to

77
00:04:55.608 --> 00:05:00.716
do in case the input is not
following the rules that I want.

78
00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:02.090
Does it make sense?

79
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.540
Everything has to do with prompt
engineering, to working with the prompt.

80
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.075
So, well, we need to remember
that LLMs can hallucinate,

81
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:17.700
making facts and
presenting them in a convincing way.

82
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.360
Just have that in mind always, right?

83
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.687
To reduce hallucination,

84
00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:28.745
there are some basic rules that we can
follow when we are writing the prompt.

85
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.486
And also,
we should use the temperature as 0.

86
00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:34.686
Remember, the temperature
is a property that we set.

87
00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:39.043
For example, in our server,
we didn't set that one.

88
00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:46.109
So when we got here,
We can have the property temperature and

89
00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:50.703
we can set it to 0, and
that means a deterministic output.

90
00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:57.308
If you set 1, it will hallucinate,
it will be imaginative in their responses.

91
00:05:57.308 --> 00:06:00.178
But we don't want that,
so we want temperature 0.
