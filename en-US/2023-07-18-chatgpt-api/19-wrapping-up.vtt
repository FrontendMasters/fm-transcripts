00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.670
We've seen how AI works
with web development so

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.858
we don't just use ChatGPT
as a normal user.

3
00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:11.665
We are web developers, we've seen how
to integrate that into our websites.

4
00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:17.629
We've seen how we can provide information
to ChatGPT through a ChatGPT plugin.

5
00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:21.985
Remember that at the end
is just injecting data into

6
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:26.254
the prompt that's what
the ChatGPT plugin does.

7
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.153
We've covered the idea
of prompt engineering,

8
00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:31.070
I prefer to say prompt hacking.

9
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.564
But anyway, we've seen that
making a clear prompt with really

10
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:43.418
strict instructions of what you're
expecting really gives you good output.

11
00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:48.100
And also working with the temperature,
it's important for

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.057
us, for the developers temperature
zero will not guarantee but

13
00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:56.472
will try to always get
a consistent result.

14
00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:00.010
And finally we discussed
ways that we have today,

15
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.632
to actually work with your own data.

16
00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:08.047
We see how you can integrate
ChatGPT with your own databases,

17
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:15.039
documents and any media file that you have
right now in your website or your app.

18
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.666
Just have in mind,
there is no way to fine tune ChatGPT

19
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.807
it's always about the prompt so
prompt is king.

20
00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:30.559
So that's all I have here for you so
I hope that you now understand

21
00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:35.047
how this looks like and
you are excited about what you can do.

22
00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:39.249
I think that the recipe example
that creates images and

23
00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.386
recipes in a structured data format
it's really cool it's like magic, okay?

24
00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:50.129
So actually I'm really excited
about what you can do now that

25
00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:54.315
you know how to integrate
ChatGPT into the platform.

26
00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.335
And I hope that you can
show us on social networks,

27
00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:03.219
I'm Firt on Twitter or
Frontend Masters what you are going to

28
00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.946
do with ChatGPT on your websites and
web apps, thank you.

29
00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:10.641
