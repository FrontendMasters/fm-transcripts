WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.084
So the first thing that we need to do,
if you look at our code,

2
00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:13.968
In the public folder,
we do have a gpt.js file.

3
00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:19.024
That file has a very basic fetch system.

4
00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:24.768
So it's just a fetch call that
will make an HTTP request and

5
00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:30.407
within for
example chat app.js we have an OPENAI_KEY.

6
00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:34.028
So let's start talking about that,
so what's the key?

7
00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:37.913
If you have ever played with web
services with third party web services,

8
00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:39.768
you probably know what the key is.

9
00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.238
Don't worry about the security
if you know what the key is.

10
00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:45.770
I have already deleted these keys and I'm
going to delete all the keys that you will

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.754
see on the screen right now because
what's the problem with the key?

12
00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:52.898
The key is actually your
authorization token.

13
00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:57.270
The key is,
anyone with that key can actually

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.425
charge your credit card for using OpenAI.

15
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.359
Where can you can you get those keys?

16
00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:09.285
Well, after you have
your account at OpenAI.

17
00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.281
And at this point you should have already,

18
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:19.950
your personnel account at OpenAI,
you go to platform.openai.com.

19
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.314
And there is a section for API keys.

20
00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:27.565
There you will see all the API keys
that you have already created, and

21
00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:28.819
this is important.

22
00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:35.200
You cannot see the key, the keys that you
have, you can see the name of the key,

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.869
a part of the key and
when you have created and last use it.

24
00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.852
Let me show you what that means.

25
00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:44.125
I can create a new secret key now.

26
00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:49.486
I can say this is
the Frontend Masters Workshop.

27
00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:55.221
Create secret key, and that's the key.

28
00:01:55.221 --> 00:02:00.391
I must copy and save the key right now,
if I close this window,

29
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.574
I will just never have
access to that key anymore.

30
00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:07.209
I can still delete that in the future.

31
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.492
So I will copy that key and
paste that key here.

32
00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:17.582
Let's make sure that we don't
have a piece from a previous key.

33
00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:22.259
So that key that you see in the screen
is actually pointing to my account.

34
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.363
Anyone with that key, again,
because it is important,

35
00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:31.407
anyone with that key will use your
account and it will be charged to your

36
00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:36.467
credit card, so you should save
that really, really, in a safe way.

37
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.591
Now, you know the importance of that key.

38
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:41.791
So you need to safely stored that key.

39
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.048
Anyway, I mean, a JavaScript file that is

40
00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:50.678
pointing from an HTML file,
that is not safe.

41
00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.946
So that's why typically,

42
00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:58.277
we're not going to make calls in
the front end to the OpenAI API.

43
00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:02.292
We can, and we're going to do
the first example as with this,

44
00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:05.779
just with the front end,
but that's not a good idea.

45
00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.260
It's really not a good idea.

46
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.228
So that means that you will always
need a server, at least to make

47
00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:18.303
some kind of a proxy between your
front end and the open AI server.

48
00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:22.962
So once you have the key, by the way,
remember that here you can say done, and

49
00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:24.412
then your key is there.

50
00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:28.907
In the future, if you know that
someone has stolen your key,

51
00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.830
well, you can just go and delete that.

52
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.895
And by the way, you can just refresh and
see if someone is using it.

53
00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:40.480
And if it says never it's still unused,
so we are safe.

54
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.694
So anyway, you go and revoke the key.

55
00:03:42.694 --> 00:03:44.245
In fact, if OpenAI,

56
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:50.212
I think somewhere it says that if OpenAI
thinks that your key appeared somewhere.

57
00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:54.692
So it's a public it's in a GitHub repo,
they will delete the key,

58
00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.293
it will remove the key.

59
00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:59.911
And once the key is removed
It's not going to work, and

60
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.201
it's not going to charge anyone.

61
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.781
Okay, so once you have the key,
we're ready to make queries.

62
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:10.773
But before doing that,
the place where you will leave the most

63
00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:14.904
initially is the playground,
it's a nice thing.

64
00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.955
If we wanna live in a playground,
it's not so bad.

65
00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:25.569
So the playground is where we can test, we
can try our prompts on how they look like.

66
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:32.450
Before actually, copy and
paste in that prompt within our app.

67
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.516
The playground has different models and
different modes, and the mode

68
00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:42.836
that we want because remember that we
are not going to use all the models that

69
00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:48.846
are available in OpenAI, here you can see
you have DaVinci, GRI, Barbash, Adda.

70
00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:50.645
There are different models for
different things.

71
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:54.571
We're going to use Chat GBT, and
that model is not in this mode,

72
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.620
it's actually in the chat mode.

73
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.874
So the first step is to
go to the chat mode.

74
00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:06.006
And now we can pick the model,
GPT 3.5 or GPT 4, the expensive one.

75
00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:11.664
And now that you are here,
you can see three sections,

76
00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:15.238
System, User, and Add Message.

77
00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:19.002
This is kind of a chat GPT
interface that looks better.

78
00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:25.849
In fact, if you're paying for
just GPT+, you have a trick.

79
00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.649
Maybe you can stop paying those $15 US
per month, and just pay for the API and

80
00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:31.974
use the Playground.

81
00:05:31.974 --> 00:05:36.591
Because it has the same functionality, and

82
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:42.472
you can use GPT 4 without
the cap that you have on GPT+.

83
00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:45.026
And you have even more things to try.

84
00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:48.160
We'll talk about this temperature and
all that stuff.

85
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.282
So for example, here you can express,
who is the system.

86
00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:59.310
We can define a role for GPT.

87
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.366
So you can say, okay, you are, let's say,

88
00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:09.172
a professor explaining web development.

89
00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:15.087
You are funny, and
you are always looking for

90
00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:17.896
explaining things.

91
00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:22.348
So you are defining the role
as if it's an actor or

92
00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:26.483
an actress,
I don't know the gender of GPT.

93
00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:30.290
And then I can enter a message here.

94
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.443
What is a message?

95
00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:36.318
This is the user, so
this is us, humans, human user.

96
00:06:36.318 --> 00:06:40.698
So I can say, hello, how are you?

97
00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:42.737
Okay, and I can submit.

98
00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:46.861
This is like ChatGPT.

99
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:49.843
Hello, I'm Jessica Beer Burrum so
I don't have feelings blah, blah, blah,

100
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:50.386
blah, blah.

101
00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:53.522
So I think that's probably the funny part,
right?

102
00:06:53.522 --> 00:06:56.623
Anyway, so and I can add more messages.

103
00:06:56.623 --> 00:07:00.856
And of course, I can have the full
conversation that you're used to on

104
00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:04.970
ChatGPT but in this case,
it's being charged by the token, okay?

105
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.422
It's charged by the token not by month.

106
00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:17.033
One of the things that we can set up
here we have a couple of settings.

107
00:07:17.033 --> 00:07:21.495
For example maximum length,
in this case, we can say, for

108
00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:26.597
example, you know what, I only want,
the minimum is four tokens.

109
00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:29.056
So I want your answer in four tokens.

110
00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:32.498
Remember, a token is roughly
like four characters in English.

111
00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:35.001
So if I say, I don't know,
what's your name?

112
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:38.700
Submit the answer.

113
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.580
I mean language, that's all, okay?

114
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.286
Because we are stopping that answer.

115
00:07:44.286 --> 00:07:46.182
Of course, you can say, well,

116
00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:50.551
it's not useful because I was expecting
like something that fits there.

117
00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:54.150
Well, I need to be precise
with what I'm asking.

118
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.140
So what's your name?

119
00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.633
Answer in just one or two words, okay?

120
00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:04.095
So I can actually say that.

121
00:08:04.095 --> 00:08:07.739
Oops, sorry about the message here.

122
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.243
Maybe that will probably work better.

123
00:08:09.243 --> 00:08:12.061
I'm an OpenAI, so that's better.

124
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:17.770
Because I was clear about my intentions,
and that's key.

125
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.364
Anyway, so that's length,
typically, four is, but

126
00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:26.678
you can see the maximum
is 2,048 on GPT 3.5.

127
00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:31.435
If we move to GPT 4, we can actually
get more, but not in the playground.

128
00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:37.532
We can get 4,000 or 8,000, but not in
the playground because I don't know why.

129
00:08:37.532 --> 00:08:41.527
But from JavaScript,
you don't have that limitation.

130
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:45.101
Let's say there are more
properties here such as this.

131
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:49.022
Dappy frequency penalty,
you have an explanation here,

132
00:08:49.022 --> 00:08:52.310
typically changing that
is really fine graded.

133
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.883
The most important thing
here is temperature.

134
00:08:56.883 --> 00:09:01.202
That's the most important part,
really important, why?

135
00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:05.937
The temperature is a value between 0 and
1.

136
00:09:05.937 --> 00:09:10.807
Do you remember that we
mentioned that Chat GPT works

137
00:09:10.807 --> 00:09:14.245
like the prediction of the keyword.

138
00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:17.590
So it predicts the next word.

139
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.180
So if you say again, hello, how are,

140
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.229
the most common possible next word is you.

141
00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:30.092
If we say 0,
the model will always pick the most

142
00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:34.115
probable next word, so it will be you.

143
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:40.333
So we are making the model predictable,
just by setting temperature as 0.

144
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:45.924
When you are saying 1,
we are like making more random selections.

145
00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:50.771
So it's not going to take always
the most probable also maybe the one

146
00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:54.442
that comes after, or
after, or after, or after.

147
00:09:54.442 --> 00:09:59.848
And that's how you make
the model more imaginative,

148
00:09:59.848 --> 00:10:05.988
more fancy, that can say anything,
can hallucinate more.

149
00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:08.438
Because when it's speaking the words,

150
00:10:08.438 --> 00:10:11.543
it's not always speaking
the most probable word.

151
00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:17.343
But typically, as developers,
unless you are creating stories for

152
00:10:17.343 --> 00:10:24.951
kids, jokes, or things like that, as app
developers, we prefer predictable answers.

153
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:29.440
So if I am asking one question,
I typically prefer the same answer always,

154
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.946
right?

155
00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:32.494
So most of the time, as developers,

156
00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:36.370
we probably want the temperature
to be 0 or close to 0.

157
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.427
Again, unless you are writing emails or
social posts,

158
00:10:40.427 --> 00:10:44.581
where, yeah,
you want more imagination in the answer.

159
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:45.316
Make sense?

160
00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:49.331
So typically,
that's something that you will touch.
