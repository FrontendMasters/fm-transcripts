00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.560
Yeah, we have a large prompt and we are
going to pay for the prompt every time.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.480
That's how GPT works.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.370
It's part of the deal.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.850
Okay, cool.

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.970
Let me just save that for
later uses just in case.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.070
Okay, let's go back here.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.230
So remember as you see there,
prompt is king here.

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.720
Everything is about the prompt.

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.055
Capabilities that you
can do with the prompt,

10
00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:33.820
ask for summaries,
inferring things like ask for

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.280
the sentiment, for example,
or relevant data or tags.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.072
So let me show you one example of that.

13
00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.796
So, give me, so

14
00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:48.834
with the sentence in triple quotes,

15
00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:54.677
infer if the sentence is positive or

16
00:00:54.677 --> 00:01:00.129
not, answering with the words or

17
00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.022
with the letters P or N,

18
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:09.669
let's say, or negative, here,

19
00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:14.760
without any other character.

20
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.475
And now I can pass a quote,

21
00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:25.575
like '''I hate this course.''' So, Send.

22
00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:28.767
N, negative.

23
00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:34.450
'''I like this course,''' P.

24
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.997
So that's inferring, and you can use
that to check what the user is typing,

25
00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:40.950
what the user is saying.

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.005
And even look at this, instead of that,

27
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:52.260
select or
pick one emotion related to the phrase.

28
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.460
Okay, so I like this course.

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.910
Let's see the emotion.

30
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.930
It's that one.

31
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.239
I hate this course.

32
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.380
That's emoji, by the way.

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.131
It rains outside.

34
00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:09.530
That's emoji.

35
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.130
Can you see the emoji there?

36
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.670
So this is pretty good for
doing these things.

37
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.940
Right, so these are different ideas
that you can use with prompting.

38
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.240
And by the way,
this is probably one token.

39
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.770
So that's a cheap prompt,
at least in the answer.

40
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.390
Okay, so that's inferring, actually.

41
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.693
You can also transform data,
translations, format conversion.

42
00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:40.453
Extract data, like you have a text and
try to extract the numbers or

43
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:45.640
the emails, or the amount of wherever
that you expect the text you have.

44
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.224
Create content, expand on the fact,
so you have a fact and

45
00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:54.888
you can explain, well, write me an article
as if you are in the New York Times or

46
00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.670
in the style of Jack Spear about blah and
blah.

47
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.640
Okay, so that's prompt engineering.
