00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.478
Hi, welcome to ChatGPT for Web Developers.

2
00:00:03.478 --> 00:00:08.519
We're going to cover today quickly,
as a first look,

3
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.340
how artificial intelligence and
LLMs work for web developers.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.070
And we will talk about that later.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.365
So what's an LLM?

6
00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:21.050
So my name is Maximiliano Firtman.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.184
Let me go really quickly about myself.

8
00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:27.047
I'm from Argentina, I live in
Buenos Aires, and I'm a web developer and

9
00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:29.210
also a mobile app developer.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.411
I'm actually excited as most people
around the world about AI, and

11
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:35.000
also a little scared.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.720
It's time between both worlds.

13
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.129
I have authored many books, a lot of
courses on different platforms, and

14
00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.773
of course the best one, Frontend Masters.

15
00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:47.113
You will find a lot of workshops and

16
00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:53.460
courses that I have been doing on mobile
app development and also web development.

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.320
But this is a different kind of worship.

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.100
It's a first look into a new
technology for most of us.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.630
So we are here because of that,
let me say, kind of ugly user interface.

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.709
So you know that the ChatGPT
user interface is not like,

21
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.274
wow, but that's not what we see here,

22
00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:22.132
we see the power of something
totally different behind scenes.

23
00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:24.238
So it's not about the why.

24
00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:27.350
In fact,
this is not a course about ChatGPT.

25
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.080
Actually, we won't be using ChatGPT.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.255
So ChatGPT, so chat.openai.com is not
actually what we're going to cover today.

27
00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:41.965
We will see how can we use
that as web developers?

28
00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.749
So I had that question
a couple of months ago,

29
00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.805
as maybe some of you are having right now.

30
00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:51.740
Okay, I'm a mobile developer,
I'm a web developer.

31
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.980
I know that we have GPT.

32
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.010
I mean, what's the point?

33
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.050
Should I do something about that?

34
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.600
Do I need to learn machine learning
to actually use some of this stuff?

35
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.054
Well, that's why I have created
this course to give you a quick

36
00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:13.100
look into ChatGPT from
a perspective of a web developer.

37
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.390
First, ChatGPT, what's that, in case you
are here and you haven't heard about it?

38
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.055
So it's a large language model
designed to generate human-like

39
00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:29.520
responses to natural language input,
using the GPT architecture.

40
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.620
So we have here natural language input.

41
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.897
So when we talk to ChatGPT,
we need to use natural language,

42
00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:43.393
our human natural language, so
it's not a programming language.

43
00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:47.364
Another definition, ChatGPT is a computer
program that can understand and

44
00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:49.669
respond to written text
like a human would.

45
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.910
So it's trying to impersonate us,
actually.

46
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.276
And the final definition as if we
were child, that ChatGPT is like

47
00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:05.417
a talking robot that can talk with
us by reading what we write and

48
00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:09.997
answering us in a way that
sounds like a person talking.

49
00:03:09.997 --> 00:03:16.290
And actually, all these definitions
are coming from ChatGPT itself.

50
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.722
And that's the goal of ChatGPT,
talk, so it's a talking parrot, okay?

51
00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:30.240
I'm not going to get today at least
into the details on how it works.

52
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.530
We want to use it,
we want to understand ChatGPT and use it.

53
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.057
So this is not an artificial
intelligence course in terms of

54
00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:43.686
we're not going to learn how to
create a model like ChatGPT.

55
00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:45.520
We're going to use it,

56
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.215
so we need to understand the concepts and
use it in our favor.

57
00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:53.143
That's the idea, to use GPT, LLMs, and

58
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.335
I will explain what that is in a minute,
in our own web apps.

59
00:03:57.335 --> 00:04:02.340
Today, we're going to do some
cold practices in JavaScript.

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.930
So the only thing you need to know to
follow this course is JavaScript and HTML.

61
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.093
And on the server, we are also going
to use JavaScript in a very simple

62
00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:19.590
Node.js Express Service that we
will provide to our frontend.

63
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.490
I already have the frontend, so
you don't need to create HTML and CSS.

64
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.010
Today, we will focus
specifically on ChatGPT.

65
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.990
So I'm also not here to tell you that
ChatGPT will replace all of us, okay?

66
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.440
That's a different discussion for
a different day.

67
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.880
So we are going to use
ChatGPT in our apps.

68
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.830
So you will see how exciting it
is to see all the opportunities

69
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.440
that you have to enhance your
web apps using the GPT APIs.

70
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.100
So we will talk about that.

71
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.690
We will talk about how as a web developer,

72
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.440
you can today start integrating
ChatGPT in different ways.

73
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.046
So we will talk about ChatGPT plugins,
in case you're interested in that.

74
00:05:10.046 --> 00:05:14.607
We will talk about what happens
with ChatGPT browsing the web, and

75
00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:17.410
not just ChatGPT, also Bing Chat.

76
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.220
We will discuss
the difference in a minute.

77
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.390
They can browse the web, so
they can browse our websites.

78
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.910
So should we do something about that?

79
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.710
Can we optimize the content for AI?

80
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.840
Should we do that?

81
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.160
Well, we will discuss that as well.

82
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.523
But let's say that 80% of the workshop,
80% of this course,

83
00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:43.695
it's actually about coding apps
that will talk to the, for now,

84
00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:49.640
let's say ChatGPT API, then we will
become more specific with the terms.

85
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.028
Okay, so we will cover OpenAI and ChatGPT.

86
00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:59.306
We will try to understand the whole
ecosystem that we have today.

87
00:05:59.306 --> 00:06:03.939
And you probably know this, but
AI is changing really, really,

88
00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.395
really, but really fast.

89
00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:10.692
So everything that I'm saying today may
be a little bit outdated in a couple of

90
00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:13.495
months, I'm not even telling you years.

91
00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:17.128
So that's why you need to rush here and
actually start working with this,

92
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:18.839
because everything is changing.

93
00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:23.950
So the ecosystem will probably
change after a while.

94
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.099
Then we'll get into concepts
that won't change so fast.

95
00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:33.930
I'm talking about how we can use
these tools with web development.

96
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.644
We will talk a little bit about a concept
known as prompt engineering that I

97
00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:40.550
will give you a spoiler.

98
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.480
I don't like the term, and
I will explain why later.

99
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.219
But anyway, it's a term that is there, and

100
00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.090
it's something important
that we need to understand.

101
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.250
And at the end, we will talk
about embeddings and fine tuning.

102
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.936
So we will see what is that in case
you want to, let's say, for now,

103
00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:59.983
customize ChatGPT with your own data,
that's the idea.
