1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.081
We're going to talk about ChatGPT.

2
00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:05.230
ChatGPT is actually a web app, right?

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.390
It's a web app that it's based on or
is using something known as a GPT model.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.030
GPT stands for
generative pre-trained transformer.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.910
Okay, what's that?

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.545
Well, that's actually one
specific model of a set of

7
00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:29.110
models known as large language models,
LLMs.

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.720
So every time we see LLMs, we
are talking about large language models.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.350
So these are AI models that were trained
for natural language processing.

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.469
The idea is they were trained with text,
but trillions of text.

11
00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.570
And they know how text work.

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.644
Again, I'm not going to explain
here how these models work,

13
00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:03.096
but the basic idea to take this for
something really, really, really basic.

14
00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:08.019
Think about when you have
a smart keyboard on your phone,

15
00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:11.720
that we have a prediction
of the next word.

16
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean, you're typing, hello,
how, and your phone will say R,

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.590
it will appear as a recommendation, as
a suggestion, and then you, how are you?

18
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.299
Because that's the most probably two
words that comes after hello, how.

19
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.390
LLMs are kind of that
with a million asteroids.

20
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.530
That's kind of the idea.

21
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.530
So LLMs knows, statistically,
which words comes after other words.

22
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.460
That's kind of the idea.

23
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.190
That's the whole idea behind this.

24
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.067
The problem is that, not the problem,
the situation is that we the community,

25
00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:55.279
even the developers,
the scientists working with GPT,

26
00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:59.666
they realize that it's not just words,
that at one point,

27
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:05.040
it feels like behind the scenes,
there is some kind of reasoning.

28
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.595
I'm not going to discuss here
if it's true or not, but

29
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:13.790
we feel when we talk with ChatGPT,
that sometimes it feels its reasoning.

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.128
So there is,
I don't wanna say intelligence, but

31
00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:20.280
we have some sparks of something.

32
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.840
And that's why everyone is excited
today about LLMs and ChatGPT.

33
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.670
And by the way, we have LLMs today in
the market from other companies as well.

34
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.870
We have LLaMA from Meta.

35
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.434
We have from Google.

36
00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:41.560
We have Lambda, that's the one that
we don't see, it's an internal.

37
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.005
But then we have Google Bard that
is a product using Lambda, and

38
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.190
many other therapy are in
from other companies as well.

39
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.230
But ChatGPT was the first public one,

40
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.020
the first one that was
available to the public.

41
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.730
It seems to be still
the best one out there.

42
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
So LLMs are actually part of
the deep learning umbrella.

43
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.900
And the deep learning umbrella is part
of the machine learning umbrella.

44
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.615
That is actually what we typically say or
typically know today as AI or

45
00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:13.990
artificial intelligence.

46
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.580
Just to mention different concepts and
how they apply here.

47
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.680
So AI, we have one kind of AI
known as machine learning.

48
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.690
And there is one kind of machine
learning known as deep learning.

49
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.439
And within deep learning we have LLMs and
we have GPTs,

50
00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.710
and then we have ChatGPT
as one product of that.

51
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.740
And ChatGPT is actually a product,
a website,

52
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.618
an app from a company known as OpenAI.

53
00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:48.800
OpenAI is not really open,
these days, at least.

54
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.580
It's the company behind ChatGPT.

55
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.320
And it's not the only product they have.

56
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.810
They have other things.

57
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.215
For example,
if you have heard about DALL-E,

58
00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:04.007
this was also one of the first public
artificial intelligence image generator,

59
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.663
in this case, DALL-E is not an LLM.

60
00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.746
It's a different kind of
machine learning model.

61
00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:15.432
And OpenAI is also
offering to the community,

62
00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:19.979
the development community,
and app community, APIs.

63
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.855
We will focus there actually,
not really over ChatGPT but on APIs,

64
00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:33.640
APIs that are also using GPT, so they're
using the same GPT model as ChatGPT.

65
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.394
So when you go to ChatGPT,
you're using a GPT model, and

66
00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:43.060
we're going to use an API from the same
company that is also using the GPT model.

67
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.394
So that's how we are going to
connect to ChatGPT most of the time.

68
00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:53.441
And just to finish that empty
part of the slide that we

69
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:59.490
have there,
OpenAI has partnered with Microsoft.

70
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.998
So Microsoft is not owning OpenAI, but

71
00:05:01.998 --> 00:05:06.530
there is a really strong
partnership between both companies.

72
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.525
And Microsoft is also offering
Bing Chat that it's now integrated

73
00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:18.790
in many places on bing.com but
also on Microsoft Edge as a tab.

74
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.942
And also,
Microsoft is integrating LLMs in many

75
00:05:22.942 --> 00:05:26.880
softwares such as Office or Visual Studio.

76
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.040
And Microsoft is also
offering Azure OpenAI APIs.

77
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.417
So if you're used to a Microsoft APIs
on Azure, you can also use GPT,

78
00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:41.982
so the same source, the same model
as ChatGPT, but using the Microsoft

79
00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:48.220
infrastructure and using the Microsoft
business contract over there.

80
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.800
Today, we will be focusing here.

81
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.090
So we are going to mostly use APIs that
are using the GPT model from OpenAI.

82
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.840
That is the same model
that is using ChatGPT.

83
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.960
Makes sense?

84
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.050
That's kind of the idea.

85
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.610
That's the architecture.

86
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.410
So that's where we're going to focus.

87
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.040
Azure OpenAI APIs are also the same thing.

88
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.328
So if you learn how to use
directly API from OpenAI,

89
00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.870
you can move to Azure at any time.

90
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.269
But as we are doing this video,
Azure OpenAI APIs are still in beta,

91
00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:27.790
and closed, so
you need to apply to get access to them.

92
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.280
So we're going to use the one from
OpenAI that they are open to everyone.

93
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.800
Also, we will talk a little bit
about something on top of ChatGPT.

94
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.580
It's known as plugins.

95
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.710
Plugins for ChatGPT are also something
that is not yet available to every user.

96
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.913
But it's another way that we have as web
developers, or as service providers,

97
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:58.110
or content providers,
to integrate into the ChatGPT ecosystem.

98
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.272
So large language models can be used for
several tasks without changing or

99
00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:05.620
training models.

100
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.313
So before LLMs were actually so popular,
in the deep learning environment,

101
00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:17.870
we have to select one particular model
that we need for something in particular.

102
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.922
We wanna categorize products,
we had a model for that.

103
00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:27.100
We wanna translate, we had a model.

104
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.904
And most of the time we were able
to train our own models, okay?

105
00:07:30.904 --> 00:07:32.860
That's part of deep learning.

106
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.609
But now we realize that we
can use LLMs such as GPT for

107
00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:44.250
a lot of tasks without the need to
change the model or to train any model.

108
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.611
That's why everyone is excited about LLMs.

109
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:53.011
We found that it's very useful for
a lot of tasks.
