WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.710
We are web developers, right?

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.610
So we mentioned that.

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.840
So what's the relationship between
open AI Chat GPT and web development?

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.360
So this is what we can do as web
developers first integration.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.010
We can use artificial intelligence for
your apps.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.540
We can integrate that in your app for
many things.

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.712
We can create, we can transfer and
manipulate data,

8
00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:29.260
conversations, we can create chatbots.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.620
And there are many other ideas that
they will show you in a minute.

10
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.110
That's one thing that we can do and
we will focus on that today.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.290
You can create plugins In this case,
plugins from ChatGPT.

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.040
For example, we can create
the front-end masters plugin.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.750
So you can ask ChatGPT about in
which course from front-end masters,

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.990
I can learn about web push.

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.456
Then ChatGPT will talk to the web service
that we can create here in frontend

16
00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:04.708
masters and it will respond with the data
that then Chat GPT will process,

17
00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:08.060
understand and create the output.

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.790
That's a plugin.

19
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.770
We can also use GPT for content creation.

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.910
That's a different,
it's more around marketing and SEO.

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.080
We are not going to really,
really cover that today.

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.679
And there is also some questions today and
some of you may be wondering,

23
00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.220
we do have SEO right search
engine optimizations.

24
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.672
Well, do we need an AIO,
artificial intelligence

25
00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:39.744
optimization because now AI
can read web content being can

26
00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:44.520
read the Bing version of GPT,
can browse the website.

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.680
Now there is a plugin for
chat GPT that can also browse the website.

28
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.760
The plugin is still not available to
everyone, but it will in short time.

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.439
So do we need to prepare or

30
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.890
do something to serve better our AI?

31
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.570
Well, we'll see.

32
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.450
The quick answer is no, we don't
need to do anything in particular.

33
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.429
However, there are still some
people working with that and

34
00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.720
say playing with that to
see what they can achieve.

35
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.627
So let's talk a little
bit about some ideas or

36
00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:27.800
ideas that you can start thinking about.

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.870
So what things we can
do as web developers.

38
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.053
You can use GPT for user input detection,
such as hate speech,

39
00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:42.170
content that you don't
want in your system.

40
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.654
So you can Pass user input to ChatGPT and
ask for something in return.

41
00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:55.530
That something can be categorized this
content in these possible options.

42
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.850
And then you can automatically reject
that or not within your system.

43
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.667
Content creation you can
create content on the fly.

44
00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:10.496
Sentiment analysis for example,
you have a review system and you can send

45
00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:16.244
that the user is sending you a review
of any of your services or products.

46
00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:23.180
You can send a text to ChatGPT and
ask ChatGPT to give you just one answer.

47
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.300
Is this positive or negative?

48
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.612
And based on that,

49
00:03:26.612 --> 00:03:31.790
you can change the message that you
reply to that user automatically.

50
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.670
And if it's negative, for example,
you can send an email to someone.

51
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.870
So that someone can reach the customer for
blah, blah, blah.

52
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.419
Make sense?
So that's one idea.

53
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.604
You can customize or make articles or

54
00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:52.880
content really personal for
example, maybe a newspaper.

55
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.708
You have a newspaper, of course,
a journalist, or maybe ChatGPT,

56
00:03:56.708 --> 00:04:01.200
someone wrote an article, it's published,
but maybe I don't understand it.

57
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.533
So I can ask the website with
maybe a drop-down option for

58
00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:11.754
a simpler version, or a summary,
or a version as if I'm

59
00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:16.886
10 years old, or
a different language or whatever.

60
00:04:16.886 --> 00:04:23.270
And you can then customize that text and
offer a service to your readers.

61
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.758
So, and then can improve the time on your
page, and then you have more ads, and

62
00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:29.810
more views, and maybe more money.

63
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.200
Language translation is
actually pretty good.

64
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.037
It's better than Google Translate,
translating to languages,

65
00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:40.579
even to languages that
are not even common.

66
00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.396
I don't know, Guarani,
that's from Paraguay,

67
00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:46.810
that on Google Translate is not
available or not good enough.

68
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.315
Search, you can use it for
a search box and

69
00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:55.870
you can use ChatPT to find
the content within your database or

70
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.610
within your articles for that, and
we will explain how that's done later.

71
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.921
To summarize content,
GPT is pretty good on that,

72
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:13.020
q&amp;aIt can create the Q&amp;A for you.

73
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.370
Test automation, now talking about code,
it can actually write your tests directly.

74
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.520
Chatbots, that's like the first
step when we are dealing with GPT.

75
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.770
Let's create a chatbot.

76
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.260
So then it can offer like
customer service to your users.

77
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.912
You should use ethics here and
say to the user, hey,

78
00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:39.394
this is AI have in mind that and
there's more email generation,

79
00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:44.070
content filtering, content tagging,
this is pretty cool.

80
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.453
So you have an article, you can tag
the article so then it's better to connect

81
00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:52.623
articles between them instead
of doing this manually.

82
00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:54.920
You can automate social media.

83
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.316
So you can post on Twitter on
Instagram automatically when

84
00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:04.341
something happens on your page and
make that content doesn't like

85
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.930
look automatic like it's always
the same text is not a template.

86
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.800
ChatGPT can generate
different versions of that.

87
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.370
Keyword Research for SEO,
a spelling and grammar error.

88
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.407
So text correction, that's pretty cool and
that content enhancement,

89
00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.410
maybe you have a lot of
articles without the machine.

90
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.640
Now you can create images around that.

91
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.820
Content Creation, email filtering or
even automatic transcriptions on videos.

92
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.940
There are more ideas.

93
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.490
This is just a list of ideas of what
you can do as a web developer with AI.

94
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.523
And by the way,
this is not ideas of integrating your app,

95
00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:48.519
like make an AI app for something.

96
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.403
You can make an app that uses
AI as part of the business.

97
00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:58.946
So in this case, we were just talking
about ideas for any website, but

98
00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:03.723
you can create an app that can translate
JavaScript into something else or

99
00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.060
any language into JavaScript.

100
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.550
So in that case,
you use AI as the core of your business.

101
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.889
We can use other specific artificial
intelligence models in our apps

102
00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.490
on website.

103
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.680
But what makes LLM easier is
that they are multipurpose.

104
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.340
So then we don't need
to train a new model.

105
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.480
We don't need to create a new API.

106
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.470
We don't need to do anything we just set
up in our app, server side, client side.

107
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.470
We will see later what's better but

108
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.970
we can just have one codebase to
talk to LLMs for all the purposes.

109
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.780
We don't need to set up
different models for that.

110
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.585
That's the great advantage of LLMs.
