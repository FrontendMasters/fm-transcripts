00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.125
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: What did we do, right?

2
00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:03.680
So we proposed different scenarios, right?

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.343
I think you fully understand that now.

4
00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:08.000
And you see the scenarios
that we went through, right?

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.720
We evaluated multiple solutions.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.155
You didn't just come out of this
course building one deployment.

7
00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:18.235
You started somewhere and then you
went through the process of building

8
00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:21.635
out that deployment all the way
till a much larger scale, or

9
00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.040
at least what would be
a much larger scale, right?

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.160
We iterated over existing changes.

11
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.882
I showed you guys how to start in one
place and then kind of move to the right

12
00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:33.999
so that you're not blocking
developer's productivity and

13
00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.480
any other things like that.

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.261
And then once you've done that,
you kind of move back over to the left so

15
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.720
that they can continue working over here,
but

16
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.300
then you can keep moving forward as well
as reusing things you've already created.

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.140
We already had GitHub actions.

18
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.002
We already had AWS credentials in GitHub
actions, so we could reuse GitHub

19
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:57.943
actions to run Terraform as well as our
deployments have more automation and

20
00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:01.390
more benefits to what we're building.

21
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.710
Yeah, and we adapted for future scenarios.

22
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.352
So one thing to note is every
step of the phases that we

23
00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:13.216
went through was just a preparation for
the next step.

24
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:17.828
You start out on App Runner running some
SSM and that prepares you for the next

25
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:23.630
step of like, okay, let's get some
automation and some CI and some CD, right?

26
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.390
That's kind of the evolution of it.

27
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.087
And then eventually you go like,
all right,

28
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.748
we're gonna take ownership over this now.

29
00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:32.645
We're gonna keep taking
on future problems, but

30
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:38.630
keep making sure we adapt for
future solutions as well, right?

31
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.479
And I think you can see how we built that
path of, okay, we can start here, but

32
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.989
it won't be terrible to get here when
we want to in the future, right?

33
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.670
So what did we learn?

34
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.350
How to approach, again,
how to approach different scenarios.

35
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.671
I think this is when I first started
thinking about this course and

36
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.387
the things I hear often on stream or
other people asking me, it's not so

37
00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:05.100
much, how do I build this one cluster or
whatever.

38
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.700
It's more like, how do I gain experience?

39
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.900
And so what you experienced over the last
two days is really what you would deal

40
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.588
with normally at the day and
day job, building and

41
00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:16.940
learning how to grow something.

42
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180
You learned how to make
impactful decisions as well.

43
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.518
I definitely feel like you are all much
more confident now in at least being able

44
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.820
to say like, okay,
maybe this isn't a good decision yet.

45
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.095
Maybe this is how you
can actually help and

46
00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:32.090
impact the business part of the company.

47
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.440
How to grow a managing infrastructure,
again,

48
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.192
we started in start-up,
moved through growth all the way to scale.

49
00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:43.906
You got to see the application
kind of live in multiple scenarios

50
00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:49.210
as it got lifted up higher and higher
into its new and its final destination.

51
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.850
And then, yeah,
how to manage deployment strategies.

52
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.790
You saw how we can deploy
directly from CI to an instance.

53
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.990
We showed how you can use AWS to
trigger tasks and run them remotely.

54
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.750
We showed how you can deploy
on main versus deploy on prod.

55
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
Right, so there's a lot of options
with how you can do stuff.

56
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.310
And one other thing to note,
you don't have to use a prod branch.

57
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.368
For example, if you're like,
you know what, let's use tags, right,

58
00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:23.968
then you could just say, okay,
listen on tags and when tags run,

59
00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:27.120
then run the deploy branch or
run the deploy job, right?

60
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.440
There's not a lot of limitations here,
you can kinda do whatever you want.

61
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.720
So those strategies I hope are helpful
when you're trying to move in the future.

62
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.320
I do build things on the Internet.

63
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.332
Like I said, that's my personal GitHub.

64
00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:46.696
That's my company's GitHub,
where all the other course information and

65
00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.930
stuff exists, my Twitch, YouTube,
Twitter, and engineering blog.

66
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.290
But yeah, thank you guys so much.

67
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.983
Again, part of this job is there's
tons of information out there and

68
00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.730
I'm really glad that you listened,
so thank you.

69
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.272
I appreciate it.

70
00:03:59.272 --> 00:03:59.772
