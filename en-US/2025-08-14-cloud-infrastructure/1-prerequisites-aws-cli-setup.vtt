00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.320
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: We are gonna
take a quick second here.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.640
I just wanna make sure that everyone
at least has this stuff set up.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.328
There are some requirements here
to make sure that we can all get

4
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:08.880
through this together.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.433
The first one is just make sure that
you have Docker set up, make sure that

6
00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:16.453
you've got GO installed, make sure that
you've got a GitHub account, make sure

7
00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:20.241
that you've got your GCP account, make
sure that you got your AWS account and

8
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:24.000
credentials, and then also make sure
that you've got a Supabase account.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.355
So before I begin,

10
00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:31.224
I don't mind taking some time to make sure
that everyone has all that stuff set up.

11
00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:36.951
So I'm gonna hop out of this real fast and
then I'm going to log into my AWS.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.500
One second here, okay.

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.900
I just wanna make sure that you
can get to this page right here.

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.470
So if you need to set up an account,
make sure that you get to this page first.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.443
I understand this part is somewhat
annoying a lot because I've done

16
00:00:57.443 --> 00:01:02.150
this a lot, which is just simply
getting credentials on aws.

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.921
If you wanna create a user or create
credentials, the easiest way to do it, and

18
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:09.510
if there's people out there who's like,
no, no, no, do it this way.

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.870
This is the easiest way to do it.

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.710
I'm not telling you it's
the most secure way to do it.

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.227
I'm just telling you the easiest way
to do it is go ahead and up at the top,

22
00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:19.760
type in IAM and then navigate to the IAM.

23
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.520
Do not go to IAM Identity Center.

24
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.460
IAM Identity Center is like
an entirely separate thing for

25
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.560
managing organizations and stuff.

26
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.160
You just wanna go to good old IAM.

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.440
Once you're in IAM, you'll notice that
my account IDs up here, all that stuff.

28
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.430
If I click on Users on the left,

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.680
you'll notice that I have
some users already created.

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.960
I can go ahead and create a whole new.

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.840
And you'll actually notice that I
have a user for the course here too.

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.480
You can create a user by
just clicking Create user.

33
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.584
Give it a name of whatever you want.

34
00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:57.640
So if you wanted it for the course,
you'd just be dem-fd-service.

35
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.400
That's the actual repo.

36
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.421
If you wanted to make it so
that you could log into this user and

37
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.040
actually access the UI,
then you would click this.

38
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.680
I don't need to worry about that.

39
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.920
So we're just gonna use it for
CLI credentials, then hit Next.

40
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.170
This is the part that again,
people will probably shun me for.

41
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.483
But if you click on Attach policies
directly, you can then give it existing

42
00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:24.850
policies that Amazon kind of
has already created for you.

43
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.770
But there's one right here that you really
want which is just administrator access.

44
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.530
This will make it so that if you
open it up, it's just star star.

45
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.530
It lets you do everything.

46
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.720
So just note that this is
a root level access user.

47
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.520
But again, for
what we're doing, it's fine.

48
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.000
Click Next and then click Create
user down at the bottom right.

49
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.070
And so it'll create that user and
then once that user is created,

50
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.920
you can go to the user itself.

51
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.040
And then there will be a tab here
that says Security credentials.

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.320
You just click on that and
then you'll see Access keys.

53
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.380
Use Access keys to send
programmatic calls.

54
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.060
You click Create access key and
then it'll give you a list again.

55
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.420
This is why I don't expect you to know
this cuz it's already super easy.

56
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.580
It'll give you a list of
what things you wanna click.

57
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.580
Just click Command Line to use it.

58
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.730
With the command line,
click I understand at the bottom and

59
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.620
then click Next and
then click Create access key.

60
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.724
What this is gonna do is this is
going to create you a access key and

61
00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:35.100
a secret access key.

62
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.965
B But you can then export those to your
shell by basically copying this and

63
00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.030
pasting it.

64
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.276
Obviously don't use these credentials
because these are the fake ones that they

65
00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:46.750
put in their article.

66
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.510
But you can replace the values and
then you should be set up with your shell.

67
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.098
So once you've got those
credentials added to your shell,

68
00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:01.135
if you wanna check and
make sure that it's working,

69
00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:06.550
you can do aws in your shell s3 and
then ls so aws space s3 ls.

70
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.867
If you hit enter and you either see
nothing or something like this happens,

71
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:17.430
then you are connected,
you have authenticated.

72
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.670
And again, if you see nothing,
that's fine too.

73
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.350
If you weren't auth, it would just tell
you, hey, you're not authenticated.
