00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.760
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: We're gonna
go into the growth phase now.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.071
I do feel confident that you guys had a
good experience of what the startup phase

3
00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:07.600
feels like.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.760
So let's try and
improve it a little bit, right?

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.960
We do wanna make it so
that we can not have so much.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.400
We do wanna get rid of those headaches.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.932
We wanna get rid of the headaches
of maybe deploying and

8
00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:21.360
some of the other stuff
that we have to deal with.

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.080
We don't wanna change everything,
but just some things, right?

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.080
Here's our phase scenario for phase two.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.917
So we're shipping code, right?

12
00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.192
We have no integration process though,
right?

13
00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:39.183
So we don't really have any way of
running tests or doing tests, right?

14
00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:41.280
We don't have a real delivery process.

15
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.255
We do, but it still means that we have
to manually build the image ourselves to

16
00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:46.550
deploy things, right?

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.620
When we go back to that chart, right,

18
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.309
the computer on the right is connected
directly to the resources and

19
00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.240
that's because you have to
manage those resources.

20
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.720
So we wanna replace that.

21
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.760
We don't wanna do that.

22
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.340
We wanna have some kind of
actual delivery process.

23
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.420
However, we don't wanna
replace anything massive.

24
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.132
We're not ready to get out of App Runner
yet, we like App Runner, it works,

25
00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:12.980
maybe some dev on the team's like,
I hate App Runner, it's fine, it works.

26
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.540
We can keep moving, right?

27
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.044
So we don't wanna really change
anything on that side of things, but

28
00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:23.549
maybe there's other things that we
can do to kind of make this move and

29
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.660
our growth a little bit faster.

30
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.300
The goals in this phase are we
want to improve data reliability.

31
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.340
As you recall, we manually copy and
pasted SQL statements.

32
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.500
We weren't really doing a great
job of managing our data.

33
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.020
And when you're managing a company
especially you want to manage that data.

34
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.218
Well, right, does anyone guess or

35
00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:53.340
can anyone guess what I may be
alluding to that we might be missing?

36
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.050
They've been around forever.

37
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.730
It has relation to databases.

38
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.621
What's the one thing we have to
run whenever we make changes to?

39
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.290
&gt;&gt; Male Student 1: Migrations.

40
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.250
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: Migrations, exactly,
yeah, so we have no migrations, right?

41
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.050
It's just copy and paste data and run.

42
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.170
Migrations is missing here, right?

43
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.890
We wanna improve data
reliability through that.

44
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.970
We wanna improve the developer experience.

45
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.435
Again, it was a little clunky to
get everything up and running and

46
00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:21.010
running commands and stuff.

47
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.952
It was like, where's this?

48
00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:27.410
Again, that was purposeful for
you guys to have to remember.

49
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.930
I hate remembering commands [LAUGH].

50
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.890
Right, there's a way of solving that and
I'm gonna show you how to do that.

51
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.210
We need to create an actual
integration solution.

52
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.890
So we want CI.

53
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.210
We want an actual CI that we can lean on.

54
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.410
We want also a delivery solution.

55
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.180
We want a way of actually leaning on
something that will deliver our changes as

56
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.230
well for us, right?

57
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.937
So again, four big takeaway or
the four big goals, data reliability,

58
00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:56.181
developer experience,
integration, and delivery, right?

59
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:58.610
Requirements for
this are exactly as the other one.

60
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.852
This is why I said it's a lot easier
once we get through the first phase,

61
00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:03.890
cuz all the other phases
build on top of it.

62
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.050
And it's supposed to feel that way, right?

63
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.841
It's supposed to feel like,
okay, we already did this,

64
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:11.570
I don't wanna have to go back and
do that again, right?

65
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.770
So, yeah,
pretty much all the same requirements.

66
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.170
You don't need to set anything else up.

67
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.810
You guys have all your AWS and
everything working so fantastic.

68
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.310
This is what we're gonna be building,
right?

69
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.898
Now you might look at it and say, okay,
well, it looks pretty similar, and

70
00:03:27.898 --> 00:03:31.572
it is, as a matter of fact,
the front end side of it, right?

71
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:35.218
The client experience,
how App Runner works, what it talks to and

72
00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:38.670
what it communicates with
is pretty much the same.

73
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.431
However, you'll notice that there's
space between the developers and

74
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:47.460
the resources and
this is purposeful, right?

75
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.880
Once you get to a point where
you get more than one developer,

76
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.703
you need to figure out a way of
separating them from the resources and

77
00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:59.402
the infrastructure, because that's more
possibility of them breaking things or

78
00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:03.060
more possibility of things happening,
right?

79
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.033
And so what we're doing and the focus
of this really to grow through or

80
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.620
to grow into the next part.

81
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.360
Again, we're not just
growing the application,

82
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.540
we're growing the team, right?

83
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.310
The team needs to be able to
deploy things automatically.

84
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.470
The team needs to be able to
update schemas and stuff.

85
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.900
So with that, when we talk about growth,
we're talking about the entire growth of

86
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.830
the organization,
not just the application itself.

87
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.182
If the application itself grew,
just the application itself grew,

88
00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:32.350
none of this would need to change.

89
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.910
Why would it?

90
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.750
It's just you, you know what I mean?

91
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.935
But when you start talking
about two people, four people,

92
00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:40.991
ten people, 20 people,
having a delivery process and

93
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.280
something that automates all of those
things for you is still pretty critical.

94
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.984
Now, one thing you will note is that
configuration is still manual, but

95
00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:51.600
that's always gonna be manual, right?

96
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.389
Somebody's gonna have to go in and update
a configuration somewhere and then deploy

97
00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.360
that configuration, whether it be Vault,
Secrets Manager, whatever, right?

98
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.311
We're just using Secrets Manager as
a depot for all of our configs and

99
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:08.610
then our applications run from those,
right?

100
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.010
So that doesn't really change much.

101
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.317
But everything else for now is staying
exactly or sorry, besides that staying

102
00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:18.570
the same, everything else is gonna kinda
change and how we interact with it.

103
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.931
So I'm gonna show you really quickly where
you can find the things because honestly,

104
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:23.529
we are not gonna do what we did last time.

105
00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.730
This time I am gonna
have you guys copy stuff.

106
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.090
We are gonna move fast.

107
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.290
So there's a few things
I want you to note.

108
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.375
The first thing that is if you
go into the fem-fd-service repo,

109
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:40.530
you will now see
a stage-02-growth branch in here.

110
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.123
The first thing you'll notice is we have a
migrations directory now that we're gonna

111
00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:45.770
be adding.

112
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.050
And inside of that you'll actually
see our first migration file.

113
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.330
And if we click on that,
hey, look at that.

114
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.050
It's the readme stuff, right?

115
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.170
We created our migration out of
our schema in our readme, right?

116
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.090
So we're gonna go through that.

117
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.330
I'm gonna show you guys how many
here knows what a make file is.

118
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.470
Okay, we've got one person who knows.

119
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.070
So if you don't know what a makefile is,
it's been around for a long time.

120
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.590
But this is how a lot of like older system
or a lot of older applications were built.

121
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.350
But this is a file that can help
you run commands effectively.

122
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.035
It makes it so that all the commands and
all the stuff that you run locally,

123
00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:28.473
you can actually abstract that away and
make it so

124
00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:30.750
that you just can run
much simpler commands.

125
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.460
And as I scroll through this, you can
kind of tell there's a lot in here.

126
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.060
So we're gonna be doing that.

127
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.460
We're also gonna be
updating the docker file.

128
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.675
You'll notice that this dockerfile
is a little bit more intricate than

129
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:42.380
the other one.

130
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.380
And that's purposeful.

131
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.860
We're making some changes there for
specific reasons.

132
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.025
And then the last and most important thing
is you'll notice here, next to my commit,

133
00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:53.980
I have a little green check mark.

134
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.455
Well, that's because we're also going to
be setting up a continuous integration and

135
00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:03.505
delivery pipeline with which will
build our code, test it, and

136
00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:05.990
then optionally deploy it when ready.

137
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.109
For all of you that have open
PRs right now with your changes,

138
00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:10.710
go ahead and merge them for me.

139
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.590
So go ahead and merge that into main for
me if you guys are good.

140
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.397
So go ahead and take all your changes
that you have in your branch,

141
00:07:16.397 --> 00:07:18.350
whether your deployment's working or not.

142
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.150
Don't worry about it,
it's just the docker file.

143
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.905
But go ahead and
take all those changes and

144
00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:25.510
then just merge them in your PR for me.

145
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.200
So you'll wanna go to your PR here.

146
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.400
Now, I'm not gonna merge mine, but
just go ahead and do that for me.

147
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.640
You can do squash and merge.

148
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.972
You can do whatever you want, but just
go ahead and merge those changes for me.
