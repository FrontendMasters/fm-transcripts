00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.344
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: The objective of this
course is really to gain real world full

2
00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:04.960
stack deployment experience.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.200
I wanna take this from
a different perspective,

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.853
which is not just like, hey,
let's just build something and

5
00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:18.800
take away what you can from
that one thing that you built.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.063
This course is more focused on
going through the evolution of

7
00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:28.700
infrastructure and going through
the evolution of an application.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.226
So we're actually going to be
seeing infrastructure grow and

9
00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:37.060
change from the startup phase, the growth
phase, the scale stages and all of that.

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.483
So that's really what I want you to gain
or take away from this course is not just

11
00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:45.707
to be able to build an application, but
actually understand why we built or

12
00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:48.340
deployed the application
the way that we did.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.300
My name is Erik Reinert, also known
as Blackglasses on the Internet.

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.520
I'm a senior software engineer.

15
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.040
I'm a content creator.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.120
I enjoy making diagrams and flowcharts and
I'm a habitual problem solver.

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.040
It's one of my favorite things to do,

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.680
which is a big reason why I
am in the career I am today.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.400
I started out as a Frontend engineer.

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400
I did that for about two and a half years.

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.360
I worked with Frontend before
React was even a thing.

22
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.720
PHP days, good old PHP days.

23
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.640
And then I kinda realized
that I hated that.

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.982
And so I ended up moving from front end
and learning kind of that experience and

25
00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:28.963
what I gained from it to backend
engineering where I then started working

26
00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:32.097
on backends and
learning things like Typescript and Go,

27
00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:37.220
learning how to build more communication
between systems and stuff like that.

28
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.540
And then I kind of follow that into full
stack and I did that for a while as well.

29
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.278
I worked at a startup where I was kind of
lead POC on a lot of the things that we

30
00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:48.430
were trying to do to get them out.

31
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.430
And then again I kind of had, if you
notice a little bit of a pattern here

32
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.030
of almost every two and a half years I get
bored and then I go do something else.

33
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.110
And so that's what I was doing.

34
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.695
And this is kind of why I like
talking about this really quickly is I

35
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:07.950
don't think any of us have
deterministic paths in this career.

36
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.783
Someday you might wanna
be a Frontend engineer,

37
00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.430
someday you might wanna do Backend,
you might wanna do other things.

38
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.693
And so that was a big reason are a big
part of why I kept jumping so much was

39
00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:21.317
because I kept following that curiosity
which led me to really what I do now,

40
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:24.490
which is DevOps and Platform Engineering.

41
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.399
I focus very heavily on solving business
problems, solving them at scale and

42
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.629
solving developer problems as well,
which is something I again,

43
00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.538
throughout the years of working in
multiple areas, I kinda learned and got to

44
00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:43.390
grow and understand what people hate
because I hated a lot of that stuff too.

45
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.735
So yeah, just a note about if
you're ever wondering about should

46
00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:55.630
I get into DevOps or anything like that,
this is kind of how I got into it.

47
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.990
I do have three of my own courses
that are on the platform.

48
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.938
I try and
stay in my own world a little bit, but

49
00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:04.910
I do like to branch out as much as I can.

50
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.558
I have introduction to DevOps for
developers,

51
00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:09.678
enterprise Cloud Infrastructure and

52
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:14.130
Introduction to Backend Architectures
if you're curious about the courses.

53
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.477
Basically, introduction to DevOps for

54
00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:20.930
developers is really focused on
devs who wanna get into DevOps.

55
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.701
You've never built pipelines before,

56
00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:25.730
you've never learned how to automate
things or anything like that.

57
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.511
It's a great course to
get started with again,

58
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:31.890
can help with some of
this stuff we do today.

59
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.330
Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure.

60
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.170
This one's really focused on, okay, I'm at
a company now, I'm managing tons of teams.

61
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.840
How do I go to scale?

62
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.007
This is, I would say, a little bit beyond
the course that we're doing today,

63
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:48.923
but you can kinda see how we get
to there after this course and

64
00:03:48.923 --> 00:03:52.320
then Introduction to
Backend Architectures.

65
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.492
So if you've ever been curious
about how do I build backends,

66
00:03:55.492 --> 00:03:58.482
how do I make sure that they're
communicating properly,

67
00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:01.440
how do I scale them properly,
all of that kind of stuff.

68
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.600
Introduction to Backend Architectures
is a pretty good one to check out too.

69
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.156
And again, these all really kind of relate
to each other, so if you're interested,

70
00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:11.520
be sure to check them out.

71
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.320
So yeah,
let's get into the course introduction.

72
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.360
I wanted to use this GIF because I
felt like it was pretty appropriate.

73
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.360
We're gonna be doing a lot today,
[LAUGH] so strap in.

74
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360
I hope you guys are excited.

75
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.800
This course is a heavy,
heavy workshop course.

76
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.880
It really is focused on being hands-on.

77
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.274
So yeah, there are a few prerequisites for
this course, but

78
00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.870
they're also really basic.

79
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.670
I wouldn't be too stressed
about any of these prereqs.

80
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.390
They're just really checklists really.

81
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.070
If you have a little bit of a fundamental
knowledge of Docker, that's fine.

82
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.830
I really only expect you to have ran the
CLI and maybe built one container image.

83
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.993
I don't expect you to know what linking
is and volumes and none of that, but just

84
00:04:55.993 --> 00:05:01.408
a good understanding why you're using it
and having maybe ran a Docker file or two.

85
00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:06.440
Experience using Git and GitHub, we're
gonna be working with source control.

86
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.867
We're gonna be using GitHub as
where all that source control goes,

87
00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:11.720
as well as all of our automation.

88
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.400
So GitHub and
Git are tied together on this one.

89
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.240
A basic understanding of Amazon.

90
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.600
And when I say basic, I mean very basic.

91
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.560
I do not expect you to
be some cloud architect.

92
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.344
I do not expect you to know all of
the resources in Amazon and if you do,

93
00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:28.400
that's amazing.

94
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.228
I don't, but yeah, just a basic
understanding of maybe used it once or

95
00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:36.055
twice, set up the CLI, stuff like that.

96
00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:39.660
Command-line and scripting experience.

97
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.980
Again, very simple, use the command-line,
know that you've used it,

98
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.620
having messed around with it a little bit.

99
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.900
And same thing with scripting.

100
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.860
There's only one real script in the entire
course, but it's a little bit of a doozy.

101
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.350
So I'd like to make sure that
you at least understand it.

102
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.076
AWS account, this is really just for
the actual course itself,

103
00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:02.550
something that you can
provision resources in.

104
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.910
I do wanna be clear.

105
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.310
We will be provisioning
things that cost money.

106
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.709
Sorry, them's the ways of cloud.

107
00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.898
The course is really focused on making
sure that you can at least delete

108
00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:15.750
everything.

109
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.530
Everything's on the free tier, so
don't worry about breaking your wallet or

110
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.590
anything like that.

111
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.350
We're not provisioning 32
core instances or anything.

112
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.590
But yeah, just an AWS account.

113
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.350
Make sure that you can create stuff and
all of that.

114
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.097
Also GCP account,
we're only really using it just for

115
00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:41.390
the credential side, but
being able to log in and access a project.

116
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.893
And then again Supabase as well with
a free plan, you might be like,

117
00:06:44.893 --> 00:06:46.870
why are we using Amazon and Supabase?

118
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.910
Don't worry, we'll get into it later.

119
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.510
But yeah, those are really
all the things that you need.

120
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.947
The three phases that we're gonna be
going into are the start-up phase,

121
00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.950
the growth phase and then the scale phase.

122
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.390
So the start-up phase is really
just the tried and true.

123
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.110
Just get it working, right?

124
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.070
That's the whole point
of the start-up phase.

125
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.373
And what we're gonna do and what we're
gonna focus on is just plain and simple,

126
00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:09.270
just get it working.

127
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.150
I just wanna get my app online,
I just wanna get it running in production.

128
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.190
I just wanna make sure that
it can easily be accessible.

129
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.240
I don't wanna worry about hosting things
or resources or cloud or any of that.

130
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.120
Just get it working.

131
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.680
The growth phase, we got to go fast.

132
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.160
Okay, now it's working great, fantastic.

133
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.471
We got to keep pushing code,
we got to keep making changes,

134
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:34.160
we got to keep delivering features.

135
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.240
This is normally the next part of
the evolution of an application.

136
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.031
Hopefully, right, you make it, you get it
online, and then after you get it online,

137
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:46.000
you start dealing with growth and
how to handle that.

138
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.480
Then again, the last phase,
scale phase is really plan for the future.

139
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.545
Normally when you start
dealing with scale,

140
00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:57.280
you're starting to think about how much
traffic will we have a year from now?

141
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.280
How much traffic are we dealing with
between now and a year from now?

142
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.200
Where are we gonna be as a company?

143
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.280
Right, all of these kind of
things take into consideration.

144
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.500
So I do have links online for
all of the materials, so

145
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.280
if you need them, you can access them.

146
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.850
The main link that you will need is just
gitHub.com/ALT-F4-LLC/fem-fd-service.

147
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.330
That's the main root repo.

148
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.890
So if you guys wanna go ahead and
pull that up now, feel free.

149
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.570
Each phase in this course is
set up into its own branch.

150
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.720
Now we're gonna start
with the main branch, so

151
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.210
we're just gonna start with
the default main branch.

152
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.803
But if you want to skip ahead and look
really quickly at the other branches to

153
00:08:39.803 --> 00:08:44.460
see the final results of what we're gonna
be doing, you're more than welcome to.

154
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.894
Or if after the course later on you
wanna go back and reference it,

155
00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.140
you're more than welcome to as well.

156
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.414
And again, like I said,

157
00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:54.893
each stage has its own branch that
I've been maintaining for this.
