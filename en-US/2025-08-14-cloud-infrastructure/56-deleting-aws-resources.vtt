00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.480
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: If you want to tear
everything down really quickly, Fantastic.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.280
Perfect timing.

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.193
Right as I finish provisioning,

4
00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.280
there's going to be two
things you really need to do.

5
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.800
Let me just make sure that the pipeline's
not also running in the background.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.520
Okay, cool.

7
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.242
All right, so
if you wanna tear down really fast,

8
00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:17.880
there's gonna be a couple of things
you're gonna wanna make sure to check.

9
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.963
The first thing you're going to want to
check is you're going to want to go to

10
00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:21.840
App Runner, right?

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.941
And you're going to want to make sure
that you delete all the applications in

12
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:25.480
App Runner.

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.420
So if you go to App Runner,
I deleted all of mine.

14
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.341
But make sure you go in App Runner,

15
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:33.340
check the box of each
application that you deployed.

16
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.100
If you deployed more than one,
click delete and delete them.

17
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.980
So App Runner is gonna be one of
the places you're gonna wanna go.

18
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.260
Another place you're going
to want to go is ssm.

19
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.220
Remember on day one,
we created parameters in SSM as well.

20
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.380
So you're going to want to make sure
to go to the parameter store in here.

21
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.070
Go to /fem/.

22
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.997
You only need to delete the FEM FD
service ones because the Terraform ones

23
00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:01.350
created them automatically.

24
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.940
Those will get destroyed
with Terraform Destroy, but

25
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.710
you will want to at least make
sure you delete these three.

26
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.590
Those are there.

27
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.870
Outside of that,
everything else is in Terraform Destroy.

28
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.070
So you just run Terraform Destroy and
you're good.

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.470
That's all the Amazon stuff.

30
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.570
The only other thing you'd have
to be worried about is Supabase.

31
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.588
You just go to Supabase,
click on FEM FD Service,

32
00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:32.010
go to Project Settings, Delete,
Project, and there you go.

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.810
You are done.

34
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.170
Ecr.

35
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.730
Ecr.

36
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.450
Yeah, yeah, good call.

37
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.730
ECR as well.

38
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.383
ECR, we manually created the image.

39
00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:44.785
So if we go to ECR, you'll see that
you can just click on them right here,

40
00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:47.800
click Delete, Delete and it's gone.

41
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.200
So, yeah, that should be everything.

42
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.174
Yeah, and then again,

43
00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:53.880
Terraform Destroy [LAUGH] make
sure to run terraform destroy.

44
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.960
That's the one you really
want to make sure you run.

45
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.520
So run Terraform Destroy for sure.

46
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.600
Especially if you created
multiple environments.

47
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.800
So if you're nervous like,
did I get everything or not?

48
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.982
You can go to Cost Viewer or
Cost Explorer, and

49
00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:11.560
in here it will show you exactly
what you're getting charged for.

50
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.560
I mean,
you're going to see my terrible charges.

51
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.758
But all you have to do is scroll down and

52
00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:20.365
you could see exactly what you're getting
charged for, where it might be, and

53
00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:25.430
then you can just navigate to that part of
the console and delete whatever's there.

54
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.835
So, yeah, at the end of the day,

55
00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:30.102
if you want to make sure you're not
getting any costs you're not expecting,

56
00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:33.590
go in here, check it out, and you should
be able to find what you're looking for.
