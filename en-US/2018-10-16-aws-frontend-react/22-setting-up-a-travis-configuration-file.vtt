00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:02.757
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what I'm going to do

2
00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:08.635
is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I

3
00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.637
am going to go to the Travis CI page.

4
00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:31.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yours might look a little
emptier, I notice that apparently, yikes.

5
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.380
I thought I signed up for a Travis CI
account when I was preparing for this.

6
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.253
But it looks like any repository that
somebody else is user Travis CI that I

7
00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.384
have access to was already on that list.

8
00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.341
So you could see nothing,
you might see lots of stuff.

9
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:49.128
Both are totally fine, but
I don't know what you'll see in this case,

10
00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:52.803
you register by logging
in with your GitHub.

11
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:58.473
So this tiny little plus sign right there,
that is how we add a new repository.

12
00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:02.643
And in here, you can search through
all of your various different repos,

13
00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:04.805
whether they be forked or otherwise.

14
00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:12.434
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If you just pushed it
up recently and you don't see it there,

15
00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:14.905
right, you can hit sync account.

16
00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:18.068
Cuz it fetches your GitHub repos every so
often, you're like,

17
00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:21.844
I have never pushed up and I doesn't have
a repo, and then I do and it's not there.

18
00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:26.761
It's okay, just push it up and
then hit sync account.

19
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:32.122
Right, and then also,
you have to clear and do the such again.

20
00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:37.045
You might even treat yourself to a page
refresh, cuz distributed systems are hard.

21
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:41.116
But here's the one that I
have been working on, and so

22
00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.387
I will go ahead and
I will just switch it on.

23
00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:47.730
Cool, and then from there,
we can go into settings.

24
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.740
Now, in the setup instructions,

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.070
I put together a YAML file that's
gonna be our build process.

26
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.973
So let's look at it together,
and then we will add it in.

27
00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:03.847
Here it is, and this is a YAML
file that we'll give Travis in

28
00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:07.859
order to figure out all
the things that it needs.

29
00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:13.963
So we'll say that this is a Node app,
it'll use Node 8 to build it.

30
00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:18.633
That is, I think 10 is now LTS,
but 8 is also an LTS version,

31
00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:20.938
which is long-term support.

32
00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:25.922
So it's usually good, but
8 is pretty stable at this point.

33
00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:28.890
We'll say cache the yarn dependency,
so this way,

34
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.627
it won't download all your dependencies
on every build if they haven't changed.

35
00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:38.455
And the Node modules directory, again,
ideally, we don't wanna have to wait to do

36
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.399
a entire mpm install, a yarn install,
every single time we deploy.

37
00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.440
If the tendencies haven't changed,
cache those folders.

38
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.570
Go ahead and
run the test suite before you do anything.

39
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.667
So if the test suite fails,
then the build will fail, which is good,

40
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.444
it's a little safety thing.

41
00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.650
At SendGrid, we actually even
have our integration tests run.

42
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.846
Where I'll go spin up the app,
use a headless browser,

43
00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:03.274
hit at it a bunch of ways.

44
00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:08.397
So we'll know before we deploy bad code,
most of the time.

45
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:13.320
All right, so then before you deploy,
we wanna add this mpm library,

46
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.577
which its name should do an okay
job explaining what it does,

47
00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:20.759
travis-ci-cloudfront-invalidation.

48
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:25.046
Anyone wanna venture a wild
guess what this tool does?

49
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:34.202
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not all at once, creates
CloudFront invalidations from Travis CI.

50
00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:38.208
All right, so we're just adding
that as a global command, and

51
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.256
then we'll also build the app.

52
00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:44.423
All right, finally, what is deploying,
we're gonna deploy to S3.

53
00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:47.544
These are environment variables
that you're gonna need to set.

54
00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:51.247
All right,
we'll set them together in a moment, well,

55
00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:53.649
I'll set mine, you will set yours.

56
00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:58.587
And then it takes effectively
four environment variables,

57
00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:02.456
the AWS access key,
the AWS secret access key,

58
00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:06.638
what the name of the bucket
you want to deploy to is.

59
00:04:06.638 --> 00:04:09.571
And then finally, when we create
the CloudFront invalidation,

60
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:12.949
it will need what CloudFront distribution
to create the invalidation on.

61
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.893
So we will have to provide these to Travis
CI, I'm not gonna hard code them in here.

62
00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:23.041
You can set environment variables, and
it'll just read from those as well.

63
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:27.956
Cool, the local-dir will be dist,
which is the one we picked earlier.

64
00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:28.663
And also,

65
00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:33.936
I'm not really cleaning up the bucket
cuz I don't need to remove old versions.

66
00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:36.817
I will wait until that becomes
a cost that I need to deal with,

67
00:04:36.817 --> 00:04:40.590
before I start deleting files
in my bucket, personally.

68
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.388
And we will only deploy
when the branch is master.

69
00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:51.056
Right, so we'll still run the tests and
stuff no mater what,

70
00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:56.741
but we will deploy exclusively
when this commit is on master.

71
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:03.115
And then after deploy,
we will use our new Travis CI CloudFront

72
00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:07.564
invalidation tool to
give it the access ID,

73
00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:11.304
the secret key, the CloudFront ID.

74
00:05:11.304 --> 00:05:16.749
I told you, I just invalidate everything,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

75
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.713
then the branch and the port request.

76
00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:21.581
These are actually provided by Travis,
we don't need to set them.

77
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:28.861
But those are options that the tool
actually takes as things it wants.

78
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:33.350
Cool, so we'll take this, cuz I don't
think anyone wants to watch me type this

79
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.834
and the inevitable typos that will follow.

80
00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:40.103
I'm very good at typing unless people
are watching me, and then I can't type.

81
00:05:40.103 --> 00:05:45.155
So we'll grab, this and
what we'll do is go in here

82
00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:50.531
and,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna create

83
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.548
a new file, and
this file is going to be called

84
00:05:55.548 --> 00:06:02.073
.travis.yml
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

85
00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:04.062
I get this cute little icon, cuz one time,

86
00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:07.336
Mike North made me install cute
little icons into Visual Studio Code.

87
00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:11.025
So now I get a little Travis head
sitting there, if you don't have that,

88
00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:14.312
that's totally fine, all right,
so we've got that in place.

89
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.987
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
the two things I'm changing,

90
00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:23.248
I have this deploy script in here,

91
00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:26.086
which doesn't really matter cuz we're
not actually using it at this point.

92
00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.008
Travis knows how to deploy to S3,

93
00:06:28.008 --> 00:06:32.665
it actually already has the AWS tools
installed as well, so that's pretty great.

94
00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:34.652
And then we have this
Travis file right here.

95
00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:46.261
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'm gonna commit this
to master, it's gonna fail the build,

96
00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:47.794
this isn't gonna work.

97
00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:51.450
It's not gonna work because we never
set those environment variables.

98
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.140
So it legit can't work just yet, so

99
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.760
the build will fail,
you will get emo about it.

100
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.661
What we're gonna do right now is,
we're going to set

101
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:07.442
up those environment variables so
it actually does in fact work.

102
00:07:07.442 --> 00:07:11.191
So I'm gonna show you
where to set them up, and

103
00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:15.818
then we'll take a few minutes and
we'll do it together.

104
00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:17.954
So here it goes, so
you can see that I'm building,

105
00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:19.807
like I said, this isn't going to end well.

106
00:07:22.322 --> 00:07:24.309
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
click this, and go ahead and

107
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.670
actually watch it happen if you like.

108
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.048
I believe personally that watching
a build makes it go faster,

109
00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:33.980
my co-workers explain to me that
it's not actually the case.

110
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.150
But you can watch everything happen,
but again, I've told you already,

111
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.370
this is gonna fail.

112
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.572
So we go to more options,
and go to settings, and

113
00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:45.727
here we have environment variables,
seems like a good place.

114
00:07:45.727 --> 00:07:52.010
You have the key and then the value,
there's also this switch right here.

115
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.407
And the switch is whether or
not you want to encrypt them.

116
00:07:56.407 --> 00:08:00.427
Here's my policy, right, cuz we're gonna
break for a second as I put my keys in and

117
00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:03.940
you put your keys in, cuz I don't need
to broadcast my keys to the world.

118
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.486
Definitely encrypt your AWS access key,
absolutely, no matter what,

119
00:08:10.486 --> 00:08:15.148
definitely, definitely,
definitely encrypt the secret key.

120
00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:20.590
Right, and then we are going to,
I don't encrypt

121
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.523
the S3 bucket name or the CloudFront, why?

122
00:08:25.523 --> 00:08:28.960
Cuz I've messed them up and I need to see
them in case I'm trying to troubleshoot.
