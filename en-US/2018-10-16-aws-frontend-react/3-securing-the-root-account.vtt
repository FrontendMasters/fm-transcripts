00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.655
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I do wanna spend
a little bit of time talking about IAM.

2
00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:08.560
IAM stands for Identity Access and
Management, and

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.670
again, we created a single account and
a tiny little startup.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.720
You might be like, yeah, we'll all just
share the same username and password but

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.480
at a certain amount of scale
that doesn't work, right?

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.580
All you need is one salty person who knows
they're on their last week to go and

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.856
have some fun, right?

8
00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:31.430
So the TL;DR of what IAM is,
it's just how to manage sub accounts.

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.020
You have one main account, and
you can have multiple sub accounts.

10
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.910
We're actually gonna create at least
two sub accounts today, right?

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.590
And one of the reasons is that,
generally speaking,

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.300
we don't want to use our root account,
really for anything, right?

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.760
If we lose control of the root account,
it's kind of like game over,

14
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.010
call the credit card company up and
cancel the credit card.

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.370
So a great way of not losing control
of the root account is just to not

16
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.070
use it, right?

17
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.060
So we'll create a kind
of sub account that has

18
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.590
almost all of the rights as our root
account and we'll use that instead.

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.450
In the same way that most Unix
based computers have a root,

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.250
well, nobody actually ever uses that,
right?

21
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.830
You have some sub-account, and
if you're really super secure,

22
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.720
you have an account that has no admin
rights or something along those lines.

23
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.940
I don't do that, but you should.

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.860
So we're gonna create a new account, and
one thing to keep in mind when you're

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.050
creating accounts is the Principle
of Least Access, right?

26
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.900
Which is only giving accounts as
much power as they need, right?

27
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.360
So when we create
an administrator account,

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.780
that's gonna be separate
from a root account,

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.810
we're gonna give it some
pretty far reaching powers.

30
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.803
But later, when we go and build a CI/CD
pipeline, right, that account, we wanna

31
00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:49.471
keep it separate from administrative
account in case we lose control of it.

32
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:53.362
But it certainly doesn't need the ability
to spin up Dynamo databases or

33
00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:56.780
change billing, or
anything along those lines, right?

34
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.591
If it's the CI/CD process and that's
getting our client-side assets into an S3

35
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.519
bucket, well, it probably only needs the
ability to write to an S3 bucket, right?

36
00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:09.349
So we can create accounts, and
the accounts are for humans, but

37
00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.473
they're also for different,
a CI/CD user, right?

38
00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:15.540
They're also for the robots in our lives.

39
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.780
Also, we'll use accounts as well.

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.940
And you do much more sophisticated and
advanced things with IAM as well.

41
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.270
You can have IAM roles created for users
so they have their stuff sectioned off.

42
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.360
We're not gonna do much of that today.

43
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.312
We're just gonna keep it simple and know
the basics for deploying an application.

44
00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.120
All right, so
here's what we're gonna do together.

45
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.230
We are going to secure a root account,
then we're going to make an account that

46
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.100
is not our root account, and
then we're gonna secure that, too.

47
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.600
Sound good?

48
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.120
Cool, so let's do this together.

49
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.783
So in Services, I'm gonna go to IAM.

50
00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.974
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And you can see it's
kind of telling me all of the things that

51
00:02:56.974 --> 00:02:59.480
are kind of wrong with
my account right now.

52
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.870
If you have an older AWS account,
this might even be sad, all right?

53
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.520
Which is, we normally don't want
API keys for our root account.

54
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.480
By default, if you made a new account
this morning, or yesterday, or

55
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.060
in the last few months,
there are no keys for your root account.

56
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.570
But I know on my personal account,
which I made, apparently, in 2007,

57
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.430
I don't know what I was using it for
in 2007, but that's how old the keys were.

58
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.464
There were some keys and you should go
ahead and delete them if you see that

59
00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:34.325
there, unless you're using them
cause then you'll break stuff.

60
00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:38.520
But, so one thing I wanna do is turn
on multi-factor authentication.

61
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.990
If you have a hardware device, like one of
those UB keys that you kind of plug into

62
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.420
the computer, a software one is just an
app, whether it's Google authenticator or

63
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.930
something along those lines.

64
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.250
I use one called Authy.

65
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.270
It doesn't really matter.

66
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.640
At work, I have one called Duo.

67
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.050
There's 1,000 of them,
it doesn't really matter.

68
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.790
So we'll go ahead and I'll hit Next Step,
and I get this cool code, and

69
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.383
then, I take my phone.

70
00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:08.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I take
a picture of the code.

71
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.915
There was a Tumblr blog
at one point called

72
00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:14.990
peopletakingpicturesofQRcodes.tumblr.com.

73
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.960
That might not be the real URL,
but you know what I mean.

74
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.800
And the only thing on it was no posts yet,

75
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.180
because no one has actually ever
taken a picture of a QR code.

76
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.290
It's a fun joke.

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.289
So I scan that code.

78
00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:34.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, it's added,

79
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.510
now I'll get some keys that I can put in,
so cool.

80
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.630
And so now no one can login into my
account without first beating me up and

81
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.030
taking my phone.

82
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.880
Then, they can login into my account.

83
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.950
They'd have to torture the password out
of me, too, but that's really not hard.

84
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.659
So let me refresh this page.

85
00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.960
You can see that's now a green check.
