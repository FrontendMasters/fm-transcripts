00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:03.405
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead and

2
00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:06.250
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
talk a little bit about CloudFront.

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.800
So, CloudFront seeks to solve
the issue that we had before of okay,

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.780
we wanna make it globally distributed.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.550
Right?
So they're not always going to Virginia.

6
00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.235
CloudFront, if you think about it this

7
00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:25.927
way,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It is globally

8
00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:29.290
distributing your application
around the world.

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.940
One of my coworkers, Steven, strong name,

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.910
likes to joke that CloudFront puts
the eventual into eventual consistency.

11
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.950
Which means, things you do in
CloudFront are not immediate,

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.040
because they have to get
distributed around the globe.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
Right?
And so we do a little bit of asynchronous,

14
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.350
which is we're going to set up CloudFront,
then I'm going to talk about what it is.

15
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.950
Right?

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.610
As a way to basically fill time
as our CloudFront distribution

17
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.990
is globally distributed.

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.180
Cool.

19
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.810
So here's what we're gonna do.

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.740
We're gonna go together, we're gonna
create a new CloudFront distribution.

21
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.630
We're going to point it to
our static website on S3.

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.000
We'll add in the domain names, so
we eventually, the domain names right now

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.599
point to S3, we're gonna make them
eventually point to CloudFront.

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.110
Also, we'll set up gzipping of our assets.

25
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.690
Why?
Because you should.

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.760
Also, it's a check box
that we're gonna check.

27
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
So [LAUGH] you should, and when it's
a check box, you defiantly should.

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.435
And then,
we'll set the default root object so

29
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.820
if they just go visit the bare domain,
it's index.html.

30
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.260
And as that propagates around the world,
we'll talk a little bit about CloudFront

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.332
is and hopefully, if we time it right,
then we'll get to jump back in and see it.

32
00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.988
