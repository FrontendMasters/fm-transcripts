00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.848
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Interesting thing is
the Amazon CLI is incredibly powerful.

2
00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:10.359
Anything you can do from the UI,
you can do from the command line.

3
00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.323
So you can even do stuff like
setting headers or an S3 bucket or

4
00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:15.782
any of those options.

5
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.941
Those are all things that
you can pass through.

6
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:25.295
That said, if you thought about how
overwhelming that drop-down was,

7
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:31.558
then the amount of options available for
the CLI is an art form to learn.

8
00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.587
Cool, and so you can do a lot of stuff,

9
00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:35.940
you can get the contents
of your S3 bucket.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.753
And so if you type in AWS,
the AWS is the command line tool.

11
00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:42.476
Then it's what service you want.

12
00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.467
So in this case I want S3.

13
00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.541
And then, okay,
what do I wanna do with S3?

14
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:52.286
Well I want to list the contents of
a bucket, and then which bucket, right?

15
00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:57.250
So if you on the other hand wanted to
configure CloudFront from the command

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.508
line, it would be AWS CloudFront,
so on and so forth, right?

17
00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:05.185
We're just gonna be working with
S3 right now on the command line.

18
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:09.199
Cuz we wanna basically build it so
that we can have a command go ahead and

19
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.160
deploy the app.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.827
But if we did AWS S3 ls and then the name
of our bucket, you would see the contents.

21
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:21.023
If I did it live right now, you'd just see
that index.html that I uploaded earlier.

22
00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:26.177
This is one with the React app
that we're about to deploy in it.

23
00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:29.985
So this is going to be
the one that we use.

24
00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:32.222
So let's just talk about it real quick.

25
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:36.068
All right, AWS,
wusing AWS command line tool, cool.

26
00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:42.799
We wanna work with S3,
and then we want to copy.

27
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.485
And so we wanna copy directory
from our local machine.

28
00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:47.113
So it's gonna be the dist directory.

29
00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:50.337
Now, for your app you might
have a build directory, or

30
00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:53.013
whatever your application gets built into.

31
00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:59.010
This is gonna be like take the built
assets and copy them to S3 bucket, right?

32
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.691
I just registered
superimportantwebsite.com,

33
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.777
but this one is mysuperfunwebsite.com.

34
00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:08.412
And then the dash dash recursive,
we'll ahead and

35
00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:10.440
get all the sub-directories as well.

36
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.339
I don't really have any sub-directories,
but this would go and

37
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.088
get all of the contents of that folder.

38
00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:18.594
And it would go ahead and upload it to S3.

39
00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:25.769
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's go ahead and
deploy our application for the first time.

40
00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:33.920
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I have a version of
the noted project that's in the setup

41
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.255
instructions.

42
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:41.009
There is both a base one that
you can go ahead and clone.

43
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:46.223
And then there's a live one that I'm
gonna be pushing updates to as well.

44
00:02:46.223 --> 00:02:49.758
So we could, if we go ahead,
open it up in Visual Studio.

45
00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:56.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we look in our package.json.

46
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.667
We have a start for
starting the development server.

47
00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:03.067
We've got a build command that will go
ahead and build the application, and

48
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:04.866
we have the ability to test it.

49
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:09.403
So first thing we wanna do
is likely actually build

50
00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:12.868
the application, so yarn run build.

51
00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.508
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Fun, fun, fun.

52
00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:29.767
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, let me take
a second and I'm gonna fix this issue.

53
00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.442
Cuz I copied a directory and
hoped for the best.

54
00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:34.423
So we'll find out what it is in a second.

55
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.586
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Should we be using npm?

56
00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.536
[INAUDIBLE] it's through.

57
00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:44.083
Or this is a [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Either one,

58
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.345
not really doing anything
special with them.

59
00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:50.124
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah I'm just saying that
people that have npm it's a not given that

60
00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:51.929
they'll have yarn installed.

61
00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:52.809
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can totally do that.

62
00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:00.182
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He does.

63
00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:03.587
Okay in your instructions,
you have to install Yarn.

64
00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:05.863
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can use npm,
that doesn't matter.

65
00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:07.391
I'm not using it-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's in your instructions

66
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.845
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

67
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.592
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right looks like
the directory I copied right before we

68
00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:29.528
started doesn't work.

69
00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:33.766
So I'm just gonna use,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This one.

70
00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:40.075
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, ready?

71
00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:46.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are we gonna
use Yarn to install or NPM?

72
00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:48.627
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You wanna do Yarn or NPM?

73
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:49.733
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well you said-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

74
00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:51.813
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right yep.

75
00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:56.772
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

76
00:04:56.772 --> 00:05:03.695
All right so I'll go ahead,
I'll do a yarn run build.

77
00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:05.550
And this will build the application.

78
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.874
Again, this is a relatively small app.

79
00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:12.130
But it will go ahead and-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do Yarn install just for

80
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.757
video sake or is that already set up?

81
00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:18.382
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Probably not.

82
00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:20.019
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let's start.

83
00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.804
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
ignore everything I just said.

84
00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:26.778
[LAUGH] All right, so I have this project.

85
00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:30.282
We'll just go ahead and
make sure we have all the dependencies.

86
00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:33.649
And so I have them installed, but
if you've just gone on to repo,

87
00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.772
it's gonna pull down React and React
Router and everything along those lines.

88
00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:40.430
Once we have all of the dependencies,
we're ready to build the app.

89
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.257
I can do a yarn run build.

90
00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.923
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And it will go through
and it will take all of my assets and

91
00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:50.735
build the final project.

92
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:53.890
So now I have this dist
directory that is brand new.

93
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.648
This is the built version of
the application, so I do ls dist.

94
00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.672
You can see there are my
code split bundles.

95
00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:02.734
I've got two pictures of Prince,

96
00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:07.793
cuz honestly what application is complete
without at least two pictures of Prince.

97
00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:12.536
And we've got the favicon,
which is a little picture of Link,

98
00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:14.696
and then that index.html.

99
00:06:14.696 --> 00:06:19.522
So what we wanna do is now we
could get in the process of

100
00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:24.485
taking all these files and
dragging them into the UI.

101
00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:26.260
And that's three every single time.

102
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.328
But what if we didn't, cuz that is,
again, it's no way to live.

103
00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:39.836
So we'll say s3, aws s3,
and we'll say copy.

104
00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:45.852
And we'll take that dist directory
that we just generated and

105
00:06:45.852 --> 00:06:51.064
we'll do s3://superimportantwebsite.com.

106
00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:53.086
Now for you,
it's gonna be the name of your bucket.

107
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.804
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go ahead, and you can see
that I have uploaded all of those files.

108
00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:07.962
And they went from dist index.html
to replacing the html in the bucket.

109
00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:09.971
And then adding these additional files.

110
00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:14.652
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I refresh the page.

111
00:07:14.652 --> 00:07:21.920
My application from React from the command
line is up and on the Internet.

112
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.776
So I don't want to remember
to type this ever again.

113
00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:27.918
So what I might consider
doing is just grabbing it.

114
00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:32.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
going to package.json, and

115
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.137
let's make one more,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say deploy.

116
00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:41.091
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And that will

117
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:45.584
build the app,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

118
00:07:45.584 --> 00:07:49.518
then it will go ahead and deploy the app.

119
00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:54.486
So now, instead of ever remembering that,
we just need to remember yarn run deploy,

120
00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.764
and our application will be deployed.

121
00:07:56.764 --> 00:08:00.757
We can get better at this
eventually by going ahead and

122
00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:06.094
making sure that we don't have to do
that by having our CI/CD process.

123
00:08:06.094 --> 00:08:11.448
But hey if this is a merge and master and
all the tests pass, go, right?

124
00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:14.511
And there's different flows,
we'll talk about that when we get to it.

125
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:17.384
So just to test this out,
do a yarn run deploy.

126
00:08:26.102 --> 00:08:30.214
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I switched projects,
so I gotta grab this line.

127
00:08:46.297 --> 00:08:47.152
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

128
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.075
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So it'll build it and
then immediately deploy it, right?

129
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.457
So now we've got a shortcut for
doing this.

130
00:08:56.457 --> 00:09:00.635
Now, I can go refresh it, but
it's gonna be effectively the same site.

131
00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:03.389
But we did generate a new bundle.

132
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.311
All right, cool
