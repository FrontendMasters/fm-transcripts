00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now
what is this gonna do?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.940
By pushing commit to master,
it is going to trigger our build process,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.350
which is going to get all the assets.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.040
It's gonna run the tests,
it's gonna build the app.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.310
It's gonna push it to S3,
it's gonna invalidate CloudFront, right.

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.020
So we should get all of those things.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.340
And once just for
the act of merging to master.

8
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.500
So once you have a good
CI/CD set up in place,

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.646
you're able to just simply not think
about a lot of the details before.

10
00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:29.270
You set up this infrastructure, but
then it just becomes a thing that exists.

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.160
And you don't necessarily have to go and,
all right, I have to remember this

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.980
concoction of AWS commands and
tweak these settings, so on and so forth.

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.820
So we can see that build number 3 started.

14
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.624
It's been going for about 21 seconds.

15
00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:49.760
You can see the AWS access key is secure,
but we have the S3 bucket.

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.390
I have made typos in there before,
that is why I choose to see it every time.

17
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330
Because otherwise it's a lot of fun.

18
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.450
Did you miss a check box?

19
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.270
Did you make a typo?

20
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.447
It all depends, cool.

21
00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:05.022
So if you go directly to the page,
you actually see a lot more information.

22
00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:07.068
Eventually I can collapse this, but

23
00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:10.280
it's basically pulling down
everything that it needs.

24
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
you mentioned that it's really nice,

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.780
because it's gonna abstract that stuff
away and CI's gonna do that for you.

26
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.504
Have you run into maintenance issues where
you realize you need to go to change

27
00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:23.923
something but
nobody remembers how it was set up?

28
00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:28.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, all right, well,

29
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.540
the AWS stuff doesn't change that often,
right?

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.880
We have had problems where our
integration tests have gotten flakey,

31
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.770
and now we can't deploy.

32
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.340
Or a Docker image comes out of date,
right?

33
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.740
And those things are tricky and
problematic in those cases, right?

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.710
But we haven't necessarily had, and

35
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.720
we'll talk a little bit about
infrastructure as code later, too.

36
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720
There are ways that you can,

37
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.640
a lot of the stuff we're doing
you can automate as well.

38
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.960
There's both CloudFormation and Terraform
that make that really easy as well.

39
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.170
But especially, cuz a lot of
the front-end stuff that we're doing is

40
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.975
relatively industry standard, right?

41
00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:14.425
We're not getting too esoterical we're
gonna do some squirrely stuff at the end

42
00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.598
here to solve that
client-side routing problem.

43
00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:24.080
But, generally speaking,
it is a set it and forget it thing to

44
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.960
the point where the biggest thing we had
to do was, before Sangrin made the entire

45
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.840
move to AWS, we had a bucket where we were
doing this when we had the Rails app.

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.790
And they were gonna turn
off all the old accounts,

47
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.180
then we had to figure out,
what was the old account?

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.225
That was the level of problem solving,
arguably we could have documented that.

49
00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:47.640
[LAUGH] So no, I haven't had that issue,
which is almost an unsatisfying answer,

50
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.050
cuz I can't give you any sage advice.

51
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.920
[LAUGH] But also, I guess it's good
that I haven't had that issue.

52
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.690
Cool, so you can see done,
our build exited out, and let's see.

53
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.149
I should have a few invalidations
in place, but we should see one.

54
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.054
He goes go to services lit CloudFront.

55
00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:13.341
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If I find my validations,
cool,

56
00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:19.100
that looks like the one
that probably just fired.

57
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.903
Let's go ahead and visit the site.

58
00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we get the new one, right?

59
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.860
So again, it created the invalidation,
we get new stuff from cache.

60
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.310
Everything is good,
we now have a CI/CD process set up, right?

61
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.820
Depending on what you use for
your company, it might vary a little bit.

62
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.250
But especially if you're
making the decision, right?

63
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.680
You've seen that it's fairly
easy to get this set up.

64
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.690
And it is one of those things where it's
like was it more work than just dragging

65
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.680
a file, running it from the command line?

66
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.590
Totally, but if you compound the number
of times you have to do that,

67
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.740
that stuff pays off real fast, right?

68
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.095
And so I think part of it is, someone
said, yeah, let's set up a CI/CD pipeline.

69
00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.115
You'd be like I don't have a week, right?

70
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:05.625
But clearly that did not take a week, cuz
a lot the tooling is really good for that.

71
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:10.285
So we have this in place, and now we've
got a build pipeline and ready to rock.
