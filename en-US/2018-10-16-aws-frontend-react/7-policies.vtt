&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: In a second,

2
00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:06.830
I'm gonna set up our first S3 bucket
that will have static website hosting.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.235
In order to do that, I will need
to set a policy on that bucket.

4
00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:16.003
By default,
your S3 buckets are not accessible, right?

5
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.908
Now, if we're gonna host our client
side application out of an S3 bucket,

6
00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:22.482
then we kinda need to make it accessible,
right?

7
00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:24.565
Well, not too accessible.

8
00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:29.548
So we'll learn how to set just the policy
of being able to read from the bucket from

9
00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:34.314
anyone, but not actually write to it from
the outside world cuz who knows what

10
00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:35.581
would happen then.

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.352
So I'm gonna use it when we lab code,
so let's talk about it now.

12
00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:43.886
So this is a policy.

13
00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:47.020
That version is not like when you made it,

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.946
that version is like what version of
AWS's policy you're using, all right?

15
00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:56.477
So if you go put in today's date,
that's not a thing, right?

16
00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:59.416
This is the kind of most recent version.

17
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:02.788
So we say what version of
their format we're using, and

18
00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:05.316
now we make a statement about the policy.

19
00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.197
The effect is either allow or deny, right?

20
00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:12.396
In this case,
we are allowing a particular thing.

21
00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:16.983
And principle is who, action is what,

22
00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:20.736
and resource is which, right?

23
00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:23.006
We'll look at each of those in one second.

24
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.915
So principal is who can do the thing,
action is what they can do, and

25
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:26.896
then to which things.

26
00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:31.017
So if we go back to that policy for
a second, we look, we could say, okay,

27
00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:32.482
anyone can get an object.

28
00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:36.102
And then when we create the bucket,
we'll put the bucket name in there.

29
00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:39.784
There's a little slash star at the end,
which means any file in that bucket,

30
00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:41.042
so it's like a wild card.

31
00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:44.512
So anyone can read from this
bucket on the Internet.

32
00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:47.760
Makes sense, that's probably
what we'd want for a website.

33
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.470
You can take lucky guesses that there
are actions such as like put object.

34
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.819
We don't wanna turn that one on.

35
00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.903
[LAUGH] We wanna be able to put an object
and we have permission to do that from our

36
00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:03.010
administrator account, or any other sub
users that we grant that access to.

37
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.998
But the outside world should only
be able to read from that bucket.

38
00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:10.232
Cool, so let's set up our first,

39
00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:14.635
let's get to the point where we can
start to deploy an application.

40
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.539
So what we're gonna do,
we're gonna set up a S3 bucket,

41
00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.746
we're going to set
a policy on that bucket.

42
00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:23.284
I'll give you a hint, it might have been
the one you just saw on the slide earlier.

43
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:26.544
We're gonna configure that S3 bucket for
static website hosting.

44
00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:29.284
And eventually, later on down the line,

45
00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:33.208
we are going to upload a React
application to command line.

46
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:37.761
First, we're just going to make
a little index.html page, right?

47
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:41.746
And eventually we're not
even gonna do that manually,

48
00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:46.491
we'll have our CICD pipeline do it for
us when all the tests pass and

49
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:49.235
something gets emerged into master.
