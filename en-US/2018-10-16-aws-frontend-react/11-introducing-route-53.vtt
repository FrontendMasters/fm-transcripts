00:00:03.223 --> 00:00:08.739
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we have the point
where we now have the ability to publish

2
00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:14.510
our application, but
that URL is still not great.

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.390
So what we wanna do is we
registered a fun domain name.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.980
I did not get a .vodka,
I got a nice good old-fashioned .com.

5
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.530
And what we wanna do is set up
Route 53 to basically, that is,

6
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.150
the registrar is Amazon.

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.200
Now, if you have a domain name
somewhere else, you can point

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.520
that domain name at Route 53, and have
Route 53 point it to your bucket, right?

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.090
At SendGrid, for instance,
we use, I think, DNS Made Easy.

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.610
Personally, I use Hover.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.320
If you go through Amazon,
then you don't have to configure anything.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.670
If you got it somewhere else,
you can still use it without Route 53.

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.590
It's not a prerequisite that
you bought the domain name

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.990
through Amazon in order to use it,
it's just a few extra steps.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.710
So Route 53 is a scalable DNS service,
DNS stands for

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.910
domain name service,
and what does that do?

17
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.620
It basically takes
a easy-to-remember domain name and

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.410
turns it into the real IP
address that it actually is, and

19
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.930
Route 53 can do a lot
of interesting things.

20
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.130
We're not running any servers,
but you could, for instance,

21
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.840
if you were running servers
that had a healthcheck.json,

22
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.000
it can basically ping it
every once in a while.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.490
If the server is not responding,
it can take it out of a load balancer, or

24
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.470
it can basically route
people towards their closest

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.485
server based on where
they are in the world.

26
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:35.630
We're gonna use CloudFront.

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.950
We don't need a lot of stuff,
but it's really interesting for

28
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.615
some of the server-side aspects.

29
00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:42.485
Basically, what we need is two things.

30
00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:46.441
One, we need to get our URL working,
and two,

31
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.206
we want to eventually
have an HTTPS server.

32
00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:53.469
So we're gonna kinda get both of
those things set up really quick, and

33
00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.640
then we'll take a break,
cuz DNS takes time.

34
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.482
All right, so
we'll get that ready to rock, and

35
00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:02.594
then we will go check on it a little bit.

36
00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:07.615
All right, so we're gonna get
superimportantwebsite.com up and running.
