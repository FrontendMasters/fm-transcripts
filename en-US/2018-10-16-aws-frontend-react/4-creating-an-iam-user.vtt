1
00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:04.188
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The next one that we care
about is creating individual IAM users.

2
00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:05.080
This is what we talked about before.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.800
We've secured our root account, but we
also need to do step two of not using it.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.950
So, we'll go ahead and,
we can click Manage users.

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.652
I'll give you a hint, it's the same
as clicking that link up there,

6
00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:20.049
whichever one personally makes
you feel better, go for it.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.380
And I get this new page.

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.510
And I have no IAM users, which again makes
sense, cuz it's a brand new account.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.800
So we go to Add user.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.090
And the hardest part,
obviously, is naming things.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.500
So we need to give this
user some kind of name.

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm gonna call it Administrator.

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.570
Seems good.

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.570
And so here we have Programmatic access,
which is API access.

15
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.050
And AWS Management Console access.

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.200
So we're gonna give this user both.

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.487
If it was something like when we set up
Travis CI later, well, that Travis CI user

18
00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.780
should never be logging into
the console and changing stuff.

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410
So we might,
uncheck that box in that case.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.920
I'll give you a hint.

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.203
We will uncheck that box in that case.

22
00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:06.211
But for this account, this is gonna
be kind of like a daily driver,

23
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.050
this'll be the account that we use,
so we'll keep that.

24
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.630
Autogenerated password or custom password.

25
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.520
Autogenerated password is useful if you're
creating the account for somebody else.

26
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.220
But I can do an autogenerated password and
then require a password reset, and

27
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.330
you know what I'm gonna do?

28
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.654
The same thing as if I had just typed
in whatever password I want right here.

29
00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:34.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so
we're in the process of creating a user,

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.426
but what can this user do?

31
00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:40.410
So we'll go ahead and we'll say,
Attach existing policies directly.

32
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.850
We're gonna talk a little bit
more about groups, and roles, and

33
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.574
policies, as we go along.

34
00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:47.960
They're basically three different
ways to do stuff, right?

35
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.469
You can have a policy which is
what is whatever allowed to do.

36
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.408
And you can apply it to a group,
and you can put users in the group.

37
00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:57.810
You can have role and
apply that role to the user.

38
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.050
It's kind of like a many
to many situation.

39
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.000
We're not gonna worry about that just yet,
cuz like I said, when you're doing a large

40
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.430
scale like, hey, 400 people are all
gonna use the same Amazon resources,

41
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.140
that's when you need to
get really granular.

42
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.580
Especially for compliance reasons,

43
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.920
like I shouldn't be able to
deploy the mail pipeline at work.

44
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.946
That would be bad.

45
00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:19.390
So you kinda limit people to
what they should be able to do.

46
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.520
We're gonna go ahead and Attach existing
policies directly to this user.

47
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.720
And the one I care about
is AdministratorAccess.

48
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.490
And so you can actually
see all the stuff it does.

49
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.050
And a giant JSON file, if you want.

50
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.360
This is pretty much everything.

51
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.030
We'll talk about actions and
resources in a little bit.

52
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.670
What this one will not have access to,
is billing, out of the box.

53
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.830
The AdministratorAccess
does not have that.

54
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.859
But you can see, otherwise,
it is allowed to about a 144 services.

55
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.620
Yeah, that number keeps growing too,
it's really stressful.

56
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.910
Cool, so now we have a permission summary.

57
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.599
We've got this user, and
we'll go ahead and we will create it.

58
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.620
All right, this page is important.

59
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.800
This is your Access key, right,
which is kind of like your username.

60
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.960
And this is your Secret access key,
which is kinda like your password.

61
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.870
You might think that this is useful.

62
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.270
It just tells them that they have
an account that was created.

63
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.970
It doesn't actually send that
information to their email.

64
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.400
So go ahead and click it, but
it's not gonna be that much fun.

65
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.190
What's important is, I'm not gonna
click this, cuz that's not good.

66
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.090
But once you leave this page,
you will never see this again.

67
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.754
You can make a new Secret access key, so

68
00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.881
it's not like you're
locked out of the account.

69
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.690
But you can't, and this is just for APIs,

70
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.850
you can still log in with that password
you made in the previous page.

71
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.790
But for any API integration,
if you lose this key, you can reset it but

72
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.640
you can never see it again.

73
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.600
There's a caveat, which is if you hit this
download CSV button, you will download

74
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.320
a CSV that has both the Access key and
the Secret key.

75
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.040
So, I recommend downloading
that CSV no matter what,

76
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.590
because otherwise you
will not remember this.

77
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.250
You will paste it in the first time we
use it, and then it'll be gone forever.

78
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.700
And you will have to create another one,
which is a right of passage.

79
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.510
Everyone has to do that at some point.

80
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.490
I had to do it several times yesterday.

81
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.410
But I'm telling you right now.

82
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.750
Download that CSV, you will be happier.

83
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.850
Cool, and then we can hit close.

84
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.239
And I can see my fresh
new Administrator user.

85
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.520
So I'm gonna go back
to the Dashboard here.

86
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.040
And you can say, all right,
I've got this Create individual IAM users.

87
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.930
I'm not probably gonna
do these two right now.

88
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.860
I'll eventually have made a group.

89
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.050
But a password policy for what people
need to set their password for right now.

90
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.840
I'm the only user and I trust me.

91
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.190
But you can set that up as an exercise for
the reader.

92
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.830
One thing I want to change is,
this is the sign in link for

93
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.560
all of,
effectively have that one root account.

94
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.770
And it's like an organization.

95
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.520
This one's called FEM Live.

96
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.380
And so if people want to log in to
our company, our new company that we

97
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.009
just started right now, that console,
they need to go to this lovely URL.

98
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.720
My recommendation is you
hit this Customize button,

99
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.697
and give it a better name, cool.

100
00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:34.884
So with that, we're now able to
go ahead and we have an account,

101
00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:39.410
we have an Administrator account,
we have a nice URL.

102
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.058
One more thing that we want to do,
is if we go back to our users,

103
00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:44.828
and we click Administrator.

104
00:05:44.828 --> 00:05:49.990
I'm gonna leave this to
you during a quick break.

105
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.980
But we're also gonna set up two-factor
auth on that Administrator user.

106
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.640
Cuz the Administrator user has almost
all the powers of the root user.

107
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.060
You probably want to
secure it the same way.

108
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.960
So I'll let you all do that for a second.

109
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.250
And then when we meet back,
we will logout of our root account, and

110
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.500
that is the last we're gonna touch
our root account for the day.

111
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.350
And then we're going to get settled
into our Administrator account and

112
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.850
we'll begin getting started.

113
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.332
So I basically set up some
multi-factor authentication on my

114
00:06:18.332 --> 00:06:22.480
Administrator account, so
that that is secure as well.

115
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.009
And go back to the Dashboard, and this is
my last moments inside my root account,

116
00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.820
and that's the last we're gonna touch it.

117
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.160
And that is how it should be.

118
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.380
I'm gonna grab this link real quick.

119
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.466
Think I could actually
hit this Copy button.

120
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:37.729
And then I will go and I will sign out.

121
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:44.471
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
then I will go, and I will sign in.

122
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.997
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll actually
paste that link in there so

123
00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:52.990
I get the one that I'm looking for.

124
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.650
You see this one is
a little bit different.

125
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.665
It's not their root account.

126
00:06:56.665 --> 00:07:01.197
IAM username, we'll say Administrator

127
00:07:06.848 --> 00:07:07.689
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And in we go,

128
00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.410
you don't need to remember this.

129
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.257
And I'll quickly put in my
multi-factor authentication code.

130
00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:18.737
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's tedious,
but it's secure.

131
00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:23.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have to
change my password, apparently.

132
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, you left it checked.

133
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.585
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I left it checked.

134
00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:26.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Talked about unchecking,
but.

135
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I talked about
unchecking it, then I didn't?

136
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.850
That's great.

137
00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:41.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is that gonna
be one of those annotations?

138
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.070
[LAUGH] Steve forgot
to hit this check box.

139
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.355
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: He will pay for it later.

140
00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:49.740
[LAUGH]
Cool, and

141
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.330
I'm back in, and now I am in under
my Administrator account, cool.

142
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.420
And this is gonna be the account that
we predominantly use the console in.

143
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.300
We've made the root account, we secured
it, we made this Administrator account and

144
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.860
now we're not gonna touch
the root account anymore.

145
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:09.160
This is effectively, think of this as
your actual, main account at this point.

146
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.230
So, so far we have set up accounts
which is really riveting and exciting.

147
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.160
I know everyone is on
the edge of their seat.

148
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.085
We're gonna talk a little bit about where
we're gonna put our client-side assets.

149
00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:24.165
We're gonna put them in S3, so
we'll talk a little bit about S3.

150
00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:27.275
Then we're gonna change gears for
a second and register a domain name,

151
00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:29.965
which will be totally optional, but
that takes a little bit of time.

152
00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:32.045
And then once that happens, and

153
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:34.275
there's a reason we're doing it
before we setup the S3 bucket,

154
00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:36.955
which is they have to have the same name,
but we'll get to that in a second.

155
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.460
We'll go ahead and then start deploying
a very simple version of our application.

156
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.330
And we'll take that real React
application that we have and

157
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.320
deploy it from the command line.
