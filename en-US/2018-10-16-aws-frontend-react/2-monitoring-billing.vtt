00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what I want to do
together real quick is also set up some

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.100
billing notifications, so if we do blow
past the free tier more than we're

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.740
comfortable with, we'll have
the ability to kind of rectify that.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.670
So this is my brand-new account.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.620
You can see that it says
recently visited services.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.830
Turns out that that's probably
stored in local storage.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.190
This is literally an account that I made,
logged in for

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.520
the first time, and here we are.

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.320
So, in here, you could go to Services,
and get overwhelmed.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.030
This just stresses me out, itâ€™s not
really useful for finding anything.

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.830
One pro tip is to switch
it to alphabetical.

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410
A bigger pro tip is just
to type in this box.

13
00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:44.007
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.570
So, here we are in the Billing dashboard.

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.000
You can see currently I
am running a $0 balance.

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.320
Which is good because this
account is about two hours old.

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.220
So, if that number wasn't zero,
we'd have a problem.

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.560
One thing we can do is go to Preferences.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.990
And we have this one useful one here,
Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts.

20
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.210
And so basically you get an email
around the time when you're

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.790
about to blow past the free tier,
so we'll go ahead and turn that on.

22
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.178
And you can put in your email address.

23
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.609
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll hit Save.

24
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.092
Cool.
But like I said,

25
00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:28.750
we know that we're gonna spend
a little bit of money today.

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.130
So I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm gonna click Create budget, and

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.964
I can do a whole bunch of
what I actually care about.

28
00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:39.160
I'm gonna tell you right now what I
care about, which is cost, right?

29
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.920
I want to know if we go
past a certain amount,

30
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.799
so you can give the budget any
kind of name that you want.

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.118
And we can say, okay start it from
the first, monthly, budget amount.

32
00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.637
If I start going over $10,
someone tell me, right?

33
00:01:55.637 --> 00:02:00.582
You laugh but when you start up enough
Dynamo databases cuz you're preparing for

34
00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:03.210
a workshop, you can hit $40 real fast.

35
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.000
Luckily I had a notification
when that happened.

36
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.960
So you can actually choose,
there's a bunch of ways you can do this.

37
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.990
You can have email contact, or

38
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.620
you can actually have it logged to an S3
bucket or have other Amazon services

39
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.740
become aware if you need like
custom programming logic, right?

40
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.670
Just sending an email is great for me, but
I assume that the people that manage this

41
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.790
at the company I work at have a much more
robust system for all the different teams

42
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.483
and knowing who is going over budget and
stuff along those lines.

43
00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:34.868
I just know the person who comes
to yell at me, her name is April,

44
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:36.058
if I go over my budget,

45
00:02:36.058 --> 00:02:41.020
but beyond that I believe that there is
an infrastructure and system in place.

46
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.451
Cool.

47
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:45.110
I'll go ahead and
we'll create that budget.

48
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.108
So now if I go past $10 in a given month,

49
00:02:49.108 --> 00:02:53.350
I will be notified that
something is amiss.
