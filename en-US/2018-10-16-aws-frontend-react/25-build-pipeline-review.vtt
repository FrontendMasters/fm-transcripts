&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Fetching from S3.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.220
I personally don't like that, but
I have coworkers that disagree with me.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.130
And so for the application I work on,
we do the invalidation technique.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.480
There is the dashboard for

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.270
the email API business, they actually
use the load TTL technique, right?

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.730
You get up to 1,000
invalidations per month.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.660
And we can setup CI/CD so
that all of this is in place and

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.908
we don't have to think about it too much.

9
00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.417
So let's think about our app.

10
00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:29.745
The URL is great, it's fantastic now.

11
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.400
We don't have to do
anything manually anymore.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.110
Now we're just writing code, right?

13
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.650
Our build pipeline takes care of
everything for us at this point.

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.923
It's hosted all around the world, right?

15
00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:45.579
So it's not just distance from Virginia or
whatever region you picked.

16
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.290
It is globally distributed.

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.723
It is served over https, right?

18
00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:54.450
We're getting to a production
grade website pretty quickly.
