00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.839
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're going
to try to see if our CloudFront

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.740
distribution's up and running.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.490
It all depends on how long I just talked,
and how quickly it went.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.380
We'll take a look and we'll see.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.450
If so, we will hit our website, right?

6
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.960
So we get the CloudFront cache warmed up.

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.280
And we'll take a look at what a ht and
a miss are.

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.286
And then we will go ahead and
deploy a new version and see what happens.

9
00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:28.979
So what we'll end up doing is,
at one point we'll make some change,

10
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.182
you can change the title, you can change
my wonderful CSS work, how dare you,

11
00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:36.260
those are pretty colors, and
so on and so forth, right?

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.719
And we'll see how that actually
propagates and if it propagates.

13
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.890
Cool, so we will either.

14
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.460
Let's see if this works.

15
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.350
If not, we'll take a quick break and
wait for propagation to happen.

16
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.980
All right, there it is.

17
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.140
It's superimportantwebsite.com.

18
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Looks like it propagated enough, at least.

19
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.760
Full disclosure, you might go to yours and
it might not be propagated yet.

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.390
Right, that is okay.

21
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.960
If it doesn't propagate within about 30
minutes, then we'll deal with it, but

22
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.860
it takes time.

23
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.570
I was pleasantly surprised to
find that mine propagated.

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.478
So you see this little lock,
that means I've got HTTPS.

25
00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.175
It's a little more prominent in Chrome and
Firefox.

26
00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:22.225
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we can see superimportantwebsite.

27
00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.745
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But
the things I wanna make a note of is,

28
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:32.519
this'll either be a hit from CloudFront,
which means it never went to S3.

29
00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:37.364
A miss, which means it's the first
time it's seen this one, and

30
00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.760
it has to go to S3, or an error.

31
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.786
This is likely if you look,
there's no such key,

32
00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.779
probably cuz we need to actually set up
an error page for a 404 to show the index.

33
00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.864
Which we will literally do in a second.

34
00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:54.420
But we see some additional
things in there as well.

35
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.470
So let's go ahead and
let's deploy a version of the application.

36
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.750
And let's actually fix
the error pages first.

37
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.870
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're here.

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.510
And in case that takes some time to
propagate, we'll have that ready to go.

39
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.600
Yes?

40
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a quick question about
setting up the record set for CloudFront.

41
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.710
I'm getting error that says that
it's trying to create a record set.

42
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.990
My domain type A, if I just leave that
name blank, because it's already set up.

43
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.030
Is that supposed to be
a different value there or?

44
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Are you making a new one
or are you adding in the existing one?

45
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm making a new one.

46
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's probably like, hey,
you already have one with that name.

47
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You wanna edit that one?

48
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, exactly.

49
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To have the Cloudfront site.

50
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.647
Okay, so then you're no
longer using that S3 domain?

51
00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:51.227
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Exactly.

52
00:02:51.227 --> 00:02:52.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, cool.

53
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.609
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It'll hit CloudFront,
CloudFront will go to S3.

54
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.520
Cool, so a bunch of options here.

55
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.820
I have restrictions.

56
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.220
I have error pages.

57
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.554
So I'm gonna Create
a custom error response.

58
00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:08.370
And I'm gonna say if you get back a 404,
we want to customize that.

59
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.139
We'll send you.

60
00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:13.455
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll actually ask for
index.html, and

61
00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:15.290
we'll say everything's gravy.

62
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.430
So this is the opposite
problem that we had before.

63
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.980
Before, when we had S3,
we were like, yeah, it's a 404.

64
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.140
And then we sent them the page and
everything was great.

65
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.661
This is a similar but terrible problem,

66
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.561
where we're gonna treat
everything as okay.

67
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:31.075
Which means they go to /notes/1.

68
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.550
Yay, that's a real route.

69
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.655
If they go to slash totally not real,
not found, I don't know what you're doing.

70
00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:43.513
[LAUGH] 200, they'll see the not found
page, cause direct router'll handle that.

71
00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:45.330
This isn't great either.

72
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.509
This is a fact, what a lot of client-side
routing applications do, they just really,

73
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.490
well that's life, what can I do?

74
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.480
We'll actually explore how
we can actually solve that.

75
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.032
But this is actually the state
of world in a lot of cases.

76
00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:01.436
I'm gonna make an additional one for
403s as well.

77
00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:18.225
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That will take
a little bit of time to propagate.
