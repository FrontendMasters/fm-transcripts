&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So previously,

2
00:00:01.311 --> 00:00:07.029
we have been deploying our application
from the command line manually.

3
00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.255
We were creating invalidations manually.

4
00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:19.199
When you do stuff manually, you introduce
a non-zero chance of human error, right?

5
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.389
And you probably don't want that.

6
00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.886
So one way to do that is to automate
these things, cuz then, one,

7
00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:28.810
then you don't have to do it,
which is a win, and two,

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.627
you reduce the likelihood
that you will do it wrong.

9
00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:36.445
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna build a CI/CD pipeline for

10
00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:38.908
distributing our application.

11
00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:42.162
I'm gonna use Travis CI.

12
00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:46.684
Quick disclaimer,
I chose Travis CI because it's free for

13
00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:50.760
public repositories and
somewhat easy to get set up.

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.452
At SendGrid, we used to use Jenkins,
we now use Buildkite.

15
00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:58.525
So it doesn't really matter,
if you wanna use Circle CI,

16
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.197
it doesn't matter which one you use.

17
00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:08.198
A lot of the basic ideas are the same,
but had to pick one, so here we are.

18
00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:09.079
So here's what we're gonna do.

19
00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.201
We're going to add
the repository to Travis CI.

20
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.890
We'll create a configuration for
Travis CI.

21
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.112
And then we will deploy our
application and witness the magic and

22
00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:27.570
glory, that is,
of not having to do anything, cool.
