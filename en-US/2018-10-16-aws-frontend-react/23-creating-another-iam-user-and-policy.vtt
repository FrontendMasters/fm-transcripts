00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We wanna
create a user for Travis,

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.180
and we want it to have a limited set
of functionality that only our CI,

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.970
CD deployment bot, robot,
if you will, should have, right?

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.290
So we don't wanna use our
administrator account,

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.730
because that's got a lot of power.

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.530
Also we're using that for
administratoring.

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.430
So this is what I was talking about before
which is that principle of least access.

8
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.660
So what we want to do is create an account
that can do exactly what it needs to do

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.640
and ideally no more.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.110
So we're gonna create a user
that can do two things right.

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.900
What are the two things
that Travis needs to do?

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.680
It needs to push a new buildup to S3, and

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.280
it needs to invalidate
the CloudFront cache.

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.770
So we're gonna allow it to write to S3.

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.049
And we'll go ahead and
allow it to invalidate CloudFront caches.

16
00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.528
Those are the two things that we will
let it do, and we will use that user and

17
00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.356
will set those environment
variables there.

18
00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:57.153
So then Travis will then use that
new Travis user that we're creating

19
00:00:57.153 --> 00:00:59.721
with it's policies and abilities.

20
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:02.920
And if something happens,
it's at least a limited scope of damage.

21
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.890
You're still gonna get paged if
that key gets loose somehow, but

22
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.200
it's definitely not as bad.

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.658
So we'll start by going into policies.

24
00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.550
Before we attached a policy
directly to a user.

25
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.410
We're gonna make effectively
a custom policy at this point

26
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.860
doing the two things that we want Travis
to do, write to a particular S3 bucket and

27
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.790
invalidate CloudFront caches.

28
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.030
So we can go ahead and hit create policy.

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.680
We start by hitting Choose a service.

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.890
And we'll say S3.

31
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.510
We'll say it can write, and
then what we're going to say,

32
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.600
it can't just write to any bucket.

33
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.930
It can only write to
the super important website.

34
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.809
Or in your case,
whatever your bucket name is.

35
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.037
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so we're going
for this superimportantwebsite.com bucket,

36
00:01:55.037 --> 00:01:58.218
and like I said, since we're
generating fingerprinted assets,

37
00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:02.750
it will be like you can put whatever ones
you want in there, but only this bucket.

38
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.920
Let's also say add, and
we'll say CloudFront.

39
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.980
And what this gonna do
is you can say Write.

40
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.570
We can also get very specific.

41
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.930
You can create an invalidation and
that's it, right.

42
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.460
Cuz maybe this isn't great.

43
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.310
[LAUGH] That seems problematic, cool.

44
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.250
And, we'll review this policy.

45
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.510
We'll name it CIdeploy.

46
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.470
And, we'll have limited write
access to the CloudFront.

47
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.050
And it will be able to
write to our S3 bucket.

48
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.729
Create that policy, all right.

49
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.449
Cool and now we need to create
a user with that policy.

50
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.770
So we'll add a user, we'll call it Travis,
we'll give it programmatic access.

51
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.460
Travis CI does not need to be going to
the console and playing with anything.

52
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.167
And we'll attach an existing
policy directly and

53
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:02.590
we'll find that CIDeploy policy.

54
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.393
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go ahead, we'll
review it, we'll create the user, and

55
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:10.840
we will download that CSV.

56
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.599
Now, we're going to take a quick break and

57
00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.839
what we're going to do is we're
going to go to the settings.

58
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
I have some values in here from earlier.

59
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.600
This is my S3 bucket.

60
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.930
This is my CloudFront ID.

61
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.000
These are what I need to
change with this new user.

62
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.880
This is going to be the user,
the csv I just downloaded.

63
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.970
So we'll wipe these two out.

64
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.053
All right, we're gonna make sure
that this is set to off, so

65
00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:41.570
that we don't see the new
keys that we add.

66
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.930
And I'm just gonna quickly
pop in that AWS access ID.

67
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.070
And that AWS secret key so

68
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.200
that Travis can now use the new
Travis user that we just created.

69
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.770
All right we're back.

70
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.740
I have my new AWS access key and
secret access key.

71
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.890
Right, you might've just added it for
the first time.

72
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.490
I replace some existing ones.

73
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.730
So what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to make a change to the page,

74
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.120
and I am going to go ahead and push it up.

75
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.230
So if I go back to Visual Studio Code,
I did previously change this to a bright

76
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.570
green color on top of that kind of like
neon pink header that we had before.

77
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.370
And changed the title.

78
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.660
Let's change one additional thing.

79
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.680
Let's find something nice and obnoxious.

80
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.150
Let's take whatever the active one is.

81
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.310
Let's pick a nice new color.

82
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.530
Anyone have color preferences?

83
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.167
You know this site has
a certain aesthetic feel to it.

84
00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:42.349
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Salmon.

85
00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Salmon, let's just do it.

86
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.580
I think that's a CSS, yeah, salmon.

87
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.180
There we go.

88
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.210
So we'll go ahead and
we'll say Moar SALMON and

89
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.899
we'll push that up.
