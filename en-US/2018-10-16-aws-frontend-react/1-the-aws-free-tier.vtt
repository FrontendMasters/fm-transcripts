00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.393
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I have a brand new
AWS account that I made this morning and

2
00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:05.408
so it's kind of like tabula rasa.

3
00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:09.076
And we're gonna take a quick
look at the free-tier and

4
00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:13.475
then we're going to go ahead and
get this account set up, right?

5
00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:18.204
Because just creating an account,
there's a few things you need to do,

6
00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:19.997
mostly for your security.

7
00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:27.222
[LAUGH] Because if your main account gets
compromised, it's not a great scene.

8
00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:32.222
Especially if you are somebody who is
about to get API keys on a livestream and

9
00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:35.673
broadcast it across the world and
have it recorded.

10
00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:40.202
You'd probably wanna do the due
diligence of securing the account.

11
00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:42.622
So we'll talk a little bit
about what that means.

12
00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:46.052
Cool, so let's take a look at
the free tier real quick and

13
00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:48.347
that is at AWS.amazon.com/free.

14
00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:49.694
It's a good url.

15
00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:53.780
And for the first year there are some
things that are forever free and

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.525
there are some things that are free for
the first year of your account, right?

17
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.272
Like I said,
most of the stuff that we're doing today,

18
00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:05.959
even not on the free tier is
not going to break the bank.

19
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.112
We'll even set up some billing alert,
so if things get out of control and

20
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:13.462
the nank starts breaking,
you know about it pretty soon.

21
00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:15.666
So we'll set up some
billing alerts as well so

22
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.530
you don't have to take my word for it.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.100
So in the kind of first year you get
a whole bunch of different services.

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.621
Let's actually look here, first 12 months.

25
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.846
We're not gonna be using most of these,
but for

26
00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:33.729
CloudFront you get 50 gigabytes
of data transfer out.

27
00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.864
That's pretty good.

28
00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:38.275
So on and so forth.

29
00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:44.906
And then always free you'll
get Cloud watch logs.

30
00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:50.137
There's other stuff like code pipeline.

31
00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:52.324
We're not gonna do that today but
those are pretty cool as well.

32
00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:53.528
For the lambdas,

33
00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:58.512
you get a million invocations of your
lambda function a month, forever.

34
00:01:58.512 --> 00:02:02.158
So this site really needs to take
off before you start blowing past

35
00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:03.029
the free tier.

36
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:07.568
For Route 53,
that will be about $0.50 a month.

37
00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:14.258
And eventually you will not
have free S3 in CloudFront.

38
00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:18.960
But that will, again, for the amount that
we're doing not be too big of a deal.

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.842
I had to sit through a workshop
where one of the people from ops

40
00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.810
showed us how to check our billing alerts,
and

41
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.484
each team at Sangri is alloted
about a thousand dollars.

42
00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:32.475
And it was basically how to check and
they're like every team was supposed to be

43
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.559
checking regularly if they
were kind of nearing that or

44
00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.626
otherwise things would get
automatically shut off.

45
00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:39.140
We have this thing called Crampus, and

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.029
Crampus finds your untagged over costly
services and just shuts them down.

47
00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.197
So when I went to look
at the Frontend ones,

48
00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:50.018
that's when I found out we were
spending about between $9 and $13 so.

49
00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:53.501
I don't check anymore, don't tell anyone.

50
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:56.276
Cool, all right so
that's the free tier and

51
00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.710
if you just made an account,
you'll have that for about 12 months.

52
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.753
But like I said even if you don't,

53
00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:05.652
it's not gonna be the biggest
deal in the world.
