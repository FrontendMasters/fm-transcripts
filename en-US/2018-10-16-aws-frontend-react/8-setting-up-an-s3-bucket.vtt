1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.001
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: In here,
I will now go to S3.

2
00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.748
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And if you have no
buckets, this is kind of empty state.

3
00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:13.508
If you are using an account
that you've used in the past,

4
00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:16.165
you might see previous
buckets that you've had here.

5
00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:19.868
We'll go ahead and hit Create Bucket,
this has to be unique.

6
00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:24.360
So, if everyone does test or
Jeff Bezos, or something like that,

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.219
that's not going to work.

8
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:31.829
So I'm gonna use my domain name,
superimportantwebsite.com.

9
00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.820
Right, and if you're hosting
directly out of an S3 bucket,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.444
this does need to match the domain name.

11
00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:42.609
That is a temporary restriction,
when we move to CloudFront,

12
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.742
that won't be in place, cool.

13
00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.643
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, we're gonna
keep all the defaults in this case,

14
00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:52.769
cuz we actually tweak a few of them later.

15
00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.785
One thing we didn't really
talk about is tags.

16
00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:58.681
Tags are just basically keys and
values that you can put on a thing.

17
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:02.930
So at SendGrid, we use to figure out what
team owns this thing, so who do I yell at?

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.709
Right, so on and so forth,
what product is it used for?

19
00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:09.280
So we can figure out, for a given product,
it's costing us this much.

20
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.834
It's just basically ways for you to label
stuff so you can get back to it later.

21
00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.196
We are not gonna keep all versions,
versioning means,

22
00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:21.860
if you take a file, then you replace it,
it will keep the old version around.

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.509
Right, webpack's gonna put a little
hash on every single build that we have,

24
00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.174
so we don't necessarily need that.

25
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:35.310
Cool, we don't need it encrypted, so on
and so forth, the next one is permissions.

26
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.497
So for me, I am able to go ahead and
do everything to the bucket.

27
00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:44.660
We're not gonna touch these just yet,
we're gonna set this up by hand.

28
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.351
So we'll go with all the defaults there
as well, and we'll review it, and

29
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.068
we will create the bucket.

30
00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:53.192
Cool, so now we have our bucket.

31
00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:57.841
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can see some
basic information about it and

32
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:58.827
click on the link.

33
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:03.620
And we are inside the bucket, which it
looks suspiciously similar to the other

34
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.460
empty state, but it's slightly different.

35
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.970
Here we've got the overview,
the properties of the bucket.

36
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.846
You'll see there's an extra one that we
didn't see in that initial model before.

37
00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:17.831
This is the place for
us to play a little bit.

38
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:22.526
Permissions, basically,
who's allowed to do what, and management,

39
00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:26.249
right, we're not gonna touch
too much of this right now.

40
00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.792
We care mostly about properties and
permissions.

41
00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:33.943
We also might wanna put some
kind of file in this bucket, so

42
00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:37.772
we'll go ahead and
just create a quick index.html.

43
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.981
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and I'll say,
hello from S3, maybe not so

44
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:49.310
heavy handed on the Shift key there

45
00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:03.205
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, all right,

46
00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:08.134
so we'll save that

47
00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:12.762
as index.html.

48
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:19.985
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
then I can go ahead and go to Add Files.

49
00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.585
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can set
permissions on the file,

50
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.441
you notice that I'm not
really doing a lot with this.

51
00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:33.591
When we get to CloudFront,
a lot of the headers and

52
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:36.823
stuff along those lines
will get set there as well.

53
00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:40.268
So I'm not gonna necessarily
gonna concern myself with it.

54
00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:42.481
Cool, so we can go to set permissions and
set properties.

55
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:46.172
You can, however,
set whatever headers you want it to.

56
00:03:46.172 --> 00:03:51.121
CloudFront is going to handle this for
us, so we're not worrying about it.

57
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:54.700
But when it is served,
you can set any of these that you need.

58
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.696
I don't really wanna do that on
a per file basis, that seems silly.

59
00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:06.033
Again, you can tag it, so on and so forth,
go ahead, and we'll upload index.html.

60
00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:10.824
And there it is, it's in my bucket,
this means that it is up and available and

61
00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:11.651
ready to go.

62
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:16.120
I'm not actually serving this anywhere
yet, so I need to go ahead and

63
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.131
do two things.

64
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:21.382
I need to go ahead and I need to
turn on that static website hosting

65
00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:26.128
that we saw before, and then I also
need to configure the permissions.

66
00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:30.034
So if I go back to properties,
I go static website hosting,

67
00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:31.998
and there are three options.

68
00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:36.762
We will use this one in a little bit,
I'm gonna point it out because

69
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:40.436
that will be a little bit of a mission for
you later.

70
00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:44.366
But we can use this bucket to
host a website, that seems good.

71
00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:48.526
And what should the index document
be if they just go to slash, well,

72
00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:50.119
we'll say index.html.

73
00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.032
And you can also set a 404
page here as well, or

74
00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:58.918
really any kind of error,
like a something went wrong page.

75
00:04:58.918 --> 00:05:01.737
We don't have one of those
pages made right now.

76
00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:04.021
It will end up being
somewhat problematic and

77
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:06.436
it'll be the fight that
we fight all day today.

78
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:10.525
As we try to figure out how to use
modern client side routing, and

79
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.882
also not break the way the web works,
be a lot of fun.

80
00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:17.766
So we'll save that, cool, and
now we're hosting the bucket.

81
00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:24.068
The other thing that we need to do is go
to permissions and set our bucket policy.

82
00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:28.025
Now there is a fun policy
generator here that you can use.

83
00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:33.022
But you saw that the JSON that
we had wasn't all that large.

84
00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:36.956
So I could, for instance,
say S3 Bucket Policy,

85
00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:41.496
I can allow,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Everyone,

86
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.284
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'd go find

87
00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:45.390
Get Object.

88
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.555
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give you a sense
of all the options in there, and

89
00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:55.887
then,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The format is down here.

90
00:05:55.887 --> 00:05:59.680
ARN is an Amazon recourse number,
so it's just what thing on Amazon.

91
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.462
So you've probably seen it around,

92
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:08.486
I kinda glossed over it when we were in
the identity access and management page.

93
00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.789
We can see that the MFA had
some kind of resourse number,

94
00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.768
all the things, what do we need?

95
00:06:13.768 --> 00:06:18.406
A lot of times,
a lambda might have a series of numbers.

96
00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:23.230
Luckily, because bucket names are unique,
the ARN, other than having the ARN format,

97
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.659
is the name of our bucket.

98
00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.760
So that's great, so you can just
kind of copy this, paste it in.

99
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.716
We'll change key name to that star
like we saw in the previous one.

100
00:06:32.716 --> 00:06:37.327
And we'll change bucket name
to superimportantwebsite.com.

101
00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:42.030
Obviously, for you,
it's whatever you named your bucket, for

102
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.120
me, it is superimportantwebsite.com.

103
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:50.712
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then we go ahead and
generate the policy, and other than some

104
00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:55.249
IDs, you can see it is very similar
to what I had on the screen earlier.

105
00:06:56.804 --> 00:07:00.363
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or if you go into the
setup instructions, you can just copy and

106
00:07:00.363 --> 00:07:02.426
paste that one that I made earlier.

107
00:07:02.426 --> 00:07:04.695
Cool, so we'll go in here, and

108
00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:10.133
we'll paste this in,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll hit Save.

109
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.609
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now you're saying,
hey, this bucket has public access.

110
00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:17.730
We know that in this case, but
this is okay for this bucket.

111
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.543
Generally speaking, though, you need to be
careful with what you put in this bucket.

112
00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:26.366
There are multiple companies,
many of them financial companies,

113
00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:28.853
that put sensitive data in public buckets.

114
00:07:28.853 --> 00:07:32.566
And then there are other people who
go basically crawling the web for

115
00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:35.379
publicly exposed buckets,
and taking that data.

116
00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.229
Right, for us, right now,
with our use case

117
00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.439
[LAUGH] of trying to setup a publicly
served website, this is okay.

118
00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:46.277
But the moment you're like, yeah, and
I put users' images in this bucket too,

119
00:07:46.277 --> 00:07:46.851
not great.

120
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.254
Right, so you definitely want to be
careful when you use a public bucket.

121
00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:54.907
If you wanted to store some other
assets that were being used by your

122
00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.538
application under the hood,

123
00:07:56.538 --> 00:08:00.729
you would make a bucket where only a given
IAM user had access to that bucket.

124
00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:04.536
This is, the world can read from
this bucket, which is cool,

125
00:08:04.536 --> 00:08:08.859
if you put stuff that you're
comfortable with the world reading, and

126
00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:11.590
not cool if you put
sensitive data in there.

127
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:17.068
All right, so go back to properties,
I go to static web hosting, and

128
00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:23.316
you can see this awesome URL where my web
page is in fact hosted on the Internet.

129
00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:25.846
All right, so that's, yeah,

130
00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:30.829
behold the glory of my amazing
website that is on the Internet.

131
00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:33.683
There are some problems with this.

132
00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:41.116
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That URL isn't great,
it's mysuperimportantwebsite.com.s3,

133
00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:47.162
I don't remember at all, I don't
remember it all because it was terrible.

134
00:08:47.162 --> 00:08:52.216
Also, if anyone got a feel of the late
90s web by having to sit there and

135
00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:57.451
manually upload a file like it's
an FTP server, yeah, that's a thing.

136
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:03.596
That's probably the furthest thing from
a CICD process that I can think of.

137
00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:10.014
Right, I am literally going to drag files
in and upload them to the Internet.

138
00:09:10.014 --> 00:09:14.877
Fun fact, I was doing that as
late as 2014, don't tell anyone.

139
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:18.666
So we need to fix that,
I was in US East 1, so right now,

140
00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:24.106
we have that problem I told you about
before, where everything was in Chicago.

141
00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:28.044
We have a version of that problem where
this bucket is hosted out of US East 1,

142
00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:29.086
which is Virginia.

143
00:09:29.086 --> 00:09:31.886
Which means the farther
you get from Virginia,

144
00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:36.089
the longer it takes this page to load,
because of things like physics.

145
00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:39.536
Right, electrons can only go
through a copper wire so fast.

146
00:09:39.536 --> 00:09:43.984
Right, there are things like the speed
of light that will eventually cause

147
00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:48.234
a millisecond delay in your page
loading in certain parts of the world.

148
00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:51.537
And the routing, right now,
this is a simple web page.

149
00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:55.608
When we go and deploy a React application,
you can go to any of those routes.

150
00:09:55.608 --> 00:09:59.986
But if you try to navigate directly to it,
that's not gonna be in the bucket.

151
00:09:59.986 --> 00:10:03.198
Right, so
we're gonna have to fix that as well, and

152
00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:08.173
there are various trade-offs that we'll
make along the way until we get there.

153
00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:11.119
So we're gonna fix all of these problems,
right, it's not just like, hey,

154
00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:12.336
here's the state of the world.

155
00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:17.650
We're gonna fix every single one of those
problems together, [LAUGH] as a team.
