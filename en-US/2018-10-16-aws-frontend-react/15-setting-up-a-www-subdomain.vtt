00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The other
issue is if I someone goes to

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.912
www,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Can't find the server.

3
00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:12.784
All right, one would argue it's 2018,
why are you making me do this?

4
00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:15.287
I know there is a page
that people link to,

5
00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:18.680
which is like a manifesto
on why you should use www.

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.620
I haven't read it, but
I know that it exists.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.080
So that I know that having
both is probably good.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.850
Cool, so let's get that set up.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.139
Now,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: One easy way to do an S3,

10
00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:34.389
is, if you remember when we
saw static web hosting before,

11
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.340
there was this other one down here.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.192
It says redirect requests.

13
00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:40.500
That seems interesting.

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.990
Obviously we don't wanna do it on
this bucket cuz it is hosting it.

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.550
What we can do is, we know that if we
are doing static web hosting with S3

16
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.460
that the bucket has to have
the same name as the URL, right?

17
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.138
We also see here that we
can redirect requests.

18
00:00:57.138 --> 00:01:00.834
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna setup a second bucket,

19
00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:04.256
we're gonna name
www.superimportantwebsite.com.

20
00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:06.327
And we'll have it redirect
to this bucket and

21
00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:08.354
then we'll just have to update route 53.

22
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:09.630
All right, let's do it together.

23
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.399
Cool, so we'll go back to S3,
we'll make another

24
00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.956
one called www.superimportantwebsite.com.

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Take all
the defaults just like last time.

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.720
So now we have it.

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.490
We go into the bucket,
go to Properties &gt; Static website hosting.

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.700
I apparently clicked a link instead of,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

29
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.498
So here we'll redirect requests,
and it's like,

30
00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:48.624
okay what is the bucket that
you would like to redirect to?

31
00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:58.338
superimportantwebsite.com,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

32
00:01:58.338 --> 00:02:02.850
So now,
If we have a super important website, but

33
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.360
then we also have that one
that's in the bucket, right?

34
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.840
We haven't set up the DNS for
www.superimportantwebsite just yet.

35
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.360
But we can see if we take
the actual bucket address,

36
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.896
put the www there,
that it now redirects, right?

37
00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:20.513
And you can see it changed the URL,
it just got rid of that,

38
00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:23.380
it actually brought us back
to superimportantwebsite.com.

39
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.489
So no one's going to type in
www.superimportantwebsite.com.s3-website--

40
00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.259
us-east-1-amazonaws.com, that's not
gonna be the mistake people make.

41
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.220
They're gonna try to type
www.superimportantwebsite.

42
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.743
So let's go ahead and
we'll go into the Route 53 console.

43
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Look,
Route 53, recently visited.

44
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.471
We'll go into Registered domains
&gt; superimportantwebsite.

45
00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:12.576
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And cool, so
we'll go ahead to Go to Record Sets, and

46
00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:16.520
this is gonna be exactly
like it was last time.

47
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.490
We'll create new record.

48
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.619
This time we'll type in www, we'll set the
alias, and there it is, there's my bucket.

49
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:29.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can hit Create.

50
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.879
Again, I could theoretically get
really ambitious and immediately go

51
00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.900
to www.superimportantwebsite.com,
and maybe the DNS propagate it.

52
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.952
I'm gonna do it, but I've got a,
it didn't work last time,

53
00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:44.554
it's not gonna work this time.

54
00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:47.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But I'm hopeful.

55
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.790
superimportantwebsite.com.

56
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.400
Yeah, so that DNS needs to propagate.

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.280
But we'll check on it a little bit.

58
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.236
We should now have www support as well.

59
00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:07.462
All right, great, so
we now have effectively

60
00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:12.580
somewhat fixed client side routing.

61
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.029
We will, as soon as the DNS propagates,
have a www domain.

62
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.796
We still have a few problems in here,
which is we are still over on HTTPS,

63
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:28.724
we still have to do this manually,
still hosted in Virginia.

64
00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:33.634
And our routing is not breaking the app,
but it's definitely breaking the social

65
00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:36.927
contract, that is what a 404 means,
[LAUGH] right?

66
00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:39.750
So we still have to solve those issues,
but we're getting there.
