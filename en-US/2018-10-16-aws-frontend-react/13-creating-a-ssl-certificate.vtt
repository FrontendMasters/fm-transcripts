WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Eventually, we want to
be able to serve it over HTTPS, and so

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.760
what we need is an SSL cert.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.200
Luckily, if you have bought
the domain through Amazon,

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.380
it is both incredibly easy and
incredibly free to do that.

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.905
So let's go ahead and
we'll do that together.

6
00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:23.703
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I just go over here,
and I will go to the Certificate Manager.

7
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:32.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
I want to get started.

8
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.790
I'm gonna request a public certificate.

9
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.550
Hit that request button, and

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.870
I'm gonna put in the domain names
that I want it to work for.

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.600
If you want the same cert to work for
all of your subdomains,

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240
you can put a star in there.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.058
Let's start with
superimportantwebsite.com, and

14
00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:55.761
I'm gonna add another one,
which is www.superimportantwebsite.com,

15
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.598
so we'll have it work for both.

16
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.171
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll hit Next,
then there's DNS validation or

17
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:06.459
email validation.

18
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.010
If you're using Amazon,
this is definitely the easier of the two.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.740
I'll show you.

20
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.680
Normally, you're like, no, this is
the thing where I have to set custom DNS

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.860
things and stuff along those lines, right?

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.612
Trust me.

23
00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:26.980
All right, so validate that
you didn't misspell anything.

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.240
All right, we'll confirm and request.

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.970
All right, so the first time I got
to this page, I was like, I'm done.

26
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.270
This is another thing where I have
to wait like with the DNS, or

27
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390
like eventually with CloudFront,
and I sat there.

28
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.390
[LAUGH] No, no, there's still more
things you need to do on this page.

29
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.190
So you need to open this drop-down,
and you hit Create record in Route 53.

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.920
So it's gonna take care,
you hit this button for each one of them,

31
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.935
it's gonna put the DNS records in
place that validate that you control.

32
00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:04.959
That you're not generating an SSL cert for
a domain that you don't own, right?

33
00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.650
This will go ahead and
configure Route 53 for you.

34
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.570
So I'll hit Create record.

35
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.530
This is like, hey,
I'm gonna put in this special validation,

36
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.410
yep, totally makes sense, I believe you.

37
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.471
And then we'll go ahead and
create it for the www as well.

38
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:23.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll hit Continue.

39
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.552
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Sweet.

40
00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:30.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you do DNS validation or
email?

41
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.159
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: DNS validation.

42
00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:41.422
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so as you can see,

43
00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:46.222
it says it can take up to 30 minutes or
longer for the changes to propagate.
