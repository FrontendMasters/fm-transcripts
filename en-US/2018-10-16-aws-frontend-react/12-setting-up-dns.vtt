WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.608
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so we'll go back.

2
00:00:02.608 --> 00:00:07.392
Go to route 53 and
we will find out together if

3
00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:11.692
my domain registration is done cooking.

4
00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:16.047
So, we'll go to Registered domains,
here's my super important website,

5
00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:17.593
and we'll hit Manage DNS.

6
00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.709
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and
then we'll Go to Record Sets.

7
00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:27.941
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so I've got the basis here,

8
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.213
I want to create a new record set.

9
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.955
And we're going to leave this blank,

10
00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:34.795
because we want just super
important website.com, right?

11
00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:38.192
We don't need a subdomain,
you might be asking questions, like,

12
00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:39.633
shouldn't I also have www?

13
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.775
Aren't people expecting www,
so on and so forth?

14
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.196
I'm pretty sure Frontend Masters went
a while without supporting www, but

15
00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:47.432
you have that now, right?

16
00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:50.658
Yeah, [LAUGH],
we'll get both set up in due time, but

17
00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.180
let's get the original one going first.

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.557
So it's going to be an A record, but we're
actually going to set it to an Alias,

19
00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.115
an alias is used for
internal Amazon stuff, right?

20
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:07.215
So we'll set the alias to Yes,
and then, look at this,

21
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:12.725
it's superimportantwebsite.com,
I'm going to click that.

22
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:17.775
Routing Policy, like I said,
there was failover in case one goes down.

23
00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.811
Geolocation, depending on where they are,
Latency,

24
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.824
which is like if one is slower than
the other, it will go to the faster one.

25
00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.314
You could also do Weighted, which is like,

26
00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:28.061
if you wanted to do AB
testing between two servers.

27
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:30.733
You can be like, okay, like, there's,

28
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:35.499
one of the things we're looking at is
effectively like when we go to deploy.

29
00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.872
Eventually starting out with sending 1% of
traffic to the new version of the code,

30
00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:41.299
and then so on and so forth.

31
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.938
As that is successful, increasing it, but
we're going to keep it simple, literally.

32
00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:51.897
All right, and so
now superimportantwebsite.com

33
00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:56.524
is aliased to that longer
URL that we saw before.

34
00:01:56.524 --> 00:02:02.001
Chances of it working immediately
are fairly low, but you know what?

35
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.762
I'm going to go for it.

36
00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:09.875
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's my longer one,
no, not yet, so

37
00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.729
DNS takes a little bit of time to
propagate so we'll see it shortly.

38
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.904
So one quick public service
announcement that came up in the chat.

39
00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:22.655
Which is, if one has a domain
at some other registrar,

40
00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:25.560
how do I connect it to route 53?

41
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.598
So we'll throw this in the notes,
but basically Amazon not

42
00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:35.955
only has guides for how you can
redirect your domain of choice.

43
00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:40.018
But they even have options for, hey,
I need to do it while it's live with no

44
00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:43.255
downtime, versus I don't really
care if I have downtime.

45
00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:47.678
So the difference between if I
tried to move over SteveKinney.net,

46
00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:50.436
which honestly, I've seen the traffic.

47
00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.658
I can go down for
a little bit while the DNS propagates,

48
00:02:52.658 --> 00:02:54.359
it's not going to be the end of the world.

49
00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.338
Versus something like SendGrid.com,

50
00:02:56.338 --> 00:03:00.014
where you can equate that in dollars
with many zeroes afterwards, right?

51
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.030
So depending on what your situation is,
there is an option for both.
