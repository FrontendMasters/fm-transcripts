00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.009
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're
gonna do a quick aside.

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.022
I'm gonna go through this just
kinda with a bunch of screenshots,

3
00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.790
because this is totally optional.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.270
But we're going to register a domain name.

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.310
The reason that we're gonna kinda do it
separately, and I'll walk you through

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.676
the process first, is that it involves
putting a lot of personal information.

7
00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.836
And I'm not particularly in the mood
to dox myself at this moment,

8
00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:23.707
ask me later, and I might be.

9
00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:26.130
So we'll kind of go through the steps.

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.547
If you don't want to register
a domain name, that is totally cool,

11
00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.260
I'm gonna register one.

12
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.290
You won't be able to do necessarily
everything in this course, like setting

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.506
up the DNS on your newly registered domain
name is not gonna be a thing that you do,

14
00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:44.586
but I am not the boss of you and
I can't make you register a domain name.

15
00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.472
So this is gonna be an option,
but let's go through the steps.

16
00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:50.736
The registration takes time, so
I understand that, he was just talking S3

17
00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:54.150
and now we're talking about registering
a domain name, totally, right?

18
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.650
The other interesting part is that for

19
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.310
a very simple S3 static website hosting
the bucket has to have the same name as

20
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.520
the domain that you plan
on hosting it with.

21
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.470
So if you go like, I have a great idea for

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.410
a website,
it's gonna be frontendmasters.com and

23
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.830
you make that bucket and
then you go to register the domain name

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.720
you realize that it's taken,
that's going to be somewhat problematic.

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.510
Also, bucket names have to be unique.

26
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.090
So if for instance, Mark and Tanner have
a bucket called frontendmasters.com,

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.540
you cannot make a bucket with that name.

28
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.125
So there is a little bit of a dance here,
in terms of getting both to be unique.

29
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.700
This is only a short time limitation where
they have to have the same name, but

30
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.380
it is in the early stages workshop,
a limitation that we have to deal with.

31
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.060
Cool, so
let's actually walk through the steps.

32
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.490
We'll go visit Amazon Route 53, and

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.880
we have that one option for
domain registration.

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.920
And then there's another blue
button called Register Domain.

35
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.380
I'll give you a hint what happens there.

36
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.530
Then, the hard part, and the part that
you don't wanna watch anyone do live.

37
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.739
If you thought live coding was dangerous,

38
00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.670
live domain name shopping
[LAUGH] is also dangerous.

39
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.834
So you can find some kind of website,
I eventually went with

40
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:20.020
mysuperfunwebsite.com, which you
can totally visit right now.

41
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.199
It's the app that I showed you earlier,
there is no surprises there, sorry.

42
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.340
And you add it to the cart.

43
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.755
You click that Continue button,

44
00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:31.126
which that page is long enough
you can add it to the car and

45
00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:34.459
then you're gonna set there for a few
seconds wondering what the next step is,

46
00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.926
you actually have to scroll to the bottom
of the page to find the Continue button.

47
00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:40.161
This is literally why I
made the screenshot, so.

48
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:46.203
Cool, and then you dox yourself, and
you put in all your personal information.

49
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.448
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then you undox yourself
by making sure that you put on [LAUGH]

50
00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:54.725
domain privacy so no one can WHOIS you.

51
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:58.504
Basically, you can go to,
if somebody doesn't do this and they type

52
00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:03.280
WHOIS mysuperfunwebsite.com, and I didn't
turn this on, it would be my address.

53
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.169
And then I'd have friends over,
it would be great.

54
00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.385
So you'd turn this on and, basically,
you put in all this information,

55
00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:12.040
and then they don't show it to anyone,
cool.

56
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.840
And then you confirm all
that information again.

57
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.519
You see why I'm not doing this live now,
right?

58
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.620
You confirm all of that information,
and now, then you wait, effectively.

59
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.799
And this is why we're doing this now.

60
00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.342
So if you wanna register a domain name,
we can do it together during a break.

61
00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:32.883
It will take a little bit of time,
and hopefully when we come back,

62
00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:34.354
we'll jump back into S3.

63
00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:39.754
And then by the time we're ready to
use this domain name with the live

64
00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:46.130
demo gods smiling upon us, our domain
name should be registered at that point.

65
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.407
So I've registered
superimportantwebsite.com,

66
00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:55.938
we had a lot of fun looking at
some other top level domains.

67
00:03:55.938 --> 00:03:58.045
But some of those can get a little pricey.

68
00:03:58.045 --> 00:04:02.620
[LAUGH] So here we've got
superimportantwebsite.com, cool.

69
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.318
So that's gonna take a little
bit of time to cook,

70
00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:08.289
so we'll go back to talking
about S3 in the meantime.
