00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.640
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: The Chrome
user experience report.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.770
Now, I've alluded to this a few times so
far.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.855
The Chrome user experience report,

4
00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:15.130
this is how Google knows what
your website's performance is,

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.825
so it can decide whether or
not it wants to, penalize your ranking.

6
00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.580
So every user who uses blink,

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.203
a blink browser is capable of
capturing the Core Web Vitals,

8
00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:36.627
but not everybody who uses blink can
necessarily send that data to Google.

9
00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:40.162
That'd be kind of weird, but
everybody who uses Chrome,

10
00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:43.340
which is Google's proprietary browser.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.202
Everybody who uses Chrome can send data,
and if you've logged into your Chrome,

12
00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:52.360
you've signed into your Google account so
that it remembers things,

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.164
and you can sync your extensions
somewhere in that giant terms of

14
00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:00.049
service that you signed you
gave Google the ability to say.

15
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.193
Send your performance data back to Google,
and that's what Crux is.

16
00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:09.968
It's every single logged in user
who uses Chrome around the world,

17
00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:15.665
Chrome is measuring the Core Web Vitals
and some other metrics about that user and

18
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:21.235
sending it back to their system, which
is the Chrome user experience report.

19
00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:26.881
Now, this data represents field data, it's
the real data from all of these users,

20
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.836
from all of those logged in Chrome users.

21
00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:34.426
Now they don't care about every
website if you visit localhost,

22
00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:40.597
if you visit intranet.yourcompany.com,
they don't wanna capture that.

23
00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:44.967
They wanna capture the top
million public websites.

24
00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:49.017
Probably more than a million, I think
that's what they say, but I think they're

25
00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:53.647
actually capturing more than a million for
the purposes of deciding ranking.

26
00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:57.007
They're capturing all this data,
then they anonymize the data.

27
00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:01.592
They put a bunch of fuzzing in it to
round the numbers off a little bit and

28
00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:05.793
remove all the information about
how many page views is actually

29
00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:09.936
being represented here, and
then they publish this.

30
00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:14.226
You can get the Crux data, the Chrome
user experience data from any website,

31
00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:17.328
from your website,
from your competitor's website,

32
00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:22.710
from my website, from anybody's website,
this data is publicly available.

33
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.380
It's given to you on
a 28 day rolling average.

34
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.826
So when you look at it, it's at your score
from the Chrome user experience report on

35
00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:34.080
any given day, it doesn't actually measure
what your site was doing that day,

36
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.340
it measures the average of what
the last 28 days have done.

37
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.311
And that's, again, to kind of fuzz
everything and anonymize it so you can't,

38
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:46.786
figure out the traffic patterns of
your competitors based on this data.

39
00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:50.597
This data is all stored in
Google BigQuery, which,

40
00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:54.648
if you are familiar with the Google Cloud
System, and you're a developer, and

41
00:02:54.648 --> 00:02:58.346
you know how SQL works and BigQuery work,
and you can do all that stuff.

42
00:02:58.346 --> 00:03:02.815
You can go and query this, stated
directly, caution if you do stupid queries

43
00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:06.939
it can cost you real amounts of money
because it has lots and [LAUGH] lots of

44
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.540
data in it, but the data is also available
by an API, you can get this data in page

45
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.438
speed insights and Google search
console and a bunch of other tools.

46
00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:20.497
One such tool the publishes
the data is something that I wrote,

47
00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:24.648
called the speed check,
the speed check is what we'll do next.

48
00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:29.525
If you go to request metrics,
speed check, we can do a real-time

49
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:34.858
query against the Chrome user
experience report for any website.

50
00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:39.847
So for example,
if I wanna see how target.com is rating

51
00:03:39.847 --> 00:03:42.817
right now I can go and do that, and

52
00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:47.595
here is the current Chrome
user experience scores for

53
00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:54.023
target.com, their desktop score
is they are failing LCP and CLS.

54
00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:58.534
They are passing INP, so
potentially they are getting SEO penalties

55
00:03:58.534 --> 00:04:03.059
depending on who they're competing
with and what their scores are.

56
00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.643
For mobile, it's a little bit worse
their CLS is better on mobile, but

57
00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:10.589
their INP is a lot worse.

58
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.003
Mobile devices don't have
as much processing power,

59
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:17.249
JavaScript's gonna take longer,
that's not an entirely surprising score.

60
00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:21.125
We can also see TTFB and FCP,
those metrics are also captured that we

61
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.519
could report on, and
you can do this for anything.

62
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.396
So if you wanna check out what
your site is doing right now,

63
00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:30.709
you can go out to the Speed Check tool,
type in any domain you want.

64
00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:37.880
Now if I was Target, let's say I am Target
Let's say I'm a performance developer

65
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.973
at Target, and I wanna make sure that
my site is faster than my competitors.

66
00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:48.680
Well, I can look up my competitors
I could go to walmart.com and

67
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.731
I could see what Walmart is doing I'm,

68
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:56.525
Walmart is having some CLS problems
we can see in their recent data

69
00:04:56.525 --> 00:05:01.318
it's gotten a lot worse now it's
still in the good range barely,

70
00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:06.328
but they're right at that edge,
and they're failing LCP and INP.

71
00:05:07.678 --> 00:05:13.418
On desktop, they're failing LCP,
on mobile, they're failing the same ones.

72
00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:19.318
So, we can see are we faster or slower
than our competitors, which is a really

73
00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:24.148
interesting side effect of the Chrome User
Experience Report is not only do we know

74
00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:29.194
that Google has performance data about our
website, but they have it for everybody.

75
00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:34.644
And so this isn't like a secret, you know
if your website is performing poorly.

76
00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:37.525
This tells you if your website's
performing poorly, and

77
00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.991
you can look at the people who you
compete with for search ranking, and

78
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:44.968
make sure that your site is performing
better than them, which is pretty cool.

79
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.668
Crux is a really powerful set of tools.

80
00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:53.555
Now, the Crux is revealed in a bunch of
different places, Speed Check is something

81
00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:57.338
that I built because I thought a lot
of them were really complicated to get.

82
00:05:57.338 --> 00:06:01.491
One of the other places that you can get
it is inside a PageSpeed Insights report.

83
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:08.071
This is at pagespeed.web.dev, a lot of you
might have used PageSpeed Insights before.

84
00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:14.181
PageSpeed Insights is basically
Lighthouse run as a synthetic test.

85
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:18.060
So rather than running
Lighthouse on your browser,

86
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.301
you're telling Google's data
center to run it for you.

87
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:29.904
Now you don't have a lot of control of it,
but it at least has to do network hops.

88
00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:33.725
So we typed in target.com,
it's gonna go off and do something.

89
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:38.416
Right off the bat, it's going to tell us,
discover what your

90
00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:43.379
real users are experiencing right
here at the top, this is Crux,

91
00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.359
it's basically that same data that
I just pulled for the origin.

92
00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.719
So it captures it both for
specific URLs or whole origins.

93
00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.892
The Speed Check tool that I built,

94
00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:03.774
only does origin this one can you can do
either, but it shows you the real user

95
00:07:03.774 --> 00:07:07.605
data first because it's still
busy doing the actual test.

96
00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:11.634
So we can see, here's the Crux data,

97
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:15.505
hopefully this loads here in a second,
come on.

98
00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:22.109
So behind the scenes, PageSpeed Insight
does is it spun up like some server

99
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:27.196
instance that ran a mobile version of
Chrome, and it ran a Lighthouse report.

100
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.824
This looks exactly like the Lighthouse
report we ran locally, but

101
00:07:30.824 --> 00:07:35.161
it's packaged in here, and it shows us
the performance score, the LCP, CLS,

102
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:38.136
First Contentful Paint, some other stuff.

103
00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:42.061
Again, it does not give us an INP,
there's no user interaction.

104
00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.493
We couldn't instruct it to do anything for
us, but we get some general information

105
00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:51.011
about it, as well as some recommendations
for what it thinks we can improve.

106
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:55.666
So this was actually a really big moment
when page speed insights put Crux in here

107
00:07:55.666 --> 00:08:00.391
as well, because this data, art like not
arguably this data is more relevant and

108
00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:03.215
meaningful than what came below it.

109
00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:07.435
If this data says you're good,
this number doesn't matter.

110
00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:13.936
If this data says you're failed,
then if this number says

111
00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:18.722
100% it also doesn't matter,
your data is still bad,

112
00:08:18.722 --> 00:08:23.220
and it meant that this if your
field data is failing, but

113
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.073
this is passing,
it means the robot's wrong.

114
00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:31.983
The synthetic test is wrong,
it doesn't represent the real users.

115
00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:36.634
So PageSpeed Insights, lets you
get kind of compare both together.
