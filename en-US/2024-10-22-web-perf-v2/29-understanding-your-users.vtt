00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So
let's talk about those users.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's talk about who your users are.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.750
Who are they, and what do they use,
and what's interesting?

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.180
We're gonna look at some general
statistics about the web.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.344
So this is all according to StatCounter,

6
00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:20.290
which has lots of really cool data,
but we look at device share in.

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.458
In the world, as of August 2024,

8
00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:30.333
62% use mobile 62%,
most of the web is mobile.

9
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.239
This is why Google cares about mobile.

10
00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.592
It's why mobile first indexing.

11
00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:37.530
It's why so many stores like
Build Mobile First Things.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.720
Now, it's not saying
everybody uses mobile.

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.675
Some people use desktop, some
industries are overwhelmingly desktop.

14
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.304
My sites are like 98% desktop users,

15
00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:50.855
cuz I typically target developers when
they're at work on their workstations.

16
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.226
And so
desktop is really important to me, but

17
00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.875
globally, mobile is twice
the size of desktop.

18
00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:03.966
Let's break down screen sizes,
cuz there's a huge diversity here.

19
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:09.208
There's 8% at the absolute like biggest,
right,

20
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:15.859
1920, so we have big screens,
10 ADP or better, 8.3%.

21
00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.282
But then we go the next largest size
is all the way on the other end of

22
00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:23.109
the spectrum at only 360 pixels wide.

23
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:29.200
7% only 360 pixels wide that's
not I that's like a teeny tiny

24
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.978
Android device like an iPhone
doesn't even come in that size.

25
00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:39.593
390 by 844,
I think that's the small iPhone, and

26
00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:46.708
then a 1366 by 768 that's like a small
laptop, but it's all over the board.

27
00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:52.538
And so the screen size, none of those is
what I'm rocking here with my MacBook.

28
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.536
Like mine's bigger than any of those,
right?

29
00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:56.948
I bet all yours is probably
bigger than any of those, too.

30
00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:02.473
And so what you see on your developer
laptop or your developer workstation,

31
00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:06.372
it's probably nothing like
what your real users do.

32
00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:10.233
Operating system share,
let's look at this, check this out.

33
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:15.810
71% are on Android, 71%.

34
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.720
iOS at 27 then on the desktop side,

35
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.532
we have overwhelmingly Windows at 71%,
some OSX.

36
00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:34.970
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So if we break that down,
so mobile is 60% and 60 some percent,

37
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.381
and within mobile,
Android is 71% of that mobile.

38
00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:48.624
What's the average cost of an Android
phone worldwide, it's $286.

39
00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:54.104
So that means even of those Android
phones, they're not buying Google Pixels.

40
00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:57.197
They're not buying the crazy
high-end Android phones.

41
00:02:57.197 --> 00:02:59.918
They're buying, the cheap Android phones.

42
00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:02.544
The cheap Android phones with
the lowest amount of memory and

43
00:03:02.544 --> 00:03:04.765
the lowest processing power in them.

44
00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:09.396
So the average user on the internet
is nowhere close to what we typically

45
00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:13.655
think of and what we typically
have in our pockets as developers.

46
00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.200
Network speed,
this is based on speedtest.net.

47
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.302
This is average worldwide mobile and
fixed broadband speed,

48
00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:28.513
mobile is 60 down, 11 up,
27 milliseconds of latency.

49
00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:33.454
So if you're trying to base maybe your
chrome speed tests on, these would be

50
00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:38.490
good numbers to base your throttles based
on how you should slow things down.

51
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.881
But of course,the future is
not evenly distributed yet

52
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.084
because those numbers are wildly different
depending on where in the world you go.

53
00:03:47.084 --> 00:03:52.573
Some places, connection speeds
is 250 megabits or better.

54
00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:55.255
Other places crawl along at less than 10.

55
00:03:56.315 --> 00:04:01.566
Now, this is all like global data, which
is interesting to think about if you build

56
00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:06.801
a site that serves a worldwide audience,
but you should understand your users.

57
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:12.260
So using an analytics tool or real user
monitoring tool, you should understand

58
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.555
who your users are, like what operating
system, browsers, what country,

59
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:23.102
what screen sizes are your visitors coming
from, so you can be sure to test that.

60
00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:25.277
These are all reports
out of request metrics,

61
00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:27.687
which does a little bit
of analyticsy stuff, too.

62
00:04:29.247 --> 00:04:33.958
So that is all about
understanding our users and

63
00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.152
setting goals for our website.
