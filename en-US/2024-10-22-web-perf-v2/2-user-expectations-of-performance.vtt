00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.118
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So, let's talk about,

2
00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:06.380
why should I bother making
developer stickers online fast?

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.598
Why is web performance important at all?

4
00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:12.376
I have other things to do,
I could design a bunch more stickers and

5
00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:14.662
put it on the site and
hopefully make some more money.

6
00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:20.297
Or I could focus on web performance,
why should I spend the time doing this?

7
00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:24.151
There's three big reasons the why
web performance is important.

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.920
First, user experience,
second Search Engine Optimization or

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.531
SEO and third online advertising.

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.058
And all three are important for

11
00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:36.464
the e-commerce store depending at
what kind of website you work on,

12
00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:39.533
maybe two of these are important or
one of these is important.

13
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:44.327
But one of these is important to
every single website on the planet.

14
00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:50.094
So, let's talk about each of those in
depth, why is web performance important?

15
00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:54.136
Well, from a user perspective, from the
user coming to your site, generally, we

16
00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:58.445
could say, web performance is important,
so I don't strangle you with frustration.

17
00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:02.573
Because I'm gonna be so angry visiting
your site that I'm going to want to leave.

18
00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:07.183
If the users feel this, you definitely
know you have a web performance problem.

19
00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:10.607
But let's be more specific than that,

20
00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:16.521
the user experience of your website
is how well your website meets or

21
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.064
exceeds the expectations of your user.

22
00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:23.950
When an internet visitor comes to your
site, they have a certain expectation

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.922
of how fast it's gonna load based on
similar sites, historical experience.

24
00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:32.842
What they're trying to do, how important
your site is to their day-to-day life,

25
00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:37.089
all sorts of things, so it's about
understanding user expectations.

26
00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:40.859
Now you could say, maybe an easier way to
solve this is the key to happiness is just

27
00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.745
to lower everybody's expectations and

28
00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:45.812
then we wouldn't have to worry
about any of this, you know what?

29
00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:49.850
That's a great idea,
let's just lower everybody's expectations,

30
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.576
the website shouldn't load in less than
two minutes, and let's go about our day.

31
00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:55.837
Websites would be so

32
00:01:55.837 --> 00:02:00.888
much easier to build if we didn't have
all these needy high expectations users.

33
00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.345
Unfortunately, we can't
buy fiber connections and

34
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:07.722
fast devices for
every single user on the planet, so

35
00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.581
we have to figure out ways to
make our website fast instead.

36
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:15.195
So, let's talk about
common user expectations.

37
00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:20.823
And this is data based on real research,
not weird vendor specific research,

38
00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:26.381
but like academic research about
human-computer interactions over time.

39
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:32.325
And the IEEE response times found that for
effective communication,

40
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:37.775
some sort of response is needed
within two seconds of a request.

41
00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.539
So, if the user makes an action,

42
00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.566
they should feel something
has happened in two seconds.

43
00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:47.762
And if they don't, they immediately think
this is slow and they feel interrupted.

44
00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:52.004
Any weight that's longer than two
seconds breaks concentration and

45
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.914
affects their productivity.

46
00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:58.207
So, if I'm trying to do something,
if I click on an ad or if I add

47
00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:03.067
something to my cart or if I submit
a request to your website in any kind,

48
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:07.933
if you don't give me something in
two seconds, I lose what I'm doing.

49
00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:11.753
My brain wanders, I have the intention
span of a goldfish, and I'm gone and

50
00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:13.556
I'm thinking about other things.

51
00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:17.098
I'm thinking about the shed
I want to build, or

52
00:03:17.098 --> 00:03:20.032
something like that, so two seconds.

53
00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:25.108
So, it's more granular than that, it's
not just two seconds is its magic point.

54
00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:30.125
So, usability engineering study found
that the user's concentration or

55
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:34.834
the user's interaction with something
changes at different rates.

56
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:38.537
So, if you can respond in
less than 0.01 seconds,

57
00:03:38.537 --> 00:03:41.683
the user feels that's effectively instant.

58
00:03:41.683 --> 00:03:43.347
They don't notice any delay,

59
00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:46.805
they feel like something happened
immediately that's great.

60
00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:49.921
If the user experiences one second,
they notice it,

61
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:54.573
it's like, something happened, but
it doesn't interrupt their flow.

62
00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:58.548
It doesn't get in the way of what they're
doing, that's not enough time for

63
00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:01.790
their brain to switch gears and
think about something else, so

64
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.461
one second is this cool number.

65
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.959
But if you do 10 seconds or more,
if something stops for 10 seconds,

66
00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.134
the users almost universally
feel frustration and

67
00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:14.919
break their concentration and
their flow, they're done.

68
00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:21.042
10 seconds is really, really bad in
terms of understanding how humans and

69
00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:23.828
computers are going to interact.

70
00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:28.016
Now, if we apply that
directly to websites, and

71
00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:33.242
the expectations that users
have of the web, time is money.

72
00:04:33.242 --> 00:04:39.753
A book on web performance found in
a large study that 40% of users, 40% will

73
00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:46.005
abandon a site if they wait three seconds
over the large data set of all users.

74
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:51.258
So, three seconds, if you don't get there,
40% of them are just gone,

75
00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:55.131
75% of users that experience
what they feel is slow.

76
00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:58.556
If the user would describe their
experience on your website is slow,

77
00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:00.632
75% of them just will never come back.

78
00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:03.605
They don't trust your store,
they don't like your store,

79
00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:07.394
they don't like the experience,
they won't look at your cat gifs anymore,

80
00:05:07.394 --> 00:05:10.157
they're done,
75% of users are just going to bail.

81
00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:15.212
Now, that's just some general
expectations around user experience.

82
00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:18.872
Your user experience for your app
depends a lot on what you're doing and

83
00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:20.095
how important that is.

84
00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:24.735
And we're going to talk a lot more about
that later in the section around setting

85
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:26.893
goals for performance of your site.
