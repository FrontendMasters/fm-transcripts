00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.977
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Let's talk
about browser support.

2
00:00:01.977 --> 00:00:07.274
All right, this is interesting because
not all browsers support all of these,

3
00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:12.585
and you can't necessarily have the full
picture if you only measure one thing.

4
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.446
So before I get into it,
we're not actually talking about browsers,

5
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:17.203
we're gonna talk about browser engines.

6
00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:20.896
Because these things are all implemented
in browser engines not the browsers

7
00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:21.585
themselves.

8
00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.482
So there's three browser engines
that we really care about here.

9
00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:27.072
We care about Blink, WebKit and Gecko.

10
00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.332
Blink, obviously the biggest one.

11
00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:33.412
So that's Chrome, that's Edge,
that's Opera, that's Samsung,

12
00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:37.087
that's Brave, that's Arc,
that's what a lot of people use.

13
00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.811
WebKit is Safari, Mobile Safari,

14
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:45.408
and strangely Chrome
on iOS is also WebKit.

15
00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:50.012
At least for now, this might be
changing here soon, Apple locked down

16
00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:55.258
the ability for which browser engines can
be installed on iOS to only be theirs.

17
00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:59.229
Because they didn't want other people to
go and screw up the browsing experience.

18
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.640
So if you installed Firefox on iOS or
Chrome on iOS or any other browser on iOS,

19
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.574
it was really just a wrapper around
Safari, it wasn't its own thing.

20
00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:14.739
And so for this purposes,
you have to think of Chrome if it's

21
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:19.519
operating on iOS isn't really Chrome,
it's WebKit.

22
00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.212
And then Firefox is based
on one called Gecko, okay?

23
00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:27.210
Here is the breakdown of how this works.

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.908
So across the top we have Blink,
WebKit, and Gecko.

25
00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:34.265
On the left are all of the metrics
that we talked about and

26
00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.342
then which things are supported.

27
00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:39.466
The legacy metrics,
the ones that have been around forever,

28
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.439
obviously we're all good.

29
00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.739
Everything is fine up here at the top.

30
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:49.966
Where this breaks down is right
here on the Core Web Vitals,

31
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:56.627
not just these Core Web Vitals, here,
here and here, LCP, CLS, and INP.

32
00:01:56.627 --> 00:02:01.107
And the problem here is that WebKit
does not support any of them.

33
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:05.446
So Firefox supports LCP,
but not the other ones.

34
00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.470
And so
if you're measuring the Core Web Vitals,

35
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.140
which you absolutely should for your SEO.

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.406
Because Google is the thing and
you need to make Google like you,

37
00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:18.571
you're actually not
measuring Safari at all.

38
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.546
It's not reflective of your Safari users.

39
00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:27.733
No zero Safari users have sent you a Core
Web Vital metric, you've never gotten one.

40
00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:30.891
So your Core Web Vitals could be great,
but

41
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:35.385
the user experience on
Safari could still be crap.

42
00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:38.886
You don't know, because you can't
measure those specifically.

43
00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:42.588
Now, what you can measure,
you can measure TTFB,

44
00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:45.615
you can measure FCP, so those are great.

45
00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:48.924
You can still know that those things
are fast across browsers, and

46
00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:51.360
you can build custom metrics for
any one of them.

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.513
They both support the performance API,
mark, and measure.

48
00:02:55.513 --> 00:02:58.822
They just don't support the logic
built into the Chrome Web vitals.

49
00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:00.885
They're not technically web standards,

50
00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:03.182
they're just something
that Google has done.

51
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:08.362
So you just need to be aware that
that data is not reflecting Safari.

52
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:13.511
So if we look at market share of
these browsers, the big problem here,

53
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:19.361
I mean Chrome is clearly big and Edge and
Samsung and Opera are all blink as well,

54
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:24.117
so like a big portion of the internet
is already covered by this.

55
00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:24.861
The problem is Safari.

56
00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:30.111
The problem is that a lot
of people use Safari.

57
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.894
Safari is built into a lot of devices,
a lot of high-end devices.

58
00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:37.362
And if you're building
an e-commerce store,

59
00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:40.925
they tend to be, frankly,
higher value users.

60
00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:45.588
They tend to be the people who spend
more money, tend to have iPhones,

61
00:03:45.588 --> 00:03:47.892
tend to have iOS devices, right?

62
00:03:47.892 --> 00:03:50.958
Apple devices are more
expensive to begin with.

63
00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.362
It's a weird signal that this is somebody
who's already willing to spend a lot of

64
00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:56.612
money on technology.

65
00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.585
They might be willing to spend
more money on other things too.

66
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:04.144
So generally, we care a lot
about those Safari users, but

67
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.879
we don't always get the best metrics for
them.

68
00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.544
What do we do about this?

69
00:04:10.544 --> 00:04:12.084
Frankly, I don't know.

70
00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:14.949
There's not a good solution for this.

71
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.153
We capture the Core Web Vitals.

72
00:04:16.153 --> 00:04:17.372
There's a lot of good reasons to do it.

73
00:04:17.372 --> 00:04:19.483
You should totally do those things,

74
00:04:19.483 --> 00:04:23.235
but you also just need to periodically
test things out on Safari.

75
00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:25.099
We don't have good automated
metrics to do this.

76
00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.320
You just need to make sure your
site doesn't suck on an iPhone.

77
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.820
That's a few generations old to make sure
that normal people can use your site.

78
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.498
There's not a good way to
programmatically get all of that

79
00:04:39.498 --> 00:04:42.946
data other than just testing it yourself.

80
00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:46.128
So that is the end of
our measuring section.

81
00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:49.739
What we're gonna get into next is we're
going to talk about testing and tools.

82
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:53.358
We're going to talk about the common tools
of web performance and how we go about

83
00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:57.105
getting this data and interpreting it,
specifically some statistics about it.

84
00:04:57.105 --> 00:05:00.985
Then we're gonna talk about setting
a proper corporate performance goals for

85
00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:01.580
your site.

86
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.184
And then we're gonna spend a lot of time
at the end of the day talking about metric

87
00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:06.881
by metric.

88
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:10.552
Here are tactics you can
use to improve TTFB.

89
00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:13.608
Here are tactics you can use to fix CLS.

90
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:19.945
And I mean this, for the people who are
watching the video on Frontendmasters.com.

91
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:23.157
I mean this as an index for you.

92
00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:26.562
You should probably go through it
once to know what they are, but

93
00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:29.904
once you know what metric you
need to improve for your website,

94
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:32.328
go to that section and
look at those tactics.

95
00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:36.065
Because you don't necessarily need
to do everything for your website.

96
00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:38.292
You shouldn't do everything,
it's a waste of time.

97
00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:41.276
Focus on the metrics that
your site sucks at and

98
00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:44.038
do those tactics to make your site better.
