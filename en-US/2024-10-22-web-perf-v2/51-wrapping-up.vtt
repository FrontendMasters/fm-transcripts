00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: That was a lot.
That was a lot.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.880
We talked about the importance of
web performance, why you care?

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.235
We talked about all these different
metrics, all the different ways you

4
00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:12.870
can measure it, all the different things
that to consider about data points.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.330
We talked about testing and tools.

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.623
We talked about setting appropriate goals,
and we spent a long time talking

7
00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.592
about improving your actual
web performance metric.

8
00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:23.794
Some very like concrete
tactics to look at and

9
00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:28.355
improve each of your performance
metrics and make them better.

10
00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:32.082
Along the way we also looked at
waterfall charts, flame charts,

11
00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.412
some statistics, a bunch of stuff.

12
00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:37.323
So now it's time,
just like at the end of every year,

13
00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:39.412
to conduct your performance review.

14
00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:40.959
We're gonna go through that.

15
00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.044
All right, a couple of key points
that I just want to underline and

16
00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.369
make sure you walk away with.

17
00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.509
Why is web performance important?

18
00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:53.127
There's three main things that make web
performance important to you, to me,

19
00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:55.019
to businesses all over the world.

20
00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.959
One, user experience.

21
00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.735
Making sure the user has
the right expectation and

22
00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:03.275
that expectation is met about
what your website does.

23
00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:07.678
Second, SEO, if you're publicly facing,
if you care about page rank, you gotta be

24
00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:12.165
fast to get onto that first page and make
sure your site gets the traffic it needs.

25
00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:14.368
And third,
if you're doing online advertising,

26
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:17.546
you're really just pissing money away
if you don't keep your site fast,

27
00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:20.277
your bounce rate skyrockets,
people don't stay on the page.

28
00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:23.562
You're paying money for
clicks that don't last.

29
00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:25.492
Some notes about user expectations.

30
00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:29.898
40% of users abandon a site if it's not
visibly ready in three seconds, and

31
00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:33.917
75% of them just won't come back
if they feel the site is slow.

32
00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:39.324
These are general expectations
of users on the web in 2024.

33
00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:42.174
And so if we don't hit something
like these expectations,

34
00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:46.172
you're gonna lose a lot of traffic, you're
gonna lose a lot of return customers.

35
00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:51.147
SEO, this was a big thing that has
happened in the last couple of years.

36
00:01:51.147 --> 00:01:55.429
The core web vitals specifically
are part of the page experience metrics

37
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.357
which directly impact
your page rank score.

38
00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:02.380
If you wanna be on the first page
of Google, you gotta be fast.

39
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.020
What are those core web vitals?

40
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.040
We've talked about them a lot.

41
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.304
The largest contentful paint,
the cumulative layout shift and

42
00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:09.870
interaction to next paint.

43
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.599
If you care about SEO,
you need to know what your scores are for

44
00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.833
these three things from real users.

45
00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:21.219
LCP, how fast your site visibly
loads the most important element.

46
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.210
It's to be faster than 2.5 seconds.

47
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.936
It's cumulative layout shift,
how smooth and

48
00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:29.329
predictably elements load on your page.

49
00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.082
There needs to be less than point one
shifts over the course of the page load.

50
00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:36.998
And finally,
interaction to next paint, INP,

51
00:02:36.998 --> 00:02:40.639
how well users can interact
with your site, how fast feels.

52
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.434
Is to be less than 200 milliseconds.

53
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:49.084
Now, these are targets that Google has
set for these three metrics for SEO.

54
00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:53.667
But your speed targets might be different
if you care about intranet sites or

55
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.244
if you care about other metrics.

56
00:02:56.244 --> 00:02:58.835
So how deciding how
fast is fast enough for

57
00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:03.668
you comes down to who your users are and
what you're trying to do.

58
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:06.925
When you look at your data, you need
to make sure that the data that you're

59
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:08.988
looking at for
performance is the right data.

60
00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:13.267
If you're looking at lab data from
lighthouse, page speed insights,

61
00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:18.378
webpage tests, those sort of tools,
that is lab data and it's diagnostic.

62
00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:21.546
You are going in and you need to assume
that there's already something that you

63
00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:23.305
were looking at and trying to fix.

64
00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:27.865
Because just because any one of those
tools tell you your site is fast does not

65
00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:28.945
mean it's fast.

66
00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:32.495
If those things tell you it's slow,
it probably means it's slow, but

67
00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:33.685
not for sure.

68
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:34.885
How do you know that for sure?

69
00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:36.565
You look at field data.

70
00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:39.575
Field data is the real
experience of your users.

71
00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:43.260
Field data comes from Crux,
the Chrome user experience report,

72
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.347
which is publicly available for
publicly crawlable internet sites, or

73
00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:51.568
it comes from RUM tools, real user
data tools, real user monitoring tools

74
00:03:51.568 --> 00:03:56.267
that allow you to capture that real
user experience from your users.

75
00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:59.724
When you're looking at data and you're
trying to decide what things to measure,

76
00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:01.828
you always got follow your
business metrics, and

77
00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:04.524
this is the golden thing
that you're looking for.

78
00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:07.877
Which of your performance measurements
can you create a correlation with

79
00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:09.354
a business metric?

80
00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:13.481
If you can create these correlations,
this gives you the incentive and

81
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.734
the direct reason to spend
money fixing these things.

82
00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:20.139
If you can improve CLS,
you get longer session time.

83
00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.423
If you Improve LCP,
you get less bounce rate.

84
00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:25.763
Figure out what these things are for you.

85
00:04:25.763 --> 00:04:30.193
And you figure that out by looking
at who your real users are.

86
00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:31.554
Understand what browsers they are?

87
00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:33.195
Where they're coming from in the world?

88
00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.389
What screen sizes they're on?

89
00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.073
What network connections they're on?

90
00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:40.443
All of these things to understand your
users so you can meet their expectations.

91
00:04:40.443 --> 00:04:43.283
And figure out how fast
your site needs to be.

92
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.506
When it comes down to actually
working on your site,

93
00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:48.716
always rely on that real user data.

94
00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:51.189
Don't look at lighthouse,
don't look at page speed insights.

95
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.766
And then focus on the worst metric you
have and do the easiest things first.

96
00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:58.086
You're not going to boil the ocean.

97
00:04:58.086 --> 00:05:00.117
You can't do everything,
and you don't have to.

98
00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:02.170
Sometimes your site is fast enough.

99
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.970
Work on the things that are going to
affect the things that are slowing

100
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.805
you down for your site, for your users.

101
00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:12.720
Okay, what do you do now?

102
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.498
You're done with the course.

103
00:05:13.498 --> 00:05:16.592
You just spent all fricking day
learning about web performance, and

104
00:05:16.592 --> 00:05:19.240
you feel you know everything
you need to know.

105
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.512
What do you go home and do Next?

106
00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:24.022
Well, here's the things I
think you should do next.

107
00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:28.172
One, you should totally test your project.

108
00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:32.735
So if you wanna use my speed check tool,
it's at bit.ly/speed-chex or

109
00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:36.203
at this URL, or
it's on the request metrics homepage.

110
00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:40.174
Test your project,
test your publicly available stuff,

111
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:45.034
make sure you know what your real data or
your crux data is telling you and

112
00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:47.398
whether or not you need to care.

113
00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:49.308
It's a free, easy way to get started.

114
00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:54.072
If you need to dig in and you need RUM
tools, which you should totally have

115
00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:57.442
RUM tools about the products so
that you can get more real-time data and

116
00:05:57.442 --> 00:06:01.299
more actionable data about internet sites,
private sites sort of thing.

117
00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:02.699
Install a rum tool.

118
00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.029
I recommend request metrics.

119
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.889
It's awesome.

120
00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.929
It supports me.

121
00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.996
It makes the web better, and
it's not very expensive.

122
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:16.159
Coming soon, maybe spring 2025,
maybe sooner.

123
00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.639
We're going to do
an intermediary web performance.

124
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.549
If it's already available, you should
go ahead and sign up and do that next.

125
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:25.674
We're going to talk about a bunch more
advanced techniques around caching,

126
00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:29.419
around IAP issues, around JavaScript
issues, around API calling,

127
00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.829
tons of other cool stuff.

128
00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.416
And last, you should tag me and
tell me the stuff you learned and

129
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.459
how fast you made your website.

130
00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:43.131
All of my information is up on this if you
go to bit.ly/sup-todd, you'll get a little

131
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:48.402
contact page for me with my socials,
links to my projects, that sort of stuff.

132
00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:50.382
Some links to schedule time with me.

133
00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:51.602
Tag me on LinkedIn.

134
00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:52.922
Tell me what you learned.

135
00:06:52.922 --> 00:06:54.792
Tell me, like what kinds of stuff you did.

136
00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.542
That would be awesome.

137
00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:59.702
This was fundamentals of web performance.

138
00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:00.507
Thank you so much.

139
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:05.098
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
