00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.852
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So,
who gets to decide what is fast enough?

2
00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:08.190
And the short answer is, not you.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.856
Like, you don't get to say, four
seconds is plenty fast for our website,

4
00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:13.791
we don't need to worry about it anymore.

5
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:16.770
And you just deciding what's fast enough.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.824
Because your users might
not agree with you.

7
00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:27.681
There's three people, three concepts,
that get to decide what's fast enough.

8
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:33.472
And that's user experience,
your competitors, and your SEO page rank.

9
00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:35.695
So if you look at user experience,

10
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:40.526
to understand what user experience is
telling you about web performance,

11
00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:46.050
you have to look at your business metrics,
not your web performance metrics.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.633
So what your business metrics are will
depend on your unique situation,

13
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.393
but it could be things like bounce rate,
session time,

14
00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:54.464
how frequently things are added to cart.

15
00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:58.739
How frequently a cart is abandoned,
what your conversion rate is,

16
00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.893
scroll length,
you were talking about earlier.

17
00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:03.861
It could be any number of things.

18
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.085
It's how your business measures
success of the website, and

19
00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.201
you have to look at those measurements.

20
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.717
And then you have to relate
those measurements back to your

21
00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:14.581
performance scores.

22
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.104
So for example, here on the top,

23
00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:22.980
I have some web performance scores charted
over time, my LCP and CLS and INP.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.923
And on the bottom, I have some of my
business metrics charted over time,

25
00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.287
bounce rate, and session time.

26
00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:31.800
And what I look for is,
when does this correlate?

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.337
Is there a time when something
has gotten better or worse, and

28
00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:40.091
I can see a relationship with my business?

29
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:47.531
In this case, when the CLS went up, my
session time went down, in this example.

30
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.763
Or on the right, when my LCP went up,

31
00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:54.161
when it was slow to render the largest
element, the bounce rate went up.

32
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:58.100
And these both anecdotally
feel like they make sense.

33
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.304
If my page is bouncing around while
I'm loading it, people are gonna

34
00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:06.884
get frustrated and they're gonna leave,
and cause a lower session time.

35
00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:11.564
And if it's feeling like it's taking
a long time to load, which is LCP,

36
00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.317
the bounce rate would go up.

37
00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:19.981
But this is an example, I wanna underline
the point that this isn't necessarily you,

38
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:24.170
you have to look at your metrics and
how your business metrics and

39
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.206
performance metrics relate.

40
00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:29.157
Because your users are gonna
value different things and

41
00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:31.865
be affected at different thresholds.

42
00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:36.734
I wanna call back to this data that
I referenced earlier from Cloudflare,

43
00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:40.201
that was tracking conversion rates and
load times.

44
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.066
And this is super interesting.

45
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:47.021
This is how they found a correlation in
their data between a business metric and

46
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.533
a performance metric.

47
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:53.523
But correlation for them isn't
necessarily correlation for you,

48
00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.075
and correlation is not always causation.

49
00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.138
This is my favorite graphic of all time,

50
00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:02.670
I find some way to work this into
every single presentation I ever do.

51
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.200
And it's the correlation between
the global average temperature and

52
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.065
the number of pirates in existence.

53
00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:11.607
And it's true, it is correct data, and

54
00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:14.469
there is a direct
correlation between the two.

55
00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.583
If we can stop global climate
change by resorting to piracy,

56
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.175
you would all think I'm ridiculous.

57
00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:24.974
And that's what this is trying to
point out, is that correlation and

58
00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:27.294
causation are not the same thing.

59
00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:32.861
We can learn from it, but don't take it
as a golden rule that is 100% the cause.

60
00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:36.899
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Now let's
talk about competitors,

61
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:41.329
cuz your competitors are also a source for
deciding how fast you need to be.

62
00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.262
If you are in staunch
competition with other people,

63
00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:46.936
people compare your site
versus somebody else,

64
00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:50.665
either directly or you're competing for
the same search results.

65
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.819
You're competing for rank on the same
terms, they are your competitors.

66
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.330
And for a user to notice
the difference between you and them,

67
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.526
generally, you have to be 20% faster.

68
00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:07.592
And this is based on real logic
called Weber's law, or the 20% rule.

69
00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:09.035
So here's some data.

70
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:14.035
So, the graphic on the left,
we have a number of dots in each square,

71
00:04:14.035 --> 00:04:19.927
and on the left there's 10, and
on bottom there is exactly 10 more.

72
00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:24.448
And glancing at it, you can tell
that there's more on the bottom.

73
00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:27.437
You can look at it and be like, yep,
there's definitely more on the bottom.

74
00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:34.043
But on the right, we're going from 110
to 120, which is still exactly 10 more.

75
00:04:34.043 --> 00:04:35.507
But you can't really tell.

76
00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:37.287
Like, visually,
you look at that and you're like,

77
00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.482
I don't know if there's any more.

78
00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:43.839
Because there's not enough,
there's not proportionally, enough change.

79
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:48.964
In general, it takes about 20% difference
between two things for people to

80
00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:54.105
visually notice it, for people to feel
it in performance, in any sort of way.

81
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:59.394
So if we were to take that back to
performance and our scores earlier, here

82
00:04:59.394 --> 00:05:03.796
was the scores I captured from Target and
Walmart when I was building the slides.

83
00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:06.903
They might be a little different
as of what we recorded today,

84
00:05:06.903 --> 00:05:08.290
cuz they change day to day.

85
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.283
But Target is only 4% faster than Walmart,
and

86
00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:14.860
other than the fact that they're
both a little slower, or

87
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.977
they're both in the needs improvement
category, which Google might care about.

88
00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:23.342
As far as the user concerns,
it's the same.

89
00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:27.920
User's not gonna notice 4% difference,
nobody cares.

90
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.822
Now, if I compare Target to Kmart, now,
when I ran the same test on Kmart,

91
00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:38.728
Kmart has an LCP of 5.99 seconds,
which is clearly slow.

92
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:43.293
Target is 57% faster
on LCP than kmart.com.

93
00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:46.274
And a user will notice that,
a user will feel that.

94
00:05:46.274 --> 00:05:47.980
A user will compare the two and be like,

95
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.116
I don't want to stay here
because it is too slow.

96
00:05:52.297 --> 00:05:56.396
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Now, the third thing that
gets to decide is your SEO page rank.

97
00:05:56.396 --> 00:06:00.083
And if you're not ranking number one and
you feel like you should and

98
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:04.243
your content is just as good,
your core web vitals are likely the cause.

99
00:06:04.243 --> 00:06:07.705
And you need to hit these
targets on these three metrics,

100
00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:11.616
according to Google,
to avoid any penalties of your page rank.

101
00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:17.083
And so, those are the three forces that
control how fast do you need to be.

102
00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:21.488
What do your users tell you,
what do your competitors tell you,

103
00:06:21.488 --> 00:06:23.376
and what does SEO tell you?

104
00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:28.992
Use those to inform you on how fast
you need to be for your website.
