00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: The first metric in
the sequence is Time to First Byte.

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.430
If Time to First Byte is slow,
how do we make that faster?

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.554
So remember, Time to First Byte is how
quickly your host responds to the request,

4
00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:17.000
and Time to First Byte
doesn't exist in isolation.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.471
Time to First Byte is part of FCP,
which is part of LCP.

6
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:25.243
So even if you're trying to make LCP
faster, even if that's your ultimate goal,

7
00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:30.223
if your TTFB, if your Time to First Byte
is slow, that's a big contributing factor,

8
00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:33.681
and it's gonna make everything
else faster along the way,

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.782
which is why we're starting here.

10
00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:44.033
So let's figure out where we are at
right now with Time to First Byte.

11
00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.750
So I'm going to go to,

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.761
I have deployed devstickers to this URL.

13
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:56.480
I've put it in Amsterdam because
we're in Minneapolis right now and

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.562
I want to make sure that we see
real geographic network lag.

15
00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:04.465
So I've put this on a DigitalOcean
box in Amsterdam, and

16
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:08.059
it's at eu.devstickers.shop on port 3000.

17
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:12.521
Oop, and we'll just go out there,
turn on Chrome Throttling, and

18
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:15.730
check the performance
profile of what we get.

19
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.922
So I've gone to eu.devstickers.shop,
port 3000.

20
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:24.508
And In my Chrome tools,
I'm gonna go into Network, and

21
00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:30.070
I'm going to set my network throttling
to the USA Coffee Shop WiFi,

22
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.949
which, as you might recall,
is set to 10 megabits down,

23
00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.090
4 megabits up, 50 milliseconds.

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.614
Which is slightly faster
than the global average

25
00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:46.483
mobile connection, but not a whole lot.

26
00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:49.053
All right, so
we're on eu.devstickers.shop.

27
00:01:49.053 --> 00:01:52.354
We have the USA Coffee Shop WiFi,
we have a six second slowdown.

28
00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:58.515
And now we're gonna hit the little Recycle
button and it's going to reload this page.

29
00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:03.255
And it's gonna generate a full trace
of how exactly things are right now.

30
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.140
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Which is quite slow.

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.760
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Loading profile,
great, perfect.

32
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.897
So here's what we got for this load.

33
00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:37.889
Now, this load goes from zero time
origin all the way to about 24 seconds,

34
00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.180
it's everything that
needed to happen in place.

35
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.864
Now, we can also always
reference back to this,

36
00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:48.380
because all these performance profiles
are kept over the life cycle of Chrome, so

37
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.796
you can reference back to things and
see how things are going.

38
00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:57.082
Now, where we're at right now is that all
of the metrics kinda stack up right here,

39
00:02:57.082 --> 00:03:01.553
we can see that there's this Timings
row in the performance profile.

40
00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:06.228
And so here's where we're gonna look at,
FCP, LCP,

41
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.389
First Paint, those sort of things.

42
00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.426
But the Time to First Byte is
gonna happen sometime way,

43
00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:20.960
way back here,
way back here while it was loading.

44
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.031
Somewhere around 1.9 seconds,
is what I would look at from here.

45
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:30.287
Now, for some reason, it chooses
not to show it here all the time,

46
00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:34.543
but thankfully, we have our web
vitals extension installed, and

47
00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:38.428
so it also dumped all that
information out into the console.

48
00:03:38.428 --> 00:03:44.396
So here I see that our Time to First Byte
was 1.775 seconds, which is pretty bad.

49
00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:46.731
But I mean, not entirely surprising,

50
00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:51.547
given a totally unoptimized site hosted
in Amsterdam that we're accessing from

51
00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:54.619
Minneapolis with all of
these slowdowns in place.

52
00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:58.958
So that's where we're starting
with our baseline before we start

53
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.438
improving anything.

54
00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:04.798
So let's start figuring out some
things that we can make better.

55
00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:07.408
So do you need to worry about this?

56
00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:13.251
Check your RUM data or
your CrUX data for what your p75 is.

57
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:16.061
Here's your Google targets for
what this thing should be.

58
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.131
Maybe you should be faster than this,
depending on what your users want.

59
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:21.252
Most likely you shouldn't
be worse than this,

60
00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:24.018
unless you're a private site
that holds your users hostage.
