00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:02.820
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Let's talk about
the second reason why web performance is

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.418
important, that's
SEO Search Engine Optimization.

3
00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:10.244
How well you're able to help search
engines understand and rank your content.

4
00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:14.985
If you're building a site that's publicly
facing, you care about this a lot,

5
00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.763
you care about this because you live and
die based on page rank.

6
00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:24.011
Probably when the user goes to Google or
whatever and searches for your website,

7
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:28.651
your key terms, the things that you
wanna rank for, you wanna be here.

8
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:33.922
You want to be in that number one spot or
as close to it as you can.

9
00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:37.112
Because if you're not in
that number one spot,

10
00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:41.431
the traffic that you can expect
to get drops off significantly.

11
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:45.630
According to Backlink.io,
here is the traffic counts or

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.498
click through rates by position and
search results.

13
00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:51.767
And look at that number one,
look at that number one.

14
00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:57.069
That number one result can
get 75 million clicks on high

15
00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:02.376
volume words, and
drops off significantly after that.

16
00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:06.092
The number two ranking is
like 10% of number one,

17
00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:09.723
the number three ranking
is half of number two, and

18
00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:14.801
it drops off really really fast
anything time we get greater than 10.

19
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:19.194
So, if you can't get up to those top one,
two, three positions,

20
00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:22.107
you're gonna get very, very low traffic.

21
00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:26.007
So great, you might be like, this isn't
a course on SEO, and you're right,

22
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:27.317
it's not a course on SEO.

23
00:01:27.317 --> 00:01:30.411
What the hell does this have
to do with web performance?

24
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:35.211
Well, as of 2020,
Google made some important changes

25
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:39.147
that they announced on
the Search Central blog.

26
00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:44.443
Search ranking this upcoming cert, or
this change that happened in 2020,

27
00:01:44.443 --> 00:01:49.039
search ranking change that
incorporates page experience metrics.

28
00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.782
They introduced a new signal that
combines the core web vitals,

29
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:57.080
which are an important measurement
of performance that we're gonna talk

30
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.857
about a lot.

31
00:01:57.857 --> 00:02:01.702
They combine core Web Vitals with
their other existing signals.

32
00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:08.376
So, as of 2020 the performance scores
of your page are a ranking signal.

33
00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:13.290
You need to be fast to rank well,
if you wanna get to that number one spot,

34
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.046
if you're competing for a term like
developer stickers or whatever,

35
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:21.374
you need to be fast to get
to that number one spot.

36
00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:25.587
Or somebody else who has a good site,
a site almost as good as yours, but

37
00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:30.100
faster will beat you out and the traffic
wins that they'll get will be huge.

38
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.137
Now, there's data to back this up,
so here are LCP and

39
00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:36.572
CLS are two of the metrics in
the core web vitals don't worry,

40
00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:40.952
you don't need to know what they mean yet,
we're gonna talk about them a lot.

41
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.758
Along the bottom is the rank for
common keywords, so

42
00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:48.578
the rank of the site and
then what their scores were.

43
00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:53.492
And notice how much faster
the number one spot is,

44
00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:56.771
the number one rank here is fast.

45
00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:01.966
Now, it goes up from there, there's
this weird thing that happens around

46
00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:07.416
the end of the first page at like position
six for LCP and position nine for CLS.

47
00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:10.833
Where like the site gets faster and
then it goes up again, and

48
00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:14.129
that has to do because this is
not the only ranking signal.

49
00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.220
It also depends on like
how good your content is,

50
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.286
and how many people link to you and
all the other things that go into SEO.

51
00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:24.426
And so, if we assume that the top five
pages are all probably equally good in

52
00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:29.405
terms of their backlinks and their
content and the meaningfulness of how

53
00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:34.396
good of a site they are, but the first
one is faster, the first one wins.

54
00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:39.016
So, you need to be fast if you wanna
get to that number one position and

55
00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:43.333
there's huge benefits in terms
of traffic if you can get there.

56
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.850
So, the third reason that's really, really
important for web performance is if you do

57
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.138
online advertising, and not everybody
does, this might not be important to you.

58
00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:56.103
But online advertising is probably
going to be super important for

59
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.585
an e-commerce store or
anybody that It sells something.

60
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.869
So, when I say online advertising,
maybe you think of this,

61
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:07.052
you landed on some blog, some developer
productivity site, some whatever.

62
00:04:07.052 --> 00:04:10.964
And you went to a website because
they have good content, and instead,

63
00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:13.255
there's ads smeared all over the place.

64
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:17.750
Like here's some display ads that I
made for developer stickers online and

65
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.474
I'm covering so much of the page with ads,
and you know what?

66
00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.643
Sometimes that's how the internet is,

67
00:04:23.643 --> 00:04:26.912
we're not here to debate
the merits of online advertising.

68
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:29.513
But performance is a big aspect of this,
and

69
00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:34.311
I'm talking from the point of view of the
person who wants to do the advertising.

70
00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:38.967
Let's say I wanna buy an advertising
campaign for developers stickers online.

71
00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:43.353
I make this really compelling
ad that I want you to buy this,

72
00:04:43.353 --> 00:04:49.604
this sticker of a sloth on a rocket,
snd so I spend $1,000 buying display ads.

73
00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:56.735
Now for a consumer business, that'll buy
me roughly 160,000 impressions, right?

74
00:04:56.735 --> 00:05:00.029
You don't really need to know a lot
about online advertising for this but

75
00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.379
this is just some rough data.

76
00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.365
Now for a 160,000 impressions,
that's gonna get me

77
00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:09.833
about 1% of them will click on that ad and
try and buy that sticker.

78
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:14.719
So, if I have that website that I
bought a $1,000, 1600 users, but

79
00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.603
my website tends to bounce 60% of the
time, which means the user comes in and

80
00:05:19.603 --> 00:05:23.400
then because they're frustrated,
they leave right away.

81
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.966
They don't interact, they might not
even wait for it to finish loading,

82
00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.105
they don't like the site, they're gone.

83
00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:32.524
That means that at a 60% bounce rate,

84
00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:38.272
I get 640 real shoppers,
I paid 56 to get somebody on my store.

85
00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:43.982
But 960 of them are just gone
because of bad user experience,

86
00:05:43.982 --> 00:05:48.012
so how does this relate
back to performance?

87
00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:54.197
Well, bounce rate and performance are
directly related for a lot of websites.

88
00:05:54.197 --> 00:06:00.152
In one particular case study by an online
called Fernspace that sells furniture,

89
00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:04.985
they saw that with a 65% improvement
in their web performance,

90
00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:11.134
they reduced their bounce rate by 20% and
increased the time on page by 200%.

91
00:06:11.134 --> 00:06:18.412
So, by improving performance, they got
users to not leave and stay longer.

92
00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:23.029
Now, if we could apply the same sort of
improvement to our developer stickers

93
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:28.369
online site, I'm still gonna spend
$1,000 I'm still gonna get 1600 users.

94
00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:33.890
That's just kind of general online
effectiveness for this example,

95
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.300
but I lower my bounce rate
20% to 48% bounce rate.

96
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.857
That means I'm now gonna get 832 shoppers,
that's a net of 192 new

97
00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:47.581
shoppers that would have come in that
wouldn't have been there otherwise.

98
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:54.098
And I lowered my price from $1.56
per shopper to $1.20 per shopper.

99
00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:58.824
So, I can save a lot of money
in online advertising spend if

100
00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:02.208
I'm able to improve my web performance.

101
00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:07.018
Now overall, we're talking about revenue,
we're talking about dollars.

102
00:07:07.018 --> 00:07:11.421
Because if we wanna get something done,
if we wanna invest in development work or

103
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:16.103
web performance work, we need to make sure
that there's revenue behind it to tie up.

104
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:20.781
So, there's lots and lots of examples
on the web of how performance

105
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:24.409
ties to revenue,
here's an example from Walmart.

106
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:28.266
Obviously, Walmart,
huge site, huge fan base,

107
00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:32.938
huge traffic, but we can apply
some of the lessons back to us.

108
00:07:32.938 --> 00:07:35.999
Now, Walmart did a big
performance improvement,

109
00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.857
a big set of performance work.

110
00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:42.951
And what they found is that 100
millisecond improvement in terms of

111
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.976
load time resulted in a 1%
incremental revenue for walmart.com.

112
00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:53.718
If they could speed up things by 100
milliseconds, so barely perceptible,

113
00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:58.360
but it caused enough people to
not abandon what they were doing.

114
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.081
To not have the attention span of
a goldfish and not buy that Spatula that

115
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:08.128
they wanted to buy online or whatever,
they saw 1% incremental revenue.

116
00:08:08.128 --> 00:08:14.568
Now, Walmart makes $665
billion dollars a year,

117
00:08:14.568 --> 00:08:20.449
1% incremental revenue
is 6 billion dollars,

118
00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:24.662
it makes $6 billion by that 1%.

119
00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:29.533
Now that's a scale that many of
us are not operating at, but

120
00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:33.147
we can apply some lessons
back to our sites.

121
00:08:33.147 --> 00:08:38.408
Now here's another example, Skill.co is an
online job board, and what they found was

122
00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:43.258
that there was this direct relationship
between load time and conversion rate.

123
00:08:43.258 --> 00:08:47.722
A conversion for them would be like a job
is successfully posted on their site, or

124
00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:49.311
somebody applies for a job.

125
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:55.279
And at 2.4 seconds,
they saw a 1.9% conversion rate,

126
00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:02.183
if that fell to 3.3 seconds,
the conversion rate fell to 1.5%.

127
00:09:02.183 --> 00:09:08.080
If we get 5 seconds or lower, it's less
than 0.6%, so the longer this goes,

128
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.648
the worse the conversion rate got, and
the less revenue that they would get.

129
00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:18.763
There are so many examples of this,
there's a site online called WPO stats,

130
00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:21.215
which is really cool to go and visit.

131
00:09:21.215 --> 00:09:25.247
You can kind of sort case studies
by what metric they're improving or

132
00:09:25.247 --> 00:09:27.552
what business result they were after.

133
00:09:27.552 --> 00:09:32.130
And there's just so many examples of how
different businesses have correlated

134
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.037
improvements in performance back
to their core business metrics.

135
00:09:36.037 --> 00:09:39.665
And we can use this data
to justify whether or

136
00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.501
not we need to spend
money on web performance.

137
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:47.689
Now, whether or not you need to spend
money on web performance and whether or

138
00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:51.106
not it affects your business
metrics is a complicated topic.

139
00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:55.359
And we're gonna talk about that a lot
later in the workshop around setting

140
00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:57.357
appropriate goals for your site.
