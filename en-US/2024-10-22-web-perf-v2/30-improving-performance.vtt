00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.590
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: We're gonna talk
about a lot of stuff in here.

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.690
We're gonna talk about
improving web performance.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.340
We're gonna go through each of
the metrics that we talked about.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.063
And we're gonna assume that you've done
some work to figure out what are your

5
00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.140
performance goals?

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.871
What are appropriate goals for your site,
for your users, for your industry, for

7
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:19.500
your competitors?

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.483
And what are some tactics that you can
use to improve your key metrics to be

9
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.293
where you need them to be?

10
00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.253
That's what we're gonna talk about next.

11
00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:32.048
This is the part that we're
gonna start getting actionable.

12
00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.060
So improving web performance.

13
00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:38.433
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: A couple of notes on how
you think about this, how you do this.

14
00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:46.292
Focus on the easiest fixes for your worst
metrics first, from your real user data.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.480
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: This is just like project
planning, like work planning here.

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.941
So if you're not basing
this off of real user data,

17
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.300
you don't really know
what you're working on.

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.378
If you're basing this off
of a lighthouse score,

19
00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:00.052
you don't know that that's real you.

20
00:01:00.052 --> 00:01:05.023
You don't know what that lighthouse score
was represents reality or the real users.

21
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:10.242
So base it off of real data from Crux or
from your ram tool.

22
00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:15.202
And then look at whichever metric that's
interesting to you is the worst one.

23
00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:19.041
Because if you're just starting,
there might be more than one that's bad,

24
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.233
focus on the worst one.

25
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:24.369
And then do the easiest thing for
your structure first,

26
00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.542
because you don't need to do everything.

27
00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:29.844
I know a lot of people,
I'm a perfectionist,

28
00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.267
I would want to do everything,
I wanna take every single box about web

29
00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:36.764
performance to make sure my site is
the fastest thing it could ever be.

30
00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:40.786
But you don't need to do that,
sometimes it's fast enough.

31
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.612
And I'll that's probably heresy for
a web performance person to say,

32
00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:47.696
but you don't need to do everything.

33
00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:52.618
If all your stuff is green and
you've never put your stuff behind a CDN,

34
00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:56.409
maybe you don't need a CDN,
maybe, you just don't.

35
00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.409
We'll base what you do off of your data,
your metrics.

36
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.909
The secret thing that I like to think
about when I'm trying to figure out

37
00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.187
what do I need to do?

38
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:11.226
Generally, when we're talking about
computers, things are operating at

39
00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:14.771
the speed of light and you can't
make the speed of light go faster.

40
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:19.891
So all you can really do is find a way to
do fewer things, between when the user

41
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.771
starts and when that metric happens,
find a way to do fewer things.

42
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:27.479
And sometimes that means putting
fewer things on the page,

43
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.031
sometimes it means making
those things less bytes.

44
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:33.761
Sometimes that means caching things
in various places along the way.

45
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:37.501
But generally, the only way to make things
faster is to do fewer things in between

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.484
the two things you're trying to measure.

47
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.962
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: We got a lot here, we're
gonna go through each one of these and

48
00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.089
we're gonna talk about specific tactics.

49
00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.035
And some of them have a lot of
things you can do, and some of them,

50
00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.830
there's really only one thing you can do.

51
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.602
But we're gonna break
this down individually so

52
00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:58.129
that this is a really great index for
you to come back to later.

53
00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.843
And find hey, it's this section on
this course, it talks all about this.

54
00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:05.882
We're trying to fix FCP, come back and
watch this section of this course.
