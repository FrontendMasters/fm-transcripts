00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.641
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: The other metric that I
think is really important to talk about

2
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.620
is FCP, the First Contentful Paint.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.130
So this is just like largest,
but first, what's the first one?

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.420
What's the first time we've
shown the user something?

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.110
The first time the browser window
switches from white to something.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.411
Something has happened, we have given
the user an indication that the request,

7
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.383
the thing that they did,
the link that they clicked on,

8
00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:30.619
is going to load, that they're not gonna
end up with the Chrome dinosaur game,

9
00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.503
that something is going to happen,
that is what we're measuring here.

10
00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:40.471
So if we throw all of these things kind
of together onto the same film stream.

11
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:45.847
So the user first clicks on something and
there's this big white page,

12
00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:50.443
the page is loading, network requests are
happening, maybe redirects are happening,

13
00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:51.831
all kinds of stuff.

14
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.351
The first thing that happens is TTFB,

15
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:59.312
the first thing that will happen in all
of these events will always be TTFB,

16
00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:04.770
it's the first thing we got the first
byte of data back from the host.

17
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.940
Then stuff will happen, generally,
we're gonna hit DOMContentLoaded.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.035
Not all the time, but generally,
we're gonna hit DOM content loaded next,

19
00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:17.260
because we're gonna need the document
in place before we can start rendering.

20
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.852
Then the first thing that first
render that happens will be FCP,

21
00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:24.437
it's the first render that's,
by definition,

22
00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:29.108
the first time the background changes,
text element appears, something.

23
00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:36.138
Then sometime after that, LCP appears, and
then, in my case, load happens after this.

24
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:40.571
But if you remember from our talk about
legacy metrics, load can be anywhere.

25
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:44.465
Load could have happened right up
back there at DOMContentLoaded,

26
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.660
load could have happened before FCP.

27
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.746
If you have an entirely client-side
rendered architecture where the load event

28
00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:56.981
and the DOMContentLoaded event aren't
necessarily tied to the vitals in any way,

29
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.955
I'm including them here for completeness.

30
00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:03.749
As an example of where we would
expect them to show up for

31
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.726
the architecture of dev stickers online.

32
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:17.878
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: FCP, so just like all,
again, this is not a core web vital,

33
00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:20.357
this is not SEO impacting.

34
00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:24.897
But Google does recommend that
this is 1.8 seconds or less.

35
00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:28.227
So we had 800 milliseconds to
get to time to first byte.

36
00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.222
That means we have one second,

37
00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:34.444
one second from time to first byte
to the First Contentful Paint,

38
00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:39.585
one second to parse the HTML, figure out
what the heck we're gonna do with it and

39
00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:43.080
render something is what
Google's telling us to do.

40
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.788
And these are directly related.

41
00:02:45.788 --> 00:02:48.968
These three metrics are tied together.

42
00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:52.828
So here it is in a flame chart.

43
00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:57.879
The time of LCP will always be
larger than the time of FCP, and

44
00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.242
the time of FCP will always be
larger than the time to first byte.

45
00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:08.294
Now, if you have [LAUGH] a very simple
document, these could all be the same,

46
00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:11.868
they could all fire at almost exactly
the same time if you have a super

47
00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:13.882
trivial document.

48
00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:17.772
Generally, time to first byte
to FCP will have some gap.

49
00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:22.271
FCP and LCP happening at the same time,
also a very common occurrence, especially

50
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:26.511
in small websites, what yours are will
depend on how your site is structured,

51
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:30.842
how you have things put together, and
the time for resources to come together.
