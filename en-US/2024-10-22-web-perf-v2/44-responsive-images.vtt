&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Now we can
do this with plain old HTML,

2
00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:07.230
we don't need any JavaScript,
we don't need any CSS for this.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.960
This is just natively supported in
the platform as a responsive image.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.370
There's a lot going on in here don't
worry we're gonna break this down.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.290
There are three different
things happening here.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.920
So I created a picture,
the picture element supports

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.772
some special properties inside that
picture we defined at the bottom.

8
00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:33.090
Let's start at the bottom,
at the bottom, there is the image,

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.650
that is the same image that we
already had, so herodesktop.PNG.

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.573
And just for this example,
I just added a width property to say,

11
00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:47.501
here's how wide this thing could be.

12
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.365
So hero image at 2800 pixels,

13
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:56.226
it's out of fetch priority high,
this will be the default image.

14
00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:59.326
If the browser doesn't know what to do,
this is what it's gonna get.

15
00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:04.505
But we also can supply the source
element inside of a picture,

16
00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:09.683
and this lets us specify some
like pseudo CSS media queries and

17
00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:13.105
specify some different images.

18
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:20.070
So for mobile which we define as anything
with a max width of less than 720 pixel.

19
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.615
So if it's 720 pixels or narrower,
we say this is mobile, so go ahead and

20
00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:27.100
get the hero mobile image.

21
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.056
And then we use the source set attribute
to specify rules, these rules,

22
00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:35.158
let us say, for this width,
get this image.

23
00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:40.875
For this width, get this image, we can
specify however many of those we want.

24
00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:44.441
Now the browser is gonna figure it out,
it's gonna make its own decision about,

25
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:46.775
hey, how wide am I about
to display this thing?

26
00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:53.485
What is the largest image that I
can get for this space that I have.

27
00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:59.821
So for example, if it says, hey,
I have a space that is 701 pixels wide,

28
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:06.166
it's gonna say, it's wider than this one,
it's wider than 360.

29
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:12.306
So it's gonna go up to the next one.It's
not as big as 720, I'm gonna get this one.

30
00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:14.976
And it fetches that image and
places it in there.

31
00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:19.559
It allows us to precisely say,
at these screen sizes, use this image.

32
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.626
Now we can specify totally different
images by just using multiple sources.

33
00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:30.401
So here any width greater than 721,
pixels,

34
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:33.315
we'll use the hero desktop.

35
00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:37.129
And we did the same thing where we
specified at this width, anything less

36
00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.709
than this width with, I guess this
is like kind of a redundant rule.

37
00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.203
There'll never be something less than
720 width on desktop by definition,

38
00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:48.833
so that first line is kind of useless.

39
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:50.206
[LAUGH] But the second and

40
00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:55.082
third line take effect where I'll decide
between 1440 and 2800 which image

41
00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:59.283
to show based on how big the screen
is that we're actually gonna show it.

42
00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:05.012
Now, you don't need to take my word for
it here, we're gonna do some stuff.

43
00:03:05.012 --> 00:03:09.213
We're gonna do some image optimization
with some real scripts and and

44
00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:11.999
replace some stuff, so, let's do that now.
