1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.487
And this is where we need to talk
about statistics a little bit.

2
00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:06.600
Again, don't be worried.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.252
This isn't going to be
like a crazy math class.

4
00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:12.566
We're just going to talk a little
bit about a few concepts.

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.514
First, average.

6
00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:19.374
Average is the the go-to tool that
most people will use when they want to

7
00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:20.843
look at a lot of data.

8
00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.382
So I have this huge set of data and
I'll just take the average of it and

9
00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:23.972
I'll be good.

10
00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:28.503
But there's huge problems with thinking
about performance in terms of averages and

11
00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:30.625
that's what we're gonna talk about.

12
00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.473
So let's say we have an average
performance score of 80.

13
00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:38.637
Now that could mean
a couple different things.

14
00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:42.251
It could mean this averages out to 80.

15
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:46.069
We have three people that get a 99,
three people to get a 90,

16
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:49.700
three people that get a 70 and
three people that get a 60.

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.122
What does 80 mean here?

18
00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:55.981
Is that we have half the people
have a really great score, and

19
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.331
half the people have a really crap score.

20
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.753
Nobody got an 80.

21
00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:07.565
Like there's no 80,
there's nobody's having an okay time,

22
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:10.720
everybody either loves it or they hate it.

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.052
Now it could mean other things too,

24
00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:18.337
it could mean almost everybody had a great
score we have a whole bunch of '90s,

25
00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:23.100
a whole bunch of 85, so whole bunch
of like really acceptable scores.

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.191
But 10% of the people are so
bad that like they would

27
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:33.185
complain online about how bad and
slow your site is.

28
00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:41.135
This is also 80, so 80 averages
hide a bunch of interesting data.

29
00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.694
They hide like what
the overall picture looks like.

30
00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:47.820
So generally,
when we look at web performance data,

31
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.701
we don't talk about averages.

32
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.357
We talk about something else.

33
00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.752
We talk about percentiles.

34
00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:55.410
What the hell is a percentile?

35
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.346
Well, let's break that down.

36
00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:04.403
A percentile is if we take all
of the data, let's say we have

37
00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:09.274
11 scores here,
ranging from 0 to 100 every 10.

38
00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:15.014
Just for simple math, the 50th percentile
is if we arrange them in order,

39
00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.718
what score is the halfway point at?

40
00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:23.635
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So we have halfway
through the 50th percentile is 50.

41
00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:28.403
Now another way of saying this
would be p50 that's percentile 50.

42
00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:34.505
You could also call this the median,
is the same word for the 50th percentile.

43
00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.126
The 50th percentile, that's interesting,

44
00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:37.792
now we're using that to
illustrate the concept.

45
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:41.391
But generally in performance,
we don't care about the 50th percentile.

46
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.404
We care about some other scores.

47
00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:50.548
We care about the 75th percentile and the
95th percentile and the 99th percentile.

48
00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:54.904
We care about these because
these represent the 75th is what

49
00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:57.592
do the majority of users experience?

50
00:02:57.592 --> 00:03:01.909
What's the worst score that
the majority of users experience?

51
00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.794
The p75 is in fact what Google's
using in their Core Web Vital

52
00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.311
reporting to decide what's your one score.

53
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.542
It looks at the 75th percentile.

54
00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:19.522
So the 75th percent worst score
is that one score roll up.

55
00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:25.232
Now for your own perspectives, it's also
interesting to know what your 95th or

56
00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:31.624
99th are, because it's a representation of
the worst scores, the worst performance.

57
00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:33.258
Now, some of you might be asking, well,

58
00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:35.288
why don't you just take
the 100th percentile?

59
00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:37.959
Why don't you take
the literal worst score?

60
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.671
And that's generally
because of garbage data.

61
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:45.198
The web is a weird place if you collect
everybody's like load time over

62
00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:47.577
a couple of 1,000 data points,

63
00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:52.889
the worst score will be like this one took
three years to load, which isn't real.

64
00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.381
It didn't really happen, but
you'll get garbage data, and so

65
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.238
you generally wanna kind
of throw a little bit away.

66
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:04.068
That's the same reason why I have both
the 95th and the 99th here is depending on

67
00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:08.903
how much data you have, you might want to
throw away a slightly larger percentage.

68
00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:13.987
If you only get 10,000 hits a month,
or 50,000 hits a month,

69
00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:18.579
you might wanna look at the 95th
because the 99th might still be

70
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.179
a little weird in terms of like
the amount of data that you capture.

71
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.227
So let's look at how
these percentiles change.

72
00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:29.925
So this is like an even distribution
of data we had, one person with a 0,

73
00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:33.249
one person with 10,
one person with 20, etc.

74
00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.407
Let's look at like
a different set of scores.

75
00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:42.925
So in this case,
the p50 was 50, the p75 was 75,

76
00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:47.173
the p95 is 95,
it's really easy to think about.

77
00:04:47.173 --> 00:04:50.698
The average for comparison is also 50 in

78
00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:55.038
this example with this
very normal distribution.

79
00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.445
So, let's look at a not
normal distribution.

80
00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:02.661
So, here's a distribution of scores
that's much closer to a set of data

81
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:08.318
that we might get from web performance
where it ranges in a much narrower zone.

82
00:05:08.318 --> 00:05:15.851
The worst people are getting 79,
80s, stuff like that.

83
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.163
[LAUGH] The best users
are getting like 79, 80s.

84
00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:23.874
The worst users got 256 and
there's a range there.

85
00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:26.539
Now notice between these distributions,

86
00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.654
the percentiles didn't
change where they were.

87
00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:33.719
It always represents
the median user experience,

88
00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.028
the majority worst user experience, and

89
00:05:37.028 --> 00:05:41.958
the very worst user experience but
the average shifted a lot.

90
00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:47.806
The average in this case was thrown off by
that garbage data at the end, we got this

91
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:53.489
weird one off person that had a really
bad score, and it threw off our average.

92
00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:57.237
So we have to think about these
percentiles and what they mean when we

93
00:05:57.237 --> 00:06:02.237
interpret larger data sets, we're looking
at real data that has hundreds, thousands,

94
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.696
tens of thousands millions of data points.

95
00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:11.399
And we interpret them by looking
at the 75th or 95th percentile for

96
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.631
representing the majority of user and
the worst user.

97
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:21.167
So let's translate this back
to lab data and field data.

98
00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:22.779
When we're thinking about lab data.

99
00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.673
Lab data is easier to capture.

100
00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:30.292
We open up our browser,
we visit the site, we run a report.

101
00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:32.475
We got a data point, it's easy.

102
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.916
But field data is more accurate.

103
00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:39.841
There's a lot of data points, but
it represents the real experiences

104
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:44.858
from the people who visit your site or
if we were to translate that down.

105
00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:48.146
Lab data is a diagnostic.

106
00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:50.796
Field data is experience.

107
00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:55.216
We generate a piece of lab data as
a diagnostic to understand how did my site

108
00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:56.440
perform right now?

109
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.352
And are there opportunities
I could use to improve it?

110
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.550
But field data is the real
experience from people.

111
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.412
So it's It's important
on when to use each.

112
00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:09.949
If you're trying to
understand is my site fast,

113
00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.386
you need field data to tell you that.

114
00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:16.323
If you're trying to improve
the score of your site,

115
00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:20.215
you can use lab data to help you
understand what needs to be improved.

116
00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:24.684
The score you get in lab data
doesn't mean your site is fast.

117
00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:28.966
You can get a 100 perfect lab score and
still have a slow,

118
00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:33.861
frustrating, painful site to use
that's getting SEO penalized.

119
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:38.282
You can also have a lab score that
says your site is slow and crappy and

120
00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:42.798
have perfect Core Web Vitals scores,
as far as Google is concerned.

121
00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:45.554
They're not correlated It together,

122
00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:49.320
because a lab data is one
data point in this spectrum.

123
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.399
Let's talk about how we interpret this.

124
00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:56.258
So when we're talking about lab data and
how to do it.

125
00:07:56.258 --> 00:08:00.581
What's really important is how
you gather that lab data, and

126
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.742
cuz you need to simulate
something that looks

127
00:08:03.742 --> 00:08:08.083
a little bit closer to reality
than what your workstation is.

128
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:12.223
You need to think about, are you going
to simulate as mobile or desktop.

129
00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:15.087
Who are you trying to get
performance information from?

130
00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:19.882
What kind of network conditions does
a typical user have when they access your

131
00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:23.363
site and what's the processing
power of their device?

132
00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:26.587
Chances are they don't have
the same laptop that you do.

133
00:08:26.587 --> 00:08:29.545
They don't have the processing
power that you do, and

134
00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:33.164
they're probably not located right
next to the host like you are.
