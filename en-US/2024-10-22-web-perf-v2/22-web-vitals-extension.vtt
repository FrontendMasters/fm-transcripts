00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.870
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So
we're gonna do a bunch of demos.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.990
All right so
we're gonna turn something else on.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.082
So there's a really useful thing for

4
00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.920
performance called
the web vitals extension.

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.445
If we go out to the Chrome extension
store, it's just called web vitals, and

6
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.986
it's made by Google, it's made by
the Google performance profiling team.

7
00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:22.893
I'm gonna add this to Chrome, because it
can do a bunch of interesting things for

8
00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:26.013
us if we are diagnosed
with performance problems.

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:35.276
Okay, cool, I'm actually going to go into
here and pin this so it shows up here.

10
00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:40.065
So the metrics that show up here,
i'm gonna go into the settings here, so

11
00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.923
I clicked on here,
hit the little gear, and

12
00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:48.254
I'm gonna show turn on console logging,
and I'm gonna close that out.

13
00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:52.683
But what this is gonna do is it's gonna
show us the Core Web Vital Scores for

14
00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.194
the page that we're on.

15
00:00:55.224 --> 00:01:00.943
So for example, I'm on here,
and I reload the page.

16
00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:04.883
I'm gonna pop this to the side, and
I'm gonna pop open the console here.

17
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:09.417
I'm gonna reload the page,
as the page is loading,

18
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:14.583
when scores come in,
they pop into this little extension.

19
00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.891
It shows things live as they're happening,
and

20
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.617
then when the the page is done,
which takes a moment,

21
00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:30.645
it dumps a bunch of details about them
into the console for us to explore.

22
00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:34.130
Now we can pop this open and
we can see what these scores are,

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.605
and that's kinda cool.

24
00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.853
But the real details, especially for
us performance developers,

25
00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:41.167
is looking at this.

26
00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:45.888
And you'll notice the site is not fast,
we don't get any good scores here, but

27
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:47.307
we can drill in on this.

28
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:52.387
We can say, all right, we got a 7.29
second LCP, which Google says is poor,

29
00:01:52.387 --> 00:01:57.807
and we can drill and get information, we
can see what is the element that is LCP?

30
00:01:57.807 --> 00:02:00.814
And it confirms that,
it is this giant mobile image, and

31
00:02:00.814 --> 00:02:03.098
we can see information about it.

32
00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:07.819
We can see here are the things that
make up LCP, time to first paint, or

33
00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.838
time to first byte, LCP,
and then how long it took.

34
00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:15.402
And we can even see the whole LCP entry
that we would have gotten out of, say,

35
00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.618
attaching our own performance observer.

36
00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:19.712
We can get the same element here,
automatic,

37
00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:22.140
by just turning on
the web Vitals Extension.

38
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.060
It's super useful for
diagnosing these sorta things.

39
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.890
It automates a lot of the kinda stuff that
you would attach your own logging for, but

40
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.926
you can just turn it on and
off with an extension, and

41
00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:36.117
it gives you information
about your current session.

42
00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:39.681
I have this on a bunch,
super, super useful.

43
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:44.039
The other thing that's useful about this,
is that if we go out to a public site,

44
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.266
a real site, not local host, like this
MDN article I was on, and I reloaded,

45
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.391
it works there too.

46
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:55.753
See that's so much faster like loaded
instantly, it gives us the same

47
00:02:55.753 --> 00:03:00.772
real-time information about how this
site performed generally really fast.

48
00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:05.022
Notice it doesn't have an INP,
cause I haven't INP'd yet.

49
00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:10.682
But if I click on something,
Now I have an INP.

50
00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:15.187
But it also has a bunch of
data in the background,

51
00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:20.588
In addition to the raw scores of, this
thing loaded almost instantly from me.

52
00:03:20.588 --> 00:03:25.698
It shows that 99% of people
also have a good score,1% of

53
00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:31.838
people have an okay score, and
0% of people have a bad score.

54
00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:37.357
So this is showing us not only lab data
from me testing this right now, but

55
00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:44.635
it's showing us field data from everybody
else who's visited, developer.mozilla.org.

56
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:48.825
Where is that data coming from,
and why do I get to access it?
