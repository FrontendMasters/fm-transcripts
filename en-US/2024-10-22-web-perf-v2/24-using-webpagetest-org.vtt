00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.379
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: The last tool
that we're gonna talk about,

2
00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.570
that gets talked about a lot,
is WebPageTest, which is webpagetest.org.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.960
Now, this is not Google affiliated.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.725
This is owned by another
company called Catchpoint.

5
00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.819
But it's just so

6
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:18.440
ubiquitously used in web perf
discussions that I wanna talk about it.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.790
And it gives you a little bit
more control of how things work.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.598
It's not just PageSpeed Insights is like,
hey, run this test from somewhere and

9
00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:27.650
gimme some data.

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.490
This lets us do a little bit more.

11
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.650
So here if I test target.com,
I have some controls on what I wanna do.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.178
Like not only do I have mobile and
desktop, but

13
00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:43.528
I can choose what kind of connection and
where I want the test run from.

14
00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:46.853
So I could say, here's all the places
they have data centers from.

15
00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:49.973
I could say, hey,
run this test from Ireland.

16
00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:53.008
And maybe I don't want it from Chrome.

17
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:54.718
Maybe I want it from edge.

18
00:00:54.718 --> 00:01:00.247
Run the test on edge, and here's I
want it connected via a LTE device

19
00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:06.164
that's running that run how many
tests at this particular screen size,

20
00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:09.474
let's say 1024, by 768 start.

21
00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.274
Now, this is gonna spin up.

22
00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:16.044
We have a lot more control here,
because we're spinning up a robot in

23
00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.969
a specific place with
a specific connection string,

24
00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.351
which is some control
the PageSpeed Insights did not give us.

25
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.216
Now, this could take a little while, so

26
00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:30.189
we're gonna have to cut out my banter
here while we let this thing run,

27
00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.760
cuz the engineering behind this
is actually quite impressive.

28
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.293
I set this thing up, and now a call just
went out to a data center that's spinning

29
00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:44.032
up like a container that's running a real
browser, orchestrated with Selenium or

30
00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:48.028
something like that, that is then
gathering performance metrics and

31
00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:50.353
gonna stream the whole thing back to me.

32
00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:54.176
And they did this all for free because
I didn't pay anything for this.

33
00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.721
Any one of you could go and
do a WebPageTest thing right now.

34
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.816
The only downside is that
there's ads all over the place,

35
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:02.656
please subscribe to Catchpoint.

36
00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.153
But I mean,
unless you're a giant enterprise company,

37
00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:08.545
you're probably not gonna subscribe to
Catchpoint cuz it's a lot of money.

38
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.865
And it's depending on how many other
people are running tests right now.

39
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:16.345
So if a lot of people are doing stuff
right now, it might take just a minute.

40
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:21.157
&gt;&gt; Learner: That's running,
someone asked referred to a little earlier

41
00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:26.162
about when you enable throttling
in your browser's dev tools.

42
00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:30.502
Does that affect the web vitals extension?

43
00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:33.639
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Yeah,
if you turn on something in Chrome,

44
00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.962
everything else in
Chrome will be affected.

45
00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:42.212
So all the web vitals extension is doing
is basically injecting web vitals.js into

46
00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:47.537
the page and listening to those events and
giving you some nice rendering around it.

47
00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:49.211
So if you throttled it,

48
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:54.819
it will absolutely affect the results
that you get back in web vitals.js.

49
00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.697
It's done, okay, great.

50
00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:58.367
So here's the results.

51
00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.440
We get a little screenshot of
what the site looked like.

52
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.800
And we have a summary information, we see
like a bunch of the different metrics.

53
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.494
It's time to first bite when
rendering started first contentful

54
00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:16.418
paint speed index, LCP,
CLS, total blocking time,

55
00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:21.300
page size, and a full interactive
waterfall about what happened.

56
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.877
This is what's really cool about
WebPageTests over PageSpeed Insights.

57
00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:30.812
In addition to like, not like having some
control about where the test is run from,

58
00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.080
I also have a lot more interactivity.

59
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.701
So I can see, hey,
here's actually what's loading.

60
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.830
So I can click on things.

61
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.295
I can say this particular request for
this SVG file.

62
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.905
Here's what was going on.

63
00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.415
It was made over this
particular protocol request.

64
00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:51.090
It took this long and I can really try and
troubleshoot a specific request that's

65
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.505
happening from a remote user that I might
not have been able to do otherwise.

66
00:03:55.505 --> 00:04:00.614
That's where WebPageTest its value really
shines, is you wanna test something.

67
00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:02.310
You don't necessarily have control of it.

68
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.524
It might not be your website but
you wanna test it for whatever reason.

69
00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:10.843
You can run this from somewhere else and
get all of these details.

70
00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:19.686
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Yeah,
that's the big benefits of webpagetest.org
