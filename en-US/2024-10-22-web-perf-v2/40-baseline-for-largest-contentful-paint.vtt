00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.330
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Let's
talk about improving LCP,

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.180
the largest contentful paint.

3
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.608
This is our first of
the core web vital metrics,

4
00:00:06.608 --> 00:00:09.290
the ones that actually matter for SEO.

5
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.708
If you recall, LCP is how fast your site
visibly loads the most important elements,

6
00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:16.560
aka the largest element.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.760
That's what we're trying to measure.

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.918
How fast does the largest
thing actually show?

9
00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:23.902
Why have we spent all the time talking
about these other things before

10
00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:24.658
we got here?

11
00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.128
Because they are components.

12
00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:32.928
Because by improving TTFB and FCP,
we made LCP better automatically.

13
00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:37.428
We shrunk the time that we were waiting
for those things along the way.

14
00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:44.857
But if we look at LCP and how LCP breaks
down there's three kind of parts of LCP.

15
00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:49.727
There's the resource delay, the resource
duration and the render delay.

16
00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:56.877
So the resource that we're talking about
here is LCP is usually a resource.

17
00:00:56.877 --> 00:00:58.987
It's usually an image or a video.

18
00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:00.207
It tends to be those things.

19
00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:05.204
It's not always those things, but
nine times out of ten, it's an image.

20
00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:10.424
And so how long is the delay before
we can start downloading our image?

21
00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:11.894
That's the resource delay.

22
00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:15.522
That's a lot of what we
fixed with TTFB and FCP.

23
00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:21.307
Is we're trying to make the delay to get
to that LCP element as small as we could.

24
00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:27.075
And then the resource duration, what
we're gonna focus the most on right now,

25
00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:31.398
is how can we make getting that
LCP element as fast as we can.

26
00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:35.347
And then what's usually 99.9%
of the time not a problem,

27
00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:38.625
is the render delay,
which is you have the element,

28
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:43.021
you're ready to show it but
there's too much JavaScript in the way and

29
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:47.787
I can't get a render event together
to actually show this thing.

30
00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:49.527
Largely, that's not an issue for

31
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:53.557
almost anybody except people who use
obnoxiously huge amounts of JavaScript.

32
00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:59.977
Let's take a quick baseline of
where we're at with LCP right now.

33
00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:03.897
In fact,
we don't even need to rerun a profile.

34
00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:07.366
We should have it if we
back this up a little bit.

35
00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:13.328
So if we zoom out, we see, here's FCP.

36
00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:14.788
Here's DOM content loaded.

37
00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:20.379
And if we back way, way out,
because LCP is still a problem.

38
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.796
LCP is hanging out here at 14.26 seconds.

39
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:27.098
It's happening way out here.

40
00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:32.456
And honestly, if you're just looking
at this, you can kind of just tell,

41
00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:36.068
because of how simple this site is,
what LCP is.

42
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.879
Does anybody have a guess of
what the LCP resource is?

43
00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:43.739
&gt;&gt; Student: Hero mobile.

44
00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.448
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: It's hero mobile because
LCP is happening right at the time

45
00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:50.624
that hero mobile was done.

46
00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:54.965
We can even check that if we
go in here into console and

47
00:02:54.965 --> 00:03:00.405
pop open LCP, you'll notice that
there's two LCP events here.

48
00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:01.445
You may have noticed that.

49
00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:06.292
And that's because there was a thing
that was the largest at some

50
00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:08.455
reasonable amount of time.

51
00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.976
And it said, the largest thing so
far has been 0.625 seconds.

52
00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:17.376
But then 14 seconds later,
a larger thing rendered which updated LCP.

53
00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.974
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So LCP,
the element in question,

54
00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:28.097
hero mobile,
which is a file at 1.7 megabytes.

55
00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:32.927
That's 1200 by 1200 pixels, and that's the
thing that is stopping us from loading.

56
00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:36.613
So before you start using any of these
tactics, remember make sure you need to

57
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:40.017
worry about this, check what your LCP
value is based on your real data or

58
00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:44.006
your Crux, if you're already less than
2.5 seconds, you're probably good.

59
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.306
You probably don't need to worry about it.

60
00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:52.144
In our case, we're at what,
14 seconds, 15 seconds, 14.25 seconds.

61
00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:53.844
In my case we definitely need it.

62
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:57.254
So what are the tactics
in order to improve LCP?

63
00:03:57.254 --> 00:04:00.612
Well, one,
we're gonna do even more lazy loading.

64
00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.355
Lazy loading is the best.

65
00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:03.735
We're gonna do a bunch of stuff.

66
00:04:03.735 --> 00:04:06.750
Second, we're gonna play
with eager loading,

67
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.942
which is the opposite of lazy loading.

68
00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:13.970
And then third,
we're gonna talk about optimizing images,

69
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.071
because nine times out of ten
the big image is the LCP thing.

70
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.159
So figuring out how to make images
super efficient improves a lot of

71
00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.911
web performance problems.
