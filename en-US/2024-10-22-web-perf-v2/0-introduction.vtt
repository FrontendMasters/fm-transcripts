00:00:00.185 --> 00:00:02.098
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: Hello,
thanks for joining me today.

2
00:00:02.098 --> 00:00:03.402
We're gonna have some fun.

3
00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:09.230
We're gonna talk about web performance,
why your site needs to be fast,

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.995
how fast it needs to be,
and how to get it there.

5
00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.622
Does that sound good?

6
00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:16.660
Awesome, let's get started.

7
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.336
Okay, here's how we're gonna
break down this workshop.

8
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:24.212
We're gonna talk for a while about
the importance of web performance,

9
00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:26.611
why you need it,
why you should focus on it.

10
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.506
Then we're gonna talk about measuring it,
and this is gonna get really in depth.

11
00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:33.234
We're gonna talk about all
the different metrics,

12
00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:37.211
all the different ways you can collect
this data, and what this data means.

13
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:39.025
Then we're gonna talk about testing and
tools.

14
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:43.207
We're gonna talk about the common things
you'll use to do web performance work.

15
00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:46.646
We'll talk about setting
appropriate goals for your website,

16
00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.307
how fast your site needs to be.

17
00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:53.052
And how we're gonna spend a lot of time
focusing on improving web performance.

18
00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.105
For each metric,
how fast does it need to be, and

19
00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:59.910
what are tactics that you'll
use to get your website there?

20
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.034
Along the way, we got a couple of bonuses,

21
00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:04.748
we're gonna talk about how
to read a waterfall chart,

22
00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:08.826
how to read a flame chart, and some basic
information about statistics and data.

23
00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:13.722
Which are not necessarily web performance
related, but they're really going to help

24
00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:17.223
you in understanding the tools and
understanding your data.

25
00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:18.588
What are you gonna need for this?

26
00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:21.871
If you wanna follow along with our
examples, which you don't necessarily have

27
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.085
to, but the course,
it will be a lot better if you do.

28
00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.029
You're gonna need a Github account.

29
00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.448
You're gonna need a recent
version of Google Chrome,

30
00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.847
but anything you see might be

31
00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:34.700
a little different if you're running
a newer or an older version of it.

32
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.248
Because the Chrome team changes these
sort of things around a whole lot.

33
00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:42.320
And our example app is
gonna run on Node 20.

34
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.672
It might run on older, it might run
on newer, it definitely runs on 20.

35
00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:51.321
Our example application
is this e-commerce store.

36
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:56.797
If you wanna pull it down,
you can get it at bit.ly/fund-web-perf.

37
00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.695
There's probably also a link
somewhere in the course.

38
00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:03.463
You'll pull down the Github repo,
npm install, get everything going.

39
00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:07.371
If you're watching the recording of this,
you probably wanna pause now and

40
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.032
download that and get it going.

41
00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:09.617
Who am I?

42
00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:11.540
My name is Todd.

43
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.295
I have been a Software Engineer
in one form or

44
00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:17.059
another since 2002, so, a long time.

45
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.706
I'm an old timer.

46
00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.971
I've been at Frontend Master since 2017.

47
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.931
I've been doing Frontend Masters
courses for a long time.

48
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.452
Outside of that,
I'm also a consultant and a trainer.

49
00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:31.365
I've worked for a lot of big corporations,
I've done trainings at a lot of

50
00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:33.925
conferences and
a lot of private corporations.

51
00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.049
And I founded two software
as a service companies.

52
00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.944
I also founded a company called TrackJS,
which does JavaScript error monitoring.

53
00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:45.799
So I learned all kinds of things about
how JavaScript fails and how to fix it.

54
00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.017
Probably more relevant to our
course today is my second company,

55
00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:52.658
which is called Request Metrics,
which is web performance monitoring.

56
00:02:52.658 --> 00:02:57.049
So I help companies all around the world
improve the performance of their websites

57
00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.262
and their web applications and see all
different ways that websites get slow.

58
00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:06.139
And I've condensed a bunch of learning
from that over the past five or

59
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.591
six years into this course today.

60
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.521
If you wanna get in touch with me,
learn more about me and what I do,

61
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.893
you can get me at bit.ly/sup-todd,
or this URL link,

62
00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:20.134
it's got contact information for
me, my socials, all the stuff I do.

63
00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.611
That's how to get in touch with me.
