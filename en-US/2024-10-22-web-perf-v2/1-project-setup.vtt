00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.918
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Web performance, this is
a word that gets thrown around a lot, and

2
00:00:04.918 --> 00:00:10.220
not everybody knows what it means or
what exactly it means to be fast.

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.255
It's the speed and
efficiency with which your website loads,

4
00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:20.297
renders and responds to
the interactions of the visitors.

5
00:00:20.297 --> 00:00:23.212
It's not just how fast
the initial thing loads,

6
00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.087
it's a bunch of other kinda
perceptible things about it.

7
00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:30.657
If your website loads fast, but when the
user clicks a button, it feels sluggish,

8
00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:32.587
the user will still think it's slow.

9
00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:35.387
And so there's a lot of different
factors that come into this.

10
00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:41.007
A slow page could be the users waiting
a long time for the page to feel like it's

11
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.996
loaded, to feel like it's done,
to feel like the user can interact.

12
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:49.503
Elements could jump around during that
phase, and the user will feel like,

13
00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:52.736
this is unpredictable, and
that makes them feel slow.

14
00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:56.243
Delays when the user clicks on something,
the images or

15
00:00:56.243 --> 00:01:00.988
videos are slow to load or play,
and laggy scrolls and animation.

16
00:01:00.988 --> 00:01:05.318
All of these things are factors that
could mean why your website is slow.

17
00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:09.588
But talking about that is one thing,
let's experience it.

18
00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:13.286
So we're gonna jump in and
I'm going to show off our application,

19
00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.378
Developer Stickers Online.

20
00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.608
We're gonna talk a lot about that today.

21
00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:22.208
This is a little sample e-commerce
store that I built for this workshop,

22
00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:26.288
that sells some stickers that
I've designed over the years.

23
00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:30.838
It doesn't really sell them, but
it's an e commerce site that looks fun.

24
00:01:30.838 --> 00:01:34.348
This is the GitHub repository
that I had us pull down,

25
00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:39.184
now I'm just gonna quickly do NPM
install to pull down the dependencies,

26
00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:43.041
make sure everything runs,
everything should be cool.

27
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.890
And NPM start.

28
00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right, so
I just started this thing up,

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.951
let's have a look at what
this thing looks like.

30
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.211
So we're gonna go to localhost,
port 3000 and load this thing up.

31
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:06.488
And you can already tell this
thing is gonna be a bit of a dog.

32
00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:11.518
There's a lot going on here, there's these
images that are just crawling in place.

33
00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:16.121
There's stuff that kinda moves around,
we're still loading and

34
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:20.478
we're like seconds in, and
this promo bar pops in.

35
00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:23.971
There's ton of problems that we're going
to solve as part of the course today.

36
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.575
If we go and take a look at DevTools,

37
00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.451
this is gonna show us a lot
of things that are happening.

38
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:32.069
We're seeing some bad scores
getting popped into the console,

39
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.191
some bad performance scores.

40
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.673
We can see some things just
dragging in the network,

41
00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:42.300
the finish being 17.8 seconds
with 20 megs of resources.

42
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.158
The performance panel is like crazy,
it stretches from 0 seconds all the way

43
00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:51.890
out to 24 seconds with all kinds
of warnings and alerts and chains.

44
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.868
Now, we're gonna spend
a bunch of time today, and

45
00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:55.940
we're gonna go through what
everything here means.

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.828
You're gonna know how to
use the performance panel,

47
00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.932
how to use the network panel, how to use
all of these tools to really optimize

48
00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:06.870
the performance of your website and
understand where things slow down.
