&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: This is not
a Core Web Vital anymore, but

2
00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:05.409
I wanna talk about it in memorial.

3
00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:07.046
Up until recently,

4
00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:12.159
the third Core Web Vital used to
be the First Input Delay or FID.

5
00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.511
And you're gonna still see a lot of
content about this online because this is

6
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.040
a relatively recent change as of 2024.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.775
When the Core Web Vitals
first launched in 2020,

8
00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:26.676
FID was the third one, and
it was retired in 2024 and

9
00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:31.920
replaced with INP because it's a better
measure for user interactivity.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.999
But let's just briefly talk about
the first input delay and what it is.

11
00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.057
Essentially, this measured the first INP,

12
00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:43.765
this was measuring the first
time the user interacts.

13
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:48.143
How long does it take in
order to like measure stuff?

14
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:51.288
Now, why was that important?

15
00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:56.615
The first input delay was largely
measuring the time right up here,

16
00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:02.517
it was measuring the time at the very
beginning of that page load sequence.

17
00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:06.895
Because the first time the user interacts
is the highest likelihood that stuff was

18
00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:11.209
still working, that JavaScript was still
running, stuff was being compiled,

19
00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:15.356
images were being downloaded, and
the main thread would generally be busy.

20
00:01:15.356 --> 00:01:19.306
And so the first input delay was
trying to measure are you sending

21
00:01:19.306 --> 00:01:23.989
an obnoxious amount of JavaScript and
other resources down to the page, and

22
00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.381
is it getting in the way of
the user trying to interact?

23
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:33.596
Now it was replaced because it generally
didn't measure things super effectively.

24
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:39.009
It really emphasized that blocking
time over processing time.

25
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.257
And a lot of people have very inefficient
JavaScript that spends a lot of time

26
00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:49.754
processing it, and users will have lots
and lots of interactions on your page.

27
00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:53.440
Hopefully, hopefully, a user stays a long
time and does a lot of good stuff.

28
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.065
And so we want to measure all of them.

29
00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.993
A site could still feel slow if the third
or fourth or 100th interaction is

30
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:05.848
the important one that they click on and
the site feels laggy at that point.

31
00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.342
So FID didn't measure those things, and

32
00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:11.121
so that's why it was
retired very recently and

33
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:16.267
replaced with interaction to next paint is
a better measure for user interactivity.
