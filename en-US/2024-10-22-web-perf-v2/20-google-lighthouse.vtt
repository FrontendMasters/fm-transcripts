WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.327
So we talked about the three different
methods of testing, lab data,

2
00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:06.460
synthetic data, and field data.

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.560
And we talked about statistics.

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.614
So let's bring this down to like reality.

5
00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.570
We've been very theoretical up until now.

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.778
Let's talk about real tools and
what they mean and

7
00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:22.291
how they translate back to these things.

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.784
So web performance tooling.

9
00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:31.117
The first thing is all the different tools
that are available to us in Google Chrome.

10
00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:37.517
Now again, I'm using Google Chrome Dev,
which is like the next version right now.

11
00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:39.063
I'm running 131.

12
00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:42.127
If you're running exactly 131,
you should see what I'm doing.

13
00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:45.569
But chances are you're running either
a couple of versions behind or

14
00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.959
maybe a couple of versions ahead because
you're watching this in the future.

15
00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:54.863
All these things are very likely to change
because all the Chrome developer tools

16
00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:57.974
are under active development
to make them better.

17
00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.263
So things shift and rearrange.

18
00:01:00.263 --> 00:01:03.853
So the little disclaimer
here in this demo.

19
00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:06.253
So let's pop out and
understand a few things.

20
00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:08.891
So, we're gonna do a little demo of
a couple of things in Google Chrome.

21
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.115
And we're gonna start with lighthouse.

22
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:16.853
So, I'm actually going
to pop out my DevTools.

23
00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:21.899
And the reason why I'm gonna pop out my
DevTools is because right now with the dev

24
00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.507
tools open on the bottom here,
I'm shrinking the size of the viewport.

25
00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:29.521
My viewport is only this big.

26
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.319
And so all kinds of things that could
happen on the page that are tied to

27
00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.171
the viewport,

28
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.056
I'm going to be kind of affecting
them because DevTools is in the way.

29
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.935
So instead, I'm gonna pop them
out into a separate window,

30
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:47.122
which I encourage you to do, especially
if you're doing performance testing.

31
00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:50.085
So I'm gonna pop the Chrome
tools out into its own window so

32
00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:52.335
that we can interact with them separately.

33
00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:55.992
And so that the size of our DevTools
doesn't interact with the size

34
00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:56.981
of the view port.

35
00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:03.656
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: So under DevTools,
the first tool I want to show you is

36
00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.205
Lighthouse, which is
one of the top panels.

37
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:11.111
And the Lighthouse report is the first
thing that a lot of people will do when

38
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:12.985
getting into performance.

39
00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:17.131
It enables you to generate the really
common Lighthouse score, which is like

40
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:21.362
that big green or orange or red circle,
that I've shown in slides a few times.

41
00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:22.567
You'll see it shared online.

42
00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:24.569
People will brag about their score.

43
00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.547
There's a couple of things that we
wanna do here because we want to

44
00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:31.275
simulate a real user.

45
00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:35.575
If you just pop open Lighthouse and
you don't do anything,

46
00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:40.396
it's gonna generate a score that's
like based on your computer.

47
00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:42.113
Which isn't relevant.

48
00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:43.618
It's almost never relevant.

49
00:02:43.618 --> 00:02:46.040
It doesn't do you any good, it's noise.

50
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.550
Instead, you need to try and generate
something as close to reality as you can.

51
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.319
And so the first thing to do
is to turn on responsive mode,

52
00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.441
which is this little icon up here in
the upper left corner of Lighthouse.

53
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:05.437
Now, if you guys want to do this alongside
on either Developer Stickers Online or

54
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:09.408
another site, you can follow along and
we can do this together.

55
00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:11.441
So I'm going to turn on responsive mode,

56
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.881
which you see back in Chrome has kind
of changed the frame a little bit.

57
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:18.551
We now have this header that allows you to
set screen sizes and some other things.

58
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:24.152
There's a default set of options here,
which probably by default comes into

59
00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:28.195
responsive mode that lets you
dynamically change the size of things.

60
00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:31.850
Which is interesting if you're
doing responsive design and

61
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.863
actively doing stuff like that.

62
00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.577
It's less valuable for
performance testing.

63
00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:38.813
Usually for performance testing,

64
00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:43.219
we wanna set this to the kind
of user that we want to test.

65
00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.061
There's a lot of different
mobile devices built in.

66
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:52.046
I tend to use iPhone 12 Pro a lot
as a very common screen size

67
00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:56.179
of a few generations old mobile device.

68
00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.924
I also have one that I built
myself called small laptop,

69
00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:02.685
which I think is really valuable.

70
00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:05.262
You can create these yourself.

71
00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:09.715
Going into dimensions edit,
and you can create your own.

72
00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:15.049
So for example,
small laptop has the display resolution

73
00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.837
of 1366 by 768 at 1 device or
Per pixel density ratio.

74
00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:28.281
So not a Retina display,
there's one display pixel to whatever.

75
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:33.760
So I just built this to kind of
represent a common user for me.

76
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.348
So I'm going to set this to iPhone 12 pro.

77
00:04:38.348 --> 00:04:41.428
Now, that sets the screen size.

78
00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.086
Now, there's a couple of other
things we should also do.

79
00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:48.714
We should kind of maybe change how
we're connected to the network.

80
00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:52.718
Because right now I'm
testing this thing locally.

81
00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.376
I don't have any network
hop that I need to make.

82
00:04:55.376 --> 00:04:57.890
So we should introduce one.

83
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.936
So under the network tab, there's
this option here called throttling.

84
00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:08.336
Under throttling, we have some other
options that we can automatically tell

85
00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:11.866
Chrome to pretend that we're on
a slower network than we are.

86
00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.700
There's some default ones
that are interesting.

87
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.539
I tend to add my own honestly, so I can be
a little bit more controlling about it.

88
00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.574
So I have this one here,
you set up your own throttling profiles.

89
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.646
I have this one called
USA Coffee Shop WiFi.

90
00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:30.585
Then I just tried to emulate, hey,

91
00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:34.862
this was a real experience that I had when
I was working from a coffee shop once.

92
00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:40.026
I ran a speed test and it showed
that I had about ten megabit down,

93
00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:44.345
four megabit up, and
50 milliseconds of latency.

94
00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:47.637
It's just something that I use,

95
00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:52.935
base your data on what you
think your real users have.

96
00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:59.103
So I'm going to change my throttling
profile to USA Coffee Shop WIFI.

97
00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:01.900
And then I'm going to go
to the performance tab and

98
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.437
there's one other thing
that we can do here.

99
00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:09.705
If we open up the gear in the upper right,
we have some options on CPU throttling.

100
00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:12.816
Now I have a MacBook Pro.

101
00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:17.447
MacBook Pro with the M
whatever chip it's super fast,

102
00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:21.686
not anything like what my users have,
probably.

103
00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:23.545
And so I need to slow it down.

104
00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:29.012
Now this isn't super accurate,
this is like an approximation.

105
00:06:29.012 --> 00:06:32.679
But you can try and get a little
closer to what your users have.

106
00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:37.614
So if I wanna slow this down say
six times, and limit how many

107
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:42.764
concurrent processors I have to ten,
I can turn that on here.

108
00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:45.361
Now notice when I turned on
these throttling options,

109
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:46.949
I got these big warnings up here.

110
00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.390
It's just so
you know when throttling is in effect.

111
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.656
So as you do things, you'll notice the web
page is significantly slower than it would

112
00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:55.375
be normally.

113
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:59.055
And saying,
hey this is why you told me to slow down.

114
00:06:59.055 --> 00:07:02.951
So, I turned to both of those things on,
and now I'm gonna go back to Lighthouse.

115
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:06.959
And Lighthouse, there's this option
here of how to do throttling.

116
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:11.859
I've turned on DevTools throttling,
and that let me control this.

117
00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:15.465
So now it's going to honor
the network throttling and

118
00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.679
the performance throttling
that I just set up.

119
00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:23.645
So now I can run a page load, and
I would pretend to be a mobile device, and

120
00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:25.530
I wanna test performance.

121
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.876
Lighthouse is good for
a lot of different things.

122
00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:30.912
It can test SEO practices,
it can test accessibility.

123
00:07:30.912 --> 00:07:33.886
That's out of scope of this course,
we're gonna focus on performance.

124
00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:36.121
And we're gonna run a page load.

125
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:37.583
Now, this takes a little bit.

126
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:42.435
Because in the background,
it's re rendering the page.

127
00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:45.680
You can see it like
trying to reload it and

128
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.411
do some stuff as
a performance optimization.

129
00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:52.734
It shows us these little messages
that change along the way,

130
00:07:52.734 --> 00:07:56.398
so that we don't feel like this is
taking nearly as long as it does.

131
00:07:56.398 --> 00:08:00.054
It shows you various
statistics from Google data.

132
00:08:00.054 --> 00:08:02.913
Because sometimes Lighthouse
can be quite slow,

133
00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:06.937
especially if you're testing a slow
site like our example right now.

134
00:08:12.127 --> 00:08:15.629
&gt;&gt; Todd Gardner: If a site
takes greater than one second,

135
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.414
it becomes interactive users.

136
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:20.345
We'll cut this all out of the video so

137
00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:23.094
that people aren't watching
as this slowly loads.

138
00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:27.918
Great, we got a report, and

139
00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:30.735
it's not good.

140
00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:33.385
It's so bad,
it didn't even give us a score.

141
00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:36.098
It is not even a one.

142
00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:38.729
It is negative, bad.

143
00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.207
Error, we couldn't even load the page.

144
00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:46.764
The largest contentful paint did not
even happen in the time of this thing.

145
00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:50.145
So, what this thing generated for
us is it tries to surface

146
00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:55.121
the First Contentful Paint, Largest
Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift.

147
00:08:55.121 --> 00:08:59.780
And then some other scores that it pulls
out of Pulls out of the inner workings of

148
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.512
Chrome that we didn't really talk about
because they're really only unique to

149
00:09:04.512 --> 00:09:05.375
lab testing.

150
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:07.438
Now, what this does not give us,

151
00:09:07.438 --> 00:09:11.578
it didn't give us any INP score
because there was no interaction.

152
00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:15.376
It can't click on something for us,
It doesn't know how to do that.

153
00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:20.088
And it gives us a film stream strip of
here's what the page looked like and

154
00:09:20.088 --> 00:09:22.031
then a bunch of diagnostics.

155
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:25.680
It's saying, here's some things that
I found that statistically might be

156
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.225
interesting for you to look at.

157
00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:31.519
And that can all be super interesting.

158
00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:35.453
What this also lets us do
is it lets us view a trace.

159
00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:37.646
Which it jumps over here
into the performance tab,

160
00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:39.482
which is the next thing
I wanna talk about.

161
00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:44.260
Because this is the actual details
of getting into performance.

162
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.149
And this is why we spent time talking
about waterfall charts and fame charts.
