00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so
we just did RSCs with Next.js.

2
00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.909
Hopefully RSCs were much easier with
Next.js and you understand why next is

3
00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.634
the way it is, because parts of
this are not fun to write, right?

4
00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:12.505
Yeah.

5
00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:22.003
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so let's talk a bit
about the next couple of sections here.

6
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:26.187
One, they're gonna be way lighter
weight than what we just did,

7
00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:28.254
these are gonna go much faster.

8
00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:32.944
And it's just fixing
potential React problems.

9
00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:37.300
So let's hop into performance
optimizations here, so

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.251
where React can be slow.

11
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:42.811
I'm just gonna say out of the box,
if you're writing React,

12
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:47.070
like I've taught you here,
it's fast enough, almost always, right?

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.132
Many, many, many apps I've written I've
never had to hack around the performance.

14
00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:56.074
Just because the model
that they've built for

15
00:00:56.074 --> 00:01:00.611
React generally just works fast enough,
even on fairly slow devices.

16
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:03.920
I'm sure you've read all of
the thought leader pieces or tweets or

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.049
something like that.

18
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.723
It's like React doesn't do this
fast enough and that kinda stuff,

19
00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:11.505
even on slow devices it
typically works just fine.

20
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.472
We measured that a decade ago at Netflix
and that was generally fairly true.

21
00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:21.915
And Netflix deeply cares about that
because that's their bottom line, right?

22
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:25.266
It's pretty hard to make
non performing code.

23
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.960
In fact, writing these examples,
I wasn't even really able to do it.

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.858
We're gonna have to artificially
slow down our code so

25
00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:36.336
that you can actually see the difference
here, I couldn't get things slow enough.

26
00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:41.036
So that should tell you a whole lot about
what I'm about to teach you is like,

27
00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:45.222
this is very, I won't say niche,
but it's gotta be contextual and

28
00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:47.001
maybe stated differently.

29
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.110
Please don't preemptively do these things.

30
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.296
Don't say like, this could be slow,
I'm just gonna write a memo.

31
00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:58.589
No, bad, stop it [LAUGH].

32
00:01:58.589 --> 00:02:02.973
As your potential future coworker,
I'm just mortified that I was like,

33
00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:07.084
I learned this from you, and
I'll be like, I have failed humanity.

34
00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:10.241
So this is another thing
is like please measure,

35
00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:13.478
please have a problem
before you solve a problem.

36
00:02:13.478 --> 00:02:17.652
Again, React is normally fast enough for
almost everything.

37
00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:20.136
So I'm gonna show you
several different ways.

38
00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:21.863
Some of them are about
perceived performance,

39
00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.034
which we talked about earlier.

40
00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:24.504
And some of them are about, like,

41
00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:27.565
actual performance, of like,
how to make react actually run faster.

42
00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:30.355
Some of these concepts aren't really
that important until they're very

43
00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:31.173
important, right?

44
00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:32.841
You're going to hit some slow down.

45
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.946
You're gonna realize, like,
my gosh, I need these right now,

46
00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:39.049
which is why it's important for
you to still have these filed with,

47
00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.482
I could do these if I needed to.

48
00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:43.864
Yeah, strong advice here,
do not preemptively use these.

49
00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:47.874
And I'm harping on this because
it's gonna be a temptation.

50
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:50.107
The code is actually not
that hard to write, so

51
00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:52.871
you're thinking that maybe I
could do this all the time.

52
00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:57.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No [LAUGH], okay,
I think I've said my piece enough times,

53
00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:00.057
I might still say it again,
I can't make any promises.

54
00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:04.857
So we're gonna talk about
the most useful way,

55
00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:09.065
probably for actual React performance.

56
00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:10.553
Let's say you have app here.

57
00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:15.002
Let's just make this a bit smaller,
for a second, you have app, and

58
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:16.863
your app has, what is that?

59
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:21.031
Four child components you have
content which is its own island,

60
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.903
and then you have profile and
profile pic and profile name.

61
00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:29.796
So let's imagine for
a second that you have something

62
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:33.938
happen in profile and
nothing else happens.

63
00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:38.448
Well, content won't run it's React
is actually smart to say like it

64
00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:43.035
only happened in this component,
so I'm not gonna render app again,

65
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:48.190
I'm not gonna render content again,
I'm only going to re-render profile.

66
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.628
Imagine this is like a use
state hook that changed, right?

67
00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:53.994
So someone called like,
set count, and it changes.

68
00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:56.221
Does profile pic run again?

69
00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.605
Yeah, it does, so does profile name
right both of these will run again.

70
00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:04.854
Because whenever you dirty a tree, right?

71
00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:09.713
What React does is, cool,
re-render everything in this tree.

72
00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:15.041
Now some people might be horrified, but
how much inefficiency is that generating?

73
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.815
Some, minuscule,
almost unmeasurable amounts, right?

74
00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:24.569
It's not enough for you to worry about,
I should prevent these things from me

75
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.875
running because it generally
just doesn't matter.

76
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:31.696
Cuz you can imagine this might have some
sort of side effect that would cause these

77
00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:32.550
to be also stale.

78
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.416
And so rather than try and nitpick or
fine grain is actually the term, right?

79
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.436
Rather than having a fine grain rendering
of those things that just re-renders

80
00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:44.160
everything.

81
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.067
Again, generally,
this pattern is almost always fast enough.

82
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.230
I'm sure some of you use the Netflix app,
right?

83
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.133
It's all done with React and most of it
doesn't touch any of these React tools and

84
00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.730
it's just fine, right?

85
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.284
It renders plenty fast.

86
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:05.980
99,999 times out of 100,000,
this is just fine.

87
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.214
However, what happens if you
update something in profile?

88
00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:12.484
We know nothing's gonna
change in profile pic, and

89
00:05:12.484 --> 00:05:15.247
this is also very expensive to re-render.

90
00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:18.881
Let's say,
this is doing interpolation of images and

91
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:24.103
running like image magic in the browser or
something wild and silly like that.

92
00:05:24.103 --> 00:05:28.226
And we want to make sure that
please don't re-render this.

93
00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:29.694
That is what I'm gonna
show you right here.

94
00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:32.395
It's, okay, profile needs to change and

95
00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:36.908
we cannot have profile pick re-render
unless it absolutely needs to.
