00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What do you think?

2
00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:02.613
Do we like RSCs?

3
00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:03.262
Are we fans?

4
00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:04.450
Are we not fans?

5
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.938
Is it big stupid face or
is it like really cool?

6
00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:08.761
I don't know.

7
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.722
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Do you have any
like general rules of thumb for

8
00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:15.231
when you recommend next js?

9
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:18.939
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think as you see here,
when you have a lot of

10
00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.660
like client actions which
then do things on the server.

11
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.963
So like a lot of when a client would
be calling an API fairly frequently,

12
00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:29.337
this is nice, right?

13
00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:35.266
This makes the client-server
interaction pattern very great,

14
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.750
it makes it very nice to do.

15
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.939
When you don't have that,

16
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.306
there's enough downside where you might
question maybe I don't need this.

17
00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:45.874
Or maybe when you have something
that's extremely client-side heavy,

18
00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:49.845
this also could get very annoying pretty
quickly because everything would be used

19
00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:50.724
client, right?

20
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:54.986
So a great example of this is if
I was making Excalibur draw or

21
00:00:54.986 --> 00:01:00.120
something like that, first of all,
if you don't use Excalibur draw.

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.325
Great piece of software,
I really quite like it, but

23
00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:07.472
you can see this is all client side
drawing and all that kind of stuff.

24
00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:10.137
Doing this on next JS just doesn't
make a lot of sense to me.

25
00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.644
I would just use like vite or something
like that, or or tan stack router or

26
00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:14.729
something like that.

27
00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.578
So, yeah, extremely client side
heavy applications, maybe not.

28
00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:23.411
Yeah, hopefully the thing that
is like in your brain is like,

29
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:25.261
these are useful Sometimes.

30
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:30.065
If I communicated that, then I
successfully conveyed my bias towards you,

31
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.153
and you adopted it, and
now it's your problem.

32
00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:34.258
[LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Student 1: [INAUDIBLE]

33
00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:38.204
React do we have similar frameworks
that embrace a paradigm RSCs,

34
00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:41.453
or is it kind of a new paradigm
that's unique to react.

35
00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:44.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Man, I feel like Meteor did
this some time ago, there were certain

36
00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:48.263
aspects of Meteor that made these kind
of interactions kind of seamless.

37
00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:53.041
I feel like rails and
like Phoenix have elements

38
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.469
of this as well, obviously not with React.

39
00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.332
But Phoenix live view all kind
of stuff if you're into elixir,

40
00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:04.182
which I am not, [LAUGH].

41
00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:08.952
But if you are, has some really cool
like elements and aspects to that, yeah,

42
00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:13.002
Since you're admittedly so into PHP,
Laravel has live wire now,

43
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:17.626
which is very much this, Yep,
Just from the PHP side, Absolutely, yeah,

44
00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:20.631
Laravel is actually great
example that as well.

45
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:23.817
So, yeah, I don't none of
this was invented by react.

46
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:28.889
I think it's really fair to say that this
is a lot of adopting fairly old paradigms

47
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.677
and just bringing them into React
developers and calling them shiny again.

48
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:38.749
But yeah, pick your flavor of back end I'm
sure there's some Python version of this,

49
00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.065
it doesn't come to mind, but
I'm sure someone has or will do it, right?

50
00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:46.815
I don't know, there's Python East does,
I don't trust them,

51
00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:51.466
I say that my last PM job was open source
manager at Snowflake on Python projects.

52
00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:57.846
So that's true I don't trust
myself either, so that's fair.

53
00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.995
Okay, I'm pretty happy with that.

54
00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:04.454
So that concludes the server
portion of React.

55
00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:07.521
That's about everything you can
do with a server with React.

56
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.733
Is that fair to say?

57
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:12.866
Yeah, there's not a lot more you
can do with the server plus React.

58
00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:17.583
And it just speaks to the flexibility and
the power of React,

59
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:21.203
you can bend it to many
shapes that you want to.

60
00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:24.837
And you can use it itself
like its own framework or

61
00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.737
you can like use it to
construct larger frameworks,

62
00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:33.445
it's a pretty versatile tool
which I think is is pretty great.
