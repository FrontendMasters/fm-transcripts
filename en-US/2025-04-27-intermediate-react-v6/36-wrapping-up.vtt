00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.663
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is the intermediate
React v6 course you did it.

2
00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:11.872
I recognize that this is a lot
of information all at once,

3
00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:16.436
but after taking complete intro and
now intermediate React,

4
00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:21.635
you really are well equipped to
deal with any React-shaped problem.

5
00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.915
There's a handful of other things
that exist in the React API.

6
00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:30.689
Most of them are for like framework
authors, like use layout effect, or

7
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.262
what was the other one?

8
00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:35.925
Like use it, like insertion styles,
or something that for

9
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.987
a CSS injection stuff like that.

10
00:00:37.987 --> 00:00:42.211
They're made for people that are building
the libraries on top of React to offer

11
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.859
other people, and
not application developers,

12
00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.100
which is to say that I don't use them
because I'm not a library author, right?

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.960
So in other words, you really don't
need to know about the other hooks.

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.950
I mean, take a look, they're kind of fun,
but you don't need to.

15
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.943
So where do you go from here?

16
00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:04.615
I gave you some ideas along the way of
like maybe introducing auth into some of

17
00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:08.783
your apps would be a good idea,
take the next.js app and deploy it.

18
00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:13.705
Vercel is perfect for that, because that's
what Vercel is essentially made for.

19
00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:18.153
But this could work on Netlify,
this could work on, I don't know,

20
00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:21.366
Azure static web apps AWS,
what is they call it?

21
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.668
What do they call it?

22
00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:23.399
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Amplify?

23
00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.461
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
amplify exactly, thank you.

24
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:31.440
GCP, like App Engine or Firebase, actually
probably be a closer analogy for that.

25
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.260
Move your database to the cloud,

26
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.680
I give you like the notes do DB obviously
I'm biased cuz neon's pretty cool, but

27
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.620
you could take this to any
one of the cloud databases.

28
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.643
We talked about adding auth,
yeah, to go back to your note,

29
00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:48.993
passing app and add some more features.

30
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.159
You could make it into
more of a Twitter feed so

31
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.840
you can see what other people
are posting to each other.

32
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.140
You can make a wall that you could
post to add an admin feature.

33
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.874
Something really cool you could do is use
something like AWS Bedrock, or was it

34
00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:08.484
together AI, that you can use different or
Github models, is another one.

35
00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:13.515
And have an AI social network that
will pass notes to each other,

36
00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:15.385
that can be pretty fun.

37
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.046
But in any case, go build something.

38
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:22.435
That's the best thing you can do right
now is just go and practice this, because

39
00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:27.105
that'll help you really solidify what you
learned and what you need to go review on.

40
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.575
Yeah, it'll help.

41
00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:33.553
In any case, please let me know, I left my
links here for Twitter and for Blue Sky.

42
00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.234
I'm always interested
in what you all build.

43
00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.903
So thanks for attending,
this was a lot of fun, and

44
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:42.955
I'll see you at the next course because
they keep letting me in the building.

45
00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.737
