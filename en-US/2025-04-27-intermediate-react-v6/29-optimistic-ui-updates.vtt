00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.609
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
we are gonna do our next one here,

2
00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.836
which is in starter, and
we're gonna do optimistic.

3
00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:12.258
So, cd optimistic.

4
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:20.289
Do a nice MPM install in there, and
I'm gonna open that in my code editor.

5
00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I want you to,
picture your text messaging app of choice.

6
00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.737
That could be WhatsApp, iMessage signal,
ICQ, aim, MSN Messenger,

7
00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:33.258
steam messages,
GameSpy messages anyone use those?

8
00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:38.305
No, I think I was the only one anyway,
whenever you send a message, right?

9
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:42.577
So, you say like hello to
whoever you're sending it to,

10
00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:47.829
you immediately get shown hello as
a text bubble right there, right?

11
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.753
Despite the fact that it actually
hasn't really sent yet, right?

12
00:00:50.753 --> 00:00:55.107
So, you type hello, you hit enter,
and it shows that you have sent it,

13
00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:57.076
but it hasn't hit the wire yet.

14
00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:59.789
It definitely hasn't been delivered yet.

15
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.087
That's called like an optimistic
UI updates, right?

16
00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:06.956
That you're showing the users that
you did an action, and I have like,

17
00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:09.359
I'm optimistic that this is going to work.

18
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.075
So, I'm going to show you as
if it has already worked,

19
00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:14.331
despite the fact that it hasn't yet
worked.

20
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:17.134
So, if you were doing this
in a non-optimistic way,

21
00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:21.310
you would say type hello, and then you
just wouldn't show anything there, and

22
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.825
until it actually got delivered, and then
you would pop up the hello bubble, right?

23
00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:30.293
That would be a non-optimistic idea.

24
00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:34.815
In this particular case, that would
cause some dissonance with the user,

25
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.065
because in their brain,
I typed hello, I hit enter.

26
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.167
To them, it's sent, right?

27
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:46.103
It's gone, they done their action in
the interaction kind of model here,

28
00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:48.375
it's sent to them, right?

29
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.488
The behavior model.

30
00:01:50.488 --> 00:01:57.253
And so frequently the behavior model and
how you engineer things are similar.

31
00:01:57.253 --> 00:02:00.942
But in this particular case, there's kind
of a drift between how you're gonna build

32
00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:03.876
something, and what the user
thinks about what you're building.

33
00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:06.433
And so, we should always try and
error on the side of users to try and

34
00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:07.221
make it make sense.

35
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:12.171
So that is the point of
optimistic UI updates.

36
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.209
So again, just to kind of harp on that.

37
00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.728
If we go back to our course notes here and
we look at optimistic values, you type

38
00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:24.589
your message, you click Send, and then the
message shows up in the log of messages,

39
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.141
and this is the one that we're interested.

40
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:32.415
Then the message is actually sent over the
network, and the recipient receives it.

41
00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:36.577
So, they kind of have that at least
an I iMessage, because, as you can see,

42
00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.911
them on a Mac, and so
it follows that I have an iPhone as well.

43
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:45.560
It'll show sent and
then it'll show delivered afterwards.

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.304
So, you get some sort of like post,

45
00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:53.161
like this has definitely been
delivered to the end user there.

46
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:57.321
So, I'll show you how to do all of those
things with this hook here called use

47
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.104
optimistic.

48
00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:03.097
So like transitions,
everything I'm showing you

49
00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:08.333
here could be done without
these specialized hooks.

50
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:13.182
But because we have this React
scheduler and reconciler that we got,

51
00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:18.629
I call it new, but it's probably like
seven or eight years old at this point.

52
00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.195
We can kind of just take advantage of the
fact that this is already doing a bunch of

53
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:25.670
scheduling for us, and so we can just
kind of lean into that with these hooks.

54
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.869
It was a pain before, but it was possible.
