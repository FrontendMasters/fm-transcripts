00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Intermediate React
v6 as taught for Frontend Masters.

2
00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.470
So I am very exited to be
here today we're gonna talk,

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.770
it's kind of a continuation on
the complete intro to React v9.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.340
That kind of taught you all like the core
fundamental clientside React kind of

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.194
components.

6
00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:21.803
And then this is kinda going
into the more frontier,

7
00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:26.819
these are useful sometimes, but
not all the time kinda things, right?

8
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.838
So first of all, if you're gonna follow
along with me today, I invite you to.

9
00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:37.015
You can just go to
i6.holt.courses like that.

10
00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:43.000
And that'll take you to
intermediate-react-v.holt.courses.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.240
You should see this, kinda black and
green website, looks like this.

12
00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, just to kinda give
you a little lay of the land of how this

13
00:00:54.368 --> 00:00:58.302
website works, if I click into one of
these lessons, you'll see that it says

14
00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:01.588
RSCs without a framework and
intro to react server components.

15
00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.704
The first part is the name of the section,
and

16
00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:05.553
the second part the name of the lesson.

17
00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:09.738
So if you pop into the middle of a course,

18
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:13.569
you can kind of see where I am, okay.

19
00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.003
But beyond that, let's just hop in,
go through the introduction, and

20
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.833
then I'll kinda talk a little bit more
about what we're gonna learn in the course

21
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:21.587
I'm excited.

22
00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:25.309
So I'm just gonna click into intro here.

23
00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.220
Just to be super clear, you do not
have to take v5 of this course to take

24
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.235
v6 this is the sixth revision of it,
not the sixth in a series, right?

25
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:38.671
I just say that because I
get asked it frequently, so

26
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:40.555
I just want to clear that up.

27
00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.854
However, you do need to
take Intro to React v9,

28
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:49.418
these are kind of companion courses, this
is a continuation of what you learned.

29
00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:53.782
You can also come here just having known
React, it's not like anything in there is

30
00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.453
anything outside of just
learning React itself.

31
00:01:56.453 --> 00:02:00.445
But I did my best to make that kind of a
continuum that there's no overlap between

32
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:04.099
the two courses, you can kinda take
them individually from each other.

33
00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.114
This is a complete rewrite
of my intermediate course,

34
00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:10.654
if you have taken the previous
versions of Intermediate React,

35
00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:13.287
this is totally different
from those courses.

36
00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:16.516
Intermediate React used to focus
more on ecosystem kinda stuff, and

37
00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.257
I just was looking through
the Frontend Masters catalog.

38
00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:24.107
And a lot of that ecosystem stuff
is covered well by other teachers.

39
00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:27.870
There's one on Tailwind,
there's one on Typescript and React, and

40
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.608
those are all awesome courses.

41
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.432
So I saw is kind of being redundant.

42
00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:35.866
And then I also saw that kind of not
covering some of these more newer

43
00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:40.460
features like React server components and
some of the transition and

44
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.138
stuff like that as well.

45
00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:45.570
So all that to say, v5 still works,
it actually is going through all of

46
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.137
the curriculum there and it all still
applies, none of it's out of date.

47
00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:51.926
So v5 of this actually
still works really well.

48
00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:55.895
If you wanna learn about Redux or
Typescript from me,

49
00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:57.760
it's all in v5 of that.

50
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.706
So feel free, I left a little link
there if you wanna check it out.

51
00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:04.404
Also, just the learning path
here on Frontend Masters.

52
00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:09.322
You can see here they've done
a really good job curating, do this,

53
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:14.079
then this, then this, then this,
also a special note on Scott.

54
00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.189
He and I coordinated so
that intro to next and

55
00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.404
intermediate react didn't
have a lot of overlap, right?

56
00:03:21.404 --> 00:03:24.933
So he's focused more on the next concepts,
I'm more focused on the React concepts.

57
00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:28.761
Despite the fact that you will write
a little bit of next in this course

58
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:32.670
by necessity that certain features
of react now require next to work.

59
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.506
So this course can kinda logically
be divided into two halves.

60
00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:41.706
The first part basically
through this part with next.js,

61
00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:46.331
it's all server side react,
right, and various flavors of it.

62
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.759
We'll go over through the client
side react, static site generation,

63
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.126
server side rendering, which are like,
let's call them the not new.

64
00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:58.563
I'm not gonna call them old,
cuz I don't feel like they're old.

65
00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:01.404
I can't call them old without calling
myself old, I'll put it that way.

66
00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:04.158
So I'm not gonna do that.

67
00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:07.429
These are the, I was gonna say legacy,
no, I don't like that word either.

68
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:11.704
So there's just the ways that have
existed of writing React previously.

69
00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:12.432
And then RSCs,

70
00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:15.568
which is React Server Components
is kinda the new ways of doing it.

71
00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:18.774
We're gonna write RSCs
without a framework and

72
00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:22.066
then we're gonna write
the RSCs with next.js.

73
00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:25.852
You gonna see basically what an RSC is,
how it is created, what it does for

74
00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:29.168
you and what a pain in the back is
to write it without a frame work.

75
00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:32.455
And then am gonna show you the easy
mode of writing it, right?

76
00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.887
So that's the first half the course,

77
00:04:34.887 --> 00:04:39.452
the second half the course is percieved
an actual perfomance of React.

78
00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:43.422
So basically how to make your
app both be performant and

79
00:04:43.422 --> 00:04:48.961
also how to make it feel performant,
which can be kind of different things.

80
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:52.736
And that'll be the second
half of this course and

81
00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.799
then I will let you go to go
create really cool stuff.

82
00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:59.412
Until then, you are stuck here.

83
00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:02.930
Okay, so who is this course for?

84
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.176
I put this in here, but
hopefully it's for you, I try and

85
00:05:06.176 --> 00:05:08.689
make this generally accessible to people.

86
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.296
Is anyone looking to get some
more experience into React?

87
00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:14.084
Even beyond just the things
I'm working here,

88
00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:17.156
this is just good practice
of writing a lot of React.

89
00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:18.523
Probably shouldn't be
referred React course,

90
00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:20.124
probably shouldn't be your
first Javascript course and

91
00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:21.808
definitely shouldn't be your
first programming course.

92
00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:25.072
So if you are here and that applies
to you, there are other courses on

93
00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:27.665
Frontend Masters that will
work really well for you.

94
00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:31.600
We are gonna do some note in here and
even more note than I previously put in my

95
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.731
React courses just by necessity that
this is working with server components.

96
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:41.447
I do try and focus on the React portion
of it, not the node portion of it.

97
00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:45.702
So you're probably okay here, if you're
this is your first exposure to Node,

98
00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:46.978
but that might be hard.

99
00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.576
Also, you should just take a Node course,
because that would be helpful.

100
00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:53.509
I've been writing react for a long time,
it is now been over ten years,

101
00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.801
which is wild to say out loud
that I have been writing react.

102
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:01.231
It's kind of been career defining for
me and I still use it.

103
00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:04.615
Ten years later, who knew that someone was
still using a Javascript framework and

104
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.298
not have migrated on to a different one?

105
00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:08.573
But here we are.

106
00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:10.711
I've written React a large
variety of companies.

107
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:14.743
I've shipped it at basically every company
I've worked at in some capacity except

108
00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:18.774
probably Linkedin, and that wasn't for
lack of trying, did try to ship it there,

109
00:06:18.774 --> 00:06:20.169
they just wouldn't let me.

110
00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.574
So it's just been my go-to tool it's,

111
00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:25.759
I like the model of how it
encapsulates components and

112
00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.531
then the composability of components
it's just, it's always worked for me.

113
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:34.489
And they taken care over the years
to not break it too, too much.

114
00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:35.539
With React 19,

115
00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.542
the latest version being the one that
adds a lot of kind of New tools.

116
00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.716
Let's go with new complexity and

117
00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:45.373
we'll get into Brian's rants
as we go on as I want to do.

118
00:06:45.373 --> 00:06:47.834
They pay me for it, and they keep paying
me to do it, so I will keep doing it.

119
00:06:47.834 --> 00:06:52.217
A little bit more about me, I work at
NEON, it's pretty cool Postgres company.

120
00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:57.153
[INAUDIBLE] serverless Postgres, I'm in
charge of all sorts of developer services,

121
00:06:57.153 --> 00:07:01.553
developer tools just kind of like trying
to make working with Postgres fun.

122
00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:04.406
So I've been doing that for a while.

123
00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:08.526
Previous to that, I worked as
a JavaScript and a Node js engineer for

124
00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:13.105
over ten years at snowflake,
Microsoft, LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit.

125
00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:16.156
I'm sure I'm forgetting some but
some of those things in there,

126
00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:19.483
I've been everything from a VP of
product to Dev Rel to staff engineer,

127
00:07:19.483 --> 00:07:20.939
tech lead to junior engineer.

128
00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:24.347
I've been all those job titles.

129
00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:28.252
And I currently, I just moved to
Sacramento, I lived in Seattle for

130
00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:31.142
the past six years, but
I moved about a month ago.

131
00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:37.121
Yeah, I enjoy snowboarding,
beers, scotch, cycling and

132
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:43.465
most recently, playing Marvel
rivals poorly, quite poorly.

133
00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:46.553
If we're being truly
honest with ourselves,

134
00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:50.920
feel free to catch up with me on
the socials, I left my links here.

135
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.011
I just yeah, I say this every single time,
but I am awful at responding to DMS,

136
00:07:56.011 --> 00:07:59.572
so just be aware of that I
don't check them very often.

137
00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:03.168
If you have an issue with this course or
you find something like that,

138
00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:05.720
usually people go to DMs to try and
get that to me.

139
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.967
I'm gonna invite you to file
an issue on the repo for this,

140
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:13.034
just because if you have an issue,
somebody else is gonna have an issue.

141
00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:17.225
And then the Frontend Master staff does
a really good job of helping me keep this

142
00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:20.164
up-to-date as well, so
that helps a lot ups as well.

143
00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:23.043
So how this works?

144
00:08:23.043 --> 00:08:26.742
The first portion of this,
we're gonna write everything from scratch,

145
00:08:26.742 --> 00:08:28.364
100% just coded from zero.

146
00:08:28.364 --> 00:08:30.216
The second half of this course,

147
00:08:30.216 --> 00:08:33.312
didn't sound like fun to
reset up vite continually.

148
00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:38.275
So I just kind of basically made you like
little starter projects that basically

149
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:41.623
have all the Node APIs that
this isn't a Node course.

150
00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:44.445
And the vite build process all set up for
you.

151
00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:48.697
Again, if you wanna know more about how to
set up those processes, it's in the intro.

152
00:08:48.697 --> 00:08:52.310
So I have that up in here, you'll see
that I have these starter repos and

153
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.949
these should be empty, right?

154
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:57.345
So if you go to the perf one,
it should like start, but

155
00:08:57.345 --> 00:09:02.271
the initial component is gonna be
something super simple like blah, right?

156
00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:06.385
It doesn't have anything more than just
enough to get the app running itself.

157
00:09:06.385 --> 00:09:09.656
So that is the starter ones,
the completed ones.

158
00:09:09.656 --> 00:09:13.820
You can see here there's more in here
because I have the full Next.js project

159
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.722
finished, the full no
framework project finished.

160
00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.958
The entire point of this class learning.

161
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.551
So if you are struggling with something,
or if you wanna see how I did it versus

162
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:25.056
you did it, by all means that
that is why this is here.

163
00:09:25.056 --> 00:09:28.166
I am not your mother,
[LAUGH] this is not homework, right?

164
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:31.572
We're just joining together
to kinda learn this stuff, so

165
00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:34.441
please do the thing that
helps you learn the most.

166
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.700
If you need to deprive yourself of looking
at the completed thing, then do that.

167
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.884
If you need to look at it to compare
notes, please do that, right?

168
00:09:40.884 --> 00:09:45.527
That is the repo for the projects, I would
say go ahead at this point, go ahead and

169
00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:48.821
clone it locally,
that's what I would invite you to do.

170
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.149
You're gonna have to do it eventually.

171
00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:52.411
So yeah,
there was a couple other things in here.

172
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:58.425
So I have a little database for
some of the Node js samples.

173
00:09:58.425 --> 00:10:02.989
That's here in nodes.db,
and then the globals.css,

174
00:10:02.989 --> 00:10:06.030
I think, is for the next project, and

175
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.084
I think the style.css is for
all of the performance projects.
