1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We did it, we built
a RSC app without any help from any

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.509
framework cuz we don't need no framework.

3
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.243
And I hope you can see,

4
00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:14.726
you could just build this out
entirely into an entire app.

5
00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:18.507
I've given you all of the interreact
workings that you could build your own

6
00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:19.775
framework around this.

7
00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:22.915
I'm hoping you're seeing it's
just not really desirable to do.

8
00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:27.655
[LAUGH] You could, just maybe don't,
maybe something like Next.

9
00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:31.795
So that's what we're about to do,
we're about to just move into Next.

10
00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:35.094
Cuz we don't need no framework,
but we kinda like to have one,

11
00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:36.415
so we're gonna do that.

12
00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:42.278
Some of these notes are genuinely funny
as well, I was sending him to Sarah and

13
00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:46.736
the one that killed her was more
used effects, that should fix it.

14
00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:50.437
[LAUGH] Hot tip, it will not fix it.

15
00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:55.804
Tabs or spaces, I don't care,
that was pretty funny too.

16
00:00:55.804 --> 00:00:59.853
This is my favorite,
who needs comments when you have regrets?

17
00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:05.312
[LAUGH] Cool, so yeah, again,
this is all coming from SQLite,

18
00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:08.821
from the server, which is pretty cool.

19
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:13.782
And then this is a client component
where it's interactive on the client,

20
00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:17.652
so you get kinda both sides of that,
which is really cool.

21
00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:24.914
Okay, so
we just finished on the site here.

22
00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:29.796
This one, RSCs without a framework,
and we're about to do

23
00:01:29.796 --> 00:01:34.789
RSCs with Next.js, so
that's what we're gonna hop into.

24
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:35.823
&gt;&gt; Student: I just wanted to ask,

25
00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:39.227
are there professional developers
using the same tools that we used?

26
00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:41.697
Or are they using different
build instruments and

27
00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:45.653
other pieces instead of Webpack or using
other things, or is this all the same?

28
00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:50.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All the same stuff, yeah,
plenty of people still ship Webpack.

29
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:55.531
There's no problem shipping Webpack,
people still ship Browserify,

30
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.810
believe it or not.

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.519
And again,
if you don't know what Browserify is,

32
00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.419
then you probably have less
gray in your hair than I do.

33
00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.760
That's an interesting project, so
they just called it done, right?

34
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.282
They're not building anything more cuz
they don't think it needs anymore, and

35
00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.844
to be fair, it probably doesn't.

36
00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:13.907
Most devs probably use Vite these days,

37
00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:18.456
lots of them use Parcel,
that works as well.

38
00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:23.120
But yeah, many large, large,
large corporations still ship Webpack, and

39
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.356
Turbopack is kinda the new hotness.

40
00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:29.271
In fact, you are about to use Turbopack,
if I'm not mistaken,

41
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.605
cuz that's what's built into Next.

42
00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:38.390
So RSCs with Next.js,
this is not a Next course.

43
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.543
I just wanna underscore that fact,

44
00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:44.071
we are using Next in an instrument
to teach you React.js.

45
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.391
There is a perfectly great next teacher,
my good friend Scott Moss,

46
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.754
I liked him so
much I moved close to him in Sacramento.

47
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.955
He's only lives about 30,
40 minutes from me now.

48
00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:58.059
So that's your destination,
if you're like,

49
00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.793
I like next, I wanna ship stuff with Next.

50
00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:04.782
It's probably even the next stop on your
pathway here, after you take this course,

51
00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:06.363
taking Scott's would be great.

52
00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:09.021
So I'm going to work basically
around Next, I will try and

53
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.148
explain to you as much
Next as you need to know.

54
00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:15.496
But I'm not gonna teach you all of
the patterns or anything like that.

55
00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:20.736
I'm gonna leave that to the next course
that you teach or that you take.

56
00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:23.376
Yeah, I'm not gonna teach you
how to write great Next code.

57
00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:30.471
What I'm gonna teach is how Next
enables you to write really cool React.

58
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.775
So just mild history for

59
00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:38.543
the kids in the back is that we
had React for a very long time.

60
00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:41.498
And there was no full
stack React frameworks,

61
00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:43.785
didn't exist for a very long time.

62
00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:46.677
And Next kinda came around, and I mean,

63
00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:52.038
I'm sure we could probably point to
other ones, but generally speaking,

64
00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:56.312
you kept kind of your server and
your front-end separate.

65
00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:58.028
And we had things like Meteor,

66
00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:02.125
that was kinda one of the more first
full Stacky sales, Js is another one.

67
00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:05.759
But Next is really the one,
we're gonna take React and

68
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:09.326
move a lot more of that
workload back onto the server.

69
00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:13.163
So it's built by the fine folks of Vercel,
lots of my good friends.

70
00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:18.050
I used to talk at the same
conferences Guillermo, who's the CEO,

71
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.457
very nice person.

72
00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:24.456
So much of the core React team
left Facebook and went to Vercel.

73
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:28.218
So I would qualify the React
project much more as

74
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:32.270
a collaboration now between Vercel and
Facebook.

75
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.537
There's outside contribution,
it's open source and open contribution,

76
00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:41.437
but the lion share of work is
done by those two companies.

77
00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:46.194
So plenty of them still exist at Facebook,
yeah,

78
00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:49.150
there are both companies now.

79
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.374
What else do I wanna say about this?

80
00:04:52.374 --> 00:04:57.396
It's gone through several iterations,
but this latest one is where

81
00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:03.731
it really went full in on, we're gonna be
in React server component first framework.

82
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:07.864
And I explained a little bit at the
beginning, but it's been controversial for

83
00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:10.271
probably reasons that
you just experienced,

84
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:14.419
where you have to opt in to using server
components or, sorry, opt out of them.

85
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.992
They're there by default,
you have to opt into client components.

86
00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:20.067
So this is trade offs, right?

87
00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:24.035
It's really cool, but it fundamentally
alters the way that you write React, and

88
00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:25.256
it's not for every app.

89
00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:28.988
I feel very confident in saying that,
don't use Next for

90
00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:31.339
everything that you use React for.

91
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:38.461
It's okay to use React without Next, I'm
gonna say it's even encouraged frequently.

92
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:41.784
I still write a lot of ten stack start and

93
00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:46.627
other stuff like that, or
just straight up just V stuff.

94
00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:50.187
But there's lots of stuff that
Next is also very, very good for.

95
00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:54.229
So just make sure you have all of
your tools in your toolbox and you're

96
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.980
selecting the one that works best for
whatever problem you're trying to solve.

97
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.367
So you can use Next in kinda
one of two ways, in my opinion.

98
00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:07.249
One is, it owns everything, which is kinda
what we're gonna be doing here today,

99
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.320
where it's your back-end,
your middle-end, your front-end.

100
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.560
It's the whole world,
everything exists almost like rails,

101
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.643
it's your monolith, right?

102
00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:22.202
If you're at a bigger company
where it doesn't make sense to do

103
00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:23.931
a giant Next monolith.

104
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.216
You can do, I don't know if this is
technically correct, but I've heard people

105
00:06:28.216 --> 00:06:32.136
call it this, so I'm gonna keep
calling it that, a middle-end server.

106
00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:37.185
So let's just talk about the Netflix
architecture, cuz I worked on that, right?

107
00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:41.690
There's a bunch of Java microservices,
they all then get coalesced into one

108
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.516
front-end server that then serves
all of the requests, right?

109
00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:47.077
I would call that a middle-end.

110
00:06:47.077 --> 00:06:50.618
The Node.js server wasn't really reaching
out, iIt wasn't really a back-end, right?

111
00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:54.872
Wasn't calling the database, wasn't doing
that, it was calling other services,

112
00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:58.193
then packaging those requests,
and then responding to the user.

113
00:06:58.193 --> 00:07:00.737
I would call that the middle-end,
and it's not really your back-end,

114
00:07:00.737 --> 00:07:01.978
it's not really your front-end.
