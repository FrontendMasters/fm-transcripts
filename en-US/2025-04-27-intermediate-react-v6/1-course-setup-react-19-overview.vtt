00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.356
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So my setup,
I get asked this every time, so

2
00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:04.020
I just put a little note there.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.392
First of all, you will need
Node installed for this class.

4
00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:14.491
I am using 2214, which I think as
of writing is the most current LTS.

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:19.958
In general, I just try and
be on the latest LTS, that's just my MO.

6
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.332
Unless I have some reason to try and
be on something later,

7
00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:25.101
they have some feature that I want
to try out or something like that.

8
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:28.032
But being on the latest
LTS is just good practice.

9
00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:32.873
This should work on anything after
20.15 or 16, something like that.

10
00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:37.756
So if you're older than that, at least
the Node M stuff probably won't work.

11
00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:40.086
But you could just do .m
if you really wanted to.

12
00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:46.020
But suffice to say, you should be
on something later than 20.16.

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.694
I use Fast Node Manager,
I think that's what that stands for

14
00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:49.958
to manage my Node versions.

15
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.671
It's basically an NVM, but any one of
them works fine, I don't really care.

16
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.981
Volta would be fine as well.

17
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:03.970
Let's go with 65% certain that everything
in here would just work out of the box

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.302
with Bun, but I have not tested that.

19
00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:10.460
So good luck, have fun,
if that's your choice here.

20
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.859
And I am about 50% confident that it
won't work with Dino, if that's what your

21
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.214
preference is as well, just cuz there's
some stuff in there that I didn't try.

22
00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:21.242
I'm using VS Code today.

23
00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:25.459
I used to work there, so I signed
a blood contract with the devil that I

24
00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.896
have to continue using VS Code,
so I wanna keep my soul.

25
00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:31.760
That being said, I frequently use Copilot
and Cursor as well, awesome tools.

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.207
But I think when you're learning
something, some of those AI tools can

27
00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:39.589
kinda get in the way by like, do you want,
do you mean this, do you mean this, right?

28
00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:43.243
And it kind of spoils
your train of thought.

29
00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:47.887
So I have turned off completions
during this course, but

30
00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:52.933
generally I actually have completions on,
but that's why.

31
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:56.780
I use Firefox now more than ever.

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.560
I try and support something
anything other than Chromium, so

33
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.244
that's why I'm on Firefox today and
happen for some time.

34
00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:05.938
And I just generally use terminal.app or
the VS Code terminal.

35
00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:09.154
There's no real rhyme or
reason there, it just works for

36
00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:11.566
what I need it for, so
I continue using it.

37
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.665
I'm on Dark+, it's installed,
but not the default anymore.

38
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:18.323
I used the MonaLisa font
with ligatures installed.

39
00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:23.808
So if you see some of my fonts
combining together, that's a ligature.

40
00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.294
I'll show you when I get there.

41
00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:29.134
And then for my terminal, I use, yeah, and

42
00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:34.864
then Cascadia Code is also free if
you don't wanna pay for MonaLisa.

43
00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:38.804
And then all the cool
icons is VS Code icons.

44
00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:43.087
My terminal is zsh,
Dracula theme, Starship prompt.

45
00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:48.070
Let's just pull up my terminal here,
cuz it might be useful to visualize this.

46
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.046
So people always ask me,
where does all this stuff come from?

47
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.945
This comes from Starship.

48
00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.056
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you have
to have what's called a Nerd Font

49
00:02:57.056 --> 00:02:57.854
to make that work.

50
00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:00.576
So the font is Cascadia Cove Nerd Font.

51
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.338
So I left a bunch of links there,
if you're interested,

52
00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:05.071
please feel free to click through.

53
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:07.969
And then I've never had to
put one of these in here, but

54
00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.938
I feel like the industry has moved so
far towards AI that it's worthy to have

55
00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:15.415
a disclaimer of what is and
isn't generated by AI in this course.

56
00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:19.815
Just so
you know what came from my brain and

57
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:23.982
what came from the hive mind of GitHub.

58
00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:29.487
Every line of text in here was
hand typed by me, so that you

59
00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:36.396
can be confident in that every line of
code in the repos is written by me.

60
00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:41.196
The only actual code that exists in
here that I actually used Claude to

61
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:44.521
generate was just all the sample data,
right?

62
00:03:44.521 --> 00:03:48.718
I didn't wanna write 50 lines of SQLite
to generate something into a code base.

63
00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:54.106
So I prompted Claude
to come out with that.

64
00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:58.504
As well as all the SEO on this, because I
just can't stand writing just summaries

65
00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.715
and keywords and AI is very good at that.

66
00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:06.858
So all of that was generated using AI,
just generally my stance on AI.

67
00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:09.743
I work on AI,
neon is a very AI-enabled company.

68
00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:13.464
We power a lot of things like Replit and

69
00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:18.012
some of those other kind
of AI Codegen agents.

70
00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:22.761
I'm continually impressed with
the people that wield AI well and

71
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.103
what they're able to get done.

72
00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:28.274
So I kinda have a double-edged
kinda sword opinion on that.

73
00:04:28.274 --> 00:04:32.686
It's powerful if you are experienced in
the ways of the code that you're writing,

74
00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:35.914
and it's powerful when you know
what you're doing with AI.

75
00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:37.695
And if both of those things are true,

76
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:40.343
I'm really impressed with
what people can do with it.

77
00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:44.463
But if you go into these things with a
shallow understanding of them, then you're

78
00:04:44.463 --> 00:04:48.288
just bound to build really tall houses
of cards that when something breaks,

79
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.874
you're gonna have zero idea how to fix it,
right?

80
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.218
Whereas if it ends up being someone that
helps you write code that you were going

81
00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:55.901
to write anyway, then it's awesome.

82
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:01.086
If it's an intern that's writing code for
you that you don't understand,

83
00:05:01.086 --> 00:05:05.634
you get what you put into it, and
it's kind of what my point there.

84
00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:07.486
So do I use AI?

85
00:05:07.486 --> 00:05:09.552
Yes, it helps me work faster.

86
00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:12.928
It helps me write docs,
emails, those kind of things.

87
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:15.006
But yeah, it's like a manager
reviewing their intern's code.

88
00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:16.591
You are responsible for what you ship.

89
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:18.883
And if your intern ships bad code,

90
00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:23.558
it's because you let them ship bad code,
same thing with AI, right?

91
00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:30.295
So does that make sense,
any questions, concerns, profanities?

92
00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:32.166
All those are welcome.

93
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:37.597
A note about React 19, that's kind
of what inspired me to do a complete

94
00:05:37.597 --> 00:05:43.486
intro to React v9, which actually was
released when 18.3 was still out.

95
00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:48.494
Good news is I went through everything,
19 didn't break anything for

96
00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:52.368
complete intro to React v9,
so we're all good there.

97
00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:54.813
React 19 has been a long time coming.

98
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:59.340
They kind of publicly tipped their hand
a little bit that they were shipping it in

99
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.025
late 2020 22 and they released it in 2025,
so that's quite some time.

100
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:10.846
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
this is kind of how React tends to work.

101
00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:14.419
They tend to release all these features,
they put them in kind of a canary release,

102
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.422
and then they just run
it on Facebook forever.

103
00:06:16.422 --> 00:06:19.010
And once they're confident there,
then they release it to everybody.

104
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.953
That's what they've been doing for
a long time.

105
00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:23.413
19 just took a really long time for

106
00:06:23.413 --> 00:06:28.579
them to get out just because I guess
moving parts and a lot more opinions that

107
00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:34.161
they were kind of baking into this kind
of relatively unopinionated framework.

108
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:38.221
So all this to say is
React 19 shipped recently,

109
00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:42.292
depending on when you're
watching this course.

110
00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:46.388
But recently, for as of writing for
this, but it was actually piloted for

111
00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:49.767
two years before that,
which is say, it's pretty stable.

112
00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:54.583
So even though it's really new,
the stuff that you're working on has been

113
00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:58.941
pretty well battle tested at
Facebook's and React or at Netflix and

114
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.319
those kind of places for a long time.

115
00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.712
Primarily, we're gonna concern
ourselves with React server components.

116
00:07:03.712 --> 00:07:07.882
That's the big thing that 19
came out with, but I'll try and

117
00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:12.298
talk about all the interesting
things that are recent with React.

118
00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.916
So, yeah, the complete intro course,

119
00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:18.384
did cover some of the minor
features of version 19.

120
00:07:18.384 --> 00:07:20.954
It talks about React compiler,
which I don't talk about in here.

121
00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:26.256
So all those things I covered at
the end of a complete intro v9.

122
00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:33.154
So if you want more on that, please just
pop back over there and check it out.
