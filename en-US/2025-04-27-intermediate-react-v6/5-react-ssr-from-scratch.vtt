00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:04.385
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's write some SSR by
hand, because that seems to be the thing

2
00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:08.664
that I like to do, mutual torture
essentially I'm just kidding.

3
00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:12.867
This I actually didn't really
do enjoy writing this stuff.

4
00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:19.505
Okay, so we're gonna make
a new directory here, SSR.

5
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.027
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
I'm gonna open this in code,

6
00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.207
we're gonna do another npm init -y.

7
00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:32.859
We're gonna npm install fastify.

8
00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.347
I don't really care what node
server you're gonna use,

9
00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:40.283
you could just do node HTTP as well,
we'll do that again later.

10
00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:45.951
I generally default to fastify,
it's just the one that I know the best.

11
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.139
But you could do this with Express,
you could do this with Koa,

12
00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:50.596
all those are totally fine.

13
00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.670
React, react-dom, and

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.288
vite, we're gonna need all of those.

15
00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:05.318
Point of caution for those people watching
this later, just be careful of versions.

16
00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:10.968
So let's just take a look at this uh-oh,
we need them completed there we go, okay.

17
00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:15.135
In SSR, in package.json,
sometimes these drift by

18
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:19.681
the time I'd say you watch these,
and when I create them.

19
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.002
So these are the versions
that I'm using now,

20
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.332
if you see weird errors that I'm
not seeing here, then just try and

21
00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:28.271
going back and installing
the versions that I had them at.

22
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.196
All of these, like fastify and fastify
static, don't change too much from release

23
00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.421
to release I wouldn't
worry too much about it.

24
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.594
But if there's a new major release,
you might be suspicious.

25
00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.277
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact, a really easy
thing to do would just be grab this,

26
00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:47.385
paste this is your package.json,
and say npm install.

27
00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:51.609
In fact,
maybe that's just what I'll do right now.

28
00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:58.427
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Package.json, blah,
save that and then just say npm install,

29
00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:03.341
and that'll guarantee you that
you get the right versions.

30
00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:08.745
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go, easy peasy.

31
00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.856
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I was gonna have you put
in here as well, build and start, so

32
00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:15.840
vite build, right?

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.770
That's actually going
to build your project.

34
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.028
Do we need that?
I don't actually remember.

35
00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:27.767
But start,
that's the part that I really care about,

36
00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:30.786
is node, and it'll run server.js, yep.

37
00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:33.513
And then we also did put in
here as well type of module.

38
00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:34.863
So if you didn't put that in there,

39
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.213
make sure you have that in there
let's make that a bit bigger.

40
00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:49.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
let's go make a index.html.

41
00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:57.687
This is gonna look eerily similar
to what you've written before,

42
00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:03.545
and we're gonna say this
is react SSR example.

43
00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:08.782
And I'm gonna have an id "root" here,
and I'm just gonna put.

44
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.376
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

45
00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:18.615
The one thing I'm gonna say before we get
too much further into this server-side

46
00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:23.225
rendering, and then client side hydration,
which we're about to do in just a second,

47
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.369
is extremely sensitive to white space.

48
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.770
So just be suspicious of
that in your head here,

49
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.135
if you see anything about hydration
errors, it's probably white space.

50
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:38.490
So in other words, don't have this, or

51
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.827
you're gonna have a bad time.

52
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:45.339
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you explain why that is,
why is this in the DOI space?

53
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:50.596
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what's gonna happen is
you're going to put your app in here and

54
00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:54.037
you're gonna ship a complete markup, and

55
00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:58.736
then it's gonna have a hash on it,
on the server setting.

56
00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:01.745
I hash it to this and then it's
gonna happen on the client side and

57
00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.366
the client's gonna say, I hash it to this,
and if they don't match it says,

58
00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:08.748
I give up, I'm gonna render it myself,
right, does that make sense?

59
00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.197
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you just lose
the benefit of the SSR content, is that?

60
00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:13.649
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, you get all
the downside and none of the upside.

61
00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:18.658
Okay, so we talked about hydration errors,
we'll get there,

62
00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:22.296
cuz I guarantee you
somebody's gonna see it.

63
00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:25.974
We're gonna do just vanilla,
no JSX, react, again,

64
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:31.391
this would be actually pretty easy to do
with vite, you could just do the --SSR.

65
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.628
It actually has a feature built into
it for server-side rendering apps.

66
00:04:35.628 --> 00:04:39.537
We're just gonna keep things
as simple as possible here cuz

67
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:43.689
the client-side reactor is not
the interesting part of this.

68
00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:50.600
So we're gonna do app.js here and
we're gonna say import createelement as h,

69
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.945
and then we're also gonna
put a useState in here.

70
00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:59.278
I wanna show you that this
actually does translate to

71
00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:02.140
a interactive client-side app.

72
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.301
And then we're gonna do a function app.

73
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:08.151
This is gonna look really similar, we're
just gonna add additional button that does

74
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.779
count because it's reacting,
we love counting things.

75
00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.888
So const count, setcount = usestate 0 or

76
00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:22.318
1, or whatever you wanna put there,

77
00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:27.408
and then we're gonna say return h,

78
00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:32.325
put a "div", null, h "h1",

79
00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:37.612
null, "Hello Frontend Master".

80
00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:45.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: H("p", null,

81
00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:50.489
"this is SSR").

82
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:54.431
And then one more, for good measure,
we're gonna put a button.

83
00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:01.622
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully,
this is making you grateful for JSX,

84
00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:04.230
cuz it gets a bit tedious to write,
doesn't it?

85
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.815
Onclick.

86
00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:15.003
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SetCount(count +1),

87
00:06:15.003 --> 00:06:22.696
and then we'll put 'Count: ').

88
00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:28.141
Notice these are back ticks,
so I'm doing a template string

89
00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:33.171
count to count, and
then down here export default app.

90
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:39.290
I will save at this time, it's only once.

91
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.334
Actually it's the first time I've done,

92
00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:45.376
that's finally the first time I've done
it today, if we're being really honest.

93
00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:49.688
So, a div, inside of it there's
an h1 there's a paragraph, and

94
00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:54.782
there's a button, and the button allows
you to change the text on the button.

95
00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:59.530
Truly, miraculous work here,
changing lives,

96
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.531
that's what I like to tell myself
I'm up here changing lives.
