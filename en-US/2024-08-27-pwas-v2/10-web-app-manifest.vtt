WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.937
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's cover
the basics of the web app manifest so

2
00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:05.700
that we can go and start coding.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.660
So the web app manifest is kind of
the heart of a progressive web app, okay?

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.318
So if you don't have a web app manifest,
you don't have a heart, okay,

5
00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:13.980
you are not a PWA.

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.413
It's a JSON file that defines all the
metadata that will help the browser and

7
00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:25.504
the OS to install the app and have
integration into the operating system.

8
00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:29.803
Actually, it's a W3C spec, so

9
00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:34.118
it isn't a standard, okay?

10
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:36.508
That's why all the browsers
are currently using it.

11
00:00:37.508 --> 00:00:39.838
It is a JSON file, already mentioned that.

12
00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:43.619
But typically,
we don't use the JSON extension.

13
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:48.836
To be honest, if you check on
current PWA is probably more

14
00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:54.380
than half of the PWAs are calling
the file manifest JSON, but

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.729
the official word is to use
the extension.webmanifest.

16
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.093
And that also comes to the MIME type for
the content type,

17
00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:10.210
when you set up your server,
it should use application manifest JSON,

18
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.899
but it accepts anyway,
application JSON as well.

19
00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:21.684
And that's important,
we have to link the file from the HTML.

20
00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:22.868
In which HTML?

21
00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:28.139
Actually, all the documents,
if you're a multi page application,

22
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.979
so you have multiple HTML files,
you actually done all of them.

23
00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.947
Because the installation option
will appear only if the current

24
00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:43.011
document that the user is browsing
has the manifest link, okay?

25
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:47.864
You add the link just with the link
element, as with CSS style sheets,

26
00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:52.072
but the rel says manifest,
that's the difference, okay?

27
00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:55.183
So it's pretty simple.

28
00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:59.852
This one is really important,
because some people think

29
00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:05.323
that if you have an origin domain,
is one origin, one PWA.

30
00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:08.718
But actually, you can have more
than one installable web app or

31
00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:10.753
PWA in the same origin.

32
00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:14.081
If you point to different web app
manifest files, and typically,

33
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.753
when you do that,
you'll have different folders.

34
00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:20.653
I mean it's not mandatory, but
it sounds like a good idea.

35
00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:24.200
And that allows to a pattern
that is not possible or

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.614
is too expensive to apply in
the App Store micro-apps.

37
00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:29.784
Have you heard about micro-apps?

38
00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:35.634
It's kind of a business design pattern for

39
00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:40.651
apps that is being used a lot in China for
example.

40
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.528
Not probably in the Western world,
but with PWA,

41
00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:47.491
you can do that, let me explain that.

42
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:52.132
Let's go back to the coffee store,
or let's talk about Starbucks,

43
00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:53.891
like a big branch.

44
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:57.011
You have a one Starbucks app, right?

45
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:59.311
And then you pick the store,
when you're there.

46
00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:01.970
What if you can install one app per store?

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.950
So when you open that, it's the Starbucks
that near home, Starbucks near work.

48
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.670
So it already knows where
do you wanna order, okay?

49
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.750
Or even, we can go even further.

50
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.276
You can have the app for
one specific soda machine.

51
00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:30.546
Each soda machine can have a QR
code pointing to a domain.

52
00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:35.109
Forward flash, or an ID, and
each ID can be a different app,

53
00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.626
then you install the app.

54
00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:43.885
It's a micro-app, it's an app to engage
directly with that particular device.

55
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:51.805
In app that I need to connect or
select or find by geolocation.

56
00:03:51.805 --> 00:03:54.355
No, no, I'm already pointing that.

57
00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:59.389
And this is free for us, we don't have
a cost, we can create infinite apps.

58
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.365
Just changing the arguments
of the manifest,

59
00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:09.840
we can create infinite apps and again,
in the App Store is not so simple.

60
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.281
I mean, think about this,
if you are Yelp or

61
00:04:13.281 --> 00:04:18.027
an app that serves different businesses,
right now you're

62
00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:23.352
offering the business to be in your app,
but it's a Yelp app.

63
00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.432
But with the PWA,

64
00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:29.072
you can offer each of your business
clients to have their own app.

65
00:04:29.072 --> 00:04:31.512
And you call that once.

66
00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:36.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Going back to
the example of the soda machine, so

67
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.853
do I understand correctly
that the workflow would

68
00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:44.099
be the user scans a QR code on that
particular [INAUDIBLE] machine?

69
00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.188
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Or you have an NFC
tag with a URL, that's another option.

70
00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:53.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then on the soda
company's server, there's a .webmanifest

71
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:59.520
file that's generated on the fly using
like templating to put in specific text.

72
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.235
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's one option,
yeah.

73
00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:01.801
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.

74
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.915
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Or you can have a
statically generated all the manifest file

75
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:08.526
for all the machines, or you can
dynamically generate it on the fly,

76
00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:09.600
it's up to you.

77
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could have
a static site generator?

78
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.000
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah.

79
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.782
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For web manifest generator,
geez, all right cool.

80
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.590
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
that's correct.

81
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.796
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So and again,

82
00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:21.918
this adding is like thinking
out of the box now,

83
00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:25.835
it's not just cloning,
what I'm doing for the App Store.

84
00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.754
I can actually think on other ideas
with this platform that are not

85
00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:36.149
the normal that we found there,
so we can create micro-apps.

86
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:41.579
They can have push notifications,
they can be isolated from other micro-apps

87
00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:47.102
with everything that we mentioned or we
will do, but just for very small things.

88
00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:50.187
Maybe the HTML is just a button,
or something like that.
