WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.002
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So,
if you're looking into your HTML,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:08.040
we have already a toolbar here,
okay, that says button id Learn.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.110
So I can add another button here,
so let's add another button and

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.897
let's call this btnInstall,
okay, something like that.

5
00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:20.258
And we're going to say span
class like we can find an icon,

6
00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:24.100
this is using icons,
I don't know, like, down.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.320
I'm not sure if there is one down,
Install, okay?

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.149
So now we have a button that says Install,
let's try here.

9
00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.335
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, well,

10
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.150
you can add an icon later,
it's not really the important part.

11
00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.244
So the thing is that, okay,
I need now a handler for that, okay?

12
00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:47.158
So well we go to JavaScript, so

13
00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:50.667
I open app.js,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And

14
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.644
again this is vanilla JavaScript.

15
00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:58.534
I'm sorry if you are not comfortable with
this, but I will just do query selector.

16
00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:03.101
Or if you want the old-fashioned
getElementById, it's up to you,

17
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.330
btnInstall, and
I will add an event listener for

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.476
it or an onClick event handler.

19
00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:11.035
Sorry for that.

20
00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.056
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I'm going to
do something, well, what should I do?

21
00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:18.466
Can I request install?

22
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.529
I mean, there will be pretty good
if we can do something like this,

23
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.943
navigator.app.install, something
like that, but

24
00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:29.115
unfortunately, we are not there yet.

25
00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:31.155
So, it's not so simple.

26
00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:36.985
Actually, I need to wait for the before
install prompt event to be fired.

27
00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:44.299
So, okay, so
then that means that we need to listen for

28
00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.901
that event, Window.addEventListener,

29
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.902
It's beforeinstallprompt, okay?

30
00:01:52.902 --> 00:02:00.020
So we wait for that, okay,
so we wait and what?

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.398
What to do with that?

32
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:04.908
Here comes the tricky part, I mean,
it's not difficult, but it's weird.

33
00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:07.858
It's odd when you say, hey, yeah.

34
00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:13.738
So we need to create a global variable,
or a variable that you can use later.

35
00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:19.767
I typically call that bip,
before install prompt or bipEvent.

36
00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:25.018
We started without it, without one,
so null, and when we get it, I'm just

37
00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:31.274
going to save this object that we received
here, you understand why in a sec.

38
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:34.793
So I will take it,
first I can call preventDefault, so

39
00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:38.774
that will prevent the browser
to render any UI.

40
00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:45.749
And then I will say bipEvent = event, so
I'm saving that for later, when is later?

41
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.353
Here, when you click the button,
I will check.

42
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:55.347
If I do have it, I will call an event
from it, it's called prompt.

43
00:02:55.347 --> 00:03:00.240
That triggers the native
installation dialogue, just that.

44
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.456
And if not, I cannot trigger it, so
the only option is make an alert,

45
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:08.601
show in divs saying, hey,
well you need to go install it manually,

46
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:11.180
add to the home screen, whatever.

47
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.535
So for now, I will say,
sorry, do it manually.

48
00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:21.864
Okay,of course,
give the user better instructions.

49
00:03:21.864 --> 00:03:23.275
But it's kind of tricky, right?

50
00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:27.653
So we wait for the event to happen,
we save that as kind of a token, and

51
00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:32.201
then we use that later when
the user wants to install the app.

52
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:36.264
So now if I go back and refresh, if I
click here, I'm sorry, do it manually,

53
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:39.751
I'm sorry, do it manually,
what's going on?

54
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:44.536
The app is already installed, because
it's already installed it's not gonna

55
00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.260
fire the event. It was one of the requirements.

56
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.200
So I need to uninstall the app for testing.

57
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.790
So I will open the app,
you uninstall the app from here, Uninstall.

58
00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.601
Also you can see all your apps if you go
to about::apps, all the apps appear there.

59
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:07.047
Actually, the Edge version of this
is actually better, it's nicer,

60
00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.911
the Microsoft Edge version.

61
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.391
So I need to uninstall the app from here.

62
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:18.471
Okay, uninstall, of course,
getting to the app again.

63
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:23.917
And now let's see, now you can see
my button is back there, my badge.

64
00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:28.398
But now, if I click install here, well,

65
00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:32.120
I have the native dialog, magic.

66
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.647
We have any question?

67
00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:42.220
We should probably put this button
somewhere else, in the HTML, right?

68
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.728
Maybe what I'm doing wrong is
I should close this li and

69
00:04:46.728 --> 00:04:51.050
open another li,
I think that it's a menu, right?

70
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.090
So, okay, now it's a little better,
but that's just CSS, okay?

71
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.130
You can play with that, but
now I can install from here, pretty cool.

72
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:03.986
&gt;&gt; Student: I was gonna ask
about selective CSS for

73
00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:07.026
if it's already installed,
not showing the Install button.

74
00:05:07.026 --> 00:05:10.806
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's a good
thing, because if I install this,

75
00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:16.226
I see the install,
now I don't want that, so let's do that.

76
00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:21.280
So we go to CSS, and what I want,
let me add this to the bottom,

77
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.119
I want to use a media query, okay?

78
00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.539
The media query,
I will write the media query in a sec,

79
00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.479
will actually take the button Install and
they will say display.

80
00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.219
I mean, I can hide it or show.

81
00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.565
I can decide which media query to use,
but probably I will say display none.

82
00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:46.903
So I'm removing it from the visual DOM,

83
00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:51.955
remember it's display something.

84
00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:54.655
Well, here it's called
display-mode in CSS.

85
00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:59.637
When display-mode is standalone.

86
00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:03.207
So when display-mode standalone,
I don't wanna see the button.

87
00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:06.184
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's
how you do that.

88
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:14.324
And it works everywhere, on every
platform iOS, Android, desktop it works.

89
00:06:14.324 --> 00:06:18.184
Have in mind that you might
not be using standalone.

90
00:06:18.184 --> 00:06:21.374
Maybe you're using minimal-ui or tab mode.

91
00:06:21.374 --> 00:06:26.514
Remember to match this value
to your manifest, okay?

92
00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:32.691
&gt;&gt; Student: Is there also a way to,
if you already have the app installed, but

93
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:36.958
you're on the web browser,
like a regular web browser and

94
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:42.116
it's already installed, just not display,
do you know what I mean?

95
00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:43.728
Or say open-
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: No, well,

96
00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:44.655
okay I get it.

97
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.258
Well, there are two answers
to trigger problem.

98
00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:52.720
First, something that we can do is we
can start with this button, actually

99
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.543
the whole the li can or maybe not the li,
because we will see some shift in the UI.

100
00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:04.889
I can start hidden and maybe I can show
the button only if the event is fired.

101
00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.319
That's when I'll say it's probably
not exactly what you were asking, but

102
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.099
I think it will solve the same problem.

103
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.653
So now we say when,
before install prompt happens,

104
00:07:14.653 --> 00:07:20.250
I'm going to take I can take the,
I put it on the button, right?

105
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:27.400
I think so, so btnInstall and
I will say that hidden = false.

106
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:36.500
So now we can even see that actually-,
we are not seeing that actually.

107
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.141
So hidden is fine, right?

108
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.421
The btnInstall,
install everything is fine.

109
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:49.751
I don't have this, I think it may
have the service worker or not.

110
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:55.361
Just in case I will clear the whole site
data, that's good thing to do every time.

111
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:58.957
Also no, I don't wanna be offline.

112
00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:01.627
Come on, we have a working app.

113
00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:05.147
Now I'm still seeing the install,
so let's see why.

114
00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:13.333
I do have hidden, and why I'm
seeing if it's hidden, interesting.

115
00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:21.072
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Because I
think it's a CSS issue,

116
00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:26.082
my CSS is replacing that display thing.

117
00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:30.602
I can change that, or let me change
hidden form that, you got idea?

118
00:08:30.602 --> 00:08:37.972
That it's my CSS here is saying that
buttons should always be display block.

119
00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:43.556
And this is actually replacing the default
behavior for hidden buttons, okay?

120
00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:48.215
That's what's going on,
I should say buttons that are not hidden,

121
00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.140
Can you say that?

122
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.280
This is hidden,
how can you say not hidden?

123
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.870
&gt;&gt; Student: Colon not.

124
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.233
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Colon or not,

125
00:08:56.233 --> 00:09:00.883
I use this not
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We can do that,

126
00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:05.733
it seems little cryptic because it's
not hidden, you start thinking not,

127
00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:08.572
not, of not I think it's a little dirty.

128
00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:12.722
Maybe it's better to work
with classes here, okay?

129
00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:18.339
Or just here for doing this quickly, I can
try work with disable instead of hidden,

130
00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:21.884
just for the sake of this sample,
so let's see now.

131
00:09:25.954 --> 00:09:28.525
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now it's disabled,
but I should change the UI, right?

132
00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:31.965
But now it's disabled and
it is going to be enabled after that.

133
00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:33.703
But working with probably with CSS,

134
00:09:33.703 --> 00:09:36.735
but I didn't answer your
question directly, right?

135
00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:41.299
Another way that you have is
the getInstallRelatedApps that I

136
00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:44.909
mentioned before,
it's a weird name, I know.

137
00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:49.629
getInstalledRelatedApp is an API that
will let you know in JavaScript,

138
00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:51.969
if an app is already installed.

139
00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:57.764
It can be a native app,
it can also be a web app.

140
00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.944
You need to do a couple of things,
actually.

141
00:10:00.944 --> 00:10:05.934
Check if your website, no, there is
a section here that talk about a web app.

142
00:10:07.514 --> 00:10:12.184
The this one tell your PWA about
itself [LAUGH], that's the section.

143
00:10:12.184 --> 00:10:17.183
So, you need to add this to your manifest,
so it's kind of an advance thing.

144
00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:22.086
So you need to add a related application
that points to the same manifest,

145
00:10:22.086 --> 00:10:23.568
to itself.

146
00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:27.992
When you do that, then from JavaScript,
you can check if the PWAs installed or

147
00:10:27.992 --> 00:10:32.228
not, and then turn off, disable or
do whatever you want with your button.

148
00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:36.239
That doesn't work,
unfortunately, in Safari.

149
00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:40.050
In Safari in fact, there is no way to know
that an app is installed, and actually,

150
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.333
because you can install
more than one instance.

151
00:10:43.413 --> 00:10:45.490
So actually,
I put that as one you to know.
