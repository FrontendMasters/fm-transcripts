00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.545
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
after the icons,

2
00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:05.355
something next is talk
about the Splash Screens.

3
00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.598
So when a Splash Screen is just
a mobile app design pattern.

4
00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:09.852
Be careful with mobile.

5
00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:13.787
So it's mobile only that renders a
static image while the app process is

6
00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:14.287
loading.

7
00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:17.936
So it's when you open an app and
you see in that animation,

8
00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:21.300
it's just on a static image
while the rest is loading.

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.874
So on Android it works this way,
they are automatically generated.

10
00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:31.546
So I don't need to do anything to
get a Splash Screen on Android.

11
00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.315
You can't provide your own image.

12
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:39.709
They use just the meta data from a Web App
Manifest, I will show you which parts.

13
00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:45.086
So it looks like this, and
it's taking exactly this information.

14
00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:49.940
It's taking the theme
color from the status bar.

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.395
Then the background color,
it's a property that we haven't

16
00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:59.031
defined in our manifest for
that background that you see there.

17
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.689
Then the icon. 512 preferred there.

18
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.281
And finally, the name of your PWA,
the large name.

19
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.369
And it generates an image with that.

20
00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.564
Now, let's jump into iOS.

21
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:18.206
So on iOS and iPadOS,
I have good news and bad news, okay?

22
00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:20.580
We'll start with the good news.

23
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.803
It won't use the App Manifest meta data.

24
00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.416
I hear you say good news, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:28.599
Because that means that we
can create our own images.

26
00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:31.412
So you can customize with your logo,

27
00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:35.787
you can create a piece of art,
whatever you want, okay?

28
00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:40.241
This is where the good news ends, why?

29
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.123
Well, they are known as Startup Image.

30
00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:45.854
So Apple named them as Startup Images.

31
00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:47.627
We define them through a link.

32
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:53.253
So we have to create the PNG files and
define them through a link element.

33
00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:57.943
Also, for
some reason... I actually reported this, and

34
00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:01.106
no one answered, to the WebKit team,

35
00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:06.251
you must use the deprecated meta tag for
them to appear.

36
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.951
That is deprecated, and we shouldn't
be using that meta tag anymore.

37
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:17.299
So actually, the Web App Manifest spec
replaced that one but yeah, I don't know.

38
00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.032
And here comes the worst problem,

39
00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:24.660
it must match exactly the current
device's screen size.

40
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.134
If the PNG is one pixel more or

41
00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:31.994
less than the current image,
it will ignore it, okay?

42
00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:34.715
On iPad it gets even more complicated.

43
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.731
So let's see the code.

44
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.359
It's apple-touch-startup-image,
and you pass the PNG file.

45
00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.539
And that the first one is the meta
tag that you need to add,

46
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.802
apple-mobile-web-app-capable.

47
00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.564
When Steve Jobs was
presenting Web Apps for

48
00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:54.580
iOS in the video we saw earlier,
he was talking about that

49
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.616
meta tag before the display
standalone in the manifest.

50
00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:04.513
Well, the problem is that we need the
image with the exact size of the device

51
00:03:04.513 --> 00:03:05.148
screen.

52
00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:06.279
And what's the problem?

53
00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:12.880
We have a lot of iPhones with
different screen sizes, okay?

54
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.533
Actually, well, you can see right
now you need to create six images.

55
00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.696
So those are the groups, okay?

56
00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:24.412
I'm just showing you this really
quickly because you will get the idea.

57
00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.701
Also, we need Landscape versions.

58
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:32.970
Fortunately, I'm not sure if you know this
but only Landscape if you have an iPhone,

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.977
the home screen works Landscape
only in some devices,

60
00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:40.744
only on the original Plus
now known as Max version.

61
00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:44.937
If not, there is no Landscape, so
I don't have, I have the Pro only.

62
00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:49.428
So if I go Landscape, you don't see
my icons going Landscape, okay?

63
00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.451
You need the Max for that.

64
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:54.936
So we need two versions for Landscape.

65
00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.658
So for iPad,
we have several iPads available.

66
00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:00.535
This year we have more, even more.

67
00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.235
Hey, we have two kinds of iPad,
there are two kinds of iPad program.

68
00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:06.431
We have the old one, the new ones,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

69
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.218
Portrait and Landscape in that case, for
everyone you need Portrait and Landscape.

70
00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:16.305
And then we have a Split View,
where it can be a third, two-thirds.

71
00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:19.562
So yeah, we have a problem, right?

72
00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:20.696
And also, we have Side View.

73
00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.964
That's when you have one
on top of the other one,

74
00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.294
one window on top of the other one.

75
00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:31.272
And now on some iPads,
you can even have your own size, Any size.

76
00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:33.617
You can resize the window.

77
00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:37.503
So it looks like this,
all the images you want.

78
00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:42.292
And actually, this chart is outdated,
is from a couple of years ago.

79
00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.117
So we have a problem, right?

80
00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:50.556
Because you need to
create more than 20 PNGs.

81
00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:55.078
And also,
the sizes properties is ignored, so

82
00:04:55.078 --> 00:05:01.418
you need to use media queries to
specify them which is kind of whoo.

83
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:05.300
Imagine your HTML should
contain all these things there.

84
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.358
So yeah, it's like we're not
going to do that, right?

85
00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:12.352
So let's talk about two
solutions to the problem.

86
00:05:12.352 --> 00:05:17.490
One, it's called the PWA static asset
generator, it's actually available on npm.

87
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.288
You just run command line,
you create one SVG with what you want, and

88
00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:27.442
some rules, and it will actually
create all the versions for you, okay?

89
00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:30.068
This is a video, so there we are.

90
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:34.383
So of how that works, so
you request that, and

91
00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:38.265
it creates all the images for you, okay?

92
00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:43.179
Static images for you and then it gives
you the links that you need to copy and

93
00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:45.136
paste into your HTML, okay?

94
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.762
So yeah, it is what it is.

95
00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:52.672
But there is another solution,
using some hacky solution but it works.

96
00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:55.356
It's a Client Side Generator.

97
00:05:55.356 --> 00:06:00.816
So using canvas, an invisible canvas or
memory only canvas,

98
00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:07.227
you can draw on the screen at PNG based
on the current device dimensions.

99
00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:13.234
Then convert that into the Data URI and
inject that into the HTML, and it works.

100
00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:18.427
And if you don't wanna do it manually,
there is a library known as PWACompat,

101
00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:22.060
created by the Chrome team
that will actually do that.

102
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.246
That it takes the Web App Manifest and
generates assets for

103
00:06:26.246 --> 00:06:28.126
other browsers as well and

104
00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:33.605
including the startup images on the fly
with JavaScript for iOS and iPadOS.

105
00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:37.470
And actually, it emulates
the Android splash screens for iOS.

106
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.521
The final screen that you get is similar
to the one you get on Android, okay?

107
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.555
Which if you're okay, it what it is.

108
00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:52.203
And in this case, after you
include the manifest in your HTML,

109
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.305
you add the script for PWACompat.

110
00:06:55.305 --> 00:07:00.499
And if you want,
you can even style that image that

111
00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:06.570
is going to be generated just
by using some styles, okay?

112
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.384
So maybe this is the simplest solution to

113
00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:14.769
create a good startup image solution,
okay?

114
00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:20.082
For iOS, PWACompat, okay?

115
00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:22.348
Let me get out of here for a sec.

116
00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:29.489
So if you Google PWACompat, you will
find a couple of, of course, of results.

117
00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:33.709
You have the NPM solution,
and then we have an article.

118
00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:38.029
I'm not sure if you know this guy, okay?

119
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:41.302
That says you shouldn't use
Chrome PWACompat libraries.

120
00:07:41.302 --> 00:07:44.274
And I explain why, okay?

121
00:07:44.274 --> 00:07:48.562
Anyway, you can read my article,
it's from five years ago, okay?

122
00:07:48.562 --> 00:07:51.176
Why?
Because it's actually injecting a lot of

123
00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:54.638
meta tags that are deprecated and
yeah, okay, it's fine but

124
00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:57.453
just have in mind that you
will have that problem.

125
00:07:57.453 --> 00:08:02.281
This is the official article talking
about this thing, how that works.

126
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:06.667
I think they have a video here so
you can see how it looks like.

127
00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:09.470
I don't know why, well, they have
a problem with rotation, there we are.

128
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.620
So you see that's the image,

129
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.099
that's this startup image
generated by the library, okay?

130
00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:20.054
The emoji typer.

131
00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:24.143
If you wanna try this on our app,
we just need to copy and

132
00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:28.587
paste this into our index.html
after the manifest, okay?

133
00:08:28.587 --> 00:08:30.728
After the manifest.

134
00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:35.220
I don't need this,
just the script, okay?

135
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.013
Just that.
So if I run this, now if we inspect this,

136
00:08:39.013 --> 00:08:44.958
if you go to the head, we may find
some other things that we don't have.

137
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.300
We have these meta tags.

138
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.949
So this x5-page-mode,
what is that meta tag?

139
00:08:52.637 --> 00:08:54.700
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I don't know,
okay?

140
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.999
So it's actually a meta tag from 15 years
ago from a device of Sony Ericsson,

141
00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:00.817
whatever.

142
00:09:00.817 --> 00:09:05.437
So I was actually suggesting not to use
this just because you think it's a happy

143
00:09:05.437 --> 00:09:08.307
library, because it's
adding some meta tags,

144
00:09:08.307 --> 00:09:12.442
it's injecting some meta tags that
you don't know what it's doing.

145
00:09:12.442 --> 00:09:14.019
So and they are deprecated,

146
00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:17.313
just that if you know what
you're doing it's fine, okay?

147
00:09:17.313 --> 00:09:21.592
And I'm not seeing any image being
injected because this is Chrome.

148
00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:24.518
So it's detecting that it's
not really an iPhone, so

149
00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:27.962
it's not creating images just for
the sake of creating images.

150
00:09:27.962 --> 00:09:33.098
But if I run this on my iOS simulator,

151
00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:36.245
so if I open now here and

152
00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:40.742
I inspect my iPhone simulator.

153
00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:44.132
So if I go to the iOS simulator and
I run my app,

154
00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:48.785
I refresh my app just in case,
now I go to Safari on my desktop.

155
00:09:48.785 --> 00:09:54.075
So Safari on the Mac and
I will try to inspect my iPhone session.

156
00:09:54.075 --> 00:10:01.128
So now I have my inspector on one side and
my iPhone on the other side.

157
00:10:01.128 --> 00:10:08.482
So if I inspect the head, you can see
that at some points I have two links,

158
00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:15.853
apple-touch-startup-image with
a base64 image embedded there.

159
00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:20.235
For Portrait and Landscape,
it is hacky, okay?

160
00:10:20.235 --> 00:10:25.303
I can see some of your pain faces,
but it works.

161
00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:30.186
So that means that when you install this,
when you install now a new PWA,

162
00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:33.968
it's not going to change
the previous installations.

163
00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:39.358
Now, when I open this,
I see my Splash Screen for iOS and

164
00:10:39.358 --> 00:10:44.418
I don't need to create
100 versions of my image.

165
00:10:44.418 --> 00:10:46.973
&gt;&gt; Student: Sorry,
I'm confused about which solution this is,

166
00:10:46.973 --> 00:10:48.691
cuz it's not using the PWACompat.

167
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.433
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
using PWACompat, yeah.

168
00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:52.193
&gt;&gt; Student: But
you don't want us to use it.

169
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.836
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So I want you to
at least understand what the thing is

170
00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:56.439
doing.

171
00:10:56.439 --> 00:11:01.845
For example, it's injecting this meta
data, Apple Mobile Web App title.

172
00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:05.465
That meta tag is overriding the manifest.

173
00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:10.814
So if you don't know that, I mean,
you may have some problems.

174
00:11:10.814 --> 00:11:15.554
So I mean, the title was kind of click
bait, but they was trying to say,

175
00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:19.125
hey, don't just add it
because it's not harmless.

176
00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:21.095
It's injecting things,
it's doing a lot of things.

177
00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:24.723
So understand what's going on because then
you may have a problem in the future and

178
00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:27.577
you don't know what's going on,
why this is not working.

179
00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:32.561
Because the library is injecting
some meta data that has nothing to

180
00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:36.391
do with the startup image
that you may don't want.

181
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:41.087
Maybe what you want is open source so
you can just take the part that creates

182
00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:45.650
the startup image, the Client Side part,
and remove the rest, okay?

183
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.220
Things like that.

184
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.525
I think that's that's pretty cool.

185
00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:50.992
Just have in mind it was just a warning.
