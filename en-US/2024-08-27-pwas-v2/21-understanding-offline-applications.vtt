00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.509
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We're going to
talk about how to make your app offline

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.370
capable, we know that it's
not mandatory anymore, okay?

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.662
Again, you know that it's not
mandatory for creating a PWA.

4
00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:13.084
And by the way,
what happens if we are offline with a PWA?

5
00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:14.915
Is this guy appearing?

6
00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.779
That's a good question.

7
00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.105
I mean, let's try it not by,

8
00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:24.424
I'm not going to go offline manually,
but I can turn off my server.

9
00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.008
So what happens if I turn off my server?

10
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.572
So now localhost
3000 is not responding.

11
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:35.324
Of course, if I'm in the browser,
I know what happens, so my little guy, but

12
00:00:35.324 --> 00:00:39.149
actually it's not appearing right,
so you need to turn it on.

13
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.808
But we have this our T-Rex.

14
00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.368
But what happens if I try to open the app?

15
00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:48.535
So Codepad masters,
I try to open the app, well,

16
00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:54.189
it's already open, so let me close it,
and if I open the app again,

17
00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:59.368
I'm seeing the message which,
yeah, it's not what I want.

18
00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:04.332
On Android, on the other hand,
we are going to get a default offline

19
00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:09.297
page by default that actually looks
similar to the launcher image,

20
00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:13.235
the startup image that
says you're offline, okay?

21
00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.921
But not on the desktop yet at least,
I think Chrome is changing that, but

22
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.830
it's not we are not there yet,
so maybe we want to offer.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.076
Maybe we don't want our app to
be available offline completely.

24
00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:26.539
Maybe we wanna offer a page saying,
hey, I'm sorry,

25
00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.090
we don't have connection with your logo,
your theme.

26
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.739
There are some newspapers that when you
get into the website and you don't have

27
00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.609
connection, of course, you are not going
to see a news, but you see a crossword.

28
00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.682
Well, let's play a [LAUGH] game.

29
00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:44.674
If we don't have a connection,
let's play a game, okay?

30
00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:46.452
Well, let's talk about that.

31
00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:50.185
It's a large topic,
we will talk about service workers.

32
00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.343
And if you wanna get deeper into that,

33
00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:56.802
there is another Frontend Masters course
that I deliver, that they offer on.

34
00:01:56.802 --> 00:02:02.682
It's called Offline JavaScript,
where we get deeper into the topic, okay?

35
00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:07.119
But you will get the idea,
we will make it work and that, but just

36
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.436
have in mind that it's a big topic.

37
00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:12.557
So let's think about native apps.

38
00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:16.018
When you have a native app from
the App Store, by the way,

39
00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:18.415
some people are changing now the idea.

40
00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:21.785
In fact, from Google they have
a guideline now on their own documents,

41
00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:23.928
they don't talk about native apps anymore.

42
00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:26.940
They talk about store apps,
store based apps,

43
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.395
because you may have an app in the store
that is not completely native.

44
00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:37.065
It can be using cross platform
framework, or it can also be a PWA,

45
00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:42.251
but Max, the title says that
you don't need that app store.

46
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:48.215
We'll see later that if you still
want an app store, maybe you can.

47
00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:51.064
So, but let's talk about native apps or
apps from the store.

48
00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:52.174
How does it work?

49
00:02:52.174 --> 00:02:55.534
So, the app store has a lot
of packages in the cloud.

50
00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:59.910
The package is actually a zip
file with your compiled code.

51
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.020
So, you go and install the bundle,
that's the package.

52
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.572
You install that in your device,
a Mac, iPhone, Android, wherever, and

53
00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.559
then the bundle,
now is client side install, and

54
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:15.636
then it makes API calls to your
web server, that's how that works.

55
00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:19.698
What happens if there is no connection,
if you're offline?

56
00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.226
What happens with your offline?

57
00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:25.228
Well, you cannot make API calls,
they will fail, but

58
00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:30.887
the bundle is already on your client,
on your computer, okay, make sense?

59
00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:32.455
Simple to get.

60
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.403
Classic web apps,
the web apps we are doing every day.

61
00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:40.399
So you have your device, you have a web
runtime that typically it's a browser,

62
00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:44.426
but we know it can be TikTok as well,
so it can be something else or

63
00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:45.634
a PWA or whatever.

64
00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:49.328
And you have a web server and
your web server you have assets,

65
00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:53.696
you have HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
PNGs, blah, blah, blah, SVGs.

66
00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:56.920
You go and
download the web page over HTTPs.

67
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.259
Then that web page is
Loaded into the runtime.

68
00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.977
The runtime, it realized,
I need a JavaScript file.

69
00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:07.614
So it downloads the JavaScript file that
goes to a runtime, then images and so on.

70
00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:10.708
And finally, you get your UI.

71
00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:17.750
What happens if you try to access
the classic web app with no connection?

72
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.259
Before that, that web runtime,
makes API calls, okay, as native apps,

73
00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.223
just the same.

74
00:04:23.223 --> 00:04:28.497
What happens if you try to open
the app and you don't have connection?

75
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:32.370
Nothing, you see nothing,
you see this guy, this little guy, okay?

76
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.835
So, that's a problem with web apps.

77
00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:40.332
If you're offline,
you see the error as we saw before.

78
00:04:40.332 --> 00:04:44.223
So with progressive web apps and
offline progressive web apps,

79
00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:47.042
we have the same web app architecture,
okay?

80
00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:51.937
Initially, we download the webpage,
but here comes the difference.

81
00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:55.330
The webpage comes with something else,

82
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.032
with a service worker registration,
so it goes to the web runtime.

83
00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:07.632
And now, we have two things there,
the web runtime and the service worker.

84
00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:11.089
Actually, we can discuss if the service
worker is below the web runtime,

85
00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:15.178
it's part of or if something different
semantics, it's not really important here.

86
00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:20.163
So then you download JavaScript file,
the service worker will say,

87
00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:23.501
yeah, let's keep that
JavaScript file here.

88
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:29.944
Web resources, images, HTML, yeah,
I'm going to store everything client side.

89
00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:34.916
So then when the web runtime needs files,
they're being served by the service

90
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:40.205
worker, this is a simplification by the
way of all the possibilities that we have.

91
00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.607
So, what happens if we
don't have connection?

92
00:05:42.607 --> 00:05:45.575
Well, first, I always forget this part.

93
00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:50.283
Then, if we have API calls,
API calls go from the web

94
00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:54.899
runtime to the server
through the service worker.

95
00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.670
But the service worker says,
well, this is not for

96
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.031
me, most of the time it says,
no, we need to go to the server.

97
00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:02.359
Okay, let's go, okay?

98
00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:07.380
And if we don't have connection and
we open the app, this is what happens.

99
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.976
So the service worker can still serve all

100
00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:15.638
the assets to render the app,
but not the API calls.
