WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.828
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's get deeper
with the standalone user experience before

2
00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:05.378
talking about offline.

3
00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:10.381
We have already been talking about
the experience, different experiences,

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.714
like minimal UI, full screen,
let's talk about the icon, okay?

5
00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.698
So when you install a PWA on desktop,

6
00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:19.966
your icon will appear as any
other icon in the system, okay?

7
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:24.610
No matter what, it will look
like any other acronym system,

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.078
if it's window, Mac or Linux.

9
00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:30.841
On Android, there are two possibilities,

10
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:34.919
we can get the shortcut,
or we can get a web APK.

11
00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:39.322
So let's try to dig
into these two options.

12
00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:44.568
By default,
let's talk about shortcut icons.

13
00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:48.764
They create a shortcut to a browser's
engine in the home screen,

14
00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.751
only in the home screen,
not in the launcher.

15
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.836
On Android, you have two places,
iOS is kind of the home screen,

16
00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:59.526
and then we have also the gallery.

17
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:06.412
But here you have two places,
the home screen and then the applications.

18
00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:10.169
Incase you are not an Android user,
let me show you that here.

19
00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:23.884
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So this is my
home screen, and this is my launcher.

20
00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.447
I have both options.

21
00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:30.256
Well, a shortcut will only be
available at the home screen, okay?

22
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.850
No icon in the launcher.

23
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.759
So, it's an app experience, but it
doesn't feel like a full app, okay, 100%.

24
00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.020
So it doesn't appear at the apps list,
that's the problem.

25
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.724
So, all browsers use this
method by default, okay?

26
00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:51.266
By default.

27
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:57.094
And from Android 8,
they include a browser's badge.

28
00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:59.455
What is that?

29
00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:04.234
Here I have the same Starbucks PWA
installed with a lot of different

30
00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:05.096
browsers.

31
00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:10.441
What's about that little icon there
that says, this is Edge, actually

32
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:15.971
this is the old Edge icon, and Samsung
Internet browser, Firefox, and so on.

33
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:19.327
And yeah, it doesn't look so nice, right?

34
00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:22.297
We don't wanna see that small icon there.

35
00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:27.053
So what we want is webAPK icons.

36
00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:32.993
WebAPK icons will appear only if
we are passing the PWA criteria,

37
00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:37.529
that right now our web app
is not passing because,

38
00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:42.400
for example,
we don't have the icon set yet, okay?

39
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.910
In this case, the webAPK is
a full Android native package.

40
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.017
Actually, APK is Android package.

41
00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:53.117
If you have ever played with native
Android development, it's the file

42
00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:58.482
format that the Android operating system
uses to install and execute apps.

43
00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:01.840
So it's a full Android native package.

44
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.080
But be careful,
the package only contains metadata.

45
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.064
So it's not going to download your HTML,
CSS and ship that, no, okay,

46
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:14.832
it's just the metadata, the URL,
the name of your app, your icon.

47
00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:22.263
This is kind of mind-blowing,
the APK is installed silently.

48
00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:25.951
Of course, the user has to invoke
Chrome PWA installation, but

49
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:30.276
then we won't see any dialog saying,
hey, do you wanna install this APK?

50
00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:34.003
No, no, it's installed silently.

51
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:34.788
Why?

52
00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:39.527
Because that APK is signed by Google,
by the Play Store.

53
00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:41.593
It has the Play Store signature.

54
00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:46.752
It says, Google is shipping this,
so the browser is

55
00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:52.517
trusting the signature and
installing the app silently.

56
00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:59.820
It will add an icon to the home screen and
also to the launcher, both.

57
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.284
And for that, you need to use
Google Chrome as your browser, and

58
00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:09.495
you need a phone with Play Services,
but most devices have Play services,

59
00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:14.148
but have in mind that there are some
that are not, Huawei devices.

60
00:04:14.148 --> 00:04:19.623
And you need to use Google Chrome,
so if you're using other browsers,

61
00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:24.003
Firefox, Firefox don't have the ability,
the power,

62
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:29.225
the phone number of the Google
person that is responsible for this.

63
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:33.874
But actually, Google is not yet,
unfortunately,

64
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:40.648
offering the webAPK service to other
browsers, only Chrome has it, okay?

65
00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:43.916
On the other hand,
if you have a Samsung device,

66
00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:47.285
because in this case
Samsung has also signature.

67
00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:49.028
If you're using the Internet browser,

68
00:04:49.028 --> 00:04:51.550
I'm not sure if you know that
Samsung has its own browser.

69
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.861
It's called the Internet browser,
Samsung Internet.

70
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:59.753
If on that one, on Samsung devices,
you can also install webAPKs.

71
00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:04.239
I mean, users don't realize if
it's webAPK or shortcut, but

72
00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:08.908
you will get the full experience,
the full Android experience.

73
00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.616
Okay, make sense?

74
00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.870
And something similar happened with
Huawei devices, they're not using webAPK,

75
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.346
they're using something similar,
but the effect is the same one.

76
00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:23.536
When you install PWA on a Huawei
device using their own browser,

77
00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:25.946
you get the full experience.

78
00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.877
Okay, make sense?

79
00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:29.377
Any question on that, on webAPK?

80
00:05:29.377 --> 00:05:33.620
Nope?

81
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.867
So, to finish the process and
finally meet the PWA criteria,

82
00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:41.148
we need to add the icons
to the web app manifest.

83
00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:44.029
So, what is that?

84
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.412
It's actually pretty simple, it's an array
of icons that we define in the manifest.

85
00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:54.097
For each icon you win in the source,
the size is property, and the type, okay?

86
00:05:54.097 --> 00:06:00.676
So some recommendations, because actually,
what are the sizes we need to use?

87
00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:02.455
I mean, the spec, it's agnostic.

88
00:06:02.455 --> 00:06:04.567
It's, do wherever you want, okay?

89
00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:09.122
So every device will try to pick
the closest icon that matches

90
00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:10.827
their requirements.

91
00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:13.840
But for the real world out there,

92
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.110
it's a good idea to have one PNG
in the SRGB color space that

93
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.399
Android is going to use and
desktop is going to use as well.

94
00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:29.536
And if there is no exact icon
available for that particular phone,

95
00:06:29.536 --> 00:06:34.030
it would be the closest one,
and the sizes that I recommend

96
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.730
are at least 192 by 192,
512 and 1024, okay?

97
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.864
I mean, you can just provide one, and
it was just the only icon it has, okay?

98
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:49.611
There are some deprecated sizes, and
actually if you go and ask ChatGPT,

99
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.310
what are the recommended sizes?

100
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.372
I'm pretty sure it would recommend a lot,

101
00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:56.937
because there are a lot of articles out
there on the web that are outdated.

102
00:06:56.937 --> 00:07:01.273
That they will say,
you need to put this and that there,

103
00:07:01.273 --> 00:07:06.482
all sizes that no one is using it anymore,
so it doesn't worth the time.

104
00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:13.259
Also, today, you can also provide an SVG
file, and some platforms will take it.

105
00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.913
WebAPK will take it, and also some
other devices, mostly on desktop,

106
00:07:18.913 --> 00:07:25.336
will take the SVG, so then you don't
need to create different versions, okay?

107
00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:30.171
So on some operating systems, such as
MacOS, it will use the SVG if you have it.
