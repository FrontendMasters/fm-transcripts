00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.958
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: To try to
understand what we're going to do and why,

2
00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:05.926
there are today a couple
of development approaches.

3
00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:10.756
So, you can go with a native
SDKs that Steve was against

4
00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:12.863
at the time [LAUGH] okay?

5
00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.127
By the way, just to finish the history
lesson, a year after that,

6
00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:19.503
Steve Jobs presented the App Store.

7
00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:25.336
Because, actually,
he didn't want developers to create apps,

8
00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:30.334
initially for his piece of art,
if you read the Steve Jobs

9
00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:34.936
biography, he was against
developers doing apps.

10
00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:39.190
Because he said that he had a piece of
art, like the iPhone was a piece of art,

11
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.199
and developers will add
crappy things on top of that.

12
00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.783
So that's why he didn't
want to create an SDK.

13
00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:49.064
The web was a way to offer you,
okay, create web apps.

14
00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:52.694
But then well, that changed for
several reasons and

15
00:00:52.694 --> 00:00:58.055
he created the App Store with this idea
of, okay, I will let you create apps,

16
00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:02.038
but I will go and check one by one and
approve them one by one.

17
00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:04.949
So if you have a crappy app,
I won't let it happen.

18
00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.437
I'm not gonna let it install in my system.

19
00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:09.781
But anyway, so
you can go with Native SDKs, or

20
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.837
you can go with web development, okay?

21
00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:16.508
And you know that when you go
with Native SDKs, you target and

22
00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:21.561
you create an experience that
works specifically in one device.

23
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:25.417
It can be iOS, it can be Android,
it can be Windows, etc.

24
00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.609
And of course, when you go with the web,
you're targeting the browser,

25
00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.376
you know that pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:35.483
In the middle of those approaches,
we used to have, I mean,

27
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:40.705
still there, but
it's not really something cool this days.

28
00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:45.329
Something that was known as
a hybrid development if you have

29
00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.028
heard about the PhoneGap or
Apache Cordoba,

30
00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:53.930
or maybe ionic with capacitor,
that's kind of the one that's

31
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.852
still alive these days that was
mixing Native SDKs and the web.

32
00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:04.144
So it was actually a native app or it is
a native app that enables a full screen

33
00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:09.270
web rendering engine, and then it
renders the whole app within the web.

34
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.980
But it's not hosted on the web server.

35
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.124
It's hosted in the mobile package, okay?

36
00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:18.366
That's kind of the idea of a hybrid app.

37
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.294
On the hybrid app,

38
00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:22.664
the thing is that you are just
targeting the device as well as native.

39
00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:26.012
You're not targeting the browser.

40
00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:30.112
Well, maybe you're thinking
where PWA is there.

41
00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:32.811
By the way,
that's the official logo of the PWA.

42
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.824
And who approved it?

43
00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:36.730
Well, actually,
PWA is just a design pattern.

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.227
So we don't have an organization.

45
00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:40.353
We don't have an owner.

46
00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:42.559
So this is kind of a community logo.

47
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.309
The community one designer created it and
it's open source and

48
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:52.148
a lot of companies including Microsoft,
Samsung, Intel, and

49
00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:54.127
Google started using it.

50
00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:59.721
So it's actually kind of, it became
the official logo of the platform.

51
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.773
With PWA we are targeting the browser and

52
00:03:02.773 --> 00:03:06.647
also devices experience,
and this is important.

53
00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:13.617
A PWA is not just for installation
you can also use it in the browser.

54
00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:17.258
Of course, as a PWA developer,
you can choose that, okay?

55
00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:22.334
So you can, if you want, can force,
I will show you one example of that.

56
00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:26.500
You can force a PWA to be installed, okay?

57
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.993
So you can force the user to install
it and not use use it in the browser.

58
00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:32.071
You can do that.

59
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.514
It's not really a good practice, but
if you have a good reason for that,

60
00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:36.482
it's fine, okay?

61
00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.640
So you can do that.

62
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.744
But by default, it works both
in the browser and in devices,

63
00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:48.950
and the whole idea before actually
start seeing them in action

64
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.977
is to have the best of both universes,
the web universe, and the native universe.

65
00:03:55.977 --> 00:04:01.413
For example, from the web we are going
to take the great idea of links and

66
00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:02.964
discoverability.

67
00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:07.259
So this idea is that, you discover
apps just by Googling the apps or

68
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.632
by ChatGPTing,
[LAUGH] I don't know how to say that.

69
00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:14.102
Asking an AI about an app or
something like that.

70
00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:18.580
It will give you a link, look at this,
or social networks, okay?

71
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.321
The idea of discovering Things
through links, through URLs,

72
00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:25.152
it's something that we
don't have in the app.

73
00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:30.400
I mean, yeah, there are some ways to
integrate, but it doesn't work, right?

74
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.541
You need to go to the app store
to search for native apps.

75
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:40.260
That, going back to Steve Jobs,
easy to deploy.

76
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.310
The web is actually pretty simple, you
just deploy on your server and that's all.

77
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.357
On your web server, you can even use
FTP if you want, like 15 years ago.

78
00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:57.094
It doesn't matter, you just put some
files on a web server and you're done.

79
00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:01.342
Compare with the native world well,
you need to first get approved for

80
00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:05.378
an account, from a developer account,
and pay for that account.

81
00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:10.498
After that, you need to create your app,
test your app, compile your app,

82
00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:14.578
package your app, sign your app,
upload your app, wait for

83
00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:19.713
the QA team to review your app,
cross your fingers, so everything is okay.

84
00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:24.380
For whatever, they say that most of
the time might be good QA thing.

85
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.093
But sometimes, I mean,
it happened to me with a lot of customers

86
00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:33.457
that the answer from the App Store
team was kind of weird, or

87
00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:37.504
you have to appeal because
it doesn't make any sense.

88
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.526
Sometimes they say, no, you shouldn't be
using that icon for that section, and

89
00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:42.120
say, why?

90
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.130
Because that icon is
similar to another one.

91
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.460
And say, no, it's not similar to say
someone saw that didn't like your app, and

92
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.634
it was just no, it doesn't go and maybe
you have a launch, a marketing launch,

93
00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:58.979
and you cannot guarantee that the app
will be there for the launch.

94
00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.612
Thing like that.

95
00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:07.141
Also, as the Steve Jobs said, I'm going to
quote Steve, [LAUGH] it's easy to update.

96
00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:11.338
If you need to change something,
you found a bug, you have a problem,

97
00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:15.413
you just deploy the new version,
you change the file in the server.

98
00:06:15.413 --> 00:06:20.976
On the native side,
you have to of course, compile again,

99
00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:27.003
sign again, package again,
upload again, wait again for QA.

100
00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:30.750
Not just that once the app
store approved your update,

101
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.099
you need to wait for
your users to get the update.

102
00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.380
If your users are like myself,
I have my phone,

103
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.995
I can show you my phone later so
you can be witnesses of that.

104
00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:50.757
Right now, my phone has app store
updates disabled, automatic updates.

105
00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:55.205
So right now, if I go to the app store,

106
00:06:55.205 --> 00:07:01.746
right now I have 385 apps waiting for
update. 385.

107
00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:06.293
Typically I go once per week and
see, okay, and

108
00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:13.582
I wanna see which apps are being updated
and what are they updating, right?

109
00:07:13.582 --> 00:07:17.784
But yeah,
then maybe if you solve the bug,

110
00:07:17.784 --> 00:07:24.157
I would still have it because
I'm not using the latest code.

111
00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:28.698
And also from the web universe I wanna
take all the toolbox that we know,

112
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.205
I mean do you like vanilla JavaScript?

113
00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:34.938
Great, do you like doing apps with React?

114
00:07:34.938 --> 00:07:41.900
That's great next.js, Astro,
php go ahead use whatever you want.

115
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.820
You can use everything you
already know to create apps or

116
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.910
create websites now for
the app world, yeah.

117
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.907
Can I even turn my Astro site into a PWA?

118
00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:57.627
You can turn any site into a PWA,
any site.

119
00:07:57.627 --> 00:08:00.532
It doesn't matter if it's a website, so

120
00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:04.599
if it's currently rendering in a browser,
it will work.

121
00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:07.815
So you can add some layers.

122
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:12.088
And that's the idea of the P the P in PWA
progressive has to do with progressive

123
00:08:12.088 --> 00:08:12.957
enhancement.

124
00:08:12.957 --> 00:08:15.746
The idea is that you can
progressively add layers

125
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:18.608
of functionality on top
of your current website.

126
00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:21.015
Then you can add the functionality for
installation.

127
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:26.327
You can add the functionality for
offline capability and so on.

128
00:08:26.327 --> 00:08:28.806
But if the web is so cool, okay?

129
00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:34.067
We should stay with everything
we have on the web 15 years ago.

130
00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:38.392
So we also need and want some things
from the native universe, okay?

131
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:44.060
For example, offline access again,
our little T-Rex here,

132
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.676
we don't wanna see this message, okay?

133
00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:49.823
That we receive all the time.

134
00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:50.672
It's an app.

135
00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:54.437
So if the user is opening the app,
the user shouldn't see server errors or

136
00:08:54.437 --> 00:08:58.646
messages saying, you're offline, or
you don't have connection, by the way.

137
00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:02.490
Maybe the user is offline,
maybe your server is offline as well.

138
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.394
So that doesn't happen in the app world.

139
00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:06.974
You open an app, the app is always there.

140
00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:12.887
Of course, maybe the app cannot sync
the data, but the app is responding.

141
00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:15.365
We want that from the native world.

142
00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:19.176
Also, we wanna install icon,
not just a bookmark so

143
00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:21.810
I wanna see an icon in my home screen.

144
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.578
I wanna, put it whatever I want.

145
00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:28.322
I wanna organize that as
part of my normal apps.

146
00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:30.444
And I wanna standalone experience.

147
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:34.727
I wanna get rid of the browser
user interface that is

148
00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:39.508
taking space on my screen, and
also it makes me sometimes

149
00:09:39.508 --> 00:09:44.307
it's tempting me with that
URL bar to go somewhere else.

150
00:09:44.307 --> 00:09:47.936
Okay, so
I'm getting out of the app easily.

151
00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:53.022
So I wanna be in a standalone app with my
own standalone window, and integrate with

152
00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:58.423
the system, with the operating system,
and that's the next step, OS integration.

153
00:09:58.423 --> 00:10:02.425
I wanna be appear in the Alt tab,
in the task switcher.

154
00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:07.243
I wanna get push notification
messages when my app is closed.

155
00:10:07.243 --> 00:10:13.895
Well, maybe I wanna be the default
handler for a file type.

156
00:10:13.895 --> 00:10:16.769
I wanna be a PDF reader.

157
00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:19.709
I'm a PDF converter web app.

158
00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:24.334
Well, I wanna integrate with the operating
system, so every time you are right

159
00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:29.045
clicking on a PDF file, you can see my web
app, and you can open my web app, okay?

160
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.411
And also performance and user experience.

161
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:36.872
So that's something that we wanna get
from the native universe as well,

162
00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:41.258
that feeling that also Steve Jobs
was saying they feel, or

163
00:10:41.258 --> 00:10:46.919
they look like iPhone applications,
so he was talking about that as well.

164
00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:52.860
So, they will look and act exactly
the same as the apps on your iPhone.

165
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.706
So, then PWA, the web app platform.

166
00:10:57.706 --> 00:11:02.643
Now, let us get the best
of both universes.

167
00:11:02.643 --> 00:11:06.419
That's why for a lot of situation,
it's better on the website,

168
00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:10.623
it's better than the native app
because you have all these advantages.

169
00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:13.030
We're not yet
talking about distribution and

170
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.671
the business side of the distribution
part and being on the App Store or

171
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:20.574
not being on the App Store because
sometimes you cannot be on the App Store.

172
00:11:20.574 --> 00:11:27.196
For many years the App Store didn't
accept cloud-based gaming platforms.

173
00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:31.302
So for example,
we had Amazon Luna at the time,

174
00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:35.100
Google has a stadia that now it's gone,
but

175
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.915
Microsoft has Xbox cloud gaming platform.

176
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:45.455
And where you can actually play games in
the cloud, so Xbox games in the cloud,

177
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:50.525
and you can connect a gamepad
also on iPad, on your desktop.

178
00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:55.843
And the problem is that because
they're not accepted in App Stores,

179
00:11:55.843 --> 00:11:58.875
they couldn't create an app for that.

180
00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:02.554
Well, the answer was the PWA.

181
00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:08.386
Microsoft created a PWA for
the Xbox Cloud Gaming Solution.

182
00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:11.031
You can use an iPad,
you can install the app,

183
00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:15.077
it's full screen because you go
to a full-screen game experience.

184
00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:18.537
You can use a gamepad and
it works perfect.

185
00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:23.616
Okay, so there are some business
situations where there is no other way.

186
00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:28.888
And because of my expertise as a PWA
developer, consultant, and expert,

187
00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:33.843
sometimes I did a lot of consulting for
companies that are on the edge.

188
00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:36.649
Companies that they had to
get out of the App Store.

189
00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:41.666
So they had this business recent
legal problem where they couldn't

190
00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:47.311
be in the App Store, so they had to
create the best possible PWA experience.

191
00:12:47.311 --> 00:12:51.861
And sometimes, again,
it's not just about the extreme cases,

192
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:54.766
it's just some simple business issues.

193
00:12:54.766 --> 00:12:59.903
And also sometimes when you're creating
an app for that doesn't need to be so big.

194
00:12:59.903 --> 00:13:05.426
You're creating an app for a coffee store
here in we are in Minneapolis right now,

195
00:13:05.426 --> 00:13:09.040
so let's say we open a coffee
store here in downtown.

196
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.584
It's a small coffee shop.

197
00:13:10.584 --> 00:13:15.121
So do I need to hire a mobile
developer for iPhone, for Android,

198
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:17.987
just to create an app for making orders?

199
00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:22.653
Maybe we already have a website that
I have someone that is managing

200
00:13:22.653 --> 00:13:25.913
the website maybe it's
a WordPress website.

201
00:13:25.913 --> 00:13:27.387
Yeah, but we want an app.

202
00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:32.881
Well, you can create an app easily in just
a few hours users can install the app it

203
00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:38.540
will look like any other app, you can
have notifications, you can have payment,

204
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.729
the same as a native app for that small
shop, you don't need the App Store.

205
00:13:43.729 --> 00:13:47.845
Just for a really small shop
in anywhere in the world.

206
00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:53.506
So there are a lot of situations
where the PWA platform is a good one.
