00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.179
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: The title or

2
00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:06.614
the subtitle of this course is
you don't need the App Store.

3
00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:10.922
But you know, mostly if you
are dealing with the businesses and

4
00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:14.428
your clients,
sometimes they want the App Store.

5
00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:20.400
Well, you can go to the App Store if
you want keeping all the advantages.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.956
For that, you need to create
the webapp-launcher package.

7
00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:28.946
It's a native package that renders
a browser runtime in standalone mode

8
00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:31.577
that will load our PWA from the cloud.

9
00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:35.897
We won't ship, as with PhoneGap or
Apache Cordova as a hybrid,

10
00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:39.265
the HML,
we will still keep the same advantages.

11
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:43.711
The difference is that the icon,
instead of coming from the browser menu,

12
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.908
it's coming from the store, okay?

13
00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:48.906
Of course, you need to follow all
the rules from the store, right?

14
00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.150
So there are some tools available,
you can use it manually.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.978
You can create this manually
if you know Xcode and Swift,

16
00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:59.104
Android Studio and Kotlin, or .NET and C#.

17
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:02.593
You can create your own packages for

18
00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:06.782
different stores and operating systems.

19
00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:09.502
You can use some CLI tools,
or you can use PWA builder.

20
00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.306
What's PWA builder?

21
00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:14.762
A website that will do that for you.

22
00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:18.044
PWA builder.com is open source.

23
00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:23.667
It's also available as a CLI and
let's Cover it quickly,

24
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:30.806
so I will open PWA builder.com,
by the way, it's a Microsoft Project.

25
00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:37.329
And you can see here, you can ship
your PWA to App Stores, Windows,

26
00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.940
the Microsoft Store,
the App Store, Google Play Store,

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.113
Android and Meta for
the Meta Quest for Meta Horizon.

28
00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:51.095
Once the deal,
you enter the URL of your PWA.

29
00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:59.636
So we can go and try to create
the Scooch app packages, let's start.

30
00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:03.451
It will first check your
PWA to see if it's correct,

31
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:08.321
if you have all the things you need,
it will give you suggestions.

32
00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.990
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's wait for
that.

33
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.765
So, now it's giving me some suggestions
on things that I might change,

34
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.599
action item, but there are no big errors.

35
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.648
The manifest, I can add more features
to the manifest, the service worker,

36
00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:29.929
I have a service worker,
capabilities that I'm using and so on.

37
00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.336
It's a still running test.

38
00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:38.735
So, basically with that button
package of stores, there we are.

39
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.323
We are ready to package for a store.

40
00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:46.295
So I can click here and
say okay, what do you want?

41
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.593
The Windows package, the Android package,

42
00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:55.494
where PWAs are first-class applications,
iOS package, Meta Quest package,

43
00:02:55.494 --> 00:03:00.375
and you say, 'Okay,
let's make the Android package,' okay?

44
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:01.829
What's the package ID and

45
00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.938
then you have a form with things that
have to do with the Play Store, okay?

46
00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:09.966
Squoosh name, short name,
do you wanna get the source code for

47
00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.547
Android Studio in case you
wanna change that manually?

48
00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:17.898
Then you get not just the file,
it's called the AAV, the Android build for

49
00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.955
the Play Store,
you can get the source code in case.

50
00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:25.511
In case you wanna, if you know Kotlin,
Android Studio, and you wanna change that.

51
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.030
And when you're done, download a package,
and it creates a zip file ready for

52
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.724
the store.

53
00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:35.979
Of course, you need to pay for
the store, get the publisher account,

54
00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.538
follow the rules, and
download the package, that's all.

55
00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:45.834
And it works also for for Apple, for iOS,
you need to, it's more experimental.

56
00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:49.708
The one for Apple,
it just experimental, but it works.

57
00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:54.418
Need to check, then, of course, the rules,
because technically you can, but

58
00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:57.882
you need to check if the content and
the app, the service and

59
00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:02.203
the business that you have inside
the app follows the App Store the rules.

60
00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:06.777
&gt;&gt; Learner: So the advantage of that
is that you don't have to release new

61
00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:08.399
versions to update.

62
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.535
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Exactly because
you will update the app in the store only

63
00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:14.653
if you change the metadata.

64
00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:17.291
If you change the content of your app,

65
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.423
you shall deploy new app as
with the browser installation.

66
00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:25.318
And there you have the some apps
that are actually using it, Tiktok,

67
00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:30.103
Twitter, Facebook, they're using this to,
probably to wrap some or to package.

68
00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:33.987
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: There are PWAs for
the stores.

69
00:04:33.987 --> 00:04:36.228
Typically they have light versions.

70
00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:40.591
Tiktok lite,
Twqitter lite are actually PWAs, okay?

71
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:46.117
Remember that not every web app
can be published in app stores,

72
00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:50.294
so you need to get into
another whole business.

73
00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:56.235
In my website, third.Dev, I have
a session that I did for a conference.

74
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:57.512
It's free, it's available there.

75
00:04:57.512 --> 00:05:01.588
It's one hour thing only on
how to publish PWAs to the app

76
00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:04.635
stores in case you wanna get more on that.
