WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.048
So now it's time to try our own website,
our own lab, our own PWA.

2
00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:11.756
So we're going to work with an app,
it's called Codepad Masters.

3
00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:13.220
Let's just restore some notes.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.747
While you're coding, you can say, I need
to learn more about Service Workers.

5
00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:19.837
Okay, just your notepad.

6
00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:22.741
It should work offline,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.223
It's just a Vanilla web app.

8
00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.445
It's very simple, really,
really simple, okay?

9
00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.217
Just one HTML, one CSS, one JavaScript.

10
00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.444
Because what we want is to
understand the concepts around,

11
00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:37.146
how to convert that into a web app, but

12
00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:42.998
have in mind that you can apply what we're
going to see to any web app that you have.

13
00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:47.217
No library, no framework, no dependencies,
no build process, no nothing, okay?

14
00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:49.056
But it's not a PWA.

15
00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:51.283
Again, it can be installed
as an app on desktop, but

16
00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:52.710
it's not passing the criteria.

17
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.047
So we will solve the problem, okay?

18
00:00:57.047 --> 00:01:00.517
So, remember, we will work on this repo.

19
00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:02.862
You need to download the Initial Code.

20
00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:07.594
Okay, go to the branch,
Initial Code, to get the code.

21
00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:12.475
So, if you have already done that,

22
00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:18.301
because I already gave you the URL before,
I think I don't have it.

23
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.183
So I will open VS Code, and
you will see something like this.

24
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:28.400
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So it's just
an index.html, nothing too fancy.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.293
We have a UL that has a list and
a form, and

26
00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:37.795
then app.js that is listening for
DOMContentLoaded and

27
00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:42.508
in some event listeners,
and rendering nodes.

28
00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:43.137
That's it.

29
00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:46.097
So what I need, this is important,

30
00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:51.937
because remember that I mentioned
that the PWA criteria needs HTTPS.

31
00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:55.866
And you say, well, that might be
a problem if we wanna run this locally.

32
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:59.511
There is one exception to that rule,
is localhost.

33
00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:04.763
If you are running a localhost,
you don't need HTTPS, and

34
00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:07.142
you can still pass the PWA criteria.

35
00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:11.871
But also that means localhost,
and exactly localhost,

36
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:16.206
not your IP address, 1.27.0, no, no, no,

37
00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:21.937
not the name of your computer,
no, no, exactly localhost, okay?

38
00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.788
So that means we need a server.

39
00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:29.078
So we need to serve this web
app with a server, okay?

40
00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:33.320
So if you're a web developer,
you probably know how to do that.

41
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.014
I have a plugin to do that
I call library load all.

42
00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:41.589
If you don't have a plugin,
if you have Node.js installed,

43
00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.184
you can execute npx serve.

44
00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:48.266
npx server will just create
a server on the current folder.

45
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:52.878
And yeah,
you can just directly open localhost:3000.

46
00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.437
So this is how it looks like.

47
00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:58.730
I mean,
I can add things like Add workshop.

48
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.442
I can go and get some lunch.

49
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:04.533
So I just take some notes,
nothing really fancy.

50
00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:05.586
I can delete the notes.

51
00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:08.384
And you can see I don't have
the icon to install here.

52
00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:11.751
I have a Zoom icon bookmark,
but not the install one.

53
00:03:11.751 --> 00:03:17.411
And if I'm going to save and share,
I have the Install Page as App.

54
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.466
The other one was kind of different,
it was actually saying the name of my app,

55
00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.623
install Codepad Masters, for example.

56
00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:29.141
And that is because I don't have
the minimum that I need to make this work,

57
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.856
okay?.

58
00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:32.966
So I'm missing one piece.

59
00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:36.129
Do we have any other place where I
can actually check that I'm missing

60
00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.737
that piece?

61
00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:43.089
Yes, and that's gonna be our best friend
while developing PWA, is DevTools.

62
00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:47.981
So I need to open DevTools and
I need to work with the Application tab.

63
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.004
That's gonna be our best friend.

64
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:53.940
In fact, you can drag on these tabs,
I'm not sure if you know this.

65
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.824
But I encourage you to drag application
and typically put it after Console, so

66
00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:04.085
Elements, Console, Application, because
we will work with applications a lot.

67
00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:06.510
An application has a lot of sections.

68
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.297
The first one is saying Manifest.

69
00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:15.482
Actually, this is the one that will tell
you if you're passing the criteria or not.

70
00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:20.234
And you can see that we start
seeing a lot of error saying, hey,

71
00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:23.654
installability, the page has no Manifest.

72
00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:25.406
We have an error here, here, here.

73
00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:30.227
So basically, yeah, it's not a PWA, okay?

74
00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:32.593
We have that thing there.

75
00:04:32.593 --> 00:04:37.417
Another way to know if you're a PWA or
not is to use Lighthouse.

76
00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:41.221
Lighthouse, it lets you create
a report on your web app.

77
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.160
Probably, you have used it for
performance,

78
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.889
cuz it was pretty useful there.

79
00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.123
And you can analyze the current page.

80
00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:55.529
And you can see that when you create a
report here, you can specify the sections.

81
00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.656
I will unselect all of them and
I will select Progressive Web App.

82
00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:03.443
There is a section on making
a report on progressive web app.

83
00:05:03.443 --> 00:05:08.352
So it will tell you how good or bad are
you right now as a progressive web app.

84
00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:17.209
So if I analyze the page load,
It will reload the page and do some tests.

85
00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:23.699
And, well, there are yellows there.

86
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.422
By the way, it's saying that this is going
to be deprecating the feature because now

87
00:05:28.422 --> 00:05:32.231
they're changing the criteria,
but anyway, it's still there.

88
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.954
I mean, if we have a green checkmark here,
it means we are.

89
00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:39.047
We don't have the green, we are not a PWA.

90
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:42.164
And here,
it gives us all the problems that we have.

91
00:05:42.164 --> 00:05:45.074
Actually, we have nothing, okay?

92
00:05:45.074 --> 00:05:47.749
Well, the only thing that we
have is the meta viewport tag.

93
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:52.051
It's the only thing that it says,
yeah, yeah, you have one list.

94
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.475
But we are not a PWA, okay?

95
00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:57.694
So we need to move one step further.

96
00:05:57.694 --> 00:06:04.837
By the way, question for you, do you know
why we are using this viewport meta tag?

97
00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:07.181
Does anyone know why it's there?

98
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:11.116
I'm pretty sure that you're using it,
because when you create a new HTML,

99
00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:13.821
that you said, okay,
I'm going to create an HTML,

100
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.912
and you create something like this,
it's there, right?

101
00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:21.459
So every new template has
that viewport meta tag, but

102
00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:25.210
do you know what that is,
or why is it there?

103
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.311
&gt;&gt; Student: The only
time I've worked with it,

104
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:30.545
it had to do with like Apple
retina screens and the DPI.

105
00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:36.339
And so needing to set some sort of,
I think you had it in the other HTML,

106
00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.399
the initial resolution or what not.

107
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.843
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I mean,
we are close, but

108
00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:42.889
it's not exactly with resolution.

109
00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.231
We are close with, when you say Apple,
it's actually not for Apple,

110
00:06:47.231 --> 00:06:48.636
but Apple created it.

111
00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:51.694
So this was an invention of Apple.

112
00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:54.812
So before the iPhone,

113
00:06:54.812 --> 00:06:59.576
I was doing mobile web at the time.

114
00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:04.978
We used to have mobile websites,
mobile browser and

115
00:07:04.978 --> 00:07:09.030
a mobile website, because websites,

116
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.570
if you open a desktop website,
at the time,

117
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.639
actually, it didn't fit on the screen,
okay?

118
00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.502
Steve Jobs said that in
the video that we saw.

119
00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:25.259
Steve Jobs said, it's a full Safari,
it's a full desktop Safari.

120
00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.111
Remember he said that.

121
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:32.531
Well, because it's a full Safari,
what happens is this.

122
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:35.897
I mean, it's important for
PWAs to understand that viewport meta tag,

123
00:07:35.897 --> 00:07:38.022
because we will change it later.

124
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:42.087
So if I open our web app,
and this is a spoiler for

125
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:45.371
later,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I'm going to open,

126
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:46.802
this is Codepad Masters, okay?

127
00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:49.558
It looks nice, okay?

128
00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:52.526
I mean, what happens if I install it?

129
00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:53.221
Good question.

130
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.663
If I add it to the home screen,
Codepad Masters?

131
00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:59.534
Well, first,
it doesn't contain an icon, it's an S.

132
00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:01.816
S for, I don't know why,
[LAUGH] but it's an S.

133
00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:04.353
And then you look at the title,

134
00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:08.657
Store notes is taking the title,
that's why the S.

135
00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:10.641
Yeah, I'm not sure I liked it.

136
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:13.235
And if I open it, it opens in Safari.

137
00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:15.704
I'm still seeing Safari here.

138
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.217
So it's not a PWA, okay, for sure.

139
00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:21.724
But now,
let me remove the viewport meta tag.

140
00:08:21.724 --> 00:08:23.688
I think you will understand what happens.

141
00:08:23.688 --> 00:08:27.436
So I don't have the viewport meta tag,
or let me comment the viewport meta tag.

142
00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:30.177
And I'm going to refresh.

143
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:31.375
Can you see the difference?

144
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:33.762
Can you spot the difference?

145
00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:36.968
Now, everything is really small, why?

146
00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:41.388
Because by default,
if you don't have a viewport meta tag,

147
00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:46.588
mobile browsers, including Chrome
on Android, Firefox on Android,

148
00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:52.847
and Safari on iOS will think that you're
a website that was created before 2007.

149
00:08:52.847 --> 00:08:57.041
And it's optimized for desktop,
not for mobile devices.

150
00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:00.378
It's not responsive or
it's not mobile-specific.

151
00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:05.438
So that means it's emulating
a viewport of 980 pixels wide.

152
00:09:07.158 --> 00:09:08.798
That is kind of a desktop screen.

153
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:12.098
And then, of course, it's shrinking that,
because it doesn't fit.

154
00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:14.248
So that's why everything is really small.

155
00:09:14.248 --> 00:09:18.276
So when you are adding the viewport
meta tag, you are saying, hey,

156
00:09:18.276 --> 00:09:22.244
I want the width of the viewpoint
to be the same width as the device.

157
00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:25.825
I wanna match my viewpoint
with the real device.

158
00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:28.099
That's what I'm saying here, okay?

159
00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:30.615
That's why it's important to have it,

160
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:34.543
mostly if you are doing mobile websites,
mobile apps, okay?

161
00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:35.870
Any question on that?

162
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.176
So now we are back to a better experience.
