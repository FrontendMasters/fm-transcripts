00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.703
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Hello,
my name is Maximiliano Firtman, Firt on X,

2
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.710
Firtman on other social networks.

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.699
We're going to talk today about PWAs,
about web apps, installed web apps,

4
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.312
progressive web apps and

5
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:18.230
all that stuff that will let us
maybe get out of that app store.

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.544
So first, really quickly,
something about myself and

7
00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:25.359
my history doing web apps and PWAs.

8
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.645
I'm from Argentina,
I live in Buenos Aires, and

9
00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:31.069
I've been a mobile web developer.

10
00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.359
So I have started as a web developer,
doing HTML first,

11
00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.979
then adding some JavaScript, then adding
some backend, PHP, ASP and so on.

12
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.891
And Actually,
a long time ago, 1996, right?

13
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.943
And I've been also doing a lot
of web apps, more than 150,

14
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:54.181
that were published over these
decades of doing websites.

15
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.061
And also, I'm an author.

16
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.376
So I've been authoring 13 books.

17
00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:04.376
Actually, there is 14th
that will appear next.

18
00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:08.700
I authored more than 70 courses
on different topics but

19
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.796
mainly they are around web development,
mobile development and web performance.

20
00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.860
And because I also started
doing mobile apps around 2001,

21
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.275
that's actually before the iPhone
appeared, before the Android appeared.

22
00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:33.095
One of the things that I always liked was
this way to merge my two technologies.

23
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.373
The web and the mobile space at the time,

24
00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:39.424
that was actually the only
platform that was supporting apps.

25
00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:41.142
So I was merging those things, and

26
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.408
actually that's kind of what
we're going to talk today, okay?

27
00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:50.104
Merging the web and the mobile space or
at least it started like that.

28
00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:56.304
And you can see a lot of books with a lot
of translations on different languages.

29
00:01:56.304 --> 00:02:00.996
And some of them are actually
on the topic that we will cover.

30
00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:05.732
So I also authored the learned PWA kind of

31
00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:10.611
interactive ebook published web.dev,

32
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:14.666
so it's a Google Chrome website.

33
00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:19.667
There is no official PWA reference
because we will see that later, but

34
00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:25.719
as a spoiler, this is not a framework,
this is not a library, it's not an API.

35
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.179
So it's not owned by anyone.

36
00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.899
So learn PWA at web.dev is a resource.

37
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.684
We will cover all the foundations
that is actually published there, but

38
00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:39.736
there are much more that you
can continue learning there.

39
00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:44.832
But I have been writing and
teaching about PWA for a while,

40
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:52.386
so I, for example, authored this cover
article on net magazine, a resting piece.

41
00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:57.010
Well, it's a printed magazine,
it doesn't exist anymore, but

42
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.446
I was actually writing about PWA for
many years.

43
00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:05.286
And by the way, I really like that cover,
I didn't design the cover, right?

44
00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:08.326
I just wrote the technical article.

45
00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:12.533
But because it has that DNA idea, and

46
00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:17.446
the center of the DNA is the W the web.

47
00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:22.798
And the whole thing here is that
PWA is just the DNA of the web.

48
00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:25.528
That was the idea behind this design.

49
00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:29.008
I think it's a good, let's say,

50
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:33.928
abstraction of what we will cover today,
okay?

51
00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:38.290
So PWA is just the web,
it's the DNA of the web.

52
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.921
So, at Frontend Masters, so
I have a lot of courses on Frontend.

53
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:50.033
I will link to some of those courses
at some points during this workshop,

54
00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.842
this course, because there
will be more API usage that we

55
00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:57.661
won't have time today to cover.

56
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:00.467
But if you're interesting you can go and
get there.

57
00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:04.490
Also, I have some mobile app courses on
the native side, the dark side, okay,

58
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.407
not the website.

59
00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:10.357
So, I have some Swift [INAUDIBLE] and DART
courses as well because I have experience

60
00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:13.127
also doing mobile apps
in the native world.

61
00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:17.941
So that will that helps me actually
understand the power of the web,

62
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.817
and, of course, also the challenges.

63
00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:22.727
So what are the limits?

64
00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:25.652
So I hope that we can
today talk about that, and

65
00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:30.647
then also have some backend courses
on PHP and Go, for example.

66
00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:36.427
So we're going to cover, we're going
to start talking about what's a PWA.

67
00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:39.678
Or if it's a PWA, a web app,
an installable web app,

68
00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.064
a home screen web app.

69
00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:43.394
Okay, we'll talk about that first.

70
00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:45.914
What's the current state of the platform?

71
00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:48.474
So compatibility, mainly.

72
00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:50.254
We are going to see this in action.

73
00:04:50.254 --> 00:04:54.864
So I wanna show you live samples of
installing and using the things.

74
00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:56.814
Mobile and desktop installation.

75
00:04:56.814 --> 00:05:01.110
How do we install PWAs?

76
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.502
So we will see how the process works
before actually doing our own PWA.

77
00:05:06.502 --> 00:05:09.952
Then we will actually
work with the project.

78
00:05:09.952 --> 00:05:13.142
So we will have a colab,
we have a small project.

79
00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:18.024
It's a vanilla JavaScript project, and we
will convert that website, or, let's say,

80
00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:22.416
upgrade that website into a progressive
web app, in to installable web.

81
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:27.576
That will be the process and
we will see each step one by one.

82
00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:32.352
So starting with installation, we will
make that web app offline, so then we

83
00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:37.576
don't see this little T Rex that right now
is the the icon of the offline web, right?

84
00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:44.919
So, we wanna get rid of our
nice T-Rex from our web app.

85
00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.983
And we will see some UI and
UX advanced techniques to make our

86
00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:55.453
web app more app-like,
to have some more app-like experience

87
00:05:55.453 --> 00:06:00.129
before finishing with publishing and
distribution.

88
00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.573
So we will have the discussion of stores,
what's going on, how we can improve

89
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:10.865
installation and maybe what's next for
the platform in the next few years.
