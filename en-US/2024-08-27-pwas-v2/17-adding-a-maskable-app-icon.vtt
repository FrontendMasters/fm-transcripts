00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.953
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so
maskable.app, that was the idea.

2
00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:09.853
Actually, it's a PWA, you can open
an icon file, see how it looks like.

3
00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:11.919
So you can take any icon you have here.

4
00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.440
Actually, I do have the icon on
our project in the icons folder,

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.792
we do have an icon.

6
00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:22.698
So that's the icon, so we can see that,
yeah, maybe it doesn't fill and

7
00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:26.813
I can see here there are some options,
like see a ghost image,

8
00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:30.712
you can see in different shapes
how my icon will look like.

9
00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:36.174
So you realize that maybe we
need to work with that, okay?

10
00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:38.075
So we're going to do that.

11
00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:42.840
So let's go to the code now and
let's add the icons collection.

12
00:00:45.138 --> 00:00:47.344
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So, it's an array.

13
00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:53.472
In the icons folder, we have two icons
here for testings, which is okay.

14
00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:57.383
So we create objects with source, so

15
00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:01.303
it's icons/icon-512.png.

16
00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:05.861
The sizes property is the same
property that we have in img or

17
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:11.256
the picture element, actually,
the source of the picture element.

18
00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:18.627
This is 512 by 512, always square,
and the type, image/png.

19
00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:21.472
And I have two at this point, okay?

20
00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.040
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: 1024 by 1024,
okay?

21
00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:31.477
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Do
we have any maskable one?

22
00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:36.799
Not yet, so I'm going to create one, okay?

23
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.938
How can I quickly know if this is working
before actually installing the PWA?

24
00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:43.603
Chrome, remember Chrome?

25
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:47.292
Well, we can go to localhost 3000,

26
00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:52.824
open DevTools in the Application tab,
in the Manifest tab,

27
00:01:52.824 --> 00:01:58.478
I have a way to debug my manifest,
so I can see all the details.

28
00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.798
It's really my computed app ID.

29
00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:05.481
The start URL, the color, I have some
properties that I haven't used, and

30
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.349
I can see here my icons,
so they're working.

31
00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.359
And also here I have a check mark,
Show only the minimum safe area.

32
00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.714
I can see that I have a problem, okay?

33
00:02:16.714 --> 00:02:17.735
That I need to solve.

34
00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:20.091
But this is a quick way to see that.

35
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.785
Another quick way is
use the iOS simulator.

36
00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:26.746
So, let me go back to the iPhone,

37
00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:30.713
that looks bigger on the screen.

38
00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:32.242
Let me close the iPad.

39
00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:37.051
So if I refresh, and if I try to
add this to the home screen again,

40
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.757
I should see the icon.

41
00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.248
That means it's working.

42
00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:43.307
On iOS, it's fine,
I don't think I need, I mean,

43
00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:47.289
it's adding some rounded corners,
but yeah, it's an iOS thing.

44
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.418
I mean, it looks fine, right?

45
00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:50.852
Looks good.

46
00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:55.545
So now my Codepad Masters look
good when I'm trying to get into

47
00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:59.620
the home screen with the similarities,
not simple.

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.688
Cmd+Shift+H will actually do that for me.

49
00:03:03.688 --> 00:03:05.810
If the gesture is not simple, okay?

50
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.727
It will work, so
you can see the icon there as well, okay?

51
00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:10.831
Here.

52
00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:14.365
So let's make the maskable
version of the icon.

53
00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:19.121
So I will use this app, Maskable.app.

54
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:25.546
The Maskable.app has two versions,
the Viewer and the Editor, okay?

55
00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:30.149
Right now we need the Editor,
because we have already viewed that.

56
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:35.456
So you go to Editor,
the first step is to upload a layer.

57
00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.594
So I'm going to upload my current icon.

58
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:47.985
So I will go and
take PWA&gt;webapp&gt;Icons&gt;1024, that one.

59
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:51.785
And we see that, yeah,
it doesn't look nice,

60
00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:55.966
here I can check on every
possible shape on Android.

61
00:03:55.966 --> 00:04:00.206
So what, do I need? I need to add more
padding. Until I'm happy.

62
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.782
And yeah, maybe the background is not
what I want, but here I have the layer,

63
00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:04.953
this is the background.

64
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.476
So I need to just click here,
and try to change the color.

65
00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:14.597
I do have a color picker, so I can go,
pick the color, voila, have it.

66
00:04:14.597 --> 00:04:18.145
And I export this, and I'm done.

67
00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:19.530
So, simple.

68
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.752
So I export this and it says,
okay, which version do you want?

69
00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:26.355
Well, they have a rounded issue,
they should round the number.

70
00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:31.115
But anyway, I know actually the author,

71
00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:34.927
so I can send a Tweet to him later.

72
00:04:34.927 --> 00:04:35.852
So, which version do you want?

73
00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:39.350
Typically, for this one, it's 512.

74
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.483
That's the one that we 
typically use for the, but

75
00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:45.825
you can use any number actually,
it's going to be resized.

76
00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:50.369
Okay, download it, I will download
this here, icons, maskable_icon,

77
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.360
let's call it maskable_icon.

78
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.970
Let's use the same
pattern like kebab case,

79
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.618
this is maskable-icon-512.

80
00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:06.069
Okay, cool, let's go back here,
and I need to add a third one.

81
00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.255
I'm not replacing the other one, okay,
because we still need the other one.

82
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:16.369
So I'm just adding another one
that will have another purpose,

83
00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:21.585
maskable, that is now
the maskable-icon-512.

84
00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:24.519
And with that, we are done, okay?

85
00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:29.292
So now if I try this here,
I have these two versions, and

86
00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:33.657
if I show only the minimal,
I can see that this one is okay,

87
00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:38.246
because this one is a maskable one,
so I'm good now.

88
00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:43.215
On Android, it will get the best
possible icon on any shape.
