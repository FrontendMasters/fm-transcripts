WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.499
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So pre-requisites,

2
00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.748
just a web app development
experience will work.

3
00:00:04.748 --> 00:00:07.616
So if you have already created
an app in any platform,

4
00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:12.229
it doesn't matter any library, if you're
a backend developer it's gonna be fine.

5
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:17.988
If you just understand the basics of HML,
CSS, and JavaScript, you're good to go.

6
00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:21.115
Some basic JavaScript,
we will write some JavaScript, but

7
00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.784
it's not going to be a big deal.

8
00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:25.252
You will have also some
snippets to copy and

9
00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:27.593
paste in case you don't wanna write it.

10
00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:30.861
It's a good idea to have a Chromium
desktop web browser that I'm pretty sure

11
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:32.967
that if you're a developer,
you already have.

12
00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:38.152
It can be Google Chrome,
Microsoft Edge, Opera, or another one.

13
00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:43.065
Not because we will focus on Chrome,
because it has the best

14
00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:48.387
debugging tools for
PWAs ever compared with Firefox or Safari.

15
00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:49.779
It's much better.

16
00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:52.406
So of course,
if you have Safari on the Mac or

17
00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:57.463
if you have Firefox on any platform, it's
fine and we will see how that works there.

18
00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:02.632
But for debugging purposes,
probably we will focus on Chromium.

19
00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:05.414
A code editor,
I will use VS Code but of course,

20
00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:07.718
you're free to use whatever you want.

21
00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:11.927
Some optionals that I will explain later.

22
00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:16.098
If you're on a Mac,
you may wanna install Xcode.

23
00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:22.320
I mean, it's not mandatory but we will use
that for simulating in iOS and iPadOS.

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.227
So I will show you how you can use
the iOS simulator, the iPadOS simulator.

25
00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:32.796
Also, you have the visionOS simulator if
you want, that's for the Apple Vision Pro.

26
00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:36.835
And you can see and
test your PWA there, okay?

27
00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:38.821
So I will show you how to do that.

28
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.999
And also optional, Android Studio.

29
00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.217
For the same thing, this is not macOS,
it can be macOS, Windows, or Linux.

30
00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:48.681
Also, even Chromebooks depends
on the Chromebook you have.

31
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:53.473
You can install Android Studio, and
I will show you later how to enable and

32
00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:55.260
set up Android emulators.

33
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.852
So then you can also test even
if you don't have a device,

34
00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:06.087
you can test on those operating systems
and see how your web app is installed.

35
00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:08.027
How your web app works offline and

36
00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.775
how your web app integrates with
your operating system, okay?

37
00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:12.666
But that's optional,

38
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.569
if you don't have it or if you don't
wanna install it right now, it's fine.

39
00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.092
So this is the repo that we
will use today, github.com,

40
00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:24.631
Firtman that's my last name,
frontendmasters-pwa.

41
00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:31.068
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: There,
have in mind there are several branches.

42
00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:38.013
The main branch that you have actually has
the final code, so here I am in the repo.

43
00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:41.828
So if you're in the main branch,
this is actually a final code,

44
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.595
that's something that
we will get at the end.

45
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:50.244
So if we wanna start from scratch and
follow along the course,

46
00:02:50.244 --> 00:02:55.787
go to the starting-code branch,
and you can fork this one or

47
00:02:55.787 --> 00:03:00.152
just download the Zip file and
start with that.

48
00:03:00.152 --> 00:03:03.175
Remember, this is Vanilla JavaScript so
there will be no dependencies.

49
00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:05.849
You don't need to run npm install,
you don't need anything.

50
00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.115
It's just HTML, JavaScript.

51
00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.290
And you have also, by the way,

52
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.329
a copy of the slides there in
case you wanna follow along.

53
00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.986
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Why is it worth
learning PWA apps when true Cross Mobile

54
00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:21.727
solutions like Flutter exist?

55
00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:23.642
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay,
so that's a good question.

56
00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:28.357
First, we are talking about different,
let's say nature.

57
00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:31.624
First, you mentioned Flutter, okay?

58
00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:36.818
Flutter these days is actually
compiling as an Android native app.

59
00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:40.703
So you can compile an Android
native app and go to the App Store,

60
00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:44.531
you can compile an IOS app, but
also you can compile a PWA app.

61
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:48.097
And actually, let me tell you something,

62
00:03:48.097 --> 00:03:52.566
in Google I/O 2024 so
that's the annual event.

63
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:56.585
There was only one Flutter session,
What's New in Flutter.

64
00:03:56.585 --> 00:04:02.951
And the What's New in Flutter session
actually was under the web track,

65
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.970
not the mobile track,
which was actually really weird.

66
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.715
Actually, the web track was
actually following the web app PWA,

67
00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:16.086
Chrome thing and
Flutter was actually there.

68
00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:18.864
I mean, this is not information,
it's my opinion.

69
00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:23.861
I think that Flutter as a platform
to create native app for

70
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.234
the store,
might not have the brightest future,

71
00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:33.353
I think they're trying to push
Flutter as a PWA platform.

72
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:34.660
As a way to create PWA.

73
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.807
It creates PWA with web assembly this day,
so it complies to web assembly.

74
00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:43.710
So actually, if you're using Flutter,
you may wanna also learn PWA.

75
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.851
Because everything that we will see
today will actually be on top of your

76
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:52.555
Flutter application in case you wanna
compile your Flatter to the web platform.

77
00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:53.600
But anyway,

78
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.681
I think that we may go back to that
question at the end of the workshop, okay?

79
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.560
And see the reason, okay?

80
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.960
Because forget about
the PWA part of Flutter,

81
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.157
let's go back to the original
question of being native.

82
00:05:09.157 --> 00:05:13.608
The first situation is that you
are forced to go to the App Store,

83
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:18.306
which might be something good but
also sometimes it's a problem for

84
00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:22.198
several reasons, legal reasons,
business reasons.

85
00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:26.924
You have to share 30% of the money
you're making if you're making

86
00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:31.254
money with the contents of the app,
with Google or with Apple.

87
00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:33.240
It can be 15%, it depends on the case.

88
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.306
But anyway,
on the web platform you don't need to.

89
00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:42.308
So I think that let's go back to
that question after the workshop and

90
00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:45.136
see if we can together find an answer.
