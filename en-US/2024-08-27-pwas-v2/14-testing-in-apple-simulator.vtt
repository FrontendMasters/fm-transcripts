00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.302
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well, for iOS, I
already mentioned that you need to install

2
00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:07.658
Xcode, so the iOS simulator that I've
been using, is actually part of Xcode.

3
00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:14.448
You download Xcode from the Mac App Store,
it's free, you need a Mac, okay?

4
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:19.225
It's not available for Windows or
Linux and now you understand why,

5
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:22.201
because it's not a real virtual machine.

6
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.036
It's actually using the Mac OS,
as its base and of course windows and

7
00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.353
Linux are not compatible with that layer,
so that's why it's not working.

8
00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:35.053
So you just download the Xcode and
that includes the simulator and

9
00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:39.850
when you have the simulator from
here you can open new ones, okay?

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.300
And you can open another one on an iPad,
for example.

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.882
So we can try this on an iPad, you can try
this on the vision OS on iPod, Vision Pro.

12
00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:53.849
We have a Vision Pro simulator,
where you can try your web apps as well,

13
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.044
and it will work also with local host.

14
00:00:57.044 --> 00:01:00.947
Here on iPad, I wanna show you something
else, so that's why I'm opening an iPad.

15
00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:06.437
So I will also go to localhost 3000,
I will install it from the share menu,

16
00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:12.193
add to home Screen, same experience,
I don't have the icon yet, that's okay.

17
00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:16.429
So I have here my,
PWA as a really large iPad but

18
00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.983
I wanna show you that I can go with for
example, a split view.

19
00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:28.345
And it can work side by side with
other apps like any other native app.

20
00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:33.652
And when I look here,
my Code pad app appears like another app,

21
00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:35.865
so now it's a native app.

22
00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:41.738
So, even if I go in landscape,
I went landscape, how?

23
00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:45.742
Well, you have an icon here,
you go landscape and also its command,

24
00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:49.070
right and left,
something similar happens on Android.

25
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.891
So, it can be half and half,
one third and two thirds, okay?

26
00:01:54.891 --> 00:02:00.739
And of course in that case, responsive
design, it's the one that you wanna apply

27
00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.694
to change the design of the layout of your
app, as if it's a desktop window, okay?

28
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:11.900
But it's pretty cool that you can have
that and look at this, if you open, if you

29
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.220
install your PWA twice, you need to do
that twice unfortunately for this trick.

30
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.833
Remember that you can install the same
PWA more than once on iOS and ipados.

31
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:28.363
Now, I can change my app so
I can close this one, and

32
00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:33.778
say that I wanna split
the view with the other PWA.

33
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.985
So now I have,
two completely different instances,

34
00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:39.058
they are not sharing the storage.

35
00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.754
So if you're looking local storage,
they're not sharing the storage.

36
00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:46.297
You can use the drag and drop APIs to drag
and drop elements between both instances.

37
00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:51.264
They have their own IndexedDB,
database, their own file system,

38
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:56.524
their own push notifications,
completely independent, okay?

39
00:02:56.524 --> 00:03:01.935
Things like that and as I mentioned
before, when you have the simulator or

40
00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:07.624
even your real device connected to your
Mac, you can use Safari for desktop.

41
00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:12.184
And in the Develop menu,
you can see now your iPad Air and

42
00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:15.582
your iPhone, in this case simulators and

43
00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:20.361
we can inspect them from here,
so I can remotely inspect.

44
00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:22.252
I have the console, okay?

45
00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:25.702
But for example, I don't have
an application tab like in Chrome, so

46
00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:28.034
I don't know if my manifest is working or
not.

47
00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:32.721
I don't have any debugging tool for
that, but for CSS,

48
00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:36.030
for HTML and all of that, it will work.

49
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.297
&gt;&gt; Learner: I'm sorry I
missed the how to access the,

50
00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:40.209
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: The list?

51
00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.794
&gt;&gt; Learner: For, yeah simulator or
the iPhone Simulator.

52
00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:47.619
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: To
use the simulators or

53
00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:52.098
to connect your Safari to your
Debugger to the Simulator?

54
00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:52.929
&gt;&gt; Learner: The Debugger.

55
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.244
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: The Debugger,
so you need to be in Safari, for Mac.

56
00:03:56.244 --> 00:04:01.947
So, you should see Safari there and there
you go to develop Menu and then this list.

57
00:04:01.947 --> 00:04:05.694
And maybe, you have a face of,
I don't have a develop menu,

58
00:04:05.694 --> 00:04:07.542
which maybe it's an option.

59
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:10.276
By default,
if you have never debugged with Safari,

60
00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:11.932
you don't have a develop menu.

61
00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:16.692
So you first need to go to Safari
settings and developer and

62
00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:21.064
then you need to allow the developer,
now actually,

63
00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:25.554
no I'm sorry it's not developer,
it's in Advanced.

64
00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:28.792
In Advanced, is show feature for
developers,

65
00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:33.785
that will enable the developer menu
there and also develop menu on top.

66
00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:39.099
And here you should be able to see your
connected Apple devices in this case,

67
00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.433
I have an iPad simulator and
iPhone simulator.

68
00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:47.458
But if you connect your iPhone or
iPad through USB or even wireless, you

69
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:53.092
can even do the same with your real iPhone
and debug your real iPhones remotely.

70
00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:57.963
This is known as the remote debugging.
