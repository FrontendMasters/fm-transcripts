WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.029
Now I will give you an exception
to what I said 40 seconds ago.

2
00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.632
I said that it has no relationship with
PWAs, but actually there is one exception,

3
00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:11.240
iPhones.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.865
Safari and iOS does not support web push
notifications unless you install a PWA.

5
00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:22.598
If you install a PWA, that PWA,

6
00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:28.686
the installed version can request
web push notification permission.

7
00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:34.653
But not Safari, the browser,
because it's Apple, I don't know.

8
00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:36.293
Actually, it took a while to get there.

9
00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:39.753
It was one of the most
requested features for Apple.

10
00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:42.027
Hey, we want push notifications for PWAs.

11
00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:45.908
Well, the answer was, okay,
you got it, but not in Safari.

12
00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:50.689
So you have to push your websites
into installing the PWA, so

13
00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:53.332
then you can use web push, okay?

14
00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:58.623
Well, the service worker
has a scope defined.

15
00:00:58.623 --> 00:00:59.911
What's a scope?

16
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:03.281
The scope is an origin, something that
we have already defined, and a path.

17
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.701
So it can be your whole domain, or
it can be a folder in your domain.

18
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:12.189
That means that that
middleware that we installed,

19
00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.329
that network proxy can be responsible for
your whole domain, or only for a folder.

20
00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:26.249
And then you can have other service
workers managing other folders, okay?

21
00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.508
That's the idea.

22
00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:30.333
The idea is that when you
define a service worker,

23
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.697
when you register a service worker,
then it will manage all

24
00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:37.818
the pages within the browser and
within the installed app from that scope.

25
00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:41.280
So if you have a PWA installed,
when you open that PWA,

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.159
the service worker will say, that's mine.

27
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.232
It's part of my scope,
it's mine, I'll take it.

28
00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:50.842
That's kind of the idea.

29
00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:54.922
Any page in the scope will install
a service worker, and after installed,

30
00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:57.796
it can serve all the files
requested from the scope.

31
00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:02.155
And after installed, it can serve all
the files requested from the scope.

32
00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.955
Only one service worker
is allowed per scope.

33
00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.985
If you try to install another one,
you are removing the previous one.

34
00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:14.749
There is a whole process there.

35
00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.132
For more advanced situations,
you can get there.

36
00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:22.487
And WebKit, it's adding another
complexity to this, partition management.

37
00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:27.524
I'm not sure if you have heard about this
partition management before on WebKit,

38
00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:30.081
because of security, privacy reasons.

39
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.855
Partitions are only when you have iframes.

40
00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:39.415
So if you don't have iframes,
a partition is a domain.

41
00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:42.133
It's the same, okay, it's the same.

42
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.730
But if you have iframes,

43
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.613
each combination of domain plus domain
of the iframe is called a partition.

44
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:51.673
So what's the idea with that?

45
00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:55.369
There is a whole blog post
if you wanna get with that,

46
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.983
service workers partition WebKit.

47
00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:05.386
Workers at Your Service, okay, yeah,
that's the title for service worker.

48
00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:09.675
Well, here they explain how Safari
implemented service workers.

49
00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:14.046
And they talk here about partitions,
here somewhere.

50
00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:19.638
So it has to do with,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Increase

51
00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:23.836
this a little bit,
it has to do with iframe.

52
00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:28.107
So if you have webkit.org,
example.com, an iframe of that,

53
00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.756
that is taken as a partition.

54
00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:35.866
So then it will be one instance of
the service worker will be applied there.

55
00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:39.021
And if you have another page without the
iframe, it will be a different partition,

56
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:40.159
a different service worker.

57
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.549
It has to do with privacy, okay,
but it doesn't matter for now.

58
00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.313
&gt;&gt; Student: Are there any security
threats related to service workers or

59
00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:49.609
does the scope thing help with that?

60
00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:51.529
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's
a good question.

61
00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.084
Actually, when the service
workers appeared,

62
00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:58.099
there was a big fight in the community.

63
00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.306
Twitter was on fire, actually.

64
00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:03.739
And on fire,
not just because of developers, but

65
00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.612
because of browser developers.

66
00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:10.932
The service worker was an API
pushed by the Chrome team.

67
00:04:10.932 --> 00:04:14.242
The Safari team was against it.

68
00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:17.063
And there was really hard tweets.

69
00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:20.658
What we know in public,
I don't know what happened in private, but

70
00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:22.654
actually Apple didn't want that.

71
00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:24.861
And the main reason was security, okay?

72
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:29.088
Well, actually, because,
of course, it sounds too powerful.

73
00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:33.990
Because you have a lot of thousands
of service workers installed that you

74
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.654
don't know, and they can wake up,
they can execute, go in the background.

75
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:43.173
But actually,
the spec already tried to, of course,

76
00:04:43.173 --> 00:04:46.059
solve all the security concerns.

77
00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.119
That's why they cannot be
executed by themselves.

78
00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:55.200
The user needs to open a new document for
that domain so that service worker can

79
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.064
appear, or the push notification to
be received, and things like that.

80
00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:06.184
To be honest, in the probably seven,
eight years of service workers,

81
00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:12.216
we haven't seen big security problems or
things that have appeared.

82
00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:15.472
So it seems like they are pretty secure,
and

83
00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:20.321
we couldn't find a way to break
the service workers, actually.

84
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:24.436
There is a discussion of background
execution, battery usage.

85
00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:25.745
We can discuss that part.

86
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:30.478
But in terms of security,
I don't think there is any security risk.

87
00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:33.477
But all right, there is always risk, but

88
00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:36.828
nothing has been found yet,
and I think that.

89
00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:41.669
But I understand, I feel the pain,
the feeling, okay?

90
00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.476
I have the feeling also that,
hey, this is too powerful.

91
00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:48.784
How is that we can install servers
on users' computers without their

92
00:05:48.784 --> 00:05:50.056
knowledge, okay?

93
00:05:50.056 --> 00:05:54.326
Well, it's a server that
responds only to your origin.

94
00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:59.564
So you shouldn't, you cannot read
things that happens on other tabs,

95
00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:01.672
on other websites and so on.
