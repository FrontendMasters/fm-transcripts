00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.339
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: What is a PWA?

2
00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:02.710
What's a Progressive Web App?

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.480
Does anyone know or can define?

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A web app that you
don't need to download from, or

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.758
that you don't need to go
through the App Store?

6
00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:12.990
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: They is a PWA,
right?

7
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.090
So what is it?

8
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.702
So it's an app that doesn't need
to be in the App Store, okay?

9
00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:21.649
What else?

10
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.055
Let's see if we can.

11
00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:27.675
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A combination of
service workers, manifest JSON and

12
00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:28.966
some other stuff.

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.659
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay,
you like technical definitions, so

14
00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:37.346
it's a combination of service workers and
manifest and okay, we'll see, we'll see.

15
00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:41.966
I'm not saying yes or no yet, I'm just
trying to pick some, pick your brain,

16
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.759
to see why you're here also.

17
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:46.829
So you have some idea of
what we're talking about.

18
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.265
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Web app that's designed
to be mobile first, and as simple and

19
00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:55.599
small, that will build
features progressively.

20
00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:58.630
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, so
you you took the P, the P in PWA,

21
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.162
that's if you take Progressive.

22
00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:02.162
There are a couple of things there.

23
00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.952
The first definition that's coming
from the chat mentioned mobile, right?

24
00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:10.112
So that's kind of the first focus
of PWA were actually mobile.

25
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:12.050
Well, I will try to define this and
of course,

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.452
my definition has changed over the years.

27
00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:17.742
My current definition is that,
it's a design pattern.

28
00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:22.026
So again, it's just a design pattern to
use different APIs and specs from the web

29
00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:26.247
platform to create installable offline
capable standalone apps for mobile and

30
00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:27.264
desktop devices.

31
00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:31.134
That's my definition,
because we don't have a definition.

32
00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:37.363
So because it's kind of
a marketing name that started for

33
00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.168
selling things to businesses.

34
00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:42.175
I mean, we need to sell something new.

35
00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:47.197
So we go to the CEO or the CTO and
say, hey, we have to do a web app at

36
00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:52.632
PWA because we already have a website,
we need to create a PWA.

37
00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:56.732
But it's just a design
pattern around APIs.

38
00:01:56.732 --> 00:01:59.453
It's like a mobile first or

39
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:05.499
it's like responsive web design,
it's not really an API.

40
00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.365
It's just a design pattern recipe,
a collection of ideas and

41
00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:16.249
techniques that will make a web app
installable and offline capable.

42
00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.849
We will see that with time.

43
00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.867
The offline capability
requirement became more flexible.

44
00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:29.862
We are kind of focusing these days and
maybe for the future,

45
00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:35.511
on installability and
the standalone, so being an app.

46
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:40.848
The offline capabilities becoming
kind of optional, to be honest, okay?

47
00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:45.288
And it's ideal, so this platform is ideal
for all those apps out there that the only

48
00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.987
thing that the app is doing is
consuming web content or web services.

49
00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:51.591
So they are downloading
the JSON part in the JSON,

50
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.138
rendering the JSON on the screen,
that's all.

51
00:02:54.138 --> 00:02:59.081
So we don't need Swift, Kotlin,
native code to do that.

52
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:05.771
We don't integrate, we're not
listening for Bluetooth, Beacons,

53
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:11.860
while we are using now a hardware
connected through infrared, wherever.

54
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.320
So we are not doing that,
it's just rendering content.

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.142
And that means that, when you go native,
when you have these apps,

56
00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:22.789
you're actually building your own browser,
it's kind of that.

57
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:27.749
And we already have a browser that
it's ideal for rendering web content.

58
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.589
Rendering rich text,
rich information, and that's the web.

59
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:37.189
So that's why I encourage you
to check all the apps you have.

60
00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.729
I'm not saying that every
app should be a PWA, but

61
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:45.721
there are a lot of apps that should be
a PWA and it should be pretty good.

62
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:50.311
So again, PWA is not an API,
it's not a framework, it's not a library.

63
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:52.741
It's just a term to
describe a design pattern.

64
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:57.991
And even let's say for
example Apple doesn't use the term at all.

65
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.730
There were just one or
two mentions in Apple's history.

66
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.813
Lawyers, they mentioned that as a way to
describe that they have an alternative to

67
00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:06.860
the App Store.

68
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.246
And I mean, in a legal document, they
say we have PWAs, but the WebKit team,

69
00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:18.482
at WWDC, the Apple annual event,
they never use the term PWA.

70
00:04:18.482 --> 00:04:24.501
They use web apps or home screen
web apps or installable web apps.

71
00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:29.221
And I'm seeing in the past few months
that also Google and Microsoft,

72
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.709
so Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge.

73
00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.021
I'm seeing a shift also
into using less PWA and

74
00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:39.677
more web apps or installable web apps.

75
00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:44.310
But again, it's just the same,
we are just talking about the same idea,

76
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.347
it's just a name issue, okay?
