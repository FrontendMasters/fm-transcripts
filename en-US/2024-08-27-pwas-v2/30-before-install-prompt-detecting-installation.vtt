00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.220
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Deploying the app.

2
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.870
So we have the app, the app is ready,
we like it, we need to deploy it.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.490
Well, deploying a PWA is
just deploying a web app.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.320
So you just put it on a server,
that's all.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.810
And then you need users to get there,
okay?

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.027
But there are a couple of things
that we have to do to improve

7
00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:19.360
the installation experience.

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.817
That's called, that way.

9
00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:26.237
First, we can detect if
the installation API is available.

10
00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:28.647
What is that?

11
00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:29.994
What's the installation API?

12
00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:32.317
Do you remember Squoosh?

13
00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:35.623
That when we were at the Squoosh website,

14
00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:39.123
we did have an install
button within the UI.

15
00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:43.047
That's because they're using this API,
that unfortunately,

16
00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:44.981
it's not available on Safari.

17
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:50.639
I think that today is one of the biggest
lack of API issues that we have on Safari,

18
00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:56.354
that there is no way to push the user
into installing the app from our UI.

19
00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:59.833
The user needs to go manually and
add and install the app.

20
00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:03.554
It's called before install prompt, okay?

21
00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:05.234
That's kind of the idea.

22
00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.886
We'll code this, so
I will show you the code directly there,

23
00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:13.170
but, talking about the event,
it was part of the web manifest spec, but

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.784
then it was removed because Chrome
was the only one implementing it.

25
00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:21.677
And for being standard,
need to be at least two implementations.

26
00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.287
Firefox says no, WebKit said no.

27
00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:28.367
So only Chromium is there.

28
00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.657
So then now it's not part of that spec.

29
00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:36.747
It's a separate spec on a different place,
in an incubator thing.

30
00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:38.757
And it's Chromium only, unfortunately.

31
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:43.012
There are some proposals to
create a new one for the future.

32
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:45.522
A web app installation API.

33
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.232
There are some ideas there,
but it's not implemented yet.

34
00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:54.025
The event before install prompt
will be fired when the current URL

35
00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:58.272
passes the PWA criteria in that browser,
okay?

36
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.904
And also if the PWA is
not already installed.

37
00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:04.804
It will fire the event
before install prompt.

38
00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:10.276
When that event is fired is when you
see a banner on a mobile device,

39
00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:15.378
or when you see a menu and
the install button on Chrome, okay?

40
00:02:15.378 --> 00:02:18.963
Or when you see and
that a website that has a button.

41
00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:21.907
When that happens is because
the event was fired.

42
00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.547
So, well here you have the description.

43
00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:29.587
So, it can be an info bar or banner,
a badge, a desktop menu item,

44
00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:34.187
or it allows a developer to
provide a custom install button.

45
00:02:35.437 --> 00:02:37.763
That means when you see that as a user,

46
00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:41.615
it means that the before
install event was fired.

47
00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:43.955
And you can also implement that.

48
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.127
Also, there are always available
installation menus items that can't

49
00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:47.735
be tracked.

50
00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.577
So, for example, if the user is adding,

51
00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:54.882
creating a web app from the menu,
from save this site as an app or

52
00:02:54.882 --> 00:02:59.855
things like that, or an iOS, if the user
is adding it to the home screen.

53
00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:05.995
You don't know if the user did that or
not, so there is no control, okay?

54
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.525
The user is in charge.

55
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:12.445
So for example, add to home screen
install site as an app, great shortcut.

56
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:14.295
So, it depends with the browser.

57
00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:16.995
You don't have control
of those menu items.

58
00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:23.033
So also, there is an event that to
be honest no one actually uses it

59
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:28.167
because it's Chromium only and yeah,
it's on the window app installed.

60
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:32.617
It will be fired when the user has just
installed your app, so you know it.

61
00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:37.057
That's all,
this is typically for analytics.

62
00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:42.947
You track it somewhere just for
counting the user, okay?

63
00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:49.532
All these APIs as I mentioned, are not
available on Safari or Firefox on Android,

64
00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:55.459
and I'm not seeing any bright future for
the next two years, we'll see.

65
00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.837
But I don't see that's happening, okay?

66
00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:03.382
Okay, so how do you create one of
this install promotion button, so

67
00:04:03.382 --> 00:04:05.149
then we can go and code it.

68
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.588
So if you wanna add your install app
button, you can also create your own div

69
00:04:09.588 --> 00:04:13.109
that appears on top of your
page with your own design.

70
00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.899
Or you wanna create add something
to your menu that says, install.

71
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.238
So how to implement that?

72
00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:20.542
It's kind of weird to be honest.

73
00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:24.259
It's based on that event,
that's Chromium only and

74
00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.995
we need to wait for the event to happen.

75
00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:30.250
We need to first hide the promotion,
I mean,

76
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.219
the bottom or something, if the user
is not in browser display mode,

77
00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.693
l mean, if it's in standalone,
you're already in the app.

78
00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:41.521
Don't show me the button, okay?

79
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:42.236
Make sense?

80
00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:46.936
And if you know if the app
is installed somehow, or

81
00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.696
if an alternative app is installed,
what is that?

82
00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:55.679
For example, you may have an Android app,
an iOS app in the stores, so,

83
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.560
you don't wanna promote,

84
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.253
to the user the installation
of another app for the same thing.

85
00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:05.441
You will end up with two icons.

86
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.147
Do you have ways to know
if an app is installed?

87
00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:13.493
Yes, on Android, you have,
it's an API known as

88
00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:18.227
Get Installed Related Apps,
Get Installed Related Apps.

89
00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:19.995
You can search for that.

90
00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:23.587
If, while no event is fired,

91
00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:27.215
the only thing that you can
do is hide the promotion or

92
00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:32.016
fall back to manual instructions,
like go and install it manually.

93
00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:37.783
So, I mean, if the event wasn't fired,
and you don't know why, but

94
00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:41.805
if the event wasn't fired,
you don't have any control.

95
00:05:41.805 --> 00:05:42.705
You cannot do anything.

96
00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:47.355
And try to avoid user
experience duplications.

97
00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:51.546
For example, let the browser
render a batch or a banner,

98
00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:54.265
and also you are providing a banner.

99
00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:57.125
You can prevent default.

100
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.865
You can ask the browser, hey,
I will take care of this.

101
00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:01.273
Don't add me any banner.

102
00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:03.591
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Does
it make sense?

103
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:07.182
Just that UX design pattern.

104
00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:10.938
So let's go directly and
try to implement it.
