00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.542
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So iOS, as we saw,

2
00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:07.390
work with the icon that you set in
the manifest, which is perfectly fine.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.389
They will use an icon from the manifest,
the same happens on macOS as well,

4
00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.540
not a problem at all.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.456
But if we want, we can specify a specific
icon for Apple platforms using a link,

6
00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:25.754
that will override the one
that you have in the manifest.

7
00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.704
So Apple said that, yeah, they realize,

8
00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:34.861
I mean the excuse they gave us,
that it's true anyway,

9
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:39.831
because Apple got late into
the into accepting PWAs.

10
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.302
Using the standards, actually, we remember
that actually Apple created this,

11
00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:46.229
Apple was the first one.

12
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.459
But then the Web App Manifest was
something that appeared later,

13
00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.456
Chrome pushed the Web App Manifest, and

14
00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.559
Apple didn't implement
the Web App Manifest initially.

15
00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.309
So because they were late to the party,
most of the icons for

16
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.049
PWAs were optimized for Android because
it was the platform supporting PWAs.

17
00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.182
When Apple started to implement
the manifest, they said that they did

18
00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:16.669
a test on many PWAs and they realized
that the icon didn't look good on iOS.

19
00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:21.815
So they were not iOS optimized,
they were targeting Android.

20
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.494
For example, in iOS,
we don't have transparent icons,

21
00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:26.465
you cannot use transparencies.

22
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:29.455
And they said that they found
transparencies, blah, blah, blah.

23
00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:36.413
But anyway, you can override the default
manifest icon only for Apple using a link.

24
00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:39.793
Link rel apple-touch-icon.

25
00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:42.753
So now you go to the HTML
not to the manifest.

26
00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:45.403
And you specify a different one,

27
00:01:45.403 --> 00:01:50.513
if you want it's not mandatory,
and you can provide a lot one for

28
00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:55.445
each resolution, for
iPad they have different resolution.

29
00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:59.052
But if you wanna provide only one that's
my recommendation you don't need at this

30
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.273
point to provide several versions.

31
00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:05.420
It should be 180 x 180, at this point,

32
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.313
the largest resolution that actually
an iPad Pro is using for an app's icon.
