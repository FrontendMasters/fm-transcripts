WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.677
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
we've seen Windows and Chromebooks.

2
00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:09.034
Let's now see macOS live because
that's the iOS that I have here.

3
00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:12.322
I'm in the browser, so
I will start with Chrome first.

4
00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.993
So this is Chrome.

5
00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.656
I'm opening this app, squoosh.app
that is actually an open-source

6
00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:22.942
project that is actually pretty
cool if you're a web developer.

7
00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:28.095
It lets you drop an image here and you can
pick one of the examples you have, and

8
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:33.029
it will convert that image into
different format and compress the image.

9
00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:37.962
So it's an image compressor, so
you can convert, for example,

10
00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:41.459
from the new formats, WebP, AVIF, QOI, and

11
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:45.429
here you can see well,
it's compressing the file.

12
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.954
And one of the cool things about
this app is that it's client-side,

13
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:52.853
it's not uploading your file to the cloud.

14
00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.297
Everything is happening in JavaScript.

15
00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:58.132
They have their own
decoders in WebAssembly,

16
00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:00.318
so it's fast, it's pretty cool.

17
00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:05.288
But well, it's a web app,
so it works in the browser.

18
00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:08.671
So the cool part is that
you can Install this, okay?

19
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.045
So how do you know?

20
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:11.928
So when you open the app,

21
00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:16.699
first, the app itself it's
inviting me to Install it, okay?

22
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:19.328
That doesn't happen on every PWA.

23
00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:24.027
But also, if you don't have that
installation from the app itself,

24
00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:27.849
by the way, by the end of today
we will see how to do that.

25
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.659
We will do that in our project.

26
00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.483
We have this icon in Chrome that I'm
sure if you realize it was there, okay?

27
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:40.219
That in the omnibox, that's the name of
the search bar, you have this icon that

28
00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.120
actually, when it says Install Squoosh
when you click the icon.

29
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.207
We have a nice installation dialog saying,
hey, do you wanna Install this app?

30
00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:52.843
For compress and
compare images with different codecs,

31
00:01:52.843 --> 00:01:56.184
I have some screenshots,
and I can Install the app.

32
00:01:56.184 --> 00:02:01.860
Another way to Install the app, if you
don't wanna use the button, by the way,

33
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.145
that button, it's an HTML button,
is triggering the native dialogue.

34
00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:10.384
In the menu, in current Chrome,

35
00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:15.705
you need to go to Save and
Share, and in Save and Share,

36
00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:21.230
you have Install Squoosh
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Section or

37
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.131
menu item that also triggers
the same dialogue, okay?

38
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:33.686
So well, if I Install the app,
now I have an app on my Mac, it's Squoosh.

39
00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:39.247
You can see at the title bar,
the name of the app is Squoosh, okay?

40
00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:44.551
It has its own title bar,
its theme with the color of the app,

41
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.297
it appears in the Alt
tab with its own icon.

42
00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:54.219
I can close the app and open the app
again just by typing the name.

43
00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.008
So it appears in a spotlight.

44
00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.104
It appears in the Launchpad on the Mac.

45
00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:03.347
There is a menu here because this is based
on Chrome because this is important.

46
00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:08.874
This is not packaging your code in a ZIP
file with its own rendering engine.

47
00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:12.502
It's still loading the URL
from the server, and

48
00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:15.431
it's still using the browser engine.

49
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.906
So, for example, on Chrome,
you have the Extensions section.

50
00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:21.647
You can enable or disable Extensions.

51
00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:26.077
You have also the way to increase and
decrease the font size from here, and

52
00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:27.367
also you have a menu.

53
00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:32.610
But it's not a full browser menu, but
you have some information such as,

54
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.613
you can get the SSL certificate
because now we don't have the URL bar.

55
00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.061
So all that information is here,

56
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:46.735
including settings for
permissions and so on, okay?

57
00:03:46.735 --> 00:03:50.996
And you're gonna still use
the app as in the browser.

58
00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.900
Also, you can go to the File and
create a New Window so

59
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.478
you can have more than
one instance of the app.

60
00:03:56.478 --> 00:04:02.266
It's like having two Microsoft Word
documents open, okay?

61
00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:03.514
Of your own app.

62
00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:09.389
This happens on Windows, Linux,
Chromebooks, macOS, okay?

63
00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.880
What about Safari?

64
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.853
Well, Safari, this is Safari,
it looks like the same app, but

65
00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:19.205
now I mean Safari, and still have the URL,
I didn't Install the app.

66
00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:21.420
I can Install it also from here.

67
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.365
I can Install the same PWA,
I can try a different one.

68
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:27.816
For example,
one that I can try is store.app,

69
00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:31.523
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: App Store but

70
00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:33.298
in reverse order.

71
00:04:33.298 --> 00:04:40.089
The store.app is actually kind of
a store for PWAs for web apps.

72
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.707
So it's just a guy, the least,

73
00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:47.867
it's The Open Web App Store, okay?

74
00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:50.761
And then, yeah,
you can see here a lot of PWA.

75
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:54.463
So in case you all were
wondering who is doing PWAs.

76
00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:56.562
Well, here you have hundreds,

77
00:04:56.562 --> 00:05:00.464
I'm not sure if thousands of
PWAs organized by topic, AI.

78
00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:03.919
PWA is Claude as an PWA.

79
00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.814
So actually, to Get the PWA, to Install
the PWA, it just Launch the Web App,

80
00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:14.826
so it opens the URL, and
then you can Install it from here, okay?

81
00:05:14.826 --> 00:05:20.734
So you need to Install it
from the URL as of today.

82
00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:24.717
So a store.app, then it's a PWA store.

83
00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:30.304
So if you are in the PWA
that you want Install for

84
00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:34.465
Safari on the Mac, you go to File.

85
00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:41.977
Actually, it's not so
interesting as it is with Chrome.

86
00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:43.814
It doesn't say Install.

87
00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:47.258
You still need to use the Add to Dock.

88
00:05:47.258 --> 00:05:49.439
That's the term, Add to Dock, okay?

89
00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.322
And Add to Dock,
to be honest I don't like the term because

90
00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:57.819
it's not adding the app just to the Dock.

91
00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.347
First, because it's not true.

92
00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:01.121
It's not just adding to Dock, okay?

93
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:04.399
Also, because it's adding the app
in the applications menu and

94
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.141
it appears everywhere,
not just in the Dock, okay?

95
00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:11.019
But anyway, they call it Add to Dock for
some reason.

96
00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.884
Let's take that for desktop.

97
00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:18.675
We will see this in our web
app later with more details.

98
00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:21.896
But let's talk about the MobileSpace now.

99
00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:23.313
So let's start with Android.

100
00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:26.304
So I will open now Android Studio.

101
00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:28.423
So I will open one from here.

102
00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:33.480
Let's open this Pixel XL version of 34.

103
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.921
So I have an Android phone here,
I can open Chrome.

104
00:06:37.921 --> 00:06:40.621
Welcome to Chrome,
I will use it without an account.

105
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:44.467
This is like opening Chrome for
the first time.

106
00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.713
They want to say notifications,
yeah, blah, blah, blah.

107
00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:48.717
And I can open Squoosh, for example.

108
00:06:51.397 --> 00:06:54.855
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And
we see also its theme.

109
00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:58.938
We have the Install button here,
which looks pretty cool.

110
00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:03.400
If I click on the Install button,
or if I go to the menu,

111
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.094
I also have the Install app menu item,
okay?

112
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.760
So on Android, I can click Install, and

113
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.264
I have this installation dialog that looks
like a Play Store installation dialog.

114
00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:19.948
I will say, I have the screenshots,
I can say, yeah, okay, let's do that.

115
00:07:19.948 --> 00:07:21.501
Let's Install the app.

116
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:25.739
I will Install the app on Android, and now
you will see in the notifications area.

117
00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:32.856
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Notifications
section, no.

118
00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:37.650
You will see this dialog saying
that you wanna Install the app.

119
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:41.982
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And,
by the way, you can see that the icon,

120
00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:43.379
it doesn't look so nice.

121
00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:49.420
We will see how to solve the problem and
why this emulator is using that icon.

122
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.263
But forget about that,
we will get the nice icon in a second.

123
00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:58.495
I can open the app, it has a screenshot
that you see as a splash screen,

124
00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:01.704
and then I have the app
running on Android.

125
00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:05.420
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And also,

126
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.306
you can see I'm not lying that
it's separate you from Chrome.

127
00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:13.030
I can kill Chrome and
the Squoosh app is still there.

128
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.566
So it's actually an app.

129
00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:20.608
I can post the app, so
it looks like an app on Android, okay?

130
00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:21.770
So that's Android.

131
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:27.462
Now, talking about iOS,
I will open the iOS simulator,

132
00:08:27.462 --> 00:08:31.503
and I will open a simulator for iOS 17.

133
00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:35.542
For example, let's open an iPhone 15 Pro.

134
00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:41.170
So I will open Safari,
same app if you want Squoosh.

135
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.980
And when I'm here in Safari on the iPhone,

136
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.283
I can go to share,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Then Add to

137
00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:52.917
the Home Screen,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And

138
00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:55.941
then Squoosh, okay?

139
00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:58.409
The icon, I have two actually.

140
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:04.878
If I open this now,
it's rendering a Squoosh as its own app.

141
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.214
And maybe you're thinking, but
that's a short cut, that's a bookmark.

142
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.924
It's just opening Safari.

143
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:14.253
Well, actually no, it's not Safari.

144
00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:19.005
It's its own app is running
as Steve Job was saying,

145
00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:24.622
it's running its own sandbox
completely outside of Safari,

146
00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:26.902
and it can work offline.

147
00:09:26.902 --> 00:09:28.445
So I can open this, and

148
00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:33.662
because its client-side it doesn't
need the cloud, it can work offline.

149
00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:39.776
You can just convert images locally in
your iPhone without connection, okay?

150
00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:42.718
Makes sense?
So that's actually a PWA running on most

151
00:09:42.718 --> 00:09:43.956
of the platforms.

152
00:09:43.956 --> 00:09:47.354
So you see how you Install them and
how you use them.

153
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:53.158
So that means that for
now we Install PWS from the browser.

154
00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:57.600
So to Install the PWA,
the user needs to go to the browser.

155
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.402
And from the browser,
you need to get to the browser once,

156
00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:06.033
the user will Install
it in different ways.

157
00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:09.884
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I guess I had a question
just about The Open Web App Store,

158
00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:12.543
because I saw that there were ratings.

159
00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:18.397
Can anyone just add their PWA or
web app to the store?

160
00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:21.851
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
on that store, yeah, you can.

161
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:28.067
First, some of the PWA that are there were
actually added manually by the company.

162
00:10:28.067 --> 00:10:33.369
And if you're the owner,
you can go and claim that record.

163
00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:35.551
You can claim that you
are the owner of that app.

164
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.372
But if not, there is a form.

165
00:10:37.372 --> 00:10:42.884
It's free, and you go and you can say,
I have a PWA will I be in your store.

166
00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:50.404
And, yeah, it's kind of an index, PWA
index, kind of Yahoo from the 90s, okay?

167
00:10:50.404 --> 00:10:52.699
But in PWA form.

168
00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:58.469
I wanna show you before getting into the
next section, I wanna show you this PWA.

169
00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:00.828
So this is iOS.

170
00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:03.176
So I'm in the iOS, I mean iPhone, okay?

171
00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:09.205
And this is trygalaxy.com, trygalaxy.com.

172
00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:11.485
It's a PWA, but different.

173
00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:17.500
First, it's a PWA that renders
completely different in the browser or

174
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.714
as an Install app, okay?

175
00:11:19.714 --> 00:11:23.013
That was one of the questions
that we have from the chat.

176
00:11:23.013 --> 00:11:27.021
And if you look at the bottom, it's
actually saying, tap this icon below and

177
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:28.513
then Add to the home screen.

178
00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:31.922
And we have this little animation saying,
hey, hey, that's here.

179
00:11:31.922 --> 00:11:33.596
You need to Install it from here.

180
00:11:33.596 --> 00:11:36.999
So it's asking me to
Install this from here.

181
00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:42.353
And, by the way, this is a PWA
that is targeting only iPhones,

182
00:11:42.353 --> 00:11:44.180
and you will see why.

183
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.727
So then let's do that.

184
00:11:45.727 --> 00:11:48.680
Let's Add to the Home Screen.

185
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.678
And when I do that, now I have
the Try Galaxy app on my iPhone.

186
00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:55.429
So what's the idea of this app?

187
00:11:55.429 --> 00:12:02.807
If I open this, you can see here the power
of a web app installed on iPhone.

188
00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:07.268
If I open Try Galaxy, what you will see,
well, first, welcome,

189
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:11.828
I will say, yeah, I accept the terms,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

190
00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:18.375
And when I'm done, what I see is
an Android UI running on my iPhone.

191
00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:22.767
So the idea,
this is a Samsung PWA that is selling

192
00:12:22.767 --> 00:12:26.526
iPhone users the idea of buying a Galaxy.

193
00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:32.090
So before buying you a Samsung Galaxy
device, go and try it on your iPhone.

194
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.337
So now I can try it.

195
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:36.827
I have notifications,
so you can go and see.

196
00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:39.889
You can try on your real iPhone
the smoothness of the app.

197
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.338
You can try to call,
you have the back button,

198
00:12:43.338 --> 00:12:48.395
you have everything that has in
your Galaxy running directly here.

199
00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:51.157
So you can try several things.

200
00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:55.140
Well, this is a PNG you can open,
then PNG with something.

201
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.104
You have the menu, all the apps.

202
00:12:59.104 --> 00:13:03.091
Of course,
it's not a full Android runtime.

203
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:08.447
Could it be, well,
maybe with WebAssembly, I've seen some

204
00:13:08.447 --> 00:13:15.250
weird things like trying to run an Android
directly in WebAssembly on the web.

205
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.516
We do have emulators of now for
retro gaming

206
00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:25.500
consoles we do have, and they are PWAs.

207
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:32.692
We do have Windows 95 running as a PWA,
and you can Install it on your iPhone.

208
00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:34.662
It's actually running
on top of WebAssembly.

209
00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:40.329
So it's actually, it's real Windows
95 running on top of a PC emulator,

210
00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:43.082
Intel-based emulator, and so on.

211
00:13:43.082 --> 00:13:48.523
But well, this is actually a way that
you have to test the power of a PWA,

212
00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:53.170
because we are still actually
in an iOS application, okay?

213
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.427
But in Fullscreen,
you actually see an Android Galaxy.

214
00:13:56.427 --> 00:14:00.830
Think about this,
can this app be in the App Store?

215
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.807
No, of course, Apple is not gonna
approve that app in the App Store.

216
00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:11.423
But as a PWA, Samsung doesn't need
Apple's permission, it's just a web app.
