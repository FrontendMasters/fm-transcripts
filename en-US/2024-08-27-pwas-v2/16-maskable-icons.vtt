00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And also we
have something known as a maskable PNG.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.800
So, let's get into that.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.530
It's used in Android 8 by default.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.870
So Android 8+, that is 90% of the Android
out there, preferred a maskable PNG.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.730
What's that?

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.869
It's a logo designed with icon mask and
safe zone in mind, such that any blah,

7
00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.635
blah, blah, blah, goes what?

8
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.095
Let me show you an example.

9
00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.655
Okay, and you will get it.

10
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:32.201
So from Android 8,
we have something known as adaptive icons.

11
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:37.291
The launcher can define several shapes,
so you can define a shape and

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:42.404
some phones they have one shape,
some forms they have other shapes.

13
00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:47.075
Sometimes, each manufacturer is
changing the shape of your icons.

14
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:48.505
Okay, does it make sense?

15
00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:52.725
So that means that your icon
will be cut with a mask.

16
00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:58.595
So the maskable icon will solve
the problem of different shapes.

17
00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:01.613
Will still provide a square icon, but

18
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:07.001
with enough discardable padding
content out of a safe area, okay?

19
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.853
So this is from the spec.

20
00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.773
This is the official image from the spec.

21
00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:15.853
It's a centrally position circle with
a radius of 40% of the icon width.

22
00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:17.206
Let me show you an example.

23
00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:21.855
This is the square of our icon,
then we need to get and

24
00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:29.140
draw a circle in the middle with the
radius of 40% of the whole width, okay?

25
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.500
That's the safe area.

26
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.400
So, for example, if I have this icon,
this is a calculator icon, okay?

27
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.318
If I apply that rule and
apply the mask there, we have a problem,

28
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:45.523
I have parts of my calculator
outside of the safe zone.

29
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:50.685
So my icons may look like this
on real phones, so it's wrong.

30
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.155
So what do we need to do with this?

31
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.019
We can add more padding.

32
00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:02.934
So now we fit into the safe zone and
our icons will look nice, okay?

33
00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:04.174
Makes sense?

34
00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.989
But for other devices that
they're not, like desktop,

35
00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.148
maybe you don't wanna provide this one
because you say, too much padding,

36
00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:13.734
because the icon will look like this,
on desktop.

37
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:14.314
Okay, makes sense?

38
00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:18.190
So that's why you should provide both,
the maskable and

39
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.597
the non-maskable one, and
each device will pick one.

40
00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:25.227
How the device knows if it's
a maskable icon or not?

41
00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:29.455
Well, because we say so
with a property "purpose",

42
00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:33.557
we say this is the maskable version.

43
00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:35.227
Okay, makes sense?

44
00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:39.945
And how to do a maskable icon if you're
not, we don't wanna use Photoshop or

45
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:41.950
whatever tool you use for that.

46
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.400
We have a nice simple to use PWA

47
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.030
available at maskable.app.

48
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.129
And by the way, we have the app TLD now,
top-level domain .app

49
00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.715
that is actually managed by Google and
you can actually go and get one.

50
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:06.707
And a lot of PWAs today are getting .app.

51
00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:11.371
Okay, for example, the one that we saw,

52
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.651
the store.app, is actually .app.
