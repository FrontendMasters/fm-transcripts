WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:01.580
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Not
everything is good news.

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.990
We still have some platforms and browsers
where we don't have support for PWAs.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.507
Firefox on desktop, as we mentioned
before, is not supporting PWAs.

4
00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:15.813
VisionOS as of today, so
Vision Pro, you have Safari, but

5
00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:18.844
you can only install web apps from there.

6
00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:25.482
Android WebView, and also iOS WebView that
actually is more important than we think.

7
00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:29.522
So when you are on Instagram or
Tiktok, just to give you two examples,

8
00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.586
it can be also Facebook and others.

9
00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:36.638
What happens when you click on a link,
if there is a link to the outside world?

10
00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:38.359
What happens when you click on a link?

11
00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.236
Does anyone know?

12
00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:40.385
&gt;&gt; Student: Stay within the app.

13
00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.073
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: You
stay within the app.

14
00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:44.798
They have something known
as an in-app browser.

15
00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:47.961
They don't want you to get
out of TikTok or Instagram.

16
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:49.396
They want you to stay there.

17
00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:51.439
So they created an in-app browser.

18
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.643
That in-app browser is using
something known as a WebView.

19
00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:58.645
That WebView does not
support PWA installation.

20
00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:04.048
So if your PWA, if your web app
relies a lot on social networks and

21
00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:08.952
links on social networks,
have in mind that from the links

22
00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:13.654
that you post or the ads that
you put on social networks,

23
00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:19.396
the ads with links cannot trigger
the native installation dialog.

24
00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:20.716
Make sense?

25
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:25.017
So that's something to know.

26
00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:29.593
WatchOS while there is a browser here and
you can browse websites.

27
00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:30.613
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:34.922
And I have a video running
Prince of Persia here.

29
00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:37.423
Remember Prince of Persia?

30
00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:42.366
There is a JavaScript version Prince
js.com if would have tried, and

31
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:46.653
I have it on my watch, but
you cannot install the app, okay?

32
00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:50.795
The same happens on TVOS,
Apple TV or Android TV.

33
00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.029
As of today, you cannot install PWAs.

34
00:01:54.029 --> 00:02:01.398
Anyway, there are some apps in the store
that inside they are Web based, okay?

35
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:05.612
Okay, any question on compatibility?

36
00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:10.641
&gt;&gt; Student: Is there any way to
circumvent the social media screens,

37
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:14.850
so like actually have it
open a URL in a browser?

38
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.930
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Unfortunately,
no, because they don't want users to get

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.592
out of that, so that doesn't mean
that your content will not work.

40
00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:28.696
So because, I mean, it's a web
rendering engine, so the way to do that

41
00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:33.646
is sometimes given the user
instructions like, go and open Safari.

42
00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:39.257
I've seen things like, for example,
a button that says, install.

43
00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:42.573
You click on the button,
and then a dialog appears.

44
00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:47.251
you take advantage of the user
clicking the button to put the URL in

45
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:52.012
the clipboard, just to do one more step so,
and then you say, hey,

46
00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:57.739
you need to go to Safari now, paste in
the URL, and then you start it from there.

47
00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.434
Because that's actually Google
was against this against

48
00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:06.080
these companies doing this for
the WebView.

49
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.498
They started like a campaign, but yeah,
actually business is greater than this.

50
00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:17.091
And of course, these companies
don't want users to be that.

51
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:19.447
By the way,
this is happening to X as well.

52
00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:23.391
Twitter has an experiment
that's of today X,

53
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:27.139
most of your links will
open in the browser.

54
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.952
But for me, I realized that it's happening
to me one every 20 links that I click.

55
00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:37.181
One of every 20 links,
I see an in-app browser.

56
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.817
So Elon Musk also wants yourself not
to get away from the super App, and

57
00:03:41.817 --> 00:03:43.624
when that happens, yeah,

58
00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:48.439
all the installation process with
the operating system doesn't work.
