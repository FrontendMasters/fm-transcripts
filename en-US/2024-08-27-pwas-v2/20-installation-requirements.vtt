00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.669
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now
we have kind of an app, okay,

2
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.500
it's kind of installable on iOS.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.660
We see it's installable on desktop,
is it installable?

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.320
Is it passing the PWA criteria or
not, what do you think?

5
00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:18.973
Let me close it.

6
00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:19.673
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: Yes.

7
00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:20.635
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yes or no?

8
00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:21.733
We have a yes.

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.500
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yes,

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
how do you know that?

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.603
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: It's
giving us the icon there.

12
00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:29.511
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We have this
badge here, but it's not offline.

13
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:32.643
No, because now it's not mandatory.

14
00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:38.542
So again, 99% of the web will tell you
that the service worker is mandatory for

15
00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.557
passing the PWA criteria.

16
00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:44.527
But you're here at Frontend Masters,
and you're getting the good stuff, and

17
00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:47.952
I can tell you that that's
not a requirement anymore.

18
00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:52.279
And no one is updating those articles,
by the way, not even Google,

19
00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:55.232
not even Google on their
own documentation.

20
00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:57.879
So now you don't need
to be offline capable,

21
00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.371
it's already passing the criteria,
I can install my app.

22
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.041
Let's do that, so I will install,
you can also do that on your computers.

23
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:13.141
So if I install my app now, now I have
my Code Masters app running on my Mac.

24
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.381
Of course I can decrease the phone size.

25
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:22.015
I think any size would work, I think
that a small widget looks pretty cool.

26
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:28.469
For example, here you can say,
I have codepad master twice,

27
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.848
well, maybe using the other display type,
we can move this.

28
00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:36.323
We can move this to the top and
replace the title with that, so

29
00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:37.765
you can gain some space.

30
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:42.437
Well, from now on, you can start playing
with this, until you are happy, okay,

31
00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:44.351
but of course, it works, okay?

32
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:49.401
But I already have a Mac application, a
Windows application, a Linux application,

33
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:54.189
a Chromebook application, an iOS
application, also an Android application.

34
00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.709
Just because I have
a manifest with some icons,

35
00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.226
some metadata, that's the next step, okay?

36
00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.708
On mobile, it's a different story,
so because implementation and

37
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.926
operating systems, they work differently.

38
00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.213
But on the other side,
I think it's pretty cool, you can go.
