WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.111
Cool, so a state of the platform,

2
00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:05.360
before actually seeing examples
of how they look like.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.447
First, every browser supports PWA,
because it's just the web, right,

4
00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:15.397
which is kind of, yeah, I mean,
it's a right answer, but

5
00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.890
probably not the answer
you are looking for, okay?

6
00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:23.187
Because sometimes when we
are talking about the PWA platform,

7
00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:26.347
we are talking about
installation at least, okay?

8
00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:29.453
And yeah, because this is the web and
it can be used in the browser,

9
00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.247
if you have a browser,
it will render your web app.

10
00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:36.649
Maybe it's not installable, so
let's try to talk about installability.

11
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.620
So I'm keeping a list, and I'm updating
a list in my website, firt.dev/notes/pwa.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.359
This is kind of the only place that
it's available on the web these

13
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.938
days to know where a PWA is installable,
okay, with details.

14
00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:59.558
And on Android, for example, it's
currently available on all web browsers.

15
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.810
All the main web browsers or
the first ten, of course,

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.525
on Android you have ten web
browsers that no one is using, but

17
00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:12.998
Chrome, Edge, Firefox,
Opera, Vivaldi, Brave.

18
00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:16.676
So most of the most common,
Dolphin, Android web browsers,

19
00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:21.205
they support PWA installation because
most of them are chromium based, and

20
00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:23.638
chromium supports PWA installation.

21
00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:27.268
But Firefox also support PWA
installations on Android.

22
00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:28.188
Okay, so that's pretty simple.

23
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:32.637
So if you are in a PWA on Android,
you can install it, and

24
00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:38.443
it will convert into an Android app,
and we'll see that process later.

25
00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:45.757
On iOS and iPadOS, it's on Safari, so if
you're in Safari, you can install a PWA.

26
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:48.482
What happens with other browsers?

27
00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.017
Well, that has been changed in the past,

28
00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:57.977
let's say that you can install PWAs
from other browsers with a twist,

29
00:01:57.977 --> 00:02:01.426
so let's try to understand that twist.

30
00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:06.678
First, we need to know where we are,
because now we have two different iOS.

31
00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:11.517
We have the European Union iOS,
and the rest of the world iOS,

32
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:15.135
at least while we're shooting this video.

33
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.128
So in the rest of the world, actually,

34
00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:22.414
right now, even in EU countries,
it's just the same.

35
00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.710
So does anyone have iPhone here,
let's see.

36
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.438
Okay, are you using Chrome?

37
00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:30.718
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I usually just use Safari,

38
00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:33.508
since that's the only engine
that they allow at this time.

39
00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:36.170
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Safari is the only
engine that they allow at this time.

40
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.357
So Chrome on iOS,
Firefox on iOS, Edge on iOS,

41
00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:42.249
it's just Safari with different scheme.

42
00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.742
I'm simplifying the definition,
but it's kind of that, so

43
00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:49.357
it's not really Chrome,
it's not really Firefox.

44
00:02:49.357 --> 00:02:53.444
Now, in EU countries,
Chrome could create a real Chrome,

45
00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:58.206
they didn't do that yet, and
I'm not sure they will do that.

46
00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:03.106
But now they are allowed in EU
countries only to use their own engine,

47
00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:08.356
okay, browsers, they are allowed
to that only in EU countries.

48
00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:13.185
But anyway, it doesn't matter if it's
a real other browser in EU countries or

49
00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:17.153
like a simulation, as we have right
now in the rest of the world.

50
00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:22.172
You can install PWAs, but
only following Apple rules.

51
00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:28.499
And the installed PWA in the system will
use always WebKit, Safari as the engine.

52
00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.615
So even if Chrome creates a chromium
version for iOS in EU countries,

53
00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:38.878
and you install a PWA in EU countries,
it will use Safari,

54
00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:42.447
at least as of today,
okay, that's the twist.

55
00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:48.439
HarmonyOS, that's a Huawei
operating system.

56
00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.853
Well, mostly targeting Chinese devices,

57
00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:57.480
also they have some use base in China,
other Southeast Asia countries,

58
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.292
also some Latin American countries,
mostly South America.

59
00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:06.772
The native browser has
its own main browser and

60
00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:12.942
you can install PWAs from there, and
they become an install app there as well.

61
00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:18.535
And Meta Horizon OS, I'm not sure
if you know what that OS is for.

62
00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:23.352
Actually, it's a new name for
the operating system that right now

63
00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:27.223
it's the operating system
behind the Meta Quest 3,

64
00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:30.506
the VR headset or
the mixed reality headset.

65
00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:35.409
And new headsets will appear in the future
using also the Meta Horizon operating

66
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.864
system, it supports PWAs.

67
00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:41.782
And in this case the only difference
is that the installation is not through

68
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.032
the browser, but through the Meta Store.

69
00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:48.018
So you publish your PWA on a web
server and then you need to go and

70
00:04:48.018 --> 00:04:52.176
fill a form saying I have a PWA
that I wanna publish for this uses.

71
00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:59.113
And it will go through quality
assurance because VR can make you sick.

72
00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:04.087
So it's not so simple as let anyone
install apps without reviewing the app.

73
00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:09.162
Okay, because it has to do with health,
okay, mental health and so on.

74
00:05:09.162 --> 00:05:12.582
So that's why physical health, so

75
00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:17.826
that's why they are forcing
going through the store,

76
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:21.833
but you can do then 2D or
VR PWAs for Meta.

77
00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:23.353
So what about the desktop?

78
00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:27.357
On macOS, you can install
PWAs from Safari, Chrome, and

79
00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:29.973
Edge, so most of the browsers.

80
00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:34.733
Not here and not other browser, for
example, Brave it's not supported.

81
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:40.495
Linux, Chrome and Edge, ChromeOS,
it has only Chrome, and

82
00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:44.174
you can install Firefox as well,
but it's not common.

83
00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:45.274
And Windows,

84
00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:51.057
actually this is pretty cool in terms
of the amount of Windows that we have.

85
00:05:51.057 --> 00:05:55.646
Chrome, Edge on Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11.

86
00:05:55.646 --> 00:06:02.871
From Windows 7, you can install PWAs, if
you're using Chrome or Edge as browsers.

87
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.914
There is one big missing here in
this slide, I'm sure if you can

88
00:06:07.914 --> 00:06:13.641
spot which one is missing, and
it's a big name, and it's not Safari.

89
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.000
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Brave,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Brave, no,

90
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.919
even Firefox.

91
00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.538
I mean, Brave is also there, but
I think that Firefox is bigger.

92
00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:27.682
Firefox for
desktop is not implementing web apps.

93
00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:31.865
They used to have it with some
kind of an experiment, and

94
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:36.226
they say internally that we're
not going to push this, so

95
00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:41.130
right now they are behind the rest
of the browsers, even Safari.

96
00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:46.040
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And I know some
users that they were Firefox users that

97
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.960
they stopped using Firefox because
the lack of web app installations.

98
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:57.531
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So for
example, this is how Trivago is a PWA,

99
00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.509
so this is Windows.

100
00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.521
So you can install Trivago from there so
you install it and

101
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.539
then you have a full Windows application.

102
00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.539
I'm showing you a video of
Windows because I'm on a Mac, so

103
00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.283
I will show you a video on Windows.

104
00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:15.507
And after it was installed, it's in
the start menu, this is Windows 10, so

105
00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:18.707
it appears like any other in
the start menu or start screen,

106
00:07:18.707 --> 00:07:21.370
appears like any other app in the system.

107
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.980
Okay, so
that's how it looks like on windows.

108
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.626
I have the Starbucks PWA as well, so
you can order coffee from your desktop,

109
00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:31.090
that's another PWA in windows.

110
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:37.354
Tinder, I know someone told me about
Tinder, I don't know what Tinder is for,

111
00:07:37.354 --> 00:07:43.076
but it's a PWA as well, and it appears
in the alt tab as any other web app.

112
00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:48.185
Okay, this is Chromebooks,
ChromeOS by a part of the same experience.

113
00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:52.876
I'm opening here several PWA, and
you can see they have their own window.

114
00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:55.881
So once you open them,
they are at the dock, and

115
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.955
once you open them, again,
Starbucks, they look like an app.

116
00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:03.364
I mean, from a user perspective,
the user doesn't know it's a PWA.

117
00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:07.262
And the user shouldn't know actually, it's
just an app, it's a Starbucks app, okay,

118
00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.765
you want a coffee.

119
00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:13.064
I don't care if it's web app native,
okay, it's just an app.

120
00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:15.565
So it's kind of the same thing here and

121
00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:20.021
I have just a screenshot here because
just to prove, I'm not sure if

122
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:24.725
you recognize the start logo there
at the bottom, that's Windows 7.

123
00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:28.584
The same Starbucks application
installed on Windows 7.

124
00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:32.523
And probably you're thinking, well,
who is using Windows 7 these days?

125
00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:35.803
Lot of companies, lot of banks.

126
00:08:35.803 --> 00:08:40.100
And if you're doing
enterprise applications,

127
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.832
PWA is a great platform, why?

128
00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:47.573
I'm not sure if you have experience
doing app for banks, for example,

129
00:08:47.573 --> 00:08:50.508
or for large companies with old terminals.

130
00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:55.599
Deploying a desktop application is
really painful for security purposes,

131
00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:59.665
you cannot just send them
an executable and they install it.

132
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:03.647
They don't have installation permissions,
they don't have anything, so

133
00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:07.495
it's actually very difficult to
deploy apps on those devices.

134
00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:12.434
But you know what, if they have Chrome
on Windows 7 or Edge on Windows 7,

135
00:09:12.434 --> 00:09:16.195
they can install PWAs without
any special permission.

136
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:21.611
You send them a URL by email,
go there, they enter the URL, and

137
00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:24.809
the users can install it from the browser,
and

138
00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:29.243
they will get an app experience
on Windows 7 without any other.

139
00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:34.309
They don't need to call the team,
the technical team, to install the app,

140
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:38.284
it has happened,
it has worked because this is important.

141
00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:43.450
The PWA, even if it's an app,
a native app, as Steve Jobs was saying,

142
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.881
it's secure because it's still working
under the web browser umbrella,

143
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:52.264
it's using the same
security as the browser.

144
00:09:52.264 --> 00:09:55.423
So if it's secure to
browse to that website,

145
00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:58.675
it will be secure to use
it from its own window.

146
00:09:58.675 --> 00:10:03.657
&gt;&gt; Student 3: Oscar in the chat says,
WhatsApp is one of the best PWA.

147
00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:08.094
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, WhatsApp is
also a PWA, and sometimes they create it

148
00:10:08.094 --> 00:10:14.147
also a native client, the native client
inside is actually using a web view.

149
00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:18.478
So it's kind of a hybrid,
they're using a hybrid approach, but

150
00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:21.547
yeah, there are a lot of really good PWAs,
and

151
00:10:21.547 --> 00:10:25.508
the best PWAs that I've seen
are actually corporate PWAs.

152
00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:29.698
There is a big market of
corporate applications, I mean,

153
00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:35.016
application for desktop, for users,
that it's actually pretty cool.

154
00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:38.956
Of course, they are not well
known because it's just for

155
00:10:38.956 --> 00:10:43.236
their employees, but
that's actually really good target.

156
00:10:43.236 --> 00:10:46.388
Before that they were doing .net
