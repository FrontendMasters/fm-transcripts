00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.867
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Pull to Refresh,
probably

2
00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:07.587
you've seen this sometimes you pull
to refresh and it reloads the page,

3
00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:12.483
but maybe you wanna reload your content,
does it make sense?

4
00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:15.457
So you have your own Pull to Refresh, but

5
00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:20.109
the browser has its own Pull to Refresh,
so does it make sense?

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.693
If you want, you can remove it.

7
00:00:24.693 --> 00:00:28.031
With CSS overscroll behavior,

8
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:34.200
with that code you
are disabling Pull to Refresh.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.515
This is just for the case when your
PWA has its own Pull to Refresh.

10
00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.736
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And that applies
actually on Android only, to be honest.

11
00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:49.386
Because on a PWA,
you cannot pull to refresh on a PWA.

12
00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:55.037
Maybe on Safari, another browser you can,
but not on a PWA, okay?

13
00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:57.270
Another idea I have for you,

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.881
use the new View Transition API to
transition between page changes.

15
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.039
If you're a single page application or
a multi-page application,

16
00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.551
you can create really nice
animations between pages.

17
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.718
It's not directly related to PWAs, but

18
00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:17.226
it makes your PWA feels more native,
so you can animate page changes.

19
00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:24.192
And another link to another course, you
can check the course on web app patterns.

20
00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:28.272
Where we implement that View Transition
API on a single page application and

21
00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:30.779
also on a multi-page application.

22
00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:36.589
So that will improve a lot
the feeling that this is an app.

23
00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:37.884
For more information on that topic,

24
00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:39.776
check the course practical
web app patterns, okay?

25
00:01:41.627 --> 00:01:46.807
System fonts, this is in case you really
want your app to feel like a native app.

26
00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:53.257
So this is like a hacky font family
list that will try to use on

27
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:59.340
every platform the default font
that you have on native apps.

28
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.762
So then we have the apple-system one,
of course, if it's not there,

29
00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:07.522
it will move to the next one
BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI,

30
00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:11.300
that's windows, Roboto,
that's Android, Ubuntu.

31
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.040
So, then this would try to push as
much as possible the native font,

32
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130
instead of seeing a web font.

33
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.578
Of course you can use web fonts and
apply your font, okay?

34
00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:26.075
But in case you want the whole UI to feel
more native, and of course, you don't need

35
00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:30.011
to apply this to the whole body,
you can actually apply it to some parts.

36
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:35.745
It's just a hack to to make it
more app-like user interface.

37
00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:41.234
Use the web, share API, because now
we are on a standalone application.

38
00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.166
What if the user is seeing
something on the screen

39
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.673
that wanna share that with someone else?

40
00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:51.575
On a browser, you copy and
paste the URL, but

41
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:55.024
now we are at PWA, so where is the URL?

42
00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:56.234
Can I copy the URL?

43
00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:01.341
The answer is it depends on the platform,
some platform will let you,

44
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:02.784
there is a menu on Android.

45
00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:05.757
On some Android devices,
you may have a notification,

46
00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:09.054
which is called a static notification,
it's complicated.

47
00:03:10.184 --> 00:03:13.594
Well, you can provide your own
Share button in your page.

48
00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:18.507
And for that, you have navigator.share,
I'm not sure if you have ever used that.

49
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:24.563
On the normal web, it's okay,
you can use it, but it's not wow.

50
00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:30.507
But in a PWA, it's really important
because it's a way that you have for

51
00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:32.858
the user to get content out.

52
00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:38.527
And it will trigger the native share
dialogue on Android, iOS, MacOS, I think

53
00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:44.298
that's all, because on Windows, I'm not
sure if you have a native share dialog.

54
00:03:44.298 --> 00:03:51.188
So in fact, there is a can share method
as well to check if you can share or not.

55
00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:56.618
Again, just quick ideas,
pieces of ideas that I have for you here.

56
00:03:56.618 --> 00:03:59.679
Disable Touch Callout,
this is for iOS only,

57
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.439
you can see it's even a prefix -webkit.

58
00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.251
What's a touch-callout?

59
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:09.528
Is when you touch and long press a link,
it typically opens a menu.

60
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:17.479
Which is maybe okay, but if you're doing
a single-page application, it's also

61
00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.709
applying the menu on a JavaScript-based
link, which is kind of weird.

62
00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:28.319
Well, you can disable that with
webkit-touch-callout none on your links.

63
00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.369
Again, we are trying to make this more
app-like and less web-like, okay?

64
00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:42.933
So you can check the course also now
the link a tour of web capabilities,

65
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:45.225
Frontend Masters.

66
00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:49.832
There are lots of examples there on how
to use the sensors and hardware APIs.

67
00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:56.140
Where you will be able to integrate
your PWA with a platform,

68
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.077
geolocation game pads, Bluetooth,
web serial and so on, okay?

69
00:05:03.077 --> 00:05:06.412
Ideas to make a better PWA.

70
00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:10.553
Reduce motion, I mean,
this is for the web as well, but

71
00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:13.917
it's more important when
you are in the app.

72
00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:17.221
For example, on MacOS,
you can enable Reduce Motion,

73
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:21.949
the same on iOS, to the same on Android
and Android is Remove animations.

74
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.756
So some users are disabling animations,
but it's not gonna work for

75
00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:27.669
your web app automatically.

76
00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.159
It works automatically for
native animations, but not for the web.

77
00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.359
For the web apps,
you need to use media queries.

78
00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:38.183
Use the @media prefers-reduced-motion:reduce
and disable all

79
00:05:38.183 --> 00:05:41.631
your transitions and animations,
you need to do it manually.

80
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:46.435
This is important because it's not gonna
happen automatically for the user,

81
00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:49.068
on native apps it happens automatically.

82
00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:53.953
Persistent storage requests, no one asked
about that, but we're installing assets,

83
00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.003
do we have a limit?

84
00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:58.529
Remember, with the service worker, we're
installing assets, do we have a limit?

85
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.640
And for
how long those assets will be there?

86
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.297
Well, the answer is complicated, but

87
00:06:06.297 --> 00:06:12.026
something that I wanna emphasize
right now is that by default,

88
00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:16.688
those assets don't live
in a persistent storage.

89
00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:21.502
Which means the browser can,
at any time, delete everything.

90
00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:24.846
So all the assets that you downloaded,
including the service worker,

91
00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:27.854
when there is a storage pressure,
for example, that means that

92
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:32.616
you don't have enough space on your phone,
the browser will say, well, you know what?

93
00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:34.876
No, you web app, goodbye.

94
00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:39.942
And that includes all your data,
all your assets, we don't want that,

95
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:44.328
that doesn't happen with native apps,
most of the time.

96
00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:48.658
I mean, the native apps, if you have it,
you have it, it should be there, okay?

97
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.523
If you want the same thing, you can, but

98
00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:55.928
you need to explicitly
request persistent storage.

99
00:06:55.928 --> 00:07:00.882
Fortunately for us,
all the PWA browsers, Safari on iOS,

100
00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:05.153
Chrome on Android,
Chrome on desktop, Firefox.

101
00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:08.298
Actually, Firefox will do something
different, so let's get it out.

102
00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:12.978
Will grant you persistent
storage if you install the PWA.

103
00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:17.893
So if you install the PWA, when you
ask for it, it will say, okay, yeah,

104
00:07:17.893 --> 00:07:18.926
you got it.

105
00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:23.365
And then if there is a storage pressure,
it's not going to delete your data,

106
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.566
even if you're using two gigabytes.

107
00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:31.316
Firefox always ask to the user.

108
00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:33.507
You see a prompt saying, hey,

109
00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:38.741
do you wanna grant persistent storage
permission to the user, yes or no?

110
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:42.291
You just need to call explicitly this.

111
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:49.205
And another link, if you wanna get more
information about the persistent storage,

112
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:53.782
quotas, and how that works,
check the course, Web Storage APIs,

113
00:07:53.782 --> 00:07:55.647
also at Frontend Masters.
