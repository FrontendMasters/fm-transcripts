WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.063
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
this is how the manifest looks like,

2
00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:06.374
now we are going to write
our own manifest, okay?

3
00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:10.003
It's not a big deal, and of course
we will go property by property to

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.543
understand what they are, some of them
are straightforward, some of them are not.

5
00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:20.191
And something important is that on top
of the web manifest spec, there other

6
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:26.384
specs and other APIs that have appeared
with time that are adding more properties.

7
00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.397
We will mention some at the end and

8
00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:34.355
also on other courses
available at Frontend Masters.

9
00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:38.153
There is one that I will
point later on hardware.

10
00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:40.254
It's a tour of web capabilities.

11
00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:44.769
On that one, we mentioned some of
these additions that you can add

12
00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.312
to the PWA platform, for
that you need a manifest.

13
00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:50.953
It's like plugins for the manifest,

14
00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:54.757
they're not part of
the initial default spec, okay?

15
00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:56.707
Well, let's try to do that.

16
00:00:56.707 --> 00:01:01.442
So I'm going to BS Code now,
I'm going to create a file.

17
00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:04.667
So the file can't have any name okay?

18
00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.226
But I typically would call
this app.web.manifest.

19
00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:12.935
BS code now automatically
recognizes the extension, so

20
00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.395
now you can see at the bottom.

21
00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:20.085
It's turning on the JSON parser by
default, so it knows where we are.

22
00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:24.314
And also it, lets us start writing things.

23
00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:27.419
So, first this is important, and

24
00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:32.783
actually you won't find this
reference in a lot of places.

25
00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:36.589
You should start with with an id property.

26
00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:39.028
The id property was added.

27
00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.865
It was probably three years ago,

28
00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:47.349
which means not every PWA developer
realized that it's there.

29
00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:53.819
I'll never explain what happened,
why it appeared in effect.

30
00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:00.129
But now it's used by Chrome and also
it's used by Safari on the Mac and iOS.

31
00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.085
The id is just what you think, an app id.

32
00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:10.754
But the idea is to put a string there
that should be unique within your origin.

33
00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:15.096
By the way, I mentioned origin
a couple of times at this point.

34
00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:16.863
Do you know what an origin is?

35
00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:20.210
Anyone know, just to be sure
that we are on the same page.

36
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.408
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Protocol, host and port.

37
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.960
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
protocol plus host plus port.

38
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.145
So httpsblah.com, on port 80.

39
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:31.936
That's an origin.

40
00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:33.304
So it's kind of the domain.

41
00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:34.426
So your domain.

42
00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:40.100
So I don't need to say,
this is going to be called pathmasters.

43
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.318
I don't need to do that because if I'm
going to publish this on a domain,

44
00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:45.711
that will be my domain.

45
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.876
So it should be an id within my domain.

46
00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:54.362
So most of the time, if you will have
only one PWA, sometimes it's a pattern

47
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:59.618
these days to use a forward slash saying,
okay, that's a PWA for that.

48
00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:04.486
But going back to the soda machines,

49
00:03:04.486 --> 00:03:08.419
it can be just soda/267.

50
00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.042
That's the id of that soda machine.

51
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.957
So each soda machine
will have a different id.

52
00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:14.222
Okay, make sense?

53
00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:16.084
That's the idea.

54
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:23.302
Let me go back and try to explain
why the id exist these days.

55
00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:28.042
No one asked yet, but what happens when
we are in a PWA on an operating system.

56
00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.668
Are we creating an executable
file in the OS?

57
00:03:31.668 --> 00:03:33.412
Are we compiling?

58
00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.390
Well, actually we are not doing anything.

59
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.683
The browser is the one doing things.

60
00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:44.352
Browser has its own implementation,
and in most cases,

61
00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:49.227
the browser is compiling an app or
packaging an app, okay?

62
00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:52.398
The app does not contain our source code.

63
00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.674
The app just contain metadata.

64
00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.903
It points to the URL, okay?

65
00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:02.005
But that app internally has an ID, okay?

66
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:08.650
And the thing is, for
years, let's open one PWA.

67
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.217
I mean, if you like coffee,
we can open Starbucks PWA.

68
00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:17.059
By the way, the Starbucks PWA is
available on app.starbucks.com that's

69
00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.614
the URL they're using, so
not star starbucks.com but

70
00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:24.713
app.star.com that's the PWA
version of Starbucks website.

71
00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:29.363
So if I open this, remember when we are
talking about PWA is everything that has

72
00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:32.616
to do with debugging is
available under application.

73
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:35.704
So we go to Application, and
here we have the manifest,

74
00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:38.216
where we can see the details
of the manifest.

75
00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:41.961
And some they have some warnings there,
but we can see some details.

76
00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:45.126
And here it says Computed App ID.

77
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:45.790
What happens?

78
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.633
Why it says Computed App ID?

79
00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:53.024
Because Starbucks is not using the ID
attribute, as I mentioned before.

80
00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:55.211
It wasn't there three years ago, okay?

81
00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:01.359
Well, they didn't use it, so
Chrome had to create its own ID,

82
00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:06.120
and it's creating the ID
based on the start URL.

83
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.536
It's a property that we
will have right now.

84
00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:10.963
What's the problem with
the start URL as a key?

85
00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:12.292
So think about database.

86
00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:15.670
It's a table of PWA's, okay?

87
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.648
What's the problem of using the start URL
as a key that the URL sometimes has some.

88
00:05:20.648 --> 00:05:21.724
What is this?

89
00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:24.157
utm_source does anyone know?

90
00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.812
I'm pretty sure you have
seen something similar.

91
00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:29.857
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: As a referrer,
like where it's coming from.

92
00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:30.522
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It has to do.

93
00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:31.542
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Not HTTP referrer.

94
00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.858
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's
not an HTTP header.

95
00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:34.850
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: But it's like words.

96
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.378
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman:
It's Google Analytics.

97
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:40.897
That's an argument for
Google Analytics, so Google Analytics,

98
00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:45.264
then will treat this navigation
as coming from the home screen.

99
00:05:45.264 --> 00:05:46.383
That's the string.

100
00:05:46.383 --> 00:05:48.727
The thing is that tomorrow,
maybe you wanna change this.

101
00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:53.724
You change the URL, and if you're using
the URL as an ID, we have a problem,

102
00:05:53.724 --> 00:05:58.904
okay, because we change the URL, and
then it thinks, it's a different PWA.

103
00:05:58.904 --> 00:06:01.170
Okay, you get it?

104
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.909
So if we change the start URL,
the problem is that Chrome will think it's

105
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.260
a different PWA, and then you will
end up with two installations,

106
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.064
the old URL and the new URL.

107
00:06:12.064 --> 00:06:15.435
Well, to solve the problem,
we now have the id.

108
00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:19.947
So you can have your own start URL and
in this start_url,

109
00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:24.365
you can add as many parameters and
arguments you want and

110
00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:27.750
you can change those arguments like from.

111
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.465
You can change those arguments
in the future without

112
00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:35.782
any problem knowing you have an id and
the id is not changing.

113
00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:40.156
Because remember, different IDs will
trigger different PWA installations.

114
00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.308
Okay, make sense?

115
00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:43.537
Why do we need a Start URL?

116
00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:45.125
That's the next question.

117
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:46.210
Think about this.

118
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.698
Let's go back to a Starbucks PWA.

119
00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:50.640
I'm in order.

120
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.726
I'm in, let's go to a hot teas and
I select a Chai Tea Latte.

121
00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:01.112
So what happens if I install the app.

122
00:07:01.112 --> 00:07:02.534
In fact, you can see this here.

123
00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:07.143
If I install the app here, do I wanna

124
00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:12.686
install the Chai Tea Latte as my homepage?

125
00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:18.883
No, right, so I wanna install
the whole app, not the current URL.

126
00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:24.464
So that's why, no matter where you are,
when you start a PWA, you define the URL

127
00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:29.817
that you wanna use as your start URL,
not bother from where it was installed.

128
00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:32.278
Okay, so now I have my PWA.

129
00:07:32.278 --> 00:07:36.418
I can select a store, and by the way,
you can see I'm using the Geolocation API.

130
00:07:36.418 --> 00:07:37.375
Look at the bottom.

131
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:41.467
I have the icon here with
the permission in the title bar,

132
00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:46.241
in the standalone title bar that
looks really cool with the green,

133
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:49.579
with the Starbucks green color there,
okay?

134
00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:51.544
So that's why we need a start URL.

135
00:07:51.544 --> 00:07:54.006
If you don't provide the start URL,

136
00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:59.090
you will have problems cuz the browser
will pick the current URL when the user

137
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.633
installs the app as the initial URL
of the app, we don't want that.

138
00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.315
Another important thing is a scope.

139
00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:12.858
Most of the time, scope, id, and
start-url they start as the same value.

140
00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.390
What's the scope?

141
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.917
The idea is that everything the scope
is a path within your origin.

142
00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:24.885
Everything that, if you make a link,
if you open another page,

143
00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:30.960
another HTML, if it's out of the scope,
it will trigger an in-app browser.

144
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.615
We will see that in a second in action.

145
00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:37.080
If it's within the scope,
it will treat it as part of your app, so

146
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.535
it will be rendered there.

147
00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:39.440
Let me show you this.

148
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440
So we are here at Starbucks, okay?

149
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.772
So if we change URLs,
I'm still in the app, okay?

150
00:08:46.772 --> 00:08:49.237
But there will be a point
we can try to find one.

151
00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.442
If not, I can fake it here.

152
00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:55.195
I can click on Spotify.

153
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.036
So of course, that's out of the scope.

154
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.398
It's a link out of the scope.

155
00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:01.812
So if I click here, just Spotify.

156
00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:02.718
Look what happens.

157
00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:07.368
So I'm still in the app,
the Starbucks app, but

158
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:12.019
where I have this bar,
this new bar here, okay,

159
00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:16.796
this one that is not really
a full browser, okay?

160
00:09:16.796 --> 00:09:20.808
But this is known as an inner browser,
so I'm still in a Starbucks app, but

161
00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:24.134
Chrome is rendering a tab say,
well, it's a Starbucks app.

162
00:09:24.134 --> 00:09:27.465
But you are just seeing here
is in a different URL, and

163
00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:29.769
you can see the domain and the title.

164
00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:35.211
Why is that appearing to reduce phishing?

165
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:38.350
Because, let's say you
have your bank account.

166
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.970
You open your bank, your home banking,
and someone is checking some JavaScript,

167
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.006
and it's changing the URL
of the current navigation.

168
00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:50.778
You want to know that now
you're on the different URL.

169
00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:51.334
Okay, it makes sense.

170
00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:53.175
So that's why that happens.

171
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.960
So that's why it's
important to add the scope.

172
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.544
If you don't define the scope,
it will take the current folder that,

173
00:09:59.544 --> 00:10:03.031
yeah, it's everything is there in
the root, it will work anyway.

174
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.332
But it's important to specify explicitly,
yeah, I do have a scope.

175
00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:11.133
Then the other important two are name and
short_name.

176
00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:13.213
By the way, in this session,

177
00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:17.221
we will always use underscore
as a way to separate words.

178
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.588
The name is the name of your app.

179
00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:24.302
It can be a long name for
example, I can call this is

180
00:10:24.302 --> 00:10:29.707
the CodepadMasters,
the best notepad for your device.

181
00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:32.027
So what's the problem with that name?

182
00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:37.155
It's too long for an icon, for
the name that appears in the icon.

183
00:10:37.155 --> 00:10:41.260
But it might be okay for
the alt-tab, for the tag switcher,

184
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.011
when you're searching the app, okay?

185
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.497
But not for the icon.

186
00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:50.146
So that's why we have a short name
where we can say, I don't know,

187
00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:54.062
CodeMaster, maybe even
CodepadMaster doesn't fit.

188
00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:56.881
So, it depends on the device.

189
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:58.648
It's difficult to give you one rule.

190
00:10:58.648 --> 00:11:02.892
But typically,
11 characters is safe anywhere.

191
00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:07.084
Also, it depends on the font size of
the user but 11 characters is okay.

192
00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.552
More than 11 characters, it might not fit.

193
00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:14.227
But you can say, I don't know,
CM or CodePadM or

194
00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:17.999
whatever you pick your option, okay?

195
00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.627
So if I just say this,

196
00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:25.143
I'm still not the progressive web app
because there is one more property

197
00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:30.671
that is the most important property
that I have to set that says display.

198
00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:35.425
And I said choose,
I need to set the value as standalone.

199
00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:39.232
In a couple of minutes, we will see all
the possible values for that thing.

200
00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:45.175
But that's the one that says, hey,
I wanna be in a standalone app, okay?

201
00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:46.793
I don't just wanna be a website.

202
00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:48.238
I wanna be a standalone app.

203
00:11:48.238 --> 00:11:55.332
So if you save this, now, for example, if
I go to the iOS simulator and I refresh.

204
00:11:55.332 --> 00:12:00.396
I still don't see any difference, but
if I add to the home screen share,

205
00:12:00.396 --> 00:12:03.397
add to the home screen, nothing happens.

206
00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:06.386
I was expecting to see my title here why?

207
00:12:06.386 --> 00:12:08.197
I set the name.

208
00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:09.473
I don't have an icon yet.

209
00:12:09.473 --> 00:12:10.859
Yeah, that's true.

210
00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:13.259
But I set the name.

211
00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:14.958
Why is not taking my name?

212
00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.747
Does anyone know?

213
00:12:16.747 --> 00:12:18.335
Does anyone knows why?

214
00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:21.569
There is one important
step that we are missing.

215
00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:30.000
And I'm pushing your brains because
we have already seen that step.

216
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.488
How does the browser
knows that's my manifest?

217
00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:36.017
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: You have
to link it from the HTML.

218
00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:38.715
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Exactly
how to link it from the HTML.

219
00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:40.207
If not, it's not gonna work.

220
00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:44.521
So I need to go to my HTML and
typically in the hell, you don't need to,

221
00:12:44.521 --> 00:12:46.360
but typically it goes there.

222
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.618
We are going to add the rel
manifest pointing to that file.

223
00:12:50.618 --> 00:12:55.410
If not, it's not gonna work, okay?

224
00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:01.588
It's not like the fob icon that it looks
by default for a file with a name, no.

225
00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:04.003
So you have to link it explicitly.

226
00:13:04.003 --> 00:13:07.564
So after doing that, let's go back here.

227
00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:11.487
I need to refresh, reload,
so it should get it.

228
00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:14.203
And I can try again,
add to the home screen.

229
00:13:14.203 --> 00:13:16.554
And now you can see a difference.

230
00:13:16.554 --> 00:13:22.977
I see CodepadM, so
it's kind of reading my manifest.

231
00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:29.645
I don't have an icon, so by default these
days, iOS is just using your theme color.

232
00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:34.499
And because I don't have a theme color,
it's just black by default, and

233
00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:38.977
a letter with the initial of your title,
of the app's name, okay?

234
00:13:38.977 --> 00:13:42.807
Before, that was two years ago,
it was taking a screenshot.

235
00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:45.395
That's actually pretty cool to see
the screenshot, but they changed it,

236
00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:45.937
[LAUGH] anyway.

237
00:13:45.937 --> 00:13:48.491
So if I add it, I have an icon.

238
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:51.417
You say, yeah, but
that's a bookmark to your website.

239
00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:56.490
But if I open this,
now I'm in full screen.

240
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.417
So I'm my own app.

241
00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:00.500
So, just that?

242
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.960
Yeah, I kind of like that.

243
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.998
Trying to pull this over, okay.

244
00:14:07.998 --> 00:14:10.921
So I have my own app on iOS.

245
00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:16.243
Yeah, congratulations, you have just
created your first, iOS application.

246
00:14:16.243 --> 00:14:19.550
Now it looks like an app.

247
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.487
We can still make it better, nicer, okay?

248
00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:30.946
But just having this manifest with
just some properties, we have an app.

249
00:14:30.946 --> 00:14:33.006
We are not passing
the criteria completely.

250
00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:37.824
We don't have an icon for example, that
was mandatory and some other properties.

251
00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:42.641
Something else that I can add for
now is the theme color, theme_color.

252
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:49.995
I can set any CSS color will work,
but stay with the CSS3 colors,

253
00:14:49.995 --> 00:14:56.171
even CSS2 colors that are just
the name colors Or RGV.

254
00:14:56.171 --> 00:15:01.337
So, don't use transparencies,
the new CSS colors that

255
00:15:01.337 --> 00:15:06.400
we can define not in the RGV space,
but in the P3 space.

256
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.132
Don't use that because it may
work on some platform, but

257
00:15:10.132 --> 00:15:14.898
it's not like compatible, and
you don't need to get into that, okay?

258
00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:16.564
So for example, in our case,

259
00:15:16.564 --> 00:15:19.839
if I go to style CSS,
I have a couple of CSS variables here.

260
00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:24.699
So I can take one of these colors,
I know this one, or you can try with your

261
00:15:24.699 --> 00:15:29.756
own color, if you want, doesn't matter,
and I paste the CSS color here.

262
00:15:29.756 --> 00:15:33.266
And what's gonna be the change?

263
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:37.624
First once and
it's important I change the manifest,

264
00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:41.045
should I see the change
in the install app?

265
00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:43.625
I'm seeing a face of a clear no, but

266
00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:47.500
actually the answer is,
it depends on the platform.

267
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.292
On iOS, the answer is, no, yeah,
you were right, but on iOS.

268
00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:53.748
So on iOS, if I change the manifest,

269
00:15:53.748 --> 00:15:57.967
it's not gonna change the icons
that were already installed.

270
00:15:57.967 --> 00:16:01.764
On Android and next desktop,
it will update the metadata and

271
00:16:01.764 --> 00:16:04.973
the icon not immediately,
it will take some time.

272
00:16:04.973 --> 00:16:06.459
There is an update process.

273
00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.217
I mean,
in an advanced workshop we can get there.

274
00:16:09.217 --> 00:16:13.257
Hey, but
there is a whole algorithm actually,

275
00:16:13.257 --> 00:16:18.715
if you go to web.devlearnpwa,
that's the book that I author.

276
00:16:18.715 --> 00:16:21.571
I have all the explanation and
the algorithm, and

277
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:24.432
it's too complex to take
time right now for that.

278
00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:29.285
But just to say that if you change and
publish a new manifest with new data,

279
00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:33.917
some browsers will pick that change and
your users will get an update.

280
00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:37.805
IOS, no, so in IOS,
I should delete the icon or

281
00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:42.296
just install another one,
wherever you want, okay?

282
00:16:42.296 --> 00:16:47.949
So I can go here, refresh,
install another one.

283
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:50.883
And now there is a difference.

284
00:16:50.883 --> 00:16:53.498
I don't see the black background.

285
00:16:53.498 --> 00:16:56.887
And now you see that color
is actually my theme color,

286
00:16:56.887 --> 00:16:59.386
so you can see I'm matching the color.

287
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:05.143
So now the status bar also has that color.

288
00:17:05.143 --> 00:17:10.527
That's the same color when you define
the theme color in JSON, that's all.

289
00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:11.606
&gt;&gt; Female Speaker: This is only for

290
00:17:11.606 --> 00:17:16.267
the manifest in terms of having to
re download the app for updates.

291
00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:18.891
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah, so,
the thing that I set for updates is for

292
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:20.749
the manifest, for the metadata.

293
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:25.781
So, if you wanna change the colors, you
wanna change the icon, you wanna change

294
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:30.752
the app, same, the contents of the app
has a completely different lifecycle.

295
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:34.515
And, yeah, you will be able to update
the contents of your iOS, okay?

296
00:17:34.515 --> 00:17:39.545
So I was just talking about the metadata
and the icon that is installed.

297
00:17:39.545 --> 00:17:41.670
That's the basic of a web app manifest.

298
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.197
And before actually seeing more
about the contents of that file,

299
00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:51.054
it's important to say that there is
no standard way to make our content

300
00:17:51.054 --> 00:17:56.107
available for example in different
languages using just the manifest.

301
00:17:56.107 --> 00:18:00.985
So there is no way to use
the JavaScript internationalization,

302
00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:02.891
API or things like that.

303
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:08.040
So the only way in case you want your icon
or the name of your app to be in Chinese,

304
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.881
in Russian, in English, in Spanish and
and so on, is to create different

305
00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:17.906
manifest first and then change the link or
serve the manifest dynamically.

306
00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:22.806
So server-side, using server-side
mappings or your server-side

307
00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:27.963
language to detect the language and
then change the response on the JSON.
