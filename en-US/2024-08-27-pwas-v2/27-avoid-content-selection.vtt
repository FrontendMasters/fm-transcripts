00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:04.399
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Well, let's go
back to something nicer, less cryptic,

2
00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.472
less low-level, and here I'm going to just
show you a couple of quick things that

3
00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:16.104
you can do to improve the user interface
of your PWA before the final part that

4
00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:21.936
is actually short, but really important,
that has to do with distribution.

5
00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.371
So avoid content selection.

6
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.177
This is a web app, okay?

7
00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:34.321
So by default everything is selectable,
including logos, including menu items.

8
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:41.177
So, I mean, let's go back to, I don't
know, here, everything is selectable here.

9
00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:46.259
If you're using your fingers to select,
I'm trying to pick that pointer.

10
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:47.788
I can for some reason.

11
00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:50.494
I'm trying to bigger that pointer,

12
00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:55.836
you can see I can select that title and
that does happen on an app, right?

13
00:00:55.836 --> 00:01:00.118
It doesn't make any sense so
that you can do this.

14
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:02.294
And sometimes you don't even
want to just click there.

15
00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:05.214
You click and
put your finger there, and yeah,

16
00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:07.843
it doesn't make any sense, look at that.

17
00:01:07.843 --> 00:01:10.550
I don't want that in my app, okay?

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.974
I don't want those weird selections so
well, you can apply CSS.

19
00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:19.722
You will select, none, but be careful.

20
00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:23.966
Because if you are lazy,
you will do something like for example,

21
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.604
I will just put this
at the top of my size.

22
00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:27.327
Something like this.

23
00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:33.903
I mean, it works, but yeah,
for accessibility reasons,

24
00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:39.305
it's actually not a good idea to do this,
okay?

25
00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:44.276
By the way, we are still need to use
the dash WebKit prefix for some browsers,

26
00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:45.436
unfortunately.

27
00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:49.858
I mean, if I do that now,
nothing is selectable, which is not good,

28
00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:54.843
because sometimes you wanna copy and
paste, mostly when it's data, okay?

29
00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.112
So use be smart, that's why.

30
00:01:58.112 --> 00:02:02.677
So now, if I refine anyway,
how can I refresh my PWA,

31
00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:08.174
I don't have any refresh button,
so yeah, you are doing this.

32
00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:11.979
That means I need to kill the app and
open the app again.

33
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.487
Do I need to install the app again?

34
00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:18.160
No, but if I have a cache first,

35
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.199
I have to check what happens with
a new remember, I'm changing the CSS.

36
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.978
If I have a service worker that is
caching, I might have a problem with that.

37
00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:30.085
Okay, well, I'm trying to select now.

38
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.862
And I mean, you don't see that,
but believe me,

39
00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:35.920
I'm trying to select as before,
and I cannot do that.

40
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.999
Okay, that's a quick hack.

41
00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.479
It's good to create an app
like its experience, and

42
00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.467
not just keep it as a website.
