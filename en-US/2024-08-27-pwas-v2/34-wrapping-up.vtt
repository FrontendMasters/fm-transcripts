WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.680
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So
we've seen a lot today.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.240
We cover just the foundations of the PWA
platform, links and discoverability.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.590
We know it's still local host URL.

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.820
It's a web URL.

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.240
Easy to deploy.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.790
We see that.

7
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.740
Easy to update.

8
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
You change the files,
we don't need nothing special.

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.684
We are still using the web.

10
00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:23.297
Offline access, we've seen that service
workers is the one that will let us

11
00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:25.112
create that offline access.

12
00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:29.853
How to make an installed icon and
standalone, that's the manifest mainly.

13
00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:32.703
OS integration has to do
also with manifest data.

14
00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:37.935
And performance and UX,
we didn't explain a lot of things today,

15
00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:42.700
but also OS integration,
we cover all the stuff on design and

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.106
things that will give you
a better app like experience.

17
00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.756
There are much more around PWAs.

18
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:56.835
Web push notifications, the batch API
that will let you add a little rev,

19
00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:01.852
but it can be a dot on Android or
it can be a number on your icon.

20
00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:07.674
The shortcuts API that will right click
menu to the icon when it's installed.

21
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:11.685
The share API 2.0, the web share
that will let you share files.

22
00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:17.197
The share target API that will let
your PWA be the one that can open or

23
00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:20.014
receive share from other app.

24
00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:24.821
So then from Instagram, you can share and
the target can be your PWA.

25
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:31.131
You will receive, you are the target of
a share operation within that device.

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:37.441
File handling, you can be the default
handler for PDF or PNG files and so on.

27
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:42.184
URL handling, you can create your own
protocol that then will, if you find

28
00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:46.565
a link on an email or something,
can open your app, your native app.

29
00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:49.495
And there are much more.

30
00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:53.572
These are all other APIs that some of
them require you to first have a service

31
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:57.925
worker, some of them require you to first
have the web app manifest, and so on.

32
00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.603
And at Fronted Masters,
I'm not sure if you know that guy.

33
00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:03.107
There is always the same guy there.

34
00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:11.873
Here I have six workshops where you can
continue the conversation with me on PWAs.

35
00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.563
On things that they are for
the web platform, but

36
00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:18.663
at least they will help you with
some things such as performance.

37
00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:19.766
So web performance.

38
00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:26.957
Web capabilities, again, if you wanna
use sensors, Bluetooth, geolocation.

39
00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:32.997
Vanilla JavaScript, in case you wanna get
into working directly without frameworks.

40
00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:37.876
Web Storage AP to know more about quotas,
about persistence,

41
00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:41.385
about index dv,
how to work with databases.

42
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:46.017
Web authentication API is something
that we didn't mention yet, but

43
00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:49.637
you can use face ID or
you can use the finger on Android.

44
00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:55.590
And you can log in users
on PWAs using those APIs.

45
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.708
You can use pass keys on your PWAs.

46
00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:03.634
So you can integrate with the operating
system for logging using passkeys.

47
00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:08.878
And JavaScript in the background,
where we see more on service workers,

48
00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.328
we implement push notifications there.

49
00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:16.558
And also we talk about how you can
synchronize data in the background.

50
00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:23.458
And so there are a lot of content, so
you can't get bored actually right here.

51
00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:27.228
&gt;&gt; Learner 1: What do you think
the future of PWAs are for developers?

52
00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:30.858
Is it something that's worth investing in,
like investing time in?

53
00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:32.892
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I think that
if you are not investing time in them,

54
00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:34.808
you're not investing time on the web.

55
00:03:34.808 --> 00:03:35.708
Remember, it's just the web.

56
00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.358
Let's go back to the first discussion.

57
00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:40.501
Forget about the name PWA,
it's just a web.

58
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.501
It's the DNA of the web.

59
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:45.101
So let's go back to that idea
of this is the DNA of the web.

60
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.187
So if you care about the web,
if you should be doing website.

61
00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:50.525
If you're doing web apps,
it's just the same.

62
00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:54.571
It's just the installation layer,
the integration with the operating system.

63
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.907
So I think it's still growing and

64
00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:02.800
don't think that this
is something different.

65
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.690
It's not like, I need to learn
React Native, Flutter, or PWAs.

66
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.150
If you're a web developer,
PWAs is part of your DNA.

67
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.270
It's not something different
that you need to learn, okay?

68
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.600
So it's just a design pattern on the web.

69
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.277
&gt;&gt; Learner 2: I had a question.

70
00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:25.238
Just about the Web APK icons.

71
00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:30.265
So it's not like the file
type of the icon itself,

72
00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:33.857
but it's that makes it available or

73
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:38.628
accessible versus the shortcut icons.

74
00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.482
It's just, you need to pass the PWA

75
00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:44.406
criteria and then-
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: You need to pass

76
00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:49.406
the PWA criteria and
you need to have a phone with Google Play

77
00:04:49.406 --> 00:04:54.855
services enable, and
the browser should be Chrome first off.

78
00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:55.450
&gt;&gt; Learner 2: Okay, but

79
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.965
if you pass those requirements then-
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Then it

80
00:04:57.965 --> 00:04:58.753
should work.

81
00:04:58.753 --> 00:04:59.537
&gt;&gt; Learner 2: That's what should happen.

82
00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:03.513
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: If you're using
the emulator and not the real device,

83
00:05:03.513 --> 00:05:08.355
you need to check that your Chrome
is updated inside the emulator,

84
00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:13.164
and also that your your emulator
has Google Play services.

85
00:05:13.164 --> 00:05:14.024
&gt;&gt; Learner 2: Okay.

86
00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:16.004
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: If you don't have
that, it will fall back to shortcut.

87
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:18.497
And by the way, if,
because this is using a server,

88
00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:20.614
it's called the Web APK minting server.

89
00:05:20.614 --> 00:05:23.307
It's minting a Web APK server file.

90
00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:28.032
So if the server is down and it cannot
create the APK, it has a timeout,

91
00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:33.517
it's typically 20 to 30 seconds,
it will fall back to shortcuts.

92
00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:36.529
&gt;&gt; Learner 3: Say I have to
handle user tokens offline and

93
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.427
then reconcile them when back online.

94
00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:45.068
Would your JavaScript in the background
course be a good resource for me?

95
00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:50.123
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yes, because
we see the APIs that you need to use to

96
00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:50.764
do that.

97
00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:54.219
If I remember correctly,
at that particular course,

98
00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.449
someone asked specifically
about that use case and

99
00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.445
I think that I did a long answer
on specifically that question.

100
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.401
So yeah, the answer is yes.

101
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.336
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Okay, and again,
if you wanna learn more about everything

102
00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:11.735
that we've seen today,
you also have the Learn PWA course.

103
00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:13.985
But it's actually an ebook, not a course.

104
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:17.995
It's an interactive ebook where
it gets deeper on most of

105
00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:22.934
the stuff that we cover today and
maybe something else as well, okay?

106
00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:28.833
Just saying that,
that's all I have for you for PWAs.

107
00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:32.877
&gt;&gt; Learners: [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Thank you.

108
00:06:32.877 --> 00:06:36.552
&gt;&gt; Learners: [APPLAUSE]
