WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.669
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: The last thing
that I have for the installation is this,

2
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.984
if we look at the Squoosh installation,
let me uninstall the app so

3
00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:10.309
we can see the installation again.

4
00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.737
Also we can check edge as well,
Microsoft Edge,

5
00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:19.819
just to see something different,
look at the Squoosh.

6
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.155
Look at our installation,
let me also uninstall mine.

7
00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:28.218
Uninstall, okay, so this is

8
00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:34.096
our installation dialog, okay?

9
00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:40.102
That you're happy with it, and
this is a Sqooch installation dialogue.

10
00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.952
This one, it's better, right?

11
00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.132
So, why?

12
00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.087
In fact, let's try on Edge.

13
00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:54.202
Localhost 3000, that's not our
app actually, this is our app.

14
00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.845
That was probably a service worker
that has installed the previews on

15
00:00:58.845 --> 00:00:59.891
the same port.

16
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.977
We have this one here,
it's a different one.

17
00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:07.308
It says Install CodepadMasters, you can
also open as a tab window from here.

18
00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:09.016
Look at that actually pretty cool.

19
00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.218
So you can enable tab
mode as a user in Edge.

20
00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:19.049
And Squoosh,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: .app,

21
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.851
you can install the Squoosh app,
and here it has the same.

22
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.799
Well, here we are the same in Edge, okay?

23
00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.001
But in Chrome, the other one is better.

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.479
Why?

25
00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.096
I mean, I have the slide, I have
the theory, but let's try to inspect,

26
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.404
let's be hackers.

27
00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:41.810
I mean, if I go to the application on the
Manifest, I can try to see the Manifest.

28
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.526
They're using the old name Manifest.json.

29
00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:48.671
If you right-click,
you can open the manifest in the new tab.

30
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:49.474
We can see the manifest.

31
00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:52.633
The manifest is public of every PWA.

32
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.244
This is their manifest.

33
00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.212
Let me select pretty print so
we can see it better.

34
00:01:57.212 --> 00:02:01.818
So name, short_name,
start_url, theme, color,

35
00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:06.228
icon, and then we have description,
categories and

36
00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:11.138
screenshots with form factor narrow and
form factor wide.

37
00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:17.266
Let's say phones, desktop.

38
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:22.409
And the magic is actually
the description and the screenshorts.

39
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.134
If you have description and
screenshot it will work.

40
00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:28.760
So let's do at least one just for
testing this.

41
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.170
So I will go to the manifest
app.webmanifest.

42
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.203
So I need to add let's
add the description.

43
00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.630
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: So
the best notepad app for taking notes

44
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.823
while doing Frontend Masters courses.

45
00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:51.542
Okay, that's the description,
that's the text.

46
00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:54.839
And then I have screenshots.

47
00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.517
That screenshot is using
the same schema as icons, so

48
00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:01.550
we are talking about
objects with a source.

49
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.679
So I'm going to create a screenshot.png or
jpeg.

50
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:10.129
Wherever, a size that,
actually sizes is optional.

51
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.299
You don't need to specify the size.

52
00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.739
They have it here, but
I think they're not optional,

53
00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.078
mandatory, but
we can add a size, the type.

54
00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:21.341
I'm leaving the size for later.

55
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:26.063
So I will take a screen, real
screenshot, and I will use it, image/png.

56
00:03:26.063 --> 00:03:32.575
And then it is important you need to
specify form_factor, narrow or wide.

57
00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:36.531
For desktop, it's wide,
for mobile, it's narrow.

58
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:41.092
So if you want to see that,
reach UI installation dialog,

59
00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:45.095
that's the name,
that right now works in Chrome,

60
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:49.936
on desktop and Android,
you need to specify a description and

61
00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:54.146
at least one screenshot for
the current form factor.

62
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:58.978
So at least one wide,
and one narrow, okay?

63
00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:04.312
Okay, so now I will open or
take a screenshot.

64
00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.495
I can just for the screenshot.

65
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:07.829
I can just do something like this.

66
00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.957
It doesn't matter, right?

67
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:13.329
So,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: Let's take that

68
00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.192
screenshot.

69
00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:18.413
So I will create an image of that.

70
00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:19.413
And, what is this?

71
00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:23.987
I don't know, the preview.

72
00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:25.510
Other images that I had in the preview.

73
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.784
So I will save this.

74
00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:31.342
Of course, the file I'm going
to save is not compressed.

75
00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:33.287
It's nothing, just a file.

76
00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:39.205
But do you know any web
app to compress images?

77
00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:40.323
Yeah, we know.

78
00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:44.009
So I've saved this, but
I can open a Squoosh.

79
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.976
Well, I have uninstalled
it, but I have it here.

80
00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:51.226
Now you know how to create
this install button.

81
00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:53.741
By the way, look at the bottom.

82
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.505
How fortunate you are that we
have just got that message.

83
00:04:58.505 --> 00:04:59.604
What is that?

84
00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:05.469
Update available,
what do you think that is?

85
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.399
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Probably
a server push of new

86
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:11.322
assets, of-
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: Some assets have

87
00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:14.641
changed, and it's asking me, hey,

88
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:18.804
do you wanna reload the app so
we can take it now?

89
00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:20.245
Okay, I didn't tweet it.

90
00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.503
Or need to send a message to the team.

91
00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:24.763
So they did, I don't know,
but it was just luck.

92
00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:31.322
[LAUGH] So now I can take my app here,
I can open now my web app.

93
00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:35.951
So the screenshot is what is
35k it's not so bad anyway.

94
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:40.014
And I can convert it to, no maybe I want.

95
00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:47.833
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: This is JPEG.

96
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:49.856
This is so big.

97
00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:50.468
There we are.

98
00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:54.270
Now we are talking so I kind of use OxiPNG.

99
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.232
Will save me 55%,
which is okay, save it as.

100
00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:03.688
Screenshot, actually not
this one screenshot.

101
00:06:03.688 --> 00:06:07.088
So a screenshot.png is here, okay?

102
00:06:07.088 --> 00:06:09.014
It's this is the size.

103
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:18.301
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: Okay?
We have a description.

104
00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:19.420
We have one screenshot.

105
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.281
Let's try.

106
00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:29.916
So go back here, refresh, cross your
fingers, click here, there we are.

107
00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:33.948
We have a better,
a richer UI installation,

108
00:06:33.948 --> 00:06:37.450
just because I added one screenshot and

109
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.561
one,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: And

110
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:42.164
the description.

111
00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:47.708
And by the way, in applications manifest,
you can see the errors.

112
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.865
I'm still having an error.

113
00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:53.368
Say, hey, Richer PWA install
UI won't be available on mobile.

114
00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:55.458
Why?
Because I don't have a narrow screenshot.

115
00:06:56.798 --> 00:07:00.007
So, just don't tell anyone, but

116
00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:05.218
I will just say you know what
this is narrow yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:06.939
So I have now a narrow screen.

118
00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:08.017
So I'm using the same one.

119
00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:10.969
So now I don't have any warnings here.

120
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:16.389
So I would also get a Rich UI
installation available on mobile.

121
00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.861
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Is the Desktop
Safari's New add to dock option,

122
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:22.949
essentially the same as installing.

123
00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:23.742
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: Yeah,
that's correct.

124
00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:28.029
Add to dock in Safari is
the the installation part.

125
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:30.159
Unfortunately, they don't call it install.

126
00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:35.019
It's add to dock, okay, but yeah, is one.

127
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:39.733
There is a webkit blog post

128
00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:44.669
that shows how that works.

129
00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.367
It's called WebApp on Mac.

130
00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:50.140
They don't say PWAs, they say WebApps.

131
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.174
And they explain the add to dock,
Safari file, add to dock,

132
00:07:55.174 --> 00:08:00.441
where you can go to file and
from here add to dock, okay?

133
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.485
And you can add it as a PWA.

134
00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:07.854
Actually, we can try our own,
localhost 3000 PWA file,

135
00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:15.901
add to dock, it's taking my name, it's
taking my icons, so it's reading my data.

136
00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:19.193
It lets me change the name because
I can add more than one.

137
00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:24.285
With the same idea on iOS that
you can maybe you want more.

138
00:08:24.285 --> 00:08:24.833
Let's change the name.

139
00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:30.085
Let's say Frontend pad,
wherever I change the name.

140
00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:36.819
So now I have in my Mac Frontend pad, and
this is how Safari is rendering my PWA.

141
00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:42.708
I'm not seeing the install, button by
the way, that's my media query in action.

142
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.254
Okay, that's my media query.

143
00:08:44.254 --> 00:08:48.068
Yeah, you should do something with
the space and you need to work with that.

144
00:08:48.068 --> 00:08:49.831
But yeah, now it's working, right?

145
00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:53.398
Actually, I have two
versions of my app now.

146
00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:54.342
I can see them here.

147
00:08:54.342 --> 00:08:58.618
This is Frontend pad, and the other one I
think the other one is not installed yet.

148
00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:04.018
But if I click here,
I have two screenshot now,

149
00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:10.503
I have this one and
the other one is here, the font size.

150
00:09:10.503 --> 00:09:12.366
I can try to match the 100%.

151
00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:14.384
I think that both are 100%.

152
00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:17.966
Yeah, it's not exactly the same now.

153
00:09:17.966 --> 00:09:21.646
Now they're both are 100% font size.

154
00:09:21.646 --> 00:09:23.326
So one is Chrome, the other one is Safari.

155
00:09:27.862 --> 00:09:28.472
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: Two apps.

156
00:09:28.472 --> 00:09:35.068
This is Frontend app, this is, oops,
sorry, it was just do something like this.

157
00:09:35.068 --> 00:09:36.334
This is CodePen Masters.

158
00:09:36.334 --> 00:09:39.224
This is the Chrome one and
this is Frontend pad.

159
00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:46.499
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firttman: So yeah, add to
dock is how you install PWAs on Safari.
