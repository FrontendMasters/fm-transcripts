00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.989
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: That's Steve Jobs
in WWDC,07.

2
00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:09.912
I remember watching that live
stream when he, that was,

3
00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:15.555
I think, a couple of months after
he presented the first iPhone,

4
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.465
and he was about to present the iPhone,
SDK.

5
00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.970
So how to create app for the iPhone, okay?

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.598
So let's listen to Steve.

7
00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:26.237
&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs: Now, what about developers?

8
00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:29.251
&gt;&gt; Audience: [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs: What about developers?

9
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.584
&gt;&gt; Audience: [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs: We have been trying to come

10
00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:36.975
up with a solution to expand
the capabilities of iPhone by

11
00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.459
letting developers write great apps for
it.

12
00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:45.086
And yet,
keep the iPhone reliable and secure,

13
00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:49.607
and we've come up with
a very sweet solution.

14
00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:54.607
We've got an innovative new
way to create applications for

15
00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:58.207
mobile devices, really innovative, and

16
00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:03.811
it's all based on the fact that
iPhone has the full Safari inside.

17
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:09.246
The full Safari engine
is inside of iPhone.

18
00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:12.563
And it gives us tremendous capability,

19
00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:17.057
more than has ever been in
a mobile device to this date.

20
00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:21.928
And so, you can write amazing web 2.0 and

21
00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:25.612
Ajax apps, that look exactly and

22
00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:30.097
behave exactly like apps on the iPhone.

23
00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:35.152
And these apps can integrate
perfectly with iPhone services.

24
00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:39.086
They can make a call,
they can send an email,

25
00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:42.929
they can look up
an location on Google maps.

26
00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:46.765
&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs: After you write them,
you have instant distribution,

27
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:48.515
you don't have to worry
about distribution.

28
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:53.155
Just put them on your internet server,
and they're really easy to update.

29
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:56.122
Just change the code on your own server,

30
00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:01.289
rather than having to go through
this really complex update process.

31
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.984
And they're secure with the same
kind of security you'd use for

32
00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:13.523
transactions with Amazon or a bank,
and they run securely on the iPhone so

33
00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:18.392
they don't compromise its reliability or
security.

34
00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:19.483
And guess what?

35
00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:24.035
There's no SDK that you need,
you've got everything you need,

36
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:28.421
if you know how to write apps using
the most modern web standards

37
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:31.512
to write amazing apps for
the iPhone today.

38
00:02:31.512 --> 00:02:34.604
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Yeah,
well, Steve is right.

39
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:41.054
Actually, he was presenting progresive web
apps, and actually in a pretty good way.

40
00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:45.973
He was using different terms, okay,
because we are talking about almost 20

41
00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:50.829
years that has passed in, [LAUGH] that
almost incredible but web 2.0 Ajax.

42
00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.161
But it's just,
he was just talking about vanilla

43
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:59.090
JavaScript using just the Fetch API,
using the cloud, and that's all.

44
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.052
Actually, that doesn't mean
that Apple created PWAs.

45
00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:06.482
Well, not the term,
we mentioned that the term,

46
00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:12.209
the term was actually was coined by a
Google engineer, actually 10 years after.

47
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.638
But, actually no,
we can't say that... Apple was

48
00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:21.196
the first one that made
that big push initially.

49
00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:25.087
But before that, we had also web app for
Symbian, for Blackberry,

50
00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:27.692
there were other mobile operating systems.

51
00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:33.611
I made a lot of web apps for those
platforms and they were not called PWAs,

52
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.411
they were mobile widgets, different names.

53
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:42.898
And actually the first one, the first
platform that it's a kind of similar

54
00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:48.055
of what we're going to do today
was created by Microsoft in 1999.

55
00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.959
It was called MTAs.

56
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.224
MTA was Microsoft HTML applications,
something like that.

57
00:03:57.224 --> 00:04:01.033
And it was actually a way to take HTML and

58
00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.086
package that HTML as a window app, okay?

59
00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:09.286
Kind of something that we do
these days with electron, okay?

60
00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:11.410
Kind of that, so it's not new, okay?

61
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.969
But actually it's an old ideal,
it's not a new idea.
