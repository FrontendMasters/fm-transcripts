00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.141
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's
start creating a PWA.

2
00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.054
Let's first talk about
the components of a PWA.

3
00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:06.191
So what's a PWA?

4
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:09.158
What do we need to create a PWA?

5
00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:14.497
We need a web app,
any web app, any website.

6
00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:19.155
Actually, it can be a website,
not really a web app, okay?

7
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:21.717
A web app manifest, that's something new.

8
00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:23.138
So we will start talking about that.

9
00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:27.627
We need a web app manifest, and
sometimes we need a service worker.

10
00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:32.043
Why I'm saying sometimes, because I
mentioned that this service worker is

11
00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:34.806
the one that will make
our app offline capable.

12
00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.213
And now it's kind of optional.

13
00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:41.238
So it's becoming optional, okay?

14
00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:44.893
So the concept is changing with time,
and it's becoming more flexible.

15
00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:48.869
As I mentioned before,
initially, eight years ago,

16
00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:53.287
it was heartbreaking that you
have to have a service worker.

17
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:57.277
Now, if you don't have it,
it will work anyway, okay?

18
00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:59.825
So that means that we
have some kind of levels.

19
00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.385
We have a full level.

20
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:05.053
That means you're doing nothing.

21
00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:09.581
Actually, I'm not sure if you know this,
but if you have done nothing for

22
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.723
your website,
something that is also underused,

23
00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.739
on desktop,
you can install it as an app as well.

24
00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:17.203
I'm not sure if you know that.

25
00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:19.869
So let me get out of here for a second.

26
00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.910
So If I go to Wikipedia,
that is not a PWA,

27
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.796
I can take any article.

28
00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:32.007
No let's take anyone that is not
political, Paramount Pictures.

29
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.750
And I can go here, Save and Share.

30
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.384
I don't have the normally installed.

31
00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:43.763
I have a new one, this is new,
Install Page as App, on any html.

32
00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:50.301
When you do that, it kind of creates
a PWA, even if it's not a PWA.

33
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.575
That's why I can't change
the title because, okay,

34
00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.791
how do you wanna call the app, okay?

35
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:59.184
Okay, Paramount wherever, paramount PWA.

36
00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.562
Okay, Install.

37
00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:02.029
So is it a PWA?

38
00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:07.165
Well, not really, but now we have
some basic support on desktop only.

39
00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:11.802
On Android, you can add to
the home screen and it's bookmark,

40
00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:14.440
and it's not open as an app, okay?

41
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.656
It's a link, a bookmark to the browser.

42
00:02:17.656 --> 00:02:25.243
So if I install this, now, I have a PWA
for Paramount PWA, pointing to that URL.

43
00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:26.979
You can see there are some differences.

44
00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:33.867
For example, we have the back button and
the reload that wasn't there before, why?

45
00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:37.035
Because they know that this is not a PWA.

46
00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:41.602
So they wanna offer us
a minimal user interface, so

47
00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:45.119
we can navigate here, because if not.

48
00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.091
And when we are getting
out of the initial HTML,

49
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.987
we are seeing this bar here saying okay,
now,

50
00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:55.986
we are not in the initial HTML you added
as an app, it's a different one, okay?

51
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.285
But you can continue navigate and go back.

52
00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:02.268
And it took the favicon,

53
00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:06.448
okay, as of the app icon.

54
00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:10.602
So that's kind of a basic
level that you already have.

55
00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:16.088
But yeah, if that's the case,
we can end the workshop here, right?

56
00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:19.425
But there are more that we can do for.

57
00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:23.703
For example, we can provide some
basic metadata, change the icon,

58
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.447
define the title for
when you install this.

59
00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:28.577
So we can provide something else.

60
00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:33.774
We can also pass something
known as a PWA criteria.

61
00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:40.367
So passing the PWA criteria is kind of
saying, okay, I'm a PWA, I have the badge.

62
00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.346
I'm a PWA, okay?

63
00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:47.478
And then you can go into
a full offline experience that

64
00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:52.737
now is not mandatory, but
it's the one level, okay?

65
00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:56.326
So the criteria is defined by the browser.

66
00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:01.613
If passed, there are hints, banners,
dialogs, or bars explaining to the user

67
00:04:01.613 --> 00:04:06.855
that the current web app is installable,
and it will invite them to install it.

68
00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:11.639
It depends on the browser, but, for
example, on Firefox on Android or

69
00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.708
other browsers will actually,
when you pass the criteria,

70
00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:20.613
they will render this banner at
the bottom, add this to the home screen.

71
00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:26.434
Or they would add a bar as the one
that we saw on desktop in the URL bar.

72
00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:29.646
They add a menu item that
says install these apps.

73
00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:34.821
Or it will let you add your own button.

74
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.284
But for that,
you need to pass the criteria.

75
00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:39.448
If you don't pass the criteria,

76
00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:43.235
maybe the user will be able to
install your app anyway, but

77
00:04:43.235 --> 00:04:48.363
the user will receive no hints that
the app decides it's installable, okay?

78
00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:49.250
Make sense?

79
00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:55.273
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: For example, on
Safari on iOS, the installability criteria

80
00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:59.934
means that you need to include metadata
with the app's name, icons, and

81
00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.808
we will see how to do that,
and the start URL.

82
00:05:02.808 --> 00:05:04.296
What's the start URL?

83
00:05:04.296 --> 00:05:06.893
We will get there, but
it's a property that we can define.

84
00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:10.559
And display mode,
we'll get into that later.

85
00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:16.605
On Safari on the Mac, actually, that's
the requirement, installability criteria.

86
00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:20.883
So nothing, there are no requirements.

87
00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:25.171
On Safari on iOS,
you can install any website as a web app.

88
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:28.177
Add to log, it will just work.

89
00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:32.489
For Chromium, that's Chrome,
Edge on Android and

90
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:37.585
also desktop, the web app
shouldn't be already installed.

91
00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:38.305
This is interesting.

92
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:42.645
Remember on iOS that we saw two icons for
Squoosh.

93
00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:47.458
On IOS,
Apple can let you have more than one.

94
00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:51.177
And each icon,
let me show you that back again.

95
00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.822
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: I
have two Squoosh here.

96
00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:00.326
I can add as many as I want.

97
00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.869
And something interesting happens,
not with Squoosh,

98
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:07.133
but with this other PWA
that someone told me, okay?

99
00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:12.900
So you can add to the home
screen two Tinders.

100
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.718
And if you remember Steve Jobs,
every app is a sandbox.

101
00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:21.356
So you can have two Tinder accounts,
one for work,

102
00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:25.509
because I think it has to do with work,
and one for person.

103
00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.976
So on iOS, but that's iOS only,
on iOS, each PWA that you install,

104
00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:34.575
each PWA that you install, it's a sandbox.

105
00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:36.663
It's isolated from Safari.

106
00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:41.176
It's isolated from other PWAs,
even if it's the same PWA.

107
00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:45.158
That's kind of an iOS unique thing.

108
00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:50.376
And Apple is actually saying that
this is a feature, not a bug, okay?

109
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.170
They say that for

110
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.532
that, you can separate your personal
life with your corporate life.

111
00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.608
It's interesting because they
don't have that on native.

112
00:06:57.608 --> 00:06:59.999
They have that on web apps.

113
00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:04.019
On Chrome, on the other hand, if it's
already installed, it's not going to be

114
00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:07.523
installed again, so you won't be
offered the installation, okay?

115
00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:11.937
So only one, and also the storage
is share between the browser and

116
00:07:11.937 --> 00:07:16.925
the singleton install app, the only
install app that you have is shared.

117
00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:20.960
So you cannot have two users, okay?

118
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.357
It should be on HTTPS.

119
00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:26.542
That's kind of default now these days.

120
00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.054
You should meet some basic
engagement heuristic.

121
00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:31.121
So what is this?

122
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.852
The idea is that if you're
opening a URL in the background,

123
00:07:34.852 --> 00:07:39.555
you're not actually seeing the PWA,
you're not touching or scrolling or

124
00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:42.406
doing nothing, you won't see any message.

125
00:07:42.406 --> 00:07:46.859
So it takes some seconds to
see if you're actually really

126
00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:49.931
interacting with the website, okay?

127
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:53.817
And you should include also the metadata
with the name, icons, the start URL and

128
00:07:53.817 --> 00:07:54.743
the display mode.

129
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:58.060
That is kind of the same as in Safari,
okay?

130
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.383
So that's the installability criteria.

131
00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:02.394
For Firefox, Android only,

132
00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:07.230
the web app shouldn't be already
installed on HTTPS and the metadata.

133
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.847
So it's actually pretty similar
to Chrome on Android only.

134
00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:18.222
Remember, Firefox only supports
PWAs on Android, okay, cool?

135
00:08:18.222 --> 00:08:18.777
On mobile,

136
00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:22.615
if you don't meet the basic criteria,
standalone installation won't happen.

137
00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:27.115
So if you try to install,
the maximum you can get is an icon,

138
00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:30.544
but pointing to the browser,
so a bookmark.

139
00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:34.452
On desktop, there are ways to install
them as web app, as we saw before,

140
00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:37.353
that I can install any website
these days as web apps.
