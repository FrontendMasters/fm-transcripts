00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; Steve: It worked, but clearly, and
now you could be smart enough, and

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.150
you could be like I'm gonna have one
request animation frame to rule them all.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.670
But like, in a lot of these cases, it's a
lot of times useful to use an abstraction.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.560
One I really like is one called Fast Dom,

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.770
like its whole job is to like figure
this stuff out and make it fast.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.370
And Fast Dom effectively,
there's a few methods, but

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.290
there's only two that you care about.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.165
Measure and mutate, right,
which are effectively read and then write.

9
00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:30.130
It's a pretty small library.

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.896
If you really wanted to,
you could write this library yourself.

11
00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:36.888
Basically you call measure bunch of times,
it takes all of those functions, right?

12
00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:45.401
And then requests one animation frame
where it plays back all of your mutates.

13
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.897
So you can measure a bunch of times,
then you can schedule all of your writes

14
00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:52.839
a bunch of times, and it will put together
one request animation frame that will then

15
00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.198
play through all the things
you want to do at once.

16
00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:58.715
Which will stop all of those little
yellow spikes you saw at the bottom of

17
00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.290
the flame graph.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.892
All right, so,

19
00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:05.990
I'm gonna give that one a shot.
&gt;&gt; Steve: Take it for a spin.

20
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.970
So here I'm just going
to say fastdom.measure.

21
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.060
No, actually I say that up top.

22
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.167
So we'll go ahead, give it an anonymous
function, and we'll measure.

23
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.471
&gt;&gt; Steve: And we'll go in here, and

24
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:41.685
we'll mutate.
&gt;&gt; Steve: Cool,

25
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:47.895
let's give it a shot.
&gt;&gt; Steve: All right,

26
00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:57.252
nice and smooth.
&gt;&gt; Steve: Let's

27
00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.165
take a look at what we have here.

28
00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:03.468
Stop that.
&gt;&gt; Steve: Right,

29
00:02:03.468 --> 00:02:06.710
you see we don't have all
those little spikes anymore.

30
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.080
Schedule the animation frame,
we're doing Fast Dom is making its call.

31
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.550
We do have to recalculate
a bunch of stuff.

32
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.610
Clearly, that's not free.

33
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.584
We have a lot of boxes on this screen.

34
00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:18.835
And we go ahead and we paint, right?

35
00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:21.045
But you can see that we're
not all of a sudden like,

36
00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:23.285
we don't have all those spikes
from all those animation frames.

37
00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:24.265
We've used the library.

38
00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:25.795
We've scheduled everything.

39
00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:27.945
We're good to go, right?

40
00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:31.775
So a lot of times using a tool will go a
long way to solve a lot of these problems.
