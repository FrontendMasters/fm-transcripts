&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So yeah,
it's a CSS property, but

2
00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:04.742
most of the time when you're using it,
you're gonna use it in JavaScript.

3
00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:09.601
You're gonna go in there and say, hey FYI,
I know the user is about to do something,

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.941
but we are going to want to animate this.

5
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:15.330
Let's get it to its own layer now and
be good to go.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.365
So, for instance we could say on
mouse enter element.style.willChange,

7
00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:24.702
transform will promote it to its
own layer, and then when they go,

8
00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:27.412
by the time we get it
ready to do the thing,

9
00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:31.067
then it's already on its own layer,
we're good to go.

10
00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:34.911
So, if it's like a sidebar or
the sticky bottom, use CSS.

11
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.328
But if it's something that's only going to
become its own layer temporarily as you do

12
00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:42.578
some animation and
then it's going back to a static position,

13
00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:46.533
we'll add the willChange, we'll do
the thing and then we'll put it back.

14
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.242
And again, after we're done we
wanna clean up after ourselves,

15
00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.369
because if they hover over it once and
mouse enters, make its own layer.

16
00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.412
And you forget to put it back down,
you're gonna end up with a lot of layers.

17
00:00:58.412 --> 00:00:59.956
We talked about that's a bad thing.

18
00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:06.168
So here's an example, okay,
mouse enter, all right?

19
00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.999
Yeah let's set the transform and

20
00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:14.368
then may be when the animation ends,
right, put it back down.

21
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:17.112
All right, we're done, it doesn't
need to be its own layer anymore,

22
00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:17.861
we're good to go.

23
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:19.100
All right, so we can do it then.

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.627
And then I arguably,
it would be really extra bonus points,

25
00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:26.856
you should have this as well, is like
on a mouse leave, also put it down.

26
00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:30.572
Mouseenters, this would be a box that
moves when they click on it, all right?

27
00:01:30.572 --> 00:01:33.858
Mouseenters, let's move it to
a zone layer, they clicked?

28
00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:34.905
Cool, do the animation.

29
00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:35.691
Animation's done?

30
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.527
Put it back down, the mouse's left?

31
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:39.584
Put it back down, right?

32
00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:43.005
And because we are not doing anything
else, when the mouseenters, yeah,

33
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.227
we are doing some work, but we are doing
that work before it is needed.

34
00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:50.003
We wait until we are ready to start
animating, it could look a little jolty,

35
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.781
cuz it's like my God I gotta
get this to its own layer.

36
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:55.901
And now I've gotta move it, right,
versus move it before you need it or

37
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.547
move it to it's own layer before you need
it, animate it when you're supposed to.

38
00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:00.720
Put it back down when you're done.
