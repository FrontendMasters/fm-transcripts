00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.118
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is Webpack comes
with this webpack-bundle-analyzer,

2
00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:08.180
which does effectively what
it says on the tin, right?

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.210
It analyzes your bundles.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.170
You're like, great, what does that mean?

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.380
Getting there.

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.385
So I'm gonna go ahead, and
I'm just going to flip this.

7
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:23.267
It's on, very cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So,

8
00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.920
what we'll do is we're gonna build for
production.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.740
Let's do a npm run build, and
what this will do is it'll build my file.

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.797
And it'll fire up the bundle analyzer,
and we can see the contents of my bundle.

11
00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:39.376
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give it a second.

12
00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:46.304
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is it.

13
00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:51.600
This is my bundle,
main.some checksum.bundle.js,

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.670
and it's really useful for
visualizing where all your code is.

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.130
Like what is taking up
most of that bundle?

16
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.690
So this is the code I wrote over here,

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.770
this tiny little sliver
in the source directory.

18
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.520
I have written, effectively,
after it's been gzipped, 2.26 kilobytes.

19
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.642
But I am shipping all of this code,
and I'm shipping all of lodash.

20
00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:24.164
I'm shipping codemirror,
which is clearly a large bundle.

21
00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:27.225
Makes it very obvious who the culprits
are when you get to see it like this.

22
00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:31.630
React-dom, I'm probably not
gonna get away from that one.

23
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.310
And a few other libraries, and
the user is getting all of this, right?

24
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.020
They're parsing all of it.

25
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.490
It's all going through the tubes, right?

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.230
I don't know if they need all of this,
like I can not send them some stuff.

27
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.260
Like if they need the code editor,
we'll send them the code editor.
