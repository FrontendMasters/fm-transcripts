&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I want
you to try to do is go back,

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.360
turns out that codepen from before
has fast downloaded globally.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.920
What I'd love you to try is for

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.820
the doubling of the bars,
to try to use fast dot.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.640
Go ahead and
we broke it out into two functions.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.560
We ran through the entire array
of those boxes slash bars.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.670
We measured them all, then we ran
through the array a second time and

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.770
mutated them all.

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.820
Could we use FASTON, which is basically
starting out with almost the original code

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.270
we had, wrap that in the measure,
and then for when we mutate it,

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.400
wrap that in faston.mutate and
let's see what the differences are.
