00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Question is,
can you stack multiple

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.580
cache control strategies in the header?

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.320
My gut says no.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.510
I also realize that I
have never attempted to.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.605
So I can't provide a really good answer,
but

6
00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.543
my initial gut says I don't think you can.

7
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:21.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone test it.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.431
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Someone test it,
keep recording.

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:35.050
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Any other questions?

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.620
Yeah.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe you don't know
off the top of your head, but

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.690
just curious, on either send grid or
a previous project.

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.150
Do you have a favorite sort of
performance accomplishment or

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.830
task you've made that comes to mind?

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think one
of the most important ones,

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.880
cuz it precedes all other ones,
is getting the metrics in the first place.

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.870
Like figuring out the state of the world
and being able to you know this,

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.070
figuring out these actions,
what are important action and

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.350
figuring out how long they take and
starting to set those.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.620
Either performance budget, right,
if you don't want it to get worse, or

21
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.760
performance goals.

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.410
That's a nontrivial task.

23
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.430
Trying to get those measurements,
cracking open the [INAUDIBLE] and

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.590
getting all those numbers.

25
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.170
It's the first step.

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.175
It's usually stuff that doesn't
exist in most applications.

27
00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:25.185
Patience, right?

28
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.295
Like nobody's done it,
thereby it's not a thing, right?

29
00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.655
Feels fine on my computer, [LAUGH] right?

30
00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.225
Is the biggest thing.

31
00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:35.045
So like going ahead and using like
the user timing API to like get some raw

32
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:39.125
numbers, I think is really
like the kind of like first.

33
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.105
Cuz after that you can get
the buy in around it, right?

34
00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:46.305
And like, Chrome has some interesting
features now, that work different.

35
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:51.230
Like they don't work super well on
my app because we have to log in,

36
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.070
stuff like that but they actually show
you your app versus your competitors.

37
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.570
That's usually helpful for getting buy in.

38
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.500
That's a relatively new one.

39
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.270
There's another one in
Chrome specifically,

40
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.340
will show you code coverage, right?

41
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.500
Which means it'll load up all your code,
you click around your app, and

42
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
it'll show you lines of code
that were never executed, right?

43
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.880
And so like starting to get those metrics,
starting to get like these,

44
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.860
if I have like,
let's make the app go faster!

45
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.900
It's like great, everyone's like yeah!

46
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.890
And then nothing happens, right?

47
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.940
Cuz like there's no like,
here's the first thing to do, right?

48
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.970
So I think that's the kind of
most important part, right?

49
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.180
Cuz like, once you kind of like build that
into the culture that everyone kind of

50
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.730
cares about, it becomes a lot
easier to get all this stuff done.

51
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.050
And it's almost impossible
to do before you build that.

52
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
So it's kind of maybe not
the answer you're looking for.

53
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.113
But if you're asking what's the one I'm
proudest of, like starting to implement

54
00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:44.508
those metrics and kind of getting
the culture of performance in place.

55
00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:45.814
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you, that's great.

56
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.595
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anything else?

57
00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:52.919
Cool, thank you so much, everyone.

58
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:59.539
[APPLAUSE]
