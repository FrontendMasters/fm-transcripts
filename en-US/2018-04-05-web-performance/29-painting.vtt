00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.780
&gt;&gt; Steve: All right,
we've laid out the page,

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.640
hopefully we're not
thrashing the DOM anymore.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.830
We need to actually get to the final two
pieces, which is both painting the layers,

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.420
and figuring out profiling of all of this,
and seeing if we have some problems here.

5
00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:20.532
&gt;&gt; Steve: So anytime you change
something other than opacity or

6
00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:25.150
a CSS transform,
you're gonna trigger a paint, right?

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.960
And that's kind of interesting, so

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.450
it seems like there are thing that can
change without having to redraw things.

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.420
Just let that one wash over you for
a second.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.500
I will explain it in a second, but
just struggle with it for a moment.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Of trying to think about how it is
that you can change the opacity or

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.840
move stuff around without
having to repaint it.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
That doesn't feel right, does it,
it's still true, I'm not lying to you, but

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.750
it's definitely somewhat counterintuitive.

15
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.930
All right, we do a paint,
we tell the browser,

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.216
the browser tells every element on
the page to draw a picture of itself.

17
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:59.955
[LAUGH] It's just kind of funny as I think
about it, draw a picture of yourself and

18
00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:00.870
hand it to me.

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.590
[LAUGH] And then it takes those and
it puts together the page.

20
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.680
Cool, it has all this information,

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.050
everything knows this geometry
cuz we've done the layout.

22
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.020
We know what all the styles are, it has
all the information it needs to do this.

23
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.965
And I said before, triggering
a layout will always trigger a paint,

24
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.340
because now there's
different pixels to paint.

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.400
Cool, but if you're just changing
colors like, hey, I'm just changing

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.790
the background color, you don't
necessarily need to trigger a layout.

27
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
So you can have,
every layout is gonna cause a paint, but

28
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.550
not every paint had a layout before it.

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.110
Right, if you're changing colors,
that's just repainting.

30
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.470
If you're changing sizes,
that's layout and painting.

31
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.278
So what we wanna do is figure out
if we're painting unnecessarily.

32
00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:44.496
Again, it's that rule,
paint as much as you need to and

33
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:45.970
as little as you can get away with it.

34
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.128
Luckily, Chrome has some really great
tools to see if we're painting, so

35
00:01:50.128 --> 00:01:52.156
let's go take a look at that.

36
00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:55.768
&gt;&gt; Steve: So
over in an example called Stuck On Top,

37
00:01:55.768 --> 00:02:02.090
I have the classic stuck header and
footer at the bottom, right?

38
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.879
And I can actually go ahead, and if you
don't rendering next to the console,

39
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.620
these three little dots
here are your buds.

40
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.880
Where you go to More Tools &gt; Rendering,
and then you should have it down here.

41
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.761
If not, either in the chat or here,
if anyone has a problem with that,

42
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.270
we'll handle it in the next break.

43
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.378
So we can turn on paint flashing, and

44
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.670
this highlights areas of the page when
they're being repainted in green.

45
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.641
And you can see as I scroll around
that I am repainting the header and

46
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.360
footer every time.

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.240
If you are doing that and
you don't see that, there is a reason.

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.319
We'll get into a little bit, but it turns
out that if you have a retina screen,

49
00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.970
that's not happening for you right now.

50
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.372
If you have a non-retina screen,
it is, right,

51
00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:51.870
that's why I'm in this
non-retina device mode.

52
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.790
We'll look at other examples that work
just as poorly on retina and non-retina,

53
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.070
but this is kind of a very
simple example to look at.

54
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.550
And I don't know, at my job,
everyone else except for

55
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.230
me has one of those 27-inch
thunderbolt displays.

56
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.200
So on a phone, retina's good to go,
we're in front of our laptops, but

57
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.890
a lot of times when we're plugged
into a monitor, it's not retina.

58
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.530
At least in my world, I have a 4k display,
so I don't know what's going on.

59
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.010
Cool, all right, so
we can see that we're repainting.

60
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.790
We don't wanna repaint
more than we need to.

61
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.460
And the question is,
what can we do about this?

62
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.313
&gt;&gt; Steve: So again, to kinda repeat
myself, we paint as much as we need to,

63
00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:34.640
but as little as we can get away with.

64
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.020
And I feel like I was painting more than
I needed to, to not show all that much.

65
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.170
So before we can solve this problem,

66
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.804
we're missing a conceptual
piece in what's going on.

67
00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:48.280
I said, hey, we lay everything out,
we calculate the styles,

68
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.900
do all that, tell everything to
paint itself, send it to the GPU.

69
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.709
Like, anytime someone says something like,
yeah, just send it to the GPU and

70
00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.110
they get really hand wavy,
you should treat them with suspicion.

71
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.923
And you should be treating me with
suspicion at this point because I didn't

72
00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:02.930
explain what that even means, right.
