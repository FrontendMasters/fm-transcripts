&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what we're gonna
do is a little experiment together.

2
00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:08.132
It turns out that Nolan Lawson,
who made this neat library, has a little

3
00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:13.749
application where you can kind of go ahead
and try it out in some different browsers.

4
00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.770
Different browsers with
different libraries.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.212
So what I want you to do is we're
gonna go to this website and

6
00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:21.126
we're gonna take it for a spin.

7
00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.460
You're gonna spend about
five minutes doing this.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.336
And what we're gonna do is
we're gonna open it up,

9
00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:27.225
we're going to try out
some different libraries.

10
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.380
But what I'd also like you to do is try
it in some different browsers, right?

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.410
And then we'll talk about what we
noticed in about five minutes.
