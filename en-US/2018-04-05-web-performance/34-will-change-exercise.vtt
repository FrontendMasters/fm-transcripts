00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is,
we're going to take a look real quick.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.820
I'll switch off this slide.

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.390
We'll look at the "Paint
Storming" example.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.870
We'll take a first look and we'll see
right now it causes a paint storm.

5
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.860
What we want to do is we
want to refractor it, so

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.420
that when the mouse enters it
moves up to it's own layer.

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.840
And then when it ends, we put it
back down or when the mouse leaves.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.300
So let's take a look at the code and

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.130
then I'll give you some time
to play around with this.

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.055
So let's actually look at
it in the browser first.

11
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.220
I don't need the special,
super special mode anymore.

12
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.983
We're going to paint storming, I've got
this red box, click on it, look at that

13
00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:46.500
little green array paint follow it,
let's refresh this, it's fun to watch.

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.130
We're going to paint, and
it's like a little paint storm,

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.260
it's just repainting every pixel.

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.679
All right, what is this?

17
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.170
So if we look at the code and
we look under

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.580
moving boxes, thought that was
the other one, paint storming.

19
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.470
Cool.
We look under paint storming.

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.210
Ignore that there is a solutions
directory, it is not important.

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.680
Pay no attention to
the solutions directory.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.200
We are going to use jQuery for
animation because 10 years ago, and

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840
that's what we're doing right now.

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.140
And you can see that that's
using JavaScript to adjust

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.560
the marginLeft, all right?

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.450
And it's not surprising that
that changes the inline style,

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.400
which triggers a repaint,
in this case, right?

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.640
And we're doing it on every frame, and
let's actually measure it for a second.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.021
Let's see what's going on here.

30
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.782
We'll refresh.

31
00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:44.381
I'm going to turn off the paint flashing

32
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.903
when you also try to collect
the performance metrics.

33
00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:51.510
Otherwise, things will be horrifyingly
bad because the browser is also trying to

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.870
paint all those green squares and
you'll get noise.

35
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.540
So you turn off the paint flashing.

36
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.072
Click it.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

37
00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:04.690
this is the process of getting
that box 500 pixels over, right?

38
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.340
And we can zoom in,
we can see that there's some JavaScript,

39
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.220
there is a recalculated style, there's
a layout, there's an update layer tray.

40
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.560
Composite some layers, and
we're doing this repeatedly.

41
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.040
So it would be great to not do this,
cuz this is work.

42
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.000
Not doing work is faster than doing work.

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.036
So we look at the code.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There

44
00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:33.592
is this move class, which seems to know
how to get it all the way over, and

45
00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:36.300
there does seem to be a transition.

46
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.228
So if we apply that move class
instead of doing it as a jQuery,

47
00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.510
we could just use CSS transitions, right?

48
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.120
Seems like maybe on click what we want
to say is add that move class and

49
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.450
it should move.

50
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.750
But then we're still making it's own
layer and moving at the same time so

51
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.370
we're probably going to need to write some
extra JavaScript to be able to move it.

52
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.690
So this is your turn to give it a shot,
then we'll do it together.

53
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.020
So I'm gonna put this slide up for

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.610
a second, but then I'm gonna go back to
that other code that we saw earlier, and

55
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.780
that'll be where I freeze it for
a little bit.

56
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.750
But your job is to get rid
of that jQuery animation,

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.050
use the CSS transition, but when the mouse
enters, when we wanna add will-change,

58
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.020
when they click,
we want to add this class.

59
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.560
And then when the mouse leaves, where the
transition ends, that will be when we put

60
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.970
it back on its own layer because we are
good citizens in the browser community.
