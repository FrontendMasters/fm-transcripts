00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're gonna take
a react out and we're gonna implement code

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.668
splitting and lazy loading
together as a group, as a team.

3
00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:11.680
And we'll kinda see this in action,
because it is one of those things.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.449
I'm kinda fascinated with it, because
I think it seems hard on the tin, so

5
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.898
everybody avoids it.

6
00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:23.031
We couldn't do that in our app and
the kind of point that I wanna like hit on

7
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:27.400
like there are parts of this
that you can do like tomorrow.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.330
In your application that will
have like dramatic impact

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.400
on the load time of your application.

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.391
So there is a repository linked
in the gist called noted and

11
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.187
we'll take it for a spin.

12
00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:52.646
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Everyone
has their default app.

13
00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:55.130
It's like a like joke that every
framework has a to-do list.

14
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.370
My thing is I make mark
down editors repeatedly.

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.360
Cool, so here we have an application.

16
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.442
You've got some notes over on the side
with my excellent design skills.

17
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.640
You can compliment me on those later.

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.258
We can click through like you can see hey,
here's the note in rendered mark down.

19
00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.150
We can go ahead and we can edit it, and

20
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.460
we get this nifty code editor like
where I can change some stuff.

21
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:26.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I change this in
the mark down preview and in the sidebar.

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.575
Very cool, I can close the given note and
go back to this initial page.

23
00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:37.267
That's the entire application.

24
00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:41.078
One thing we can take a look at,
let's do a performance audit here and

25
00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:42.007
I'll go ahead.

26
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.180
I'll do the start profiling and
reload the page,

27
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.139
which will just get you that initial
start time all the way through.

28
00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:55.055
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And it automatically
sounds when it thinks it is done.

29
00:01:55.055 --> 00:02:01.416
So we send this large
named.somegarbage.bundle.js,

30
00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:05.956
you can see that we
spend a decent amount of

31
00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:10.515
time parsing it more than anything else.

32
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:12.967
But like using the example
from sendgrid earlier,

33
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:16.070
I don't even know if they're
going to use the editor.

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.293
This application there's not a lot to do,
but

35
00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:21.317
like this is like a microcosm
version of a larger application.

36
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:26.319
We don't know what the user is going
to do, so it'd be great like if I only

37
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.653
send them that like code editor that was
over on the side there if they need it.

38
00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:33.717
To get them that initial page,
to get them interactive,

39
00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:35.010
they're not looking at a note yet.

40
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.835
I'm not doing any markdown over here yet.

41
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:41.510
This is just like the raw string of text
like I can get them to the point where

42
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.450
they're interacting with the page before,
they don't need that thing yet.

43
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.158
Like when they need the mark down
component, we'll send it to them.

44
00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:50.020
When they need the editor,
we'll send it to them.

45
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.618
But why make them pay that cost upfront?

46
00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:55.457
Like in a larger application,
they might never need it.

47
00:02:55.457 --> 00:02:57.240
They might go to some other
part of the application.
