00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;&gt; Steve: We're gonna play with this for
a little bit.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.480
We're gonna take a look at this example.

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.480
&gt;&gt; Steve: We'll go to the page, very cool.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.250
This is a really silly example
that takes a bunch of divs, and

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.670
you can hit this double-sized button,
and you know what's gonna happen?

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.791
They're all going to double in size.

7
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.170
Whoa, crazy, right?

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.760
I'm a data visualist, all right, [LAUGH].

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.420
It's very cool, I'm doing data vis now.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
And they all double in size.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.970
What I want you to do is fire
up your Chrome Tools, and

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.786
go ahead and hit this Performance button
here, the Performance tab up here.

13
00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:45.830
And see this little record button?

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.820
You're gonna hit that,
and it's gonna record and

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.050
you're gonna double the size of the bars.

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.140
One time, two times, three times.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.190
And then, we're gonna look at what we
got from the tools right after that.

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.568
So let me give you about
three minutes to do that and

19
00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:09.090
then we'll kind of look at it together,
and you kind of explore it first.
