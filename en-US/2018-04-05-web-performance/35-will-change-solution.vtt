00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.592
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
our job is to clean up this paint storm.

2
00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:08.024
So we kinda talked a little bit about
the approach before I cut you all loose to

3
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:08.734
give it a shot.

4
00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.915
Which is, we have a CSS class,
we have a transition,

5
00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.830
we have all the basic moving pieces,
right?

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.330
The easiest thing we can do is get rid of
some of this jQuery and we'll go ahead and

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.800
we'll get our hands on the box.

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.374
I mean, I could do this part in jQuery,
I'm choosing not to,

9
00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.900
it's fine.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.890
we'll grab the class of box.

11
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.488
And step one that we do
here is we could just say

12
00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:42.989
box.addEventListener('click').
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

13
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.215
we can say box.classList,

14
00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:51.214
I'll go with a toggle.

15
00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:53.730
I think, or Google, or
goggle in that case.

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.528
Yeah, are you not all familiar with

17
00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:57.454
the goggle method?

18
00:00:57.454 --> 00:00:58.871
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay.

19
00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.870
[LAUGH] We'll toggle the move class.

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.380
Right, and we won't get our own layer and
everything like that, but

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.040
it's a good start.

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.562
We will eventually get our own layer,
it's just gonna happen at the same time.

23
00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:14.540
Let's go take a look.

24
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.792
I'm gonna do the paint flashing in
this case, so you can see It flashes.

25
00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:25.179
It moves without having that
trail of green behind it, and

26
00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.423
then it goes back down again.

27
00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:31.379
You can see the paint
flash VCR is actively

28
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.460
getting moved to it's own layer, right?

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.320
It's going up to it's own layer, then
it's moving, then it's going back down,

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.870
cuz the transition is no longer there.

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.450
But it would be great if I didn't
have to do that simultaneously.

32
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.707
Let's also just do a recording real quick.

33
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.021
Let's see what we've got going on here,
I'm gonna turn off the paint flashing.

34
00:01:58.746 --> 00:01:59.915
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and you can see,

35
00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:01.260
we've got the click event.

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.090
That's not right.

37
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.926
Fun fact that actually
didn't bite me until now is,

38
00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.676
a lot of times you're better off if
you have clean profile in Chrome.

39
00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:12.419
Or you do it in an incognito window,

40
00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.021
because sometimes you will get some of
your Chrome extension that are also

41
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:20.371
interjecting themselves.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so

42
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:25.285
we have the event listener.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

43
00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.356
it kind of moves across.

44
00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:30.927
But the one thing I want you to notice
first, is remember when I showed you all

45
00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:34.865
of those intermediate frames in
there when we did the jQuery one?

46
00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:37.450
They're gone, right,
cuz yeah, we added a class.

47
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.284
The compositor thread is all about moving,
we're basically sliding that layer along,

48
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:44.291
and then pushing it back down again.

49
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.961
But we don't actually need to manually
move it on the main thread anymore.

50
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:52.315
So we have nothing happening in here,
which is super cool.

51
00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:55.353
We could get a little bit better,
like for more complicated animations or

52
00:02:55.353 --> 00:02:56.872
when there is a lot going on the page,

53
00:02:56.872 --> 00:03:00.400
you could stutter as you're like I have to
repaint to get it up to it's own layer.

54
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.028
Right, that's gonna block everything,

55
00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:04.400
it's gonna block other things
going on on that thread.

56
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.000
So we can say, hey, when you're not busy,

57
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.340
if you could move that up to its
own thread, that'd be great.

58
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.924
So let's go ahead and

59
00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:11.577
we'll implement that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

60
00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:15.118
we've got the click listener,
we're gonna add a few more events.

61
00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:22.480
We'll say
box.addEventListener('mouseenter').

62
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.630
I think somebody asked earlier,
the difference between mouseenter and

63
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.020
mousemove.

64
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.160
Mousemove is effectively every
time you're hovering over it,

65
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.990
mouseenter is like when the mouse
enters the bounds of that element.

66
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.390
RIght, and leave will be when it leaves.

67
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.760
Cuz we don't wanna do this all the time,
we just wanna do it the first time it

68
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.999
enters, and the first time wanna to do
something different when it leaves.

69
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.343
Cool, and so we'll say
box.style.willChange = 'transform'.

70
00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:52.609
And we're gonna be good citizens here, and
we're gonna say when the mouse leaves.

71
00:03:57.928 --> 00:03:58.793
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: mouseleave.

72
00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:04.773
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll set it back to

73
00:04:04.773 --> 00:04:07.550
auto in this case, auto is the default.

74
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.630
You could also set it to an empty string.

75
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.540
We'll probably do that maybe later,
but I'm just going to set it to auto.

76
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.850
Cool, and then when the transition ends,
that's also a good time to put it down.

77
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.520
So you could say,
box.addEventListener('transitionend').

78
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.900
It's really cool that
the CSS transitions and

79
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.910
animations will trigger JavaScript events.

80
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.742
So you know when that transition or

81
00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:36.028
that animation has completed.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Excuse

82
00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:40.803
me as I learn how to type.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool, and

83
00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:41.847
we'll do the same thing.

84
00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:51.664
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And this time,

85
00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:54.178
I'm gonna turn back on paint flashing.

86
00:04:54.178 --> 00:04:57.080
Can you see hovering over it
moved it to its own layer.

87
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.570
When my mouse entered and left, it moved.

88
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.320
When I click,
it's just pure GPU animation there.

89
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.670
That final one was we put
on the transition and

90
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.490
that we wanted to be put back down again.

91
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.290
But there's really nothing that
happens on the main thread

92
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.810
as we're doing the animation.

93
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.122
Right, which means no other layouts or
style recalculations or JavaScript or

94
00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:21.964
anything else going on is going to
stop that buttery smooth animation.

95
00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:24.185
Cool, let's actually look
at that in the layers.

96
00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:27.482
And if you don't have
the layers tab up here, again,

97
00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:31.951
you can just go to these three dots,
go to More Tools and find Layers, and

98
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:35.929
then it will be there.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

99
00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:39.361
then I like to give myself just
a little bit of rotation there,

100
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:44.256
treat myself to that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go ahead you can see,

101
00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:47.600
it's up on its own layer,
and it's back down.

102
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.710
It's up, it's down, it's up, it's down,
I could literally do that all day,

103
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.660
I will respect your time and not.

104
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.899
[LAUGH] But I will never cease
to be amused and amazed by that.

105
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.110
All right, cool, so we did it.

106
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.034
Very useful for one thing are about to,

107
00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.870
the browser will handle what deserves
its own layer and what doesn't.

108
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.125
But you're allowed to give it
recommendations on listen,

109
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:11.758
I wrote the JavaScript here.

110
00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:15.610
I know what's about to happen here,
why don't you get ready for it?

111
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.540
And you can actually
save a lot in that case.

112
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.000
And yeah,
cuz if you're animations are janky,

113
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.260
why even have them?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can I ask

114
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.440
a question?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Of course.

115
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you have a really heavy

116
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.200
element page,
would it be easier to just, on enter

117
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.120
transform that element, or one of the
elements, to it's layer, leave it there?

118
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.707
Instead of having to go on and
off all the time [CROSSTALK] just

119
00:06:39.707 --> 00:06:41.595
kind of drag your mouse around.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If it's

120
00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:45.190
gonna be a permanent thing like,
yeah, right, doing stuff.

121
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.200
But if you think about
most things if it is like,

122
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.880
let's say you're swiping things away.

123
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.015
Let's say it's like a Trello, right,
or something along those lines.

124
00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:56.980
Yeah, you can promote it,
but you could move it again.

125
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.560
But as the user continues to use that app,
and you're making more and more and

126
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.940
more layers, you run the cost.

127
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.746
The main thread and the compositor
thread effectively share memory space,

128
00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:09.857
which you can run out of, right?

129
00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:12.217
So stuff like a sidebar,
the general rule should be,

130
00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:15.650
put everything back when you're done
unless you have a really good reason.

131
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.840
So a sidebar that they're gonna interact
with all the time, or a menu, or

132
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.170
something along those lines
might be an exception, maybe.

133
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.221
But it should be used like
incredibly judiciously.

134
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.884
Because yeah, if it gets out of control
and the user spends a lot of time on

135
00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.343
the page, eventually you're gonna
create more and more layers.

136
00:07:32.343 --> 00:07:34.080
It's gonna become increasingly problematic
