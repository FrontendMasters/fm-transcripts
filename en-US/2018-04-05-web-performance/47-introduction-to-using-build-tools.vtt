&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So one kind of final
topic is we've been kind of dancing around

2
00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.940
this idea of using your
build tools to help you.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.930
And our build tools have a lot
of good things and bad things.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.180
The best part is that they're automated.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.990
Going through, we saw Optimizely which can
use the heuristics to try to maybe speed

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.340
up your code.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.700
We even saw Babble low dash has
the ability to go in there and

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.990
do the code shaking,

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.020
the tree shaking to not bring in parts
of low dash that you don't need right?

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.740
We've seen that tools can do a lot of
these things, and a lot of times if you

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.840
can automate something, you're gonna do it
better than if you try to do it by hand.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
Convince your entire team to do it
by hand and never mess up, right?

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.850
So there's a lot of great tools for that.

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.420
This one's called Purify CSS and it's
really great cuz what it does is it looks

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.850
like your CSS file and it strips out all
the CSS that you're not actually using.

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.070
We talked about that in the render
ed performance section.

17
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.870
Hey, if you have less CSS,
you can do the selector matching faster.

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.490
You can go through and
fine-tune it by hand, right?

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.480
That's an option.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.150
And you'll probably do a better
job than this tool would, but

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.630
also the risk of messing it up,
the fact that you actually have to do it,

22
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.390
the fact you have to keep it up to date,
right?

23
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.890
There are tools that can kinda help us.
