00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.849
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Guess who's
turn it is now, it's yours.

2
00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:09.681
So we know the NoteView,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: NoteView is

3
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.150
using this Markdown component.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.696
We know that the Markdown component
right now is taking up 28 kilobytes.

5
00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.125
I've got some news for you about character
entities, they're together [LAUGH] right?

6
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.270
Which is another 25, so
that's another initial 10%, right?

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.550
Or it's currently at this point
20% of our resulting bundle

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.300
that we don't need immediately.

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.518
So it would be great if we
could use the same technique,

10
00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.361
create a loadable NoteView.

11
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:44.095
Then go to the NoteView container and swap
out NoteView for the loadable NoteView.

12
00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:47.070
And then we'll come back together and
we'll be able to reanalyze it.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.693
I'm gonna make a branch on
this called live coding.

14
00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.910
I'm gonna push out what I have
right now so you can pull it down.

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.991
If you didn't like yarn install or mpm
install, you can have those dependencies.

16
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.654
You can take it for a spin and
see how it goes, and

17
00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:02.460
then we'll do it together
in about 20 minutes.
