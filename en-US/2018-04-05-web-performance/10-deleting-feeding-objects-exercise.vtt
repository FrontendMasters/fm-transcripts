00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.970
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I want you to
do is I'll actually freeze this code.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.670
And what I want you to do is I want you
we're moving from the second dimension to

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.100
the third dimension.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.402
When you make a third argument,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

5
00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:23.166
we'll go ahead, we'll run some tests,
we'll set each one of those,

6
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:27.960
we'll set .x to undefined, run it, .y to
undefined run it, .z to undefined, run it.

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.390
Then we'll delete x, delete y, delete z,
so we're gonna run six different tests,,

8
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.330
and we're gonna look at when
we see that big jump off,

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.230
where it goes from 500
milliseconds to a full second.

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.770
See if we can determine what
are the cases where our

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.350
code performs basically half as fast
as it did in the other ones and

12
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.580
see if we can make any kind of assumptions
or generalizations about that.

13
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.241
So let's take five
minutes to try that out.

14
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.575
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You need to
explicitly pass value for Z?

15
00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.391
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes.

16
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:07.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the test?

17
00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You would also
pass in some value in here as well.
