00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I would be
remiss if I didn't talk a little

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.050
bit about Service Worker.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.310
This is a workshop on performance.

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.770
I'm not gonna go too deep into Service
Worker because we've covered a lot today

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.080
and Mike North and

6
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.140
I did a two day workshop on Service Worker
that I totally recommend you check out.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.558
So I'll kinda do like the high level
of what a Service Worker is and

8
00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:22.121
if you're like that is cool.

9
00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:26.931
Guess what there's ten hours of content
you can watch exclusively on service

10
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.779
worker, and I will not do nearly
as much justice to it now, but

11
00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.600
I totally recommend that
you check that out.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.075
It's called was it progressive web apps
in react was the name of the course.

13
00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:39.640
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, progressive web

15
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.230
apps is kinda of the umbrella term that
Service Worker is a really cool part of,

16
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.280
that's effectively like,
imagine you can build apps that have

17
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
native apps' superpowers,
but in your browser.

18
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.940
It's effectively one of the coolest
set of web technologies today,

19
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.640
that I think is gonna
change a lot of things,

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.859
especially now that Safari
supports it in the new betas.

21
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500
So, effectively when we ask for a webpage,

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.970
we kinda just talked about this, browser
goes to network, get me the webpage.

23
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.690
When you have a service worker,

24
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.990
effectively it installs itself
into the browser like an app.

25
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.990
Instead of asking the internet for
things, you ask the service worker.

26
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.810
Which can be like I
actually with Java Script,

27
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.570
purposefully put a bunch of files away
In the cache and can get them fo you.

28
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.080
And you can write a whole bunch of logic.

29
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.570
With the headers that we talked
about earlier like you set them,

30
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.150
if they are kind of like those
suggestions to the browser.

31
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.895
You set them in the header and
you hope the browser respect some.

32
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.805
With service worker you can write
JavaScript you can be like, I want to put

33
00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:41.185
you in the cache, I want to check this
before I pull something out of the cache,

34
00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.715
and you can do a whole bunch
of really interesting things.

35
00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:47.415
And so because you have that control you
can have applications that work offline.

36
00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.245
Because by definition,

37
00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:53.375
if it can work offline it means that
you can control the network pretty well

38
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:57.570
to get incredibly fast load times
even when you are online, right?

39
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.350
Versus, like, setting that response
header where it's like hey,

40
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.650
maybe don't check, you're in control,
I don't know that's going on.

41
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.800
So we have some stuff in cache,
some stuff on the network.

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.512
Every time a network request is made
it goes to service work, it's like hey,

43
00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:15.188
talk to the cache, right?

44
00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:19.040
Or talk to the cache, if it's not
in the cache talk to the network.

45
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.160
Or you can really do cool stuff,
like talk to the network and

46
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.830
get the fresh version, and
then put it in the cache.

47
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.280
And if they're offline,
go to the cache and get it, right?

48
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.990
It gives you a lot of programmatic
control over what you do with a network.

49
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.280
And if you can theoretically, one pattern
that I'm investigating right now is for

50
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.410
deploying with those files that
have the unique identifiers.

51
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.630
It means whenever I deploy
a new version of the app,

52
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.380
I'm destroying all the caches and everyone
has to download everything again, right.

53
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.650
Like, great,
I've shipped customer value and features.

54
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.290
Bad, I am wiping out the cache repeatedly,
right?

55
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.779
Which means If they had all these
false cash, I deploy a new version,

56
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.621
they have to pay the cost of
getting them again, right.

57
00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:05.032
That's a fact of life,
there is no real way about that.

58
00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:09.068
But what you could do with the service
worker in this case is have the service

59
00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:12.610
worker, give them the old version
the very next time they visit.

60
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.880
Show me old version, in the background,
well, they're not paying attention.

61
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720
Download the new version,
replace the cached one, and

62
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.570
next time they still get instantaneous
load times no matter what.

63
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.784
There's a bunch of really cool stuff
that you can do with service worker

64
00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:30.194
In the nature of time and the fact
there are ten hours of content on this.

65
00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:33.454
I going to punt on that one for
a little bit.

66
00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:37.324
It's in here because I'm also like
super excited progressive web app and

67
00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:38.604
service work, and
I think it's really cool.
