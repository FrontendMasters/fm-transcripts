[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cool, so what that looks
like is connect to the database.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.230
I'm just connecting to,
connecting to todos.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.290
I was going to change it because the name.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.900
That's the name of
the collection as well so

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.420
I'll change it to something
else like puppies.

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.810
So we run this file.

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.416
And let me try to clean this stuff up.

9
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:28.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right, you'll say boom.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.680
You'll be like all right,
this is what I created.

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.476
And then what we can do
is go over to our shell.

12
00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:38.536
I'm just gonna say use the name.

13
00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then now what happens is
if you didn't hear me when I told you what

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.203
collection it was, the way you would
figure that out is if you were in this

15
00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:54.070
file and we had this mongoose.model,
it takes two arguments.

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.290
It was actually just a getter and
a setter.

17
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.410
So if you pass in a second argument it's
assuming that you want to create a model.

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.849
If you exclude the second argument

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
It's assuming you are trying
to reference a model.

20
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.610
So it's a getter and a setter.

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.460
So we're doing the setter.

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780
We're creating a model, and that way that
works is the first argument is the name

23
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.220
of the collection you want to make.

24
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.460
It doesn't matter what name I put here,
Mongoose is gonna lower case it and

25
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.050
pluralize it.

26
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.570
So if I put in,
I want to create a TODO model, or

27
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.040
a TODO collection,
it's actually gonna a create a todos.

28
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.860
It's gonna lower case and pluralize it,
so I just put it in there like that.

29
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.940
And then the second argument is the
schema, which is the one we made up here.

30
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.600
So we're going to talk about schema and
this stuff on the next step, so

31
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.540
if you don't know what this stuff
means don't worry about it.

32
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.720
We're going to talk about it,
that's why I didn't ask you to write it.

33
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.010
But that's how you know
what collection it is.

34
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.080
Because that's the name of it right here.

35
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.700
And then we're creating one,
and then we're logging it.

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.210
So that means if we come back over here,
and we say we switched our database.

37
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.470
We say db dot and
you can just say show collections too.

38
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.180
It will show you the collections.

39
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.657
There's todos right there, db.the name
of the collection, which is todos.find.

40
00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:15.105
That will give you all of them.

41
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:17.959
Should be two or three in here by now,
as I restarted it.

42
00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.656
It's just one actually, so just one.

43
00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.456
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There it is.

44
00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:32.035
And if you're using RoboMongo,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You can come in here,

45
00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:36.235
go to your database, your collections,

46
00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:41.256
your,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And it's right there.

47
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Sweet.

48
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.500
So a little more on that conversion here.

49
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.892
Even if we had something that
ended in a y, it will IES it.

50
00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:06.696
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

51
00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:09.774
[INAUDIBLE] so we have-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Puppy?

52
00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:11.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, puppy.

53
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That will
turn it into puppies.

54
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.280
It's trippy, right?

55
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.490
Yeah, so, remember that.

56
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.730
To avoid that,
I just try to avoid things with y, but

57
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.780
we have a thing called category
that has a y in it, so yay.

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.250
But, we won't really be messing
around with a lower level name

59
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.600
with the collections in the driver,
anyway.

60
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.530
So, it's kind of irrelevant,
but, just to let you know.
