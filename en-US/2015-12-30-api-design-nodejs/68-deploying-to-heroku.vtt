00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.628
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.495
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Like I said,
I'm just gonna go through deployment,

3
00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.290
I think it's better.

4
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.960
Like I wasn't gonna just have notes and
be like this is how you deploy, and

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.840
this is it.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.850
But it's so much better,
if we just walk through it.

7
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.830
Especially, if you want to follow along on
your computer or just watch me go through

8
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.320
it and watch me stumble through all
the nuances that everybody goes through.

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.550
Because that's just what happens, so
let's do it, let's just go to Hiroku.

10
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.450
And especially if you've never deployed on
Hiroku before, I think this will be great

11
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.290
to see somebody who thinks they know
what they're doing, how to do it.

12
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.400
So, that'll be really cool.

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.860
So let me see, what was, don't be
trying to count my password length.

14
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.110
I see y'all over there.

15
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.730
[LAUGH] So, let's just make a new one.

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.350
We'll make a new app, and
we'll call it ngblog api.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.400
Only lower case?

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.900
Okay.

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.220
We'll use this convention then,
there we go, create app.

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.490
And Heroku actually kind of upgraded, now
that they've like integrated with GitHub,

21
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.190
so you don't have to do anything anymore.

22
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.926
Before you had to like do some stuff,
but now it's just like [SOUND],

23
00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.910
just attach it to GitHub,
push it, it's good.

24
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.373
Which is like, everybody else does, so
I don't know why it took them forever but,

25
00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:19.130
they got it, they got it.

26
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.929
So now you just like, first thing
you need to make sure you have this

27
00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.650
Heroku tool belt.

28
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.370
So I need to do that, I know I have it but
I just need to make sure I'm logged in.

29
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.480
So I'm just gonna say Horoku.

30
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.362
What was it?
Login.

31
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.684
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There you go.

32
00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:48.712
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay cool, so

33
00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:54.345
now we're logged in
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, stop doing that.

34
00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:59.595
Here we go and then need to add the remote

35
00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:05.795
URL for Heroku.

36
00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.885
Our version of git is so out of date.

37
00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:14.355
I thought I updated that, guess not.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I

38
00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:15.750
went into Heroku's office
a couple weeks ago.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.750
They have a really nice office.

40
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.410
I don't know if anyone's ever been there?

41
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.470
It's like ridiculous.

42
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.610
It's like bamboo everywhere.

43
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.240
Everything's bamboo.

44
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.340
It's really nice.

45
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.010
They have this nice rooftop
room where they party at.

46
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.510
It's really nice.

47
00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:33.760
All right, so now we've got that, and we
can verify it if we type in get remote/v

48
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.420
well see that look there's a remote url
by the name of Heroku, and it's our api.

49
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.980
So we got that, tada, and
let's just go ahead and

50
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.170
make sure I added commit it here,
get diff.

51
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.780
That's not important, let's just stash it.

52
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.360
Great.
So, we have a clean thing here, and

53
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.450
all I have to do is just
say git push heroku master.

54
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.020
Now who thinks here, if I push this
heroku, is this gonna work the first time?

55
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.930
Right?
It's just gonna work the first time.

56
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.080
Right?
I know it's gonna fail, but

57
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.684
I want us to see the error,
so let's just do it.

58
00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:15.139
What is it, push it, push it?

59
00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.728
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So,

60
00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:23.810
let's just push it.

61
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.210
I just want you to see the logs.

62
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.320
It's like, Node.js app detected, great.

63
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.770
Here, and then it injected these
environment variables into our app.

64
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.200
And then it's like, okay.

65
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.660
He didn't tell me what engine you were
running, so I just figured it out.

66
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.800
I'm restoring any cache that
was there from last deployment.

67
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.400
The npm installed some stuff, and
now it's attempting to launch the app.

68
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.940
And it said it did it,
it did it, it totally did it.

69
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.952
So, now if we go to Heroku Open.

70
00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.116
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Application error,

71
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:02.970
looks like it crashed.

72
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.777
So, what we can do is we
can say Heroku logs//,

73
00:04:08.777 --> 00:04:11.620
or we'll just do logs.

74
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.300
Let's see what happened.

75
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.650
So, it went in here.

76
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.210
It ran node server.js.

77
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.050
We'll that's not the command
I wanted it to do.

78
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.560
That's probably why it crashed.

79
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.480
It should be index.js.

80
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.235
So, It broke right there.

81
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:28.500
Why did it do that?

82
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.508
Why did it run server.js?

83
00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:36.013
That's because
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I

84
00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:38.120
don't know why it did that to be honest.

85
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.620
[LAUGH] I would have thought
it would have ran this,

86
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.570
because it's supposed to run
npm start but, I guess not.

87
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.940
But yeah I don't know why it did that.

88
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.630
So what we need to do is we need to
make a new file on here, on the root.

89
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.950
And we'll call it proc, P-R-O-C, file.

90
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.790
This is something Heroku wants.

91
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.570
And what we can do in here,
we can say web, and then give it

92
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.860
the command that we wanna run, index.js,
I think that's the format that it wants.

93
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.240
I don't know,
I think that's the format that it wants.

94
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.230
I might have to look at it.

95
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.942
Let's look at it.

96
00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:17.495
See, procfile.node.js, Heroku.

97
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.600
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes.
What's the Procfile, guy?

98
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.910
Yeah.
That was it.

99
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.730
Yeah, so.

100
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.999
Cool.
It, it says it defaults to nodeserver.js,

101
00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.360
if nodescripts.start entry is
present in the server, yeah.

102
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.930
It's cool.
Okay.

103
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.010
So, I'll just say node index.js instead.

104
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.540
That's step one.

105
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.000
Got that out of the way.

106
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.550
Another thing I was freaking out
about if people look at the output.

107
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.570
It'll send something about,
couldn't find an appropriate engine or

108
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.180
something like that.

109
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.950
Where did it say that?

110
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.590
Did I pass it?

111
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.228
Wait, hold on.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Here we go.

112
00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:11.580
Engines.node unspecified,
engines.mpm unspecified.

113
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.320
So, you can tell it which version
of node you want to this to run in.

114
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.295
By default, it uses the most recent, which
is 12, so we don't have to put anything,

115
00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:20.880
nut what that means is come in here and
say engines.

116
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.560
And you can say, node.

117
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.840
And then you can put what version
of node you want it to run, but

118
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.970
I'm not because this is going
to run the latest, so I'm fine.

119
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.750
So, we got that.

120
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.190
Okay, so now, if I deploy this,
is it going to work now?

121
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.240
Everybody think so?

122
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.020
I didn't see any other errors.

123
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.059
Let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so the status,

124
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:50.936
git add --all, -am'chore', okay.

125
00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:58.526
And then let's do get push heroku master.

126
00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:02.275
Everything up to-date.

127
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.380
I know why, I know why.

128
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.530
Heroku pushes the master
branch be default.

129
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.320
We're on step 12 fix.

130
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.680
That's why.

131
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.690
That's why it's freaking out.

132
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.130
It's deploying the master branch.

133
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.820
Doesn't matter what branch we're on here,
it'll deploy the master branch,

134
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.450
which is really weird.

135
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.830
So we need to git check out master,

136
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.110
and then git rebase step, or

137
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:38.613
git rebase origin/step-12-fix.

138
00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:42.082
Okay, I think that's good,
let's check it out.

139
00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:47.219
Is that the right thing?

140
00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:52.665
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Or no, hold on.

141
00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:54.812
Let's see.

142
00:07:54.812 --> 00:08:00.241
I need to push this up step-12-fix.

143
00:08:09.547 --> 00:08:10.503
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right.

144
00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:15.177
And let's check out the master.

145
00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:24.070
Pull.

146
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.120
Come on.

147
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.620
There we go.

148
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.741
You know exactly what I want,
I don't know why you're tripping.

149
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:35.910
Let's just do a rebase.

150
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.820
Okay, I think we're good now.

151
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.560
Yay, we're good.

152
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.810
Okay, it even gave it
a little heroic logo.

153
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.510
That's dope.
All right.

154
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.140
So, now if we push at Heroku,
let's see what happens.

155
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.760
And I knew that I needed a master reg,
because it said everything was up to date.

156
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.200
I knew everything wasn't up to date,

157
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.790
because we just made
a whole bunch of changes,

158
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.940
that's how I knew it was on a branch that
there was some weird stuff going on.

159
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.250
I remember, I ran into that error or
that problem like 30 times.

160
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.230
I did,
it only does the master branch my default.

161
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.800
Watch this thing break on the,
on the decrypt.

162
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.490
Watch.

163
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.190
Watch it break.

164
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.170
Then we'll just be in the same
problem you were on Heroku.

165
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.977
Then we'll just give up.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Where you blame

166
00:09:18.977 --> 00:09:23.817
Windows again.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't know,

167
00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:25.230
I don't know if it's gonna do it,
let's see.

168
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.750
It better,
this things like on a Linux Box somewhere.

169
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:36.130
We'll let that build.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Somebody's asking

170
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.480
if you use git-flow?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, git-flow is awesome.

171
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.140
For some reason,
I don't have it in this environment.

172
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.710
I messed up my Git.

173
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.695
I deleted it and
put some other thing there.

174
00:09:46.695 --> 00:09:48.050
Git-flow is great.

175
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.350
I like git-flow.

176
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.120
But then again,
I'm not that good at Git either, so,

177
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.380
I don't know I might just
start using GUIs now.

178
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.640
I have like a few,
I think I have like tower, do I?

179
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.530
Or no?

180
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.200
Is it called tower?

181
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.760
I don't know.

182
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.080
The Git help one is okay.

183
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.220
But yeah, there's better ones out there.

184
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.500
Alright, looks like everything's
working so far verifying deploy.

185
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.400
It deployed it, now it's trying to
check it to make sure it did it.

186
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.730
All right, looks like it did something.

187
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.038
So before we go look at it let's
go look at our dashboard here.

188
00:10:26.038 --> 00:10:30.870
Just refresh.

189
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:37.550
And let's go to activity, yeah looks
like this guy's been deploying stuff.

190
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.690
Looks like me [LAUGH]
He's been doing some work in there,

191
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.308
obviously he's earned this keep.

192
00:10:46.308 --> 00:10:49.170
So, let's check it out.

193
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:56.730
So, let's say heroku open,
again, that's gonna open us up.

194
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:02.580
Another application error, so you can
say Heroku Logs, and let's see why.

195
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:10.440
Let's see what happened.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Started

196
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.160
process with command npm start.

197
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.000
So, it freaked out on npm start.

198
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.840
Why did it run npm start when I
told it to do something else?

199
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.090
Not sure why it ran NPM start,
but that's an easy fix.

200
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.060
Just come here and be like yo, just do
node man, that's all I want you to do,

201
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.340
don't do nothing else.

202
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.860
So that'll fix that.

203
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.923
Another quick thing we can do is
instead of having to deploy every time,

204
00:11:35.923 --> 00:11:39.100
we have this other thing that we
get from Heroku called Forman,

205
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.100
which is a local, It's like how your
output runner heroku if it was on heroku.

206
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.980
And we can just say form in start, and
that's gonna start our app on port 5000,

207
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.360
and it's gonna run it
like heroku would run it.

208
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.830
So, if you go look on port 5,000,

209
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.610
can I get of course,
because we didn't have a request for that.

210
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:11.122
But, if I say what about api/users,
can I get some of that?

211
00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:12.054
Yeah, you can get that.

212
00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:15.971
So our API's working, that's great.
