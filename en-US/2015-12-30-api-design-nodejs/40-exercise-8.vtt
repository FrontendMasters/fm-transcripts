00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:05.833
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There's a lot of
fun stuff going in step eight.

3
00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.896
So we got rid of the db tester file
because that was just a one off file

4
00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:11.440
that we were using to test the database.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.670
And now, if you go to step eight and

6
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.140
you look in the api folder on each
resource there's a respective model file.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.790
And we have to go ahead and
design these schemas.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.250
Everything else is set up for
you as far as the exports.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.490
All you have to do is just fill out
the actual schemas, the blueprint for

10
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.200
these models.

11
00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:43.273
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right.

12
00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:44.111
So any questions there?

13
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:44.987
That's all we have to do.

14
00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:49.806
So, as far as what they look like,
again, the blueprint is in the JSON

15
00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:54.629
right here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

16
00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.725
you can infer what types they are, as far
as how to use the types, here's an example

17
00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:03.315
of here how to use the different types.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

18
00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:05.450
that's what we gotta do for
those models, so.
