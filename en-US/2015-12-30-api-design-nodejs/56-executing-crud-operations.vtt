00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.096
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:07.371
All right so if we did all this,
we should, now that we have our models,

3
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.991
we have our controllers,
we have our routes plugged up,

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:13.020
we should be able to start this and
start doing some CRUD on it.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.230
So, let's check it out.

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
So, in order to check this out, first
thing we need to do is make sure we have

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.480
Mongo running, so I'm gonna type mongod,
make sure that's running.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.620
The server won't start without it.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.320
If you try to start the server without
the database running, it'll crash.

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.510
So make sure that's running.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.660
And then another, I'm just gonna
run npm start to start ours.

12
00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:38.630
Looks like my path is wrong.

13
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.620
Is it up one more?

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.000
API, it's util, not utils, sorry.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.090
Cool, so there we go.

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.350
So our servers on, then in another one,
I'm gonna make a request to it.

17
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.041
So, let's do a get request,

18
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.915
let's do a post request to local host,

19
00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:19.360
of first 3,000/api/user.

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.260
So, let's create a new user.

21
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.360
And, as we know right now,
user only has user name.

22
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.010
So, let' say right now username=person.

23
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.860
Looks like we have an error, hold on.

24
00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:45.117
Where.

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.190
Well, no error.

26
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.100
I don't see any logs.

27
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.270
Let's see, let me start that down.

28
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.770
Start it up.

29
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.000
&gt;&gt; There's typos in local host.

30
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.150
&gt;&gt; The what?
&gt;&gt; There's a typo in the local host.

31
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.940
&gt;&gt; There's a typo.

32
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.330
Okay.

33
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.730
Typo's get me every time man, every time.

34
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.230
There it is.

35
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.630
Localhost.

36
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.920
Cool, there we go.

37
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.850
Created a person.

38
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.370
Totally worked.

39
00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:22.299
If I wanted to create a category,

40
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.670
and category has a name.

41
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.090
And it equals cats.

42
00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.090
It's categories, pluralized right.

43
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.978
It'll create cats category.

44
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.438
Now if I wanted to get it,

45
00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:52.384
it should be as simple as Get local

46
00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:57.000
host 3000/api/users.

47
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580
Give me all the users.

48
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.330
There we go.

49
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.280
I've got a lot of users because
I added more on the data base.

50
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.320
So, don't worry about all
the extra users here.

51
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.249
It gave me all the users.

52
00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:12.100
Cool.

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:21.120
So, you might know it'll be kinda hard
to do CRUD with the posts model and

54
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.930
that's because all of the stuff that's,
why?

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.310
I don't know how this thing keeps
getting here, but it's not being right.

56
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.280
I need to fix that.

57
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.970
So yeah,
it be kind of hard to do this here.

58
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.820
While I guess we could because non of
these are required so I guess we could.

59
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.220
Although this should be required author.

60
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.640
So let's do that, let's make a post.

61
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.210
So what will do is let's grab
a user's ID We'll grab that.

62
00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:57.249
And then what we'll do is,

63
00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:04.382
we'll say, post to api/posts and

64
00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:07.711
author= that,

65
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:12.704
title= learn node 3 and

66
00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:16.745
text= bah, blah,

67
00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:21.050
blah, blah, blah.

68
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.690
Boom.

69
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.810
We created a new blog post.

70
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.039
See, it belongs to this author here.

71
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.057
All right, and
now if we did our calculations correct,

72
00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:36.063
when I do a get request for
this blog post, what I would see back,

73
00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:39.520
I wouldn't see this author billed hear,
I'd see the author object.

74
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.150
So, let's check that out.

75
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.200
So now, if I do a get request with
this post ID, I expect there to

76
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.680
be an object on the author field
with the author's object on it.

77
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.821
The user name and stuff,
so lets check that out.

78
00:04:54.821 --> 00:05:02.084
So, now if I get logo host
3,000/api/post/thatid,

79
00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:07.391
there we go, there's the author property,

80
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:14.150
it populated it,
that's what population does.

81
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.260
It took that ID that was,
that it is stored in a database.

82
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.090
In the database, the post looks like this,
the author properties thats an ID

83
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.110
of an author, but
when we call it turns it into this.

84
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.200
It gives us that authors object,
alright so

85
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.040
that is what population does, and
if we had categories in there it would do

86
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.130
the same thing with categories
each on in an array.

87
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.120
Is that starting to make sense now?

88
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.500
I know I've talked about it a lot, but

89
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.191
this is the first time
I've actually seen it.

90
00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:49.229
So, now we're able to do CRUD
on all our routes and yeah.

91
00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.670
&gt;&gt; Stupid question,
you may have covered it.

92
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.670
The underscore, underscore v that's added
to all of those, where's that coming from?

93
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.830
&gt;&gt; That's coming from Mongo.

94
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.670
Okay, that's something Mongoose
uses internally to determine-

95
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.490
&gt;&gt; I haven't looked into it.

96
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.570
Maybe the document version.

97
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.720
Yeah, it's not important, yeah,
yeah, it's not important.

98
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.523
Well, I guess if it is important if
you ever wanted to make an underscore,

99
00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:16.780
underscore vproperty on your document,
then you'd have a problem.

100
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.490
So, If that's something you really
wanted then you probably can't have it.

101
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.808
Any questions on that stuff, so we all
should be able to do it correct now.

102
00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:32.602
And if you were having problems creating
author, for some reason this theme,

103
00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:35.366
I even put it here in the comments
array of ideas from the user,

104
00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:38.860
that should not be in the comments
I don't even know why I did that

105
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.640
this should not be an array as an author.

106
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.600
It should be just one author.

107
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.100
Actually, I know why I did it
cuz I was gonna have it so

108
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.200
where many authors can write
the blog posts at the same time.

109
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.240
That's why I did it, but
we're not doing it, so.

110
00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:55.420
I was thinking way ahead.

111
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.841
Like, I was writing a solution for
like a step 20 on step 10.
