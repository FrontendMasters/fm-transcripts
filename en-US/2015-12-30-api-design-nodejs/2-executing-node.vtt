2
00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So let's do a little
bit of digging around with Node.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.090
So, I just showed you how to run Node
in the context of a your terminal.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
But you can also run Node against a file.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.540
So, I mean,
who wants to write Node in here?

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.838
Nobody wants to do that.

7
00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:20.420
You can't even test it.

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.083
So you probably, you want to write
some JavaScript to the file, and

9
00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:24.360
then execute it with Node.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.861
So the way you would do that is,
and I'll just make a file,

11
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.403
you don't have to follow along, you guys
are gonna start digging in a little bit.

12
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.250
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So if we had a file,
I was gonna call it test.js.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.142
And I do some,
I'll just do a console.log here.

14
00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:47.181
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: To execute this file,
all I have to do is go into the terminal,

15
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.880
type in Node, and
then the path to that file, which is test.

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.150
I don't have to put test.js.

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.050
I can just put test and it'll execute it.

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.839
So there it is, the console.log, hey.

19
00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.451
It executed it, and then it exited it.

20
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:58.120
All right?

21
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.488
So, it's not running continuously.

22
00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:02.223
All right.

23
00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:05.140
So, anything that I do in here,
it'll work.

24
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.250
So, as you can see, the console
just prints out to the terminal.

25
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.980
Pretty much the same way
it would in the window.

26
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.600
There are some differences, but just to
show you that this is real JavaScript.

27
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.160
That's executing it.

28
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.664
So that's how you would
run Node against a file.

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.692
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions on that?

30
00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:30.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you make
the text bigger, they're asking?

31
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.595
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Here, or the, here?

32
00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:33.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In your editor.

33
00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.562
They're asking-
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: My editor.

34
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:37.337
Sorry.
Yeah, I must have minimized it last night.

35
00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:38.370
Yeah.

36
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.790
There we go.

37
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you
get the question on the,

38
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.740
he's seen some people use
exports=module.exports.

39
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.297
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

40
00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:48.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What does that mean?

41
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.590
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,so, that's like
a way to safeguard yourself from not

42
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.380
doing a module.exports and then doing
a exports somewhere else in the file.

43
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.210
So by doing exports equals module.exports.

44
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.340
That's, I'm just gonna
keep everything safe.

45
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.923
So I'm still only gonna be
able to export one thing, and

46
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:15.603
then I'm guaranteed that some
time in the future I don't

47
00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:20.110
come down here and
say exports.other equals a value.

48
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.890
And then, that will never get exported
because we had a module.exports.

49
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.610
So it's just a way of
keeping yourself safe.

50
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.490
You don't have to do it.

51
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.400
But there are a lot of
patterns as far as exporting.

52
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.100
I'll show you some of the other patterns.

53
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.090
But that's a pretty standard pattern.

54
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.861
You see that a lot.

55
00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:42.781
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: But it's just a way of
making sure you don't try to export

56
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:46.050
something later after you module.export.

57
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.362
And not have it be able to be
required in another file and

58
00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:51.594
have some unexpected side effects.
