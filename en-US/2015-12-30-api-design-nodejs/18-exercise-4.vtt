[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:05.100
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we have a new objective.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.860
So if you look at this one,
you go into server js,

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.820
the file we've been working out of, first
you'll notice there's two more files,

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.520
there's a lions.js there's a tigers.js,
all right, that's two more files.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.160
So at the TODO at the top it says,
mount the tigers route with a new router,

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.560
a a, just for
tigers exactly like the lions is below.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.176
So if we go down here I have the app's

9
00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:32.801
middleware.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

10
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:33.990
then I'm doing mounting right?

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.480
I'm like okay, if anyone does a request,
any verb to this route,

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.210
use the lionrouter.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.936
So, where did the lionrouter come from?

14
00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:43.580
Well, let's follow it.

15
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.510
Lionrouter right here, it's being
required from the lions file, so

16
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.360
let's go into the lions file, boom.

17
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.180
First thing I did was,
I made a lionrouter.

18
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.090
This is all filled out for you,
you will not be working in this file.

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.340
I made a lionrouter, and then the rest of
the stuff is the exact same stuff we had

20
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.630
on the last example with the only
change of getting rid of app and

21
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.824
attaching auto functionality
to the lion router itself.

22
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.294
You see that?
So I make a new router by using

23
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:14.695
the .router method on express, and
instead of using app.param and

24
00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:20.680
app.get, I'm using the router.param,
router.get, router.post.

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.280
And then at the very bottom,
I need to export that router

26
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.460
therefore I can require it in server js.

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.550
So this is all filled out for you.

28
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.369
So that's where that router came from,
it was exported and then required.

29
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.500
So what I want you to do is to go into
Tigers.js, which has absolutely nothing in

30
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.890
it but some comments and do the exact
same thing as we did in Lions.

31
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.810
It's the same thing, I mean you can just
copy the same crud if you want to, but

32
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.170
I want you to get the router to work.

33
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.380
Lions and tigers are the same thing,

34
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.330
they have the same resources,
they do the same thing.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.140
The only difference is one's called
lion and the other one's called tiger.

36
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.840
I just want you to create a new router,
add the crud to the router,

37
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.070
you can literally copy this same crud and
replace lion with the word tiger, and

38
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.600
export that router, and
then make sure we mount it over here.
