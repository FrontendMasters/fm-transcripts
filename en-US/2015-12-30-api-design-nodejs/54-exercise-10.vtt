2
00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:08.754
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So the first thing you
want to do is on step ten that's

3
00:00:08.754 --> 00:00:12.510
where we left off with the controllers.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.900
We just need to hook up the routes so
if we go to the API and go to the routes,

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.430
all these routes are here, but
they don't have their crud on them.

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.270
Right so they need stuff like .get and
then we need to be able to call

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.030
the controllers that we already have here
and represent the appropriate functions.

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.400
So for example I'm just gonna
walk through one right now.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.490
So this is the category route.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.503
So on a get request to/API/category,
I want to run the,

11
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: controller.get method.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.720
And I get controller up here
because I say var controller equals

13
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.662
require the category

14
00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:03.399
controller.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You typed request there.

15
00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.367
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Thanks.

16
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.548
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So now I can

17
00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:12.130
run controller.get which if you go
look at the controller is right here.

18
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.830
That's why we exported these, so
that we can require them here.

19
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.760
And then we'll do the same thing for
all the other routes.
