00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:05.655
Welcome to intermediate TypeScript, I'm
Mike North, I'm a Senior Staff Engineer

2
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:10.402
at LinkedIn, and I work in the developer
productivity and happiness org.

3
00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:14.662
My job is predominantly
helping make our COI and

4
00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:20.108
our UI ergonomics around
developer infrastructure great.

5
00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:22.124
And TypeScript is a huge part of that,

6
00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:26.101
and that's why I'm a great person to
speak to you about TypeScript today.

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.666
Among the top goals that I have for
this course is,

8
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:35.013
number one,
I wanna make sure that I package and

9
00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:40.013
pass onto you all of the key
learnings that I have gained

10
00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:46.775
through many hours of helping guide and
tutor others around TypeScript.

11
00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.944
So you're going to see a lot of little
pieces of code throughout this course,

12
00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:53.894
that you can copy and
paste right into your own app, and

13
00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:58.083
they can solve some of the common problems
that I get a lot of questions about.

14
00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.791
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.459
I also want you to be able to understand
complicated type information.

16
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.931
And I'm gonna show you a sample
of where we're going to be,

17
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.445
by the time this course wraps up.

18
00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:14.895
This may look scary right now,
but take my word for it,

19
00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:19.021
we'll know how to break this down and
how to troubleshoot it, and

20
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.847
how to understand it, by the time we
get through intermediate TypeScript.

21
00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:27.223
What should you already know by
the time you start to take this course?

22
00:01:27.223 --> 00:01:28.168
Well, first,

23
00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:32.465
you should have a lot of experience
working with regular JavaScript.

24
00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:37.335
We're going to be making extensive use
of classes, functions, a sync await,

25
00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:42.005
promises, so you should be very
comfortable working with those concepts.

26
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.955
You also should have equivalent
knowledge to what we cover in

27
00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:50.655
the TypeScript fundamentals of V3 course.

28
00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:54.915
In particular, you should be comfortable
working with basic types for

29
00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.686
functions, objects, arrays, and tuples.

30
00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:02.519
And you should have crossed
the threshold where you understand

31
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:07.275
how generics work, at least with one or
two type parameters.

32
00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:11.141
And this is something we cover
in TypeScript fundamentals V3.

33
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:14.407
Finally, make sure you brush
up on index signatures,

34
00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:19.164
that's going to be a very important part
of some of the more advanced topics that

35
00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:20.948
we're going to cover today.

36
00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:25.648
It's also worth stating that practical
experience will aid you in terms of

37
00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:30.809
connecting the concepts were talking
about today, to real-world situations.

38
00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:36.631
So it's helpful if you've worked in a code
base that consumes type information for

39
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:38.803
common libraries like react.

40
00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:47.808
We've spent a lot of time making this
workshop as easy to use as possible.

41
00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:52.766
So, all you're going to need, is this
website that we're working on today and

42
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:54.993
the official TypeScript website.

43
00:02:54.993 --> 00:02:59.274
We've brought a lot of the features of
VS Code right into your browser, so

44
00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:03.500
we'll be able to clearly see examples
that highlight what's going on.

45
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.513
And we'll be able to write our own code,
and

46
00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:09.292
even write some code to pass some tests.

47
00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:14.381
As of the time we're recording this
course, I have made four types of

48
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:20.022
courses for Frontend Masters, and
the way I think about them is as follows.

49
00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:24.845
TypeScript fundamentals and intermediate
TypeScript are core courses, and

50
00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:28.800
most of our time together is gonna
be spent in a lab environment.

51
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.711
The idea here is that it's easy
to teach these concepts in small

52
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.574
controlled examples.

53
00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:40.095
And once we turn the light bulbs on, once
we understand how things work, that makes

54
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:44.423
it easier to take that knowledge and apply
it in a more practical situation, and

55
00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:47.030
that's where these
electives come into play.

56
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.986
Production grade TypeScript and
JS TS Monorepos,

57
00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:55.410
in those courses,
we build an app together step by step.

58
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.595
And that's where you can look for

59
00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:01.585
the applied techniques and
the real world design patterns.

60
00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.955
We assume, in those courses,

61
00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:09.622
that you have already substantial
experience working with TypeScript.

62
00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:15.130
And this is where you can learn to build
things for production and at scale.
