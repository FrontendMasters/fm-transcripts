00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.430
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It is lovely to be
here for JavaScript, the hard parts,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.960
Object Oriented Programming.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.680
We are gonna be here all day.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.410
What more could you ask?

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.859
We're gonna be here all day for
some wonderful material.

6
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.243
There's me with people looking,

7
00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:23.504
some looking excited,
some looking not so excited.

8
00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:29.670
And there you go, doing stuff at Frontend
Masters that I love doing so much.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.350
As I said already, thank you so
much for having me back.

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.010
Today, this, I run Codesmith.

11
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.560
Codesmith is in the category
I guess of coding boot camps.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.140
Think of it more though as,
we sort of call it a residency to try and

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.770
delineate between coding boot camps.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.120
We have a bunch of folk who come to
Codesmith, who've done a coding boot camp.

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.932
I love coding boot camps,
they're wonderful.

16
00:00:54.932 --> 00:00:58.229
Typically, Codesmith tries to take
folk who are a bit further along.

17
00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.390
And kind of accelerate them
through to middle senior roles.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.750
This is the wonderful team
that does it with me.

19
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.320
That's Phil who heads up in New York.

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.787
Snow, who heads up LA.

21
00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:13.242
Samantha, there, who's a lead engineer.

22
00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.330
A wonderful team to be on.

23
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.820
I'm very, very, lucky to work with.

24
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.393
I just want to say about Codesmith.

25
00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:24.550
I started it three years ago, grads
work at all these fantastic companies.

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.226
Actually, in the last two weeks,

27
00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:31.669
three Google offers which I
was very proud of those folk.

28
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:35.071
First offer to Riot Games,
which is surprising,

29
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.805
Codesmith is based in Los Angeles,
and New York City.

30
00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:42.580
And there had never been a grad who got
through the Riot Games interview process.

31
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.340
And now, thrilled that Pauline, she will
now be a software engineer at Riot Games,

32
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.020
very proud of her, as well.

33
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.056
Yep, I mean, actually,
Codesmith graduate salaries range from 95,

34
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.391
[SOUND] I've seen offers below 95,
maybe 80 sometimes.

35
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.798
So there you go.

36
00:01:56.798 --> 00:02:00.294
That's the pitch,
[LAUGH] all the way up to a 190.

37
00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:01.918
Good, there's the pitch.

38
00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:05.562
What we look for in Codesmith candidates,
I say this only, because for

39
00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:09.050
everybody here, this is what
makes a great software engineer.

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.020
It isn't maybe what you think
of as being collect and

41
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.760
accumulate technical knowledge.

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.700
That is not what makes
a great software engineer.

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.080
The wonderful thing about
software engineering, people.

44
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.620
The bless thing about
software engineering,

45
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.220
is that the knowledge is
always evolving and changing.

46
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.270
The only measure an engineer
turns out to be how able,

47
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.780
how capable are you at taking
on that new knowledge?

48
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.160
How capable are you at hitting a block in
your understanding of something new, and

49
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.565
then pushing through it.

50
00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:45.507
That is what we call
Analytical Problem Solving.

51
00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:48.325
The ability when you hit a block,
as you try and

52
00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:53.730
do a new thing that you haven't do before,
to come out the other side successfully.

53
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.085
That is it, that's the number
one most important thing.

54
00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:59.550
That makes for a hard pedagogy.

55
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.890
That means the pedagogy at
Codesmith has to essentially be not

56
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.276
teach you tons of knowledge, but
put you through tons of blocks.

57
00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:12.420
But we gotta give you first principles,

58
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.800
and this is what I like to
do at Frontend Masters.

59
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.516
Give you the first principles,
understanding of JavaScript,

60
00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:21.630
such that you autonomously
can pursue those blocks.

61
00:03:23.254 --> 00:03:27.450
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Part of that,
both to give you clarity of your own mind.

62
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.190
But, also to ensure you become
an enabler of other team members,

63
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.610
technical communication.

64
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.360
We're gonna spend the whole of,
if you like diagramming online audience.

65
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.700
If that was a thing you liked in
hard parts, prepare to be thrilled.

66
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.520
If you didn't like that aspect
of hard parts, prepare for

67
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.350
more diagramming, a lot.

68
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.710
Look, this beautiful whiteboard
that we're gonna cover,

69
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.510
we're gonna cover with diagrams.

70
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.850
To me, that is technical communication.

71
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.110
But I'm also gonna be calling on
everybody here, again, and again,

72
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.140
and again, to verbalize the code as we go.

73
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.600
That turns out to be
the most effective way to A,

74
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.080
improve your technical communication.

75
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.860
And just to be clear what
technical communication is.

76
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.210
The ability for
somebody else to implement your code,

77
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.310
your solution to a problem,
without ever seeing your code.

78
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.140
Just from your ability to verbalize it.

79
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.010
That turns out to be
an extraordinary measure.

80
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.140
Traditionally, when you
add an engineer to a team,

81
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.150
they do not add full engineer
capacity to productivity.

82
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.339
In fact, sometimes them may
even slow the team down.

83
00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:42.966
Because, now you've got to get your
mental model of the code base, and

84
00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:46.452
make it epistemically
accessible to somebody else.

85
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.484
That can slow the team down.

86
00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:52.124
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Are people
noting down that word?

87
00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.821
I recently learned that word.

88
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.380
That can slow the team down.

89
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.940
I like to try it out.

90
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.710
Please do not look it up.

91
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.290
It almost certainly does not
mean what I think it means.

92
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.379
That can slow the team down.

93
00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.893
Versus, if you are able to perfectly
communicate your understanding

94
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.346
of the code base to that other person.

95
00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.290
And now you can become
enhancers of each other.

96
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.560
But, also technical communication clears
up your own approach to problem solving.

97
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100
It makes you have a cleaner
way of thinking about it.

98
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.810
So these two things, we look for them in
candidates for Codesmith as it happens.

99
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.575
But, of course,

100
00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:31.588
they're the very things that companies
dream of in their engineers.

101
00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:35.770
So all of you, look to today not
just as being developing an under

102
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.192
the hood understanding of
an aspect of JavaScript.

103
00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:42.053
But, also, probably, more importantly,

104
00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:46.285
an opportunity to focus on
technical communication, all right.

105
00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:51.154
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Even here, supporting
each other, I know why it say it, cuz,

106
00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:53.290
I mean, it's in Frontend Masters.

107
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.370
Frontend Masters is run by
deeply empathetic people,

108
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.406
and I think we would all
be playing that out here.

109
00:05:57.406 --> 00:06:03.390
That means, here, being that a supporter,
who's looking to see the growth of others.

110
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.200
You folk are gonna be pair programming.

111
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.964
We're gonna have some time
to pair program together.

112
00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:12.050
That will all be about,
how can I grow the person to my left?
