00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.327
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We're gonna do some
pair programming to start cementing your

2
00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:10.077
understanding of these, before we dive
into what looks very short, wait for it.

3
00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:16.290
[LAUGH] That's the rest of our code, but
it will take us a real chunk of time.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.460
So let's do some pair programming,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.390
we're gonna cement some of
the concepts you've seen here.

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.240
There's two options where you compare.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.896
Either go to csx.codesmith.io
where there's a unit,

8
00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.512
object-oriented programming.

9
00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:28.517
I think it's the same challenges, but

10
00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:32.587
these are quite nice because you can write
the code, press Check my Answer, and

11
00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:35.954
it would run a bunch of tests to
see whether your code's working.

12
00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:37.610
That whether you have
completed the challenge.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.890
Alternatively, no longer needed, csbin.io.

14
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.264
Same challenge as scbin.io/oop.

15
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:48.134
You go straight to it, no log in needed,
and those are the same challenges, but

16
00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:52.770
you have to figure out whether
they're working using console logs.

17
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.070
Is it returning the expected value?

18
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.067
Okay folks, go to these two.

19
00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:58.740
I'm gonna pair all of you up.

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.780
We're doing pair
programming here in person,

21
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.028
that is the great privilege
of being here in person.

22
00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:07.468
And we're gonna look at
a series of things you,

23
00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:12.690
serious, not a work to say
when you have a phone around.

24
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.789
And we're gonna look at a series,
[SOUND] a series of know okay,

25
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.222
this is gonna happen again and again.

26
00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:26.317
We're gonna look at a set of challenges,
a set of things you may or may not know,

27
00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.950
have a look at these,
evaluate for yourself.

28
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.042
Do I know all of these, well then
give yourself a score of one, two,

29
00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.460
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

30
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.120
If you only know two of these things,
maybe you've only added a CSS style before

31
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.590
or you've only handled
collisions in a hash table but

32
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.760
not anything else, fascinating person,
then you have a score of two.

33
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.910
So give yourself a tally for
these things as a sort of self-assessment

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.920
of your knowledge, and then we're gonna
pair you up by your relative experience.

35
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.599
Okay, give yourself a tally,
stand up, forgive me, people.

36
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.170
Stand up, grab your machines,
I'm gonna line you up along here.

37
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.930
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

38
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.540
and I'm gonna pair you off
by your relative experience.

39
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.900
Forgive me for this controlling approach.

40
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.480
And our online audience, you can just
jump straight to the challenges.

41
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.536
If you do wanna pair up,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Actually if you

42
00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:16.612
don't wanna pair up people online,
here is how you do it.

43
00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:18.284
If you run csbin, you do it like this.

44
00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:25.850
You go to csbin.io/oop/ I believe,
some string, whatever you want.

45
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.460
Let's call it, I don't know,
Will and Mark.

46
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.570
Now if we both go to that URL, online
people, then we will be able to share and

47
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.090
live code through these
challenges together.

48
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.830
So if online folk who wanna
meet in the chat room and

49
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.390
pair up, make yourself a link and then
pair up, you can certainly do so as well.

50
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.620
But for our in person folk,
we're gonna do it right here.
