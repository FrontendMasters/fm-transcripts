00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.255
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It is lovely to be
here for JavaScript, the hard parts,

2
00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:06.960
Object-Oriented Programming.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.680
We are gonna be here all day.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.410
What more could you ask?

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.710
We'll be here all day for
some wonderful material.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.629
There's me with people,
some looking excited,

7
00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:23.610
some looking,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Not so excited.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.670
And there you go, doing stuff at Frontend
Masters, that I love doing so much.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.440
As I said already, thank you so
much for having me back.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.100
I run Codesmith.

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.560
Codesmith is in the category,
I guess, of coding boot camps.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.140
Think of it more, though, as,
we sort of call it a residency to try and

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.770
delineate between coding boot camps.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.120
We have a bunch of folk who come to
Codesmith who've done a coding boot camp.

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.990
I love coding boot camps,
they're wonderful.

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.140
Typically, Codesmith tries to take
folk who are a bit further along and

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.390
kind of accelerate them through
to middle-senior roles.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.750
This is the wonderful team
that does it with me.

19
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.320
There's Phil, who heads up New York.

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.020
Snow, who heads up LA.

21
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.394
Samantha there, who is a lead engineer.

22
00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:16.820
Wonderful team of people,
I'm very very lucky to work with.

23
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.300
I just want to say about Codesmith.

24
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.459
Started it three years ago,
grads work all these fantastic companies.

25
00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.852
Actually in the last two weeks,
three Google offers,

26
00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:30.150
which I was very proud of those folk.

27
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.140
First offer to Riot Games,
which is surprising.

28
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.970
Codesmith is based in Los Angeles and
New York City.

29
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.580
And there'd never been a grad who got
through the Riot Games interview process,

30
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.340
and now thrilled that Pauline, she will
now be a software engineer at Riot Games.

31
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.319
Very proud of her as well.

32
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.330
Yep, I mean, actually Codesmith
graduates salaries range from 95.

33
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.990
I've seen offers below 95,
maybe 80 sometimes, so there you go.

34
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.370
That's the pitch.

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.040
[LAUGH] All the way up to 190, good.

36
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.160
That is the pitch.

37
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.890
What we look for in Codesmith candidates,
I say this only because for

38
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.050
everybody here, this is what
makes a great software engineer.

39
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.020
It isn't maybe what you think
of as being collect and

40
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.760
accumulate technical knowledge.

41
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.700
That is not what makes
a great software engineer.

42
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.130
The wonderful thing about software
engineering people, the blessed thing

43
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.220
about software engineering is that the
knowledge is always evolving and changing.

44
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.270
The only measure an engineer
turns out to be how able,

45
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.780
how capable are you at taking
on that new knowledge?

46
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.141
How capable are you at hitting a block in
your understanding of something new and

47
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.584
then pushing through it?

48
00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:47.447
That is what we call analytical problem
solving, the ability when you hit a block

49
00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:50.948
as you try and do a new thing
that you haven't done before,

50
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:53.730
to come out the other side successfully.

51
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.760
That is it.

52
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.080
That's the number one
most important thing.

53
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.260
That makes for

54
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.370
a hard pedagogy, that means the pedagogy
it codes with has to essentially be,

55
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.260
not teach you tons of knowledge but
puts you through tons of blocks.

56
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.420
But we got to give you first principles,

57
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.800
and this is what I like to
do at Frontend Masters.

58
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.450
Give you the first principles
understanding your JavaScript

59
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.729
such that you autonomously can
push through those blocks.

60
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.120
Part of that, both to give you
clarity of your own mind, but also

61
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.150
to ensure you become an enabler of other
team members, technical communication.

62
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.433
If you liked diagramming, online audience,

63
00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:41.700
if that was the thing you liked in
Hard Parts, prepare to be thrilled.

64
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.520
If you didn't like that aspect
of Hard Parts, prepare for

65
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.350
more diagramming, a lot.

66
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.638
Look, this beautiful white
board that we are gonna cover.

67
00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:57.510
We're gonna cover with diagrams.

68
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.850
To me that is technical communication.

69
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.110
But I'm also gonna be calling on
everybody here, again, and again,

70
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.140
and again to verbalize the code as we go.

71
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.600
That turns out to be
the most effective way to A,

72
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.080
improve your technical communication.

73
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.270
And just be clear what alternative
communication is, the ability for

74
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.330
somebody else to implement your code,
your solution to a problem,

75
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.140
without ever seeing your code,
just from your ability to verbalize it.

76
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.010
That turns out to be
an extraordinary measure.

77
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.140
Traditionally, when you
add an engineer to a team,

78
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.500
they do not add full engineer
capacity to productivity.

79
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.400
In fact, sometimes they may
even slow the team down.

80
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.958
Because now you've got to get your
mental model of the code base and

81
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.587
make it epistemically
accessible to somebody else.

82
00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:47.913
That can slow the team down.

83
00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:52.151
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Are people
noting down that word?

84
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.027
I've recently learned that word.

85
00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.762
That can slow the team down.

86
00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:58.940
I'd like to try it out.

87
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.710
Please, do not look it up.

88
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.290
It almost certainly does not
mean what I think it means.

89
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.782
That can slow a team down, versus if you
are able to perfectly communicate your

90
00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:12.530
understanding of the code
base to that other person.

91
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.290
Now you can become
enhancers of each other.

92
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.560
But also technical communication clears
up your own approach to problem solving.

93
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100
It makes you have a cleaner
way of thinking about it.

94
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.810
So these two things, we look for them in
candidates for Codesmith, as it happens.

95
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.620
But of course,

96
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.790
they're the very things that companies
dream of in their engineers.

97
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.470
So all of you look to today, not just
as being developing under the hood,

98
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.390
understanding of an aspect of JavaScript.

99
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.420
But also, probably more importantly,

100
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.950
an opportunity to focus on
technical communication.

101
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.760
All right, even here,
supporting each other.

102
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.254
I don't know what to say, cuz I mean,
it's the Frontend Masters.

103
00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:55.580
Frontend Masters is run by deep,
empathic people, and

104
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.420
I think we will all be
playing that out here.

105
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.390
That means, here, being that supporter
who's looking to see the growth of others.

106
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.200
You folk are gonna be pair programming.

107
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.940
We're gonna have some time
to pair program together.

108
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.050
That will all be about,
how can I grow the person to my left?
