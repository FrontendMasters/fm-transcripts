&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And this, I think,

2
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.630
is the funnest part [LAUGH]
of what we're gonna do today.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.910
So this is called a brush, and

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.980
it's called a brush because you literally
can brush over any part of the screen,

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.172
create that little box, drag it around,
and create interactions.

6
00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:26.180
So I tend to use this a lot for
filtering down the data.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.416
So what I'm doing right here is,
it's a quite a trivial example and

8
00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:33.835
I don't recommend it for
production or anything, but

9
00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:36.979
with brushes like I'm
brushing certain months.

10
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:43.075
That within that brush that
certain months are in color.

11
00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:48.275
And then the others are gray and
that same months

12
00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:54.640
are getting reflected in
the radio chart over here.

13
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.217
And so if you can imagine,
that could be really powerful if you have

14
00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:05.695
multiple charts that are different
aspects of the same data set,

15
00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:11.884
and you want to use one chart to filter
down the visualization elsewhere.
