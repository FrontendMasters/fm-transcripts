00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.746
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You have a question,
can you implement brush on a Canvas?

2
00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:07.314
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: You can actually, so

3
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:12.452
what you saw earlier, so I think brushes,

4
00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:17.033
I have to confirm, but I think brushes

5
00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:23.888
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Have to be in SVG.

6
00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:26.208
I don't think it lets you do it in Canvas.

7
00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:29.651
So, this brushable, like that,

8
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:35.365
drawing that rectangle and
stuff, that has to be in SVG.

9
00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:42.940
Let me show you what I mean by that.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

10
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.684
to be able to draw see,
to draw this rectangle and

11
00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:53.632
have this interactivity and

12
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:58.238
then also have kind of the ability

13
00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:02.690
to do handles, and all of that.

14
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.002
So, all of that is in SVG, so you'll have
to create a layer of SVG on top of your

15
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:14.380
canvas, [LAUGH]
so that you can have this interactivity.

16
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.430
But, this brush is not tied to any of
your data, it's not tied to any of your

17
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.600
rendering of your bars, or
your parts or any of that.

18
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
And all it does is gives
you the interactivity

19
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.440
of being able to move this around and
then also it tells you an xy coordinate

20
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.190
like the xy coordinates of this part or
this part or this part and this part.

21
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.090
So if you can imagine like
after I've done some brushing,

22
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.070
you can just go and
get the exposition of this,

23
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.910
the exposition of the right hand side,
etc.

24
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.220
Pop that into your parent and
be like filter by these dates, or

25
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.830
filter by these temperatures,
or something like that.

26
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.750
Have the parent component do
whatever filtering you need

27
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.920
and then after it's done
the filtering have,

28
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.410
the chats render only the things
that have been filtered.

29
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.740
So because this component doesn't
care about the data itself,

30
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.316
it only draws whatever
the pen tells it to draw.

31
00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:30.789
So, if the parent after
something has been filtered and

32
00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.010
the parent filters those things out.

33
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.240
Then within here it will only draw
those things that have been kept

34
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.500
after the brush.

35
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.450
So, definitely possible it's
just you need the SVG on top of

36
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.021
the canvas.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is the brush smirk when it

37
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:51.044
comes to radial chart,
would it make like a radial brush?

38
00:02:51.044 --> 00:02:52.909
No?
Does a regular square brush over it?

39
00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.576
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: But, let me

40
00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:03.225
think about that.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

41
00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:07.931
[LAUGH] I have made a custom

42
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:12.193
radial brush before.

43
00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:17.165
And I think what I did is create a,

44
00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:22.325
let me see if I can still find that.

45
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.245
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: What I did was basically

46
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:33.860
make a use D3 arc to make
a kind of like a pie slice.

47
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.930
And then, draw that and

48
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.100
when I move around I use D3 drag to
handle that dragging interaction.

49
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.180
Cuz you can imagine, this is basically
just a fancy drag interaction, right?

50
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.199
And then from there on,
I believe what I did was

51
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.202
grab the
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Grab the the minimum

52
00:03:58.202 --> 00:04:02.590
angle and the maximum angle I think.

53
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.051
Yeah.

54
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:06.160
So no.

55
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.874
But you could do it yourself.

56
00:04:07.874 --> 00:04:12.874
[LAUGH] That's all I have for
today, so I just want to thank

57
00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:17.470
the beta testers that kind
of like gave me feedback.

58
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.500
I did a shorter version
of this with them and

59
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.250
they gave me a lot of feedback, and
I want to thank you for being here.

60
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.382
Thank you so much.
