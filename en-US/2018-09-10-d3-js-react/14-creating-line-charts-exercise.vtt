00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.940
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The exercises right here.

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.768
I think the scales should be pretty
much the same, so figure out the min and

3
00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:12.751
max of the dates, min and
max of the high temperature, sorry,

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:16.907
min and max of yes,
I believe the high temperature.

5
00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:22.656
And then,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Create a line generator,

6
00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:28.439
d3.line, to generate a string for
the d attribute of each of the paths,

7
00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.560
and return then the rate of two objects.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.298
One to draw the path for
the high temperature and

9
00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:40.329
the other to draw the path for
the low temperature.

10
00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.956
And this time around,
I want to make sure to give

11
00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:51.313
you d3.line is under the module d3shape.

12
00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:57.895
And here is the API for it.

13
00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:03.255
So this is basically

14
00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:09.139
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The example.

15
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.776
So read through that if need be.

16
00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:16.276
And then please create two lines for
the line chart.

17
00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.544
You create this line generator and

18
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:25.251
you tell it how to get the x position and

19
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:30.860
the y position for
each of these data points.

20
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.149
And what this line generator
is doing underneath the hood,

21
00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.310
once it gets pass in the data,
it loops through each of the data points.

22
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.829
So it goes through this first data point,
calculates the x, calculates the y,

23
00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.201
goes to the next one,
calculates the x, calculates the y,

24
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.660
and draws the line in between them.

25
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.500
That makes sense, right?

26
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.337
Cool.
And that's all it's doing and

27
00:01:55.337 --> 00:01:57.397
then it's outputting this path string.

28
00:01:57.397 --> 00:02:00.636
And you put this into the d
attribute of your path.

29
00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:08.111
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So here is the exercise.

30
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:14.942
Again, the JavaScript code can go in here
and then, if you return the right array,

31
00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:19.441
it should draw the line charts
right here and spoiler.

32
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.756
This is the D3 code that
draws it right here.
