&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's do this
exercise of drawing the bar chart.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.530
Now that we've calculated all of the data,
and

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.130
we figured out how to calculate the data,
let's use react to do the rendering.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.726
And so here's the starter code,
so go to under visualizations,

5
00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:25.018
go to Chart.js and
then in these examples, we're just going

6
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:31.530
to put the data calculations and
to get derived state from props.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:39.150
Return it as state, and then use that
to render a bunch of rectangles.

8
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.868
And then if you do it right,
it should show up right here.
