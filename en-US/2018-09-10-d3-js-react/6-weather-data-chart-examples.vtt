00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's talk
about how a bar chart is made.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:12.040
And so if you look at this,
this is 365 rectangle elements.

3
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.051
SVG rectangle elements and then I want
us to kinda work through together

4
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:24.574
what the x coordinates might be, the y and
what the width and height might be.

5
00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.106
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: It's quite early in

6
00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:29.253
the morning, I guess.

7
00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:34.679
[LAUGH] And so the x-axis,
maybe it's a little bit small.

8
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.587
But maybe you can see is
the date of the temperature.

9
00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:44.255
Does anyone one wanna make
a guess about the y-axis?

10
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.374
You can shout it out, it's okay.

11
00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:48.059
I heard you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe temperature.

12
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.502
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you.

13
00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:54.782
It's the temperature and
in this particular bar chart,

14
00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:57.754
it's the higher temperature.

15
00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:01.397
Because the x, y-coordinate for

16
00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:07.290
the top left is the date and
basically where this is.

17
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.450
So this is the high temperature for
that day and then we're

18
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.320
trying to make a bar that goes from the
high temperature to the low temperature.

19
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.628
So the height of this rectangle is
a difference between the low, because

20
00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:28.383
that's the one down here and that's
the one with the bigger wide coordinate.

21
00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:33.202
So the lower temperature minus
the higher temperature and

22
00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:38.912
then the fill for this one is just
the average temperature of the day.

23
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:49.046
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then this line chart is

24
00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:53.217
basically two path elements.

25
00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:58.036
And I mentioned before that for path,
we have to give it a d attribute.

26
00:01:58.036 --> 00:01:59.976
And for this particular one,

27
00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:04.863
it's a d attribute where it's a bunch
of line commence that connect points

28
00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:08.680
where each of the points
are the temperature for the date.

29
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.445
So yeah, for each point,
the x-coordinate is the date and

30
00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:17.057
the y is the temperature and
I'm drawing two paths, one red, one blue.

31
00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:23.365
So one for the y-coordinates,
these are either the high temperature for

32
00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:28.554
the first path and the low temperature for
the second path and

33
00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:34.575
the fill is red for high temperature and
blue for the low temperature.

34
00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:39.805
This is how we're drawing this line chart.

35
00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.278
And finally, for this one,

36
00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:48.057
each of these slices might look
like they're bars or rectangles.

37
00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:52.759
But they're actually made out
of 365 SVG path elements.

38
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.367
And for each of the d attributes,
the commands are both in line and

39
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:05.023
curve commands to make up each of
those slices for each of the dates.

40
00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:08.845
And for each one of the slices,

41
00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:14.734
the angle that slice is at
is the day in the year.

42
00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:18.784
I think starting from up here is January.

43
00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:22.819
I realize after I made this that
l labeled the temperatures and

44
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.390
I forgot to label the dates and months.

45
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.122
[LAUGH] So in actual production,
you should label the dates and

46
00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:31.765
months too somehow.

47
00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:34.696
[LAUGH] But yeah, so
I think this starts out as January.

48
00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:39.701
And down here, it makes sense
that this is summer time and

49
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.424
comes back here for 2017.

50
00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:46.950
So angles our days,
the inner radius as kind of

51
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.404
the inside part of the slice
is the lower temperature and

52
00:03:52.404 --> 00:03:59.154
it goes out to the outer radius up
here which is the high temperature.

53
00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:02.250
And then of course,
the fill is the average temperature.

54
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.882
Really straightforward, really quite
straightforward how these are made.

55
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:09.919
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's really cool,

56
00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.768
never thought of using a radial chart.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah,

57
00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:17.093
we don't really use them too often.

58
00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:22.131
I made this more, because I wanted
something pretty for us to make.

59
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:25.676
But there are some really beautiful

60
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:30.649
like radial chart weather
that people have done.

61
00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.679
So this is by Suzzy Loo whose
work we'll use a little

62
00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:38.054
bit later today, but like there's some of

63
00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:45.475
these.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: These

64
00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:50.411
are really gorgeous and they have that
same concept of the temperatures,

65
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:54.567
but also if you can see some of
the blue on here is the rain fall.

66
00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:58.511
I don't think I see it too much.

67
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:02.064
Maybe I just don't really look
at weather visualizations.

68
00:05:02.064 --> 00:05:05.132
I don't see it used too much, but

69
00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:10.950
it is a really beautiful way to
show temperature across a year.

70
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.640
And we can talk a little bit about
different times menu you might want to use

71
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.102
something like something radial is great
for when you have data that's continuous.

72
00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:25.874
Kind of like it starts out in January and
ends in December 31st, but

73
00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:30.235
not very appropriate if you want
to be say, showing data from,

74
00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:34.378
I don't know 2016 to 2018 or
something like that.

75
00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:38.914
So radial charts are really great for
when you're trying to show

76
00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:43.370
something that's just one year or
one month, one hour, etc.
