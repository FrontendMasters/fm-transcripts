&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And of course,
there is other parts, as you can see.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.581
I think these are really great,

3
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:09.052
these are interactions that are really,
really great.

4
00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:12.858
And they're very data
visualization-specific that I use quite

5
00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:13.692
frequently.

6
00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:17.982
We'll actually talk about Brushes later
on, and Brushes are really great for

7
00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:18.699
filtering.

8
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.741
There's Drag, there's Zoom and Pan,

9
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:26.579
if you can imagine having a map and
zooming and panning for that.

10
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.756
And then Quadtree is really helpful for
finding if you have an xy position and

11
00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:36.632
finding the point that's nearest to it,
etc.

12
00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.088
And so if you ever need to implement
anything along those lines,

13
00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.720
I would recommend checking out the API for
that.

14
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.680
But today we're here to
talk also about React.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.290
And I think these are the sections
that we'll use React for and

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.581
I think React does a lot
better of a job with.

17
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.666
And so you can see here,
this is the DOM manipulation part,

18
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.400
this is the Selecting,
Modifying, Joining data.

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.308
This is the enter, update,

20
00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:07.930
exit pattern that I was talking to
you about this morning right here.

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.899
And Dispatches is kind
of how D3 tries to do,

22
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.992
basically, event handling.

23
00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:22.457
And so I think Dispatches is kind
of like the way that we use it with

24
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:27.276
visualizations is, for example,
if you have two visualizations.

25
00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:30.921
And if you do something in one
visualization and you want that

26
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:35.864
interaction to be reflected in another
visualization, you can use dispatches.

27
00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:40.009
And it's kind of like a pub/sub model, but

28
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.601
I find that that takes a lot more code.

29
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.350
And it's something that React gives us for

30
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.950
free if you just use the state
management within there.

31
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.921
So that's what we'll be talking about from
now on, this is what we'll use React for.
