00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.030
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
we're gonna do something.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.900
In particular, we're gonna play
with the all the SVG elements.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.190
So if you have the slides open,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.210
please click on the notebook.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.350
And once you click on the notebook,
it will take you here.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.005
And all I want us to do for,

7
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:30.085
let's say in the next five or

8
00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:34.742
ten minutes, just look at

9
00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:39.413
how these are made in SVG.

10
00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:42.820
So, if you hover over this line chart,

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.363
if you hover over the side,
it will let you open it and

12
00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:53.173
then you can look at the SVG that
it takes to create those elements.

13
00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:57.891
Look at how they're made, try deleting
some things and see what happens, or

14
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.170
try editing some of the numbers and
see what happens.

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.890
Maybe something breaks, but
then that'll be really fun.

16
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.238
I just want us to get a good grasp of

17
00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:14.972
how to draw these things using SVG.

18
00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:19.045
Obviously, this looks a little bit
different from the other visualizations,

19
00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:22.157
and that's because it's only
the first month of 2017.

20
00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:27.783
I didn't want to give you 365
rectangles to have to wade through,

21
00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:29.534
so this is only 31.
