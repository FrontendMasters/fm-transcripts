00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.996
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So,
this is where we create axes at the very

2
00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:06.780
beginning of the life cycle.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.917
Or in this case, I think I'm just
gonna declare on the component itself.

4
00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:20.040
So, let's create a x axis and so, x axes,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let me show

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.035
you this.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So x-axes are the one

6
00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:29.562
down here, and this sits at the bottom so

7
00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:34.233
that's why we call it d3.axisBottom.

8
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:39.299
We pass in, actually, so create that.

9
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
And then yAxis, usually we want
it on the left, but of course,

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.994
you can also create one on the right.

11
00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.088
But for
us we're going to create it on the left.

12
00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:54.905
And so that's all you

13
00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:59.189
need for the axes.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.152
But do you guys notice something?

15
00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:11.117
Which is that the bars we've
been drawing start at zero,

16
00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:16.089
but these bars start at
about 20 pixels over,

17
00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:20.581
so that there's enough room for the axes.

18
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.393
So let's take that into account also.

19
00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:28.790
Let's shift this over by,
I have this margin thing declared up top,

20
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.820
so let's move some things
over a little bit.

21
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.370
So, for the x scale, you know how
we've been saying from 0 to width.

22
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.430
Let's make that from margin.left, so
push that over by the 20 pixels or so.

23
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.970
And let's make that go from
margin.left to width- margin.right so

24
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.180
we can have a bit of
padding on both sides.

25
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.900
Let’s, and now, see, we have,
we now have a nice bit of padding.

26
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.520
Let’s do that exact same thing for
the Y scale, so

27
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.546
we have some padding to draw
the axes on the bottom.

28
00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:11.110
Height- margin.Bottom,
because this right here,

29
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.760
down here is the height and we want to
subtract the bottom margin from it.

30
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.410
And then, let's just give a little
bit of margin at the top.

31
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.280
And now we should have enough kind of
little bit of buffer on both sides

32
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.334
to draw our axes.

33
00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:39.280
So, again,

34
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.060
I declared them up here, the axes.

35
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.680
And then, the second part is
putting them into the render.

36
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860
So let's make a group element.

37
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.190
Give it a ref of xAxis.

38
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.310
Create another group element,
give it a ref of yAxis.

39
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.927
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then in component data

40
00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:16.126
update,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: All I

41
00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:21.650
have to do is get d3, well, actually,

42
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.826
first of all,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: We

43
00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:34.610
have to get the x scale and the y scale,
which we've defined in this function.

44
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.893
Right?
So, let's return that as

45
00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:41.779
the state as part of the state also.

46
00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:47.720
So just return xScale and yScale so
that in componentDidUpdate,

47
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.453
I can say
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: this.xAxis and

48
00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:58.329
pass in the scale which
is this.state.xScale.

49
00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.173
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: this.

50
00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.563
And then let's draw that XAxis.

51
00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:08.409
So to do that, I need to just use
d3 to select the group element.

52
00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.861
So this.refs.XAxis.

53
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:18.129
So I've selected the group element and
I've wrapped that into a d3 selection.

54
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:28.690
Just so that I can call the this.xAxis.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Look at that.

55
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.828
It's drawn the axis at the top.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yay,

56
00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:35.690
[LAUGH] that's all it took.

57
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.639
And let me do the same thing for
the yAxis.

58
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:49.431
scale(this.state.yScale d3.select
(this.refs.yAxis).

59
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.673
So select the yAxis group element.

60
00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:55.677
And then call the yAxis.

61
00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:59.079
And then you'll see there is something
that's been created right here.

62
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.340
And so these are the two axes.

63
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.180
And then you might notice that they're not
at the places that we expect them to be.

64
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.988
And so to put them at their places
that they should go, again,

65
00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:17.601
use that transform that
I mentioned earlier.

66
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:22.702
And for the x axis,
I just want to bring it to the bottom, so

67
00:05:22.702 --> 00:05:29.130
translate.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

68
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.956
I don't want to translate
anything in this x direction.

69
00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:36.050
I do want to translate it so

70
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.043
that it's at the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Minus

71
00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:46.827
the margin.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

72
00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:50.003
so now you see the x-axis is at the right

73
00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:55.998
spot,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: After I

74
00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:57.465
did the translation.

75
00:05:57.465 --> 00:06:01.508
And then I want to do the same thing for

76
00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:08.806
the Y-axis.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

77
00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:12.251
I don't need to translate
it in the Y direction, but

78
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:15.950
I do want to translate it over
by the padding to the left.

79
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.874
And that's how we have, we now have axes.

80
00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:34.040
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let me put that here.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

81
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.018
all it took was returning the scale,
setting the scale,

82
00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:43.786
calling it, so
this x axis is actually a function and so

83
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:50.350
calling this d3 axis function on
the VSG group element draws the x-axis.

84
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.936
Doing the same, we'll draw the y-axis.

85
00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:05.520
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Making sure that
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: d3 doesn't know anything

86
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.520
that's going on within
these group elements.

87
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.910
So that, sorry, making sure that React
doesn't know anything that are going

88
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.850
on within these group elements, so
that d3 can do whatever it needs in there.

89
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.701
That's the axes.
