00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.663
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So this is the one
we'll be talking about next.

2
00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:09.011
And then again, don't worry about
copying down all of the code,

3
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:12.423
cuz all of the code is
in the full version.

4
00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:14.917
So this one,
I want to talk about this one next.

5
00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:19.689
Again, the radial chart is
made out of 365 paths and

6
00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.733
we just need to figure
out the path to draw, and

7
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:29.127
like you saw in the very first exercise,
that path is really,

8
00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:36.332
really ugly if we have to generate it
ourselves, and so, D3's got you covered.

9
00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:42.016
D3 has this thing called D3.ARC,
and the arc generator,

10
00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:47.144
that works pretty much very
similar to D 3.line, But

11
00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:53.944
this time around what we want to do is
give the arc generator a data set, or

12
00:00:53.944 --> 00:01:00.187
sorry, give the arc generator
instead of an array of data points,

13
00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:04.900
we want to give it an object
of just one data point.

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
And then, D3.ARC generator,

15
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.067
always always wants an inner radius,

16
00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:17.287
an outer radius, a start angle, and

17
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:22.742
an end angle to draw its arc.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

18
00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:25.352
this one is pretty commonly used for

19
00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:29.782
pie charts.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And so,

20
00:01:29.782 --> 00:01:34.686
the most common example for it,

21
00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:40.314
is a pie chart like this where you give

22
00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:45.231
it a start angle, an end angle.

23
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.255
Can you see that?

24
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:51.173
For example, for this slice,
you give it this start angle, and

25
00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:57.183
then this end angle, and you give it
an inner radius, which in this case is 0,

26
00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:03.284
and then an outer radius, however big you
want it to be, or, in the donut case,

27
00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:08.386
it's a, whatever this inter radius,
and then outer radius, and

28
00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:15.440
it just calculates the string for you,
so it calculates one of these strings.

29
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.422
And so for
us what we want is we just tell it our

30
00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:25.543
inner radius, outer radius, start angle,

31
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:30.258
end angle, pass in that data object, and

32
00:02:30.258 --> 00:02:36.800
it gives us back the string
that draws that pie slice.

33
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.510
So, let's again, give that a try
