00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.767
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I want us to calculate
the data using D3 skills to

2
00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.870
make that bar chart.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.705
So the starter notebook is the same one,
the same one we were looking at before.

4
00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.155
And I want us to up here,

5
00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:21.295
there's kind of some suggestions or
hints on how to create the bar chart.

6
00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:26.905
Which scales to use,
what to map it to, et cetera.

7
00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:32.690
Here's, I have already loaded it
in the data for you right here and

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.045
so this is in the global
variable data right here.

9
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:39.228
And then I've defined within height.

10
00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:46.044
So if in the bar chart you can return
me an array of objects where each

11
00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:51.650
object has an x,
y within height to draw the bars.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.530
If you do it right it will
magically show up here.

13
00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.750
And then you can do all of your javascript
code in where I have the dot dot dot.

14
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.720
A few more things about
the observable notebook.

15
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.220
So there is a question

16
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.810
about whether you can access d3 in
one of these JavaScript blocks.

17
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.560
And so d3 is loaded down here as
one of the external libraries.

18
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020
So this is observable.

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.630
It is actually by the creator of d3,
Mike Bostock, and

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.750
as far as I can tell, it's kinda
like Jupiter Notebook, but for what?

21
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.090
But, also, I was told the thing that's
different about it is that you can

22
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.160
the order of your
dependencies don't matter.

23
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.620
So you can define like your
external libraries down here or

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.780
other things that you might not
want people to have to read through

25
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.000
down here and
then it still works everywhere.

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.870
And that's I've been told something
that Jupyter Notebook doesn't have.

27
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.690
And so that's one of the things I wanted
to mention that D3 is loaded down there so

28
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.140
that you can use it in your And
one these cells in your code.

29
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.260
And also, probably important to mention is

30
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.130
the de-scale api,
which is right here d3-scale.

31
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.620
If you want to Google that, and
then I just wanted to show you

32
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.880
some of the scales we talked about
earlier the continuous scales.

33
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.160
And so,
it tells you how to do domain and range.

34
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.479
And then as well,
as you can look at scale linear and

35
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.810
scale time and
also kind of the ordinal and

36
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.532
quanties, and the other options there are.

37
00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:52.633
So please look through the API and

38
00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:57.740
that should be probably very
helpful in the exercise.
