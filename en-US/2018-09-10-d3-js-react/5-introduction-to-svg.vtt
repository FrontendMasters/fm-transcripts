&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So to start off with,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.390
let's talk about how to draw those
charts with just SVG elements.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.653
So SVG is an XML type language,
just like HTML, but

4
00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:17.809
instead of drawing kind of,
I guess, containers with text,

5
00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:22.389
SVG is really great at drawing
shapes onto the screen.

6
00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.963
And so there's a lot of different
kinds of SVG elements, but

7
00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:32.991
the ones I tend to use the most are
rectangles, circles, and text, and paths.

8
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:38.755
And so for rectangles, you are required
to give it at least a width or

9
00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.720
height to draw onto the screen.

10
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.661
And if you want to draw
it anywhere other than 0,

11
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:50.200
0 coordinate, you have to give
it the x and y of the top left.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.080
So that's how you draw a rectangle,
x, y, width, height.

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.250
For circles you want to give
it at least a radius and

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.360
then the x and
y coordinates of its center.

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.148
To draw text, actually,
I think you just needed to give it text,

16
00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:14.998
but you can give it x, y, some offset and

17
00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:20.119
text-anchor, which is
the horizontal alignment.

18
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.088
So text anchor, think of it as a line,
text line, in CSS,

19
00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:29.113
except in CSS it's left-center-right and
then in SVG, because we just

20
00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:34.995
want to make things a slight bit different
and difficult it's start, middle, end.

21
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:40.408
[LAUGH] That's how you can
think of the text anchor.

22
00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:46.180
And then, last but not least,
this is my favorite SVG element.

23
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.820
These are paths, and with paths,

24
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.370
you want to give it a D attribute, which
is basically the path command to follow.

25
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.330
And you tell it where you want to move to,
where you want to draw lines to,

26
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.010
curve to, arc to.

27
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.340
And we won't really be talking about
the specifics of how to draw a path today,

28
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.042
just because it can get pretty
intimidating-looking actually.

29
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.985
But what I do want to
show you is that with

30
00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:25.910
paths you can draw literally any
shape you want, that you imagine.

31
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.712
So you can draw curves, you can draw

32
00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:34.810
circles, any shape, and so

33
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.580
if you ever feel up to it, wait.

34
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.410
I just about to show you
what you can do with it.

35
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.990
So this was one of my
projects two years ago and

36
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.980
this is how I got really
familiarized with SVG paths,

37
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.010
you literally can make any of these
shapes that you want with SVG paths.

38
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.467
It's extremely powerful.

39
00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:01.251
So I would highly recommend
checking it out sometime,

40
00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:07.055
when you have a chance.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

41
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:11.275
we have to also talk about
the SVG Coordinate System.

42
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:18.975
So with the SVG Coordinate System,
the 0, 0 starts in the top left corner.

43
00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:24.724
And then the x increases
as we go towards the right,

44
00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:28.560
and the y increases as we go down.

45
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.122
And this is really really
important to mention, because for

46
00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:37.691
example, if we want to be drawing
a rectangle in the screen.

47
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.129
Like I mentioned earlier,
a rectangle you draw by giving it the x,

48
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.911
y of the top left and
the width and height.

49
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:50.561
So the x, y of the top left,
maybe its something like 25,

50
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:56.100
50, but then the x,
y of the bottom is 125, 100.

51
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.941
So you'll have to take that into
account when you're kind of figuring

52
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:08.760
out your width and height and subtracting
the bottom right from the top left.

53
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.355
And this will make a bit more sense
later when we're talking about

54
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:18.565
figuring out the y coordinate of,
say, your bar chart.

55
00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:21.265
So I wanted to mention this early on.
