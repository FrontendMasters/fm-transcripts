&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So we're back and
actually before we go ahead,

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.014
I want to address a few things that
we talked about during the break.

3
00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:14.189
And so the first thing actually is,
so this an observable Notebook and

4
00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:21.004
how it works is you write either HTML or
JavaScript code in one of these cells.

5
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.757
And then every time there is a change
you can rerun it by pressing this little

6
00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:27.351
Play button right here.

7
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:33.169
Or you can just click Shift+Enter in
the cell and it will rerun the cell.

8
00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:35.311
So that was one of the first
things I wanted to cover.

9
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:41.494
The second thing I wanted to say is so
a few of you noticed that the paths

10
00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:47.960
are basically like Illustrator or
the Pen tool in Photoshop.

11
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.000
Basically in Illustrator, you can with
the Pen tool kind of click on a point,

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.560
and then draw a line, or draw a curve.

13
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.050
And for
a curve you have to first make a line and

14
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.960
then there's an anchor point that show up.

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.260
And you drag those anchor
points around to make curves.

16
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.010
That's basically exactly what's
happening with these path elements,

17
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.458
except instead of a nice
Pen tool that you click and

18
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:21.936
drag and all of that,
it's all just numbers.

19
00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:30.340
But kind of when in the Pen tool, you
click and that's the start of your path.

20
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.900
That's the move to command that
you might have noticed in here.

21
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.250
There are Ls in here
that are subtle to see.

22
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.770
But the Ls are line 2 commands.

23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.810
I think if you go down to this

24
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.880
radio chart, you can kind of
see these arcs, these curves.

25
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.260
And these are, I believe,
arc two commands right here.

26
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.780
And each of them, so for move-to's

27
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.040
you have to give it an x,y-coordinate and
that's separated by this comma.

28
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.570
For arcs you have to give it a radius x,
a radius y,

29
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.180
three zeros and ones, to tell it
what to draw and then ending x,y.

30
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.091
And so,
it's like drawing with Illustrator but

31
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:27.334
without the Pen and just with
numbers [LAUGH] and a few letters.

32
00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:31.625
And so the point of this was to show you.

33
00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:36.407
And then I also heard, actually, it made
me really happy cuz I heard people say, so

34
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:37.520
this is doing this.

35
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.959
Or if you remove this,
and that was really cool.

36
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.480
And I was also told that the rectangle
was the most straightforward.

37
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.228
And I wanted you to see that, too.

38
00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.340
It's exactly what we were talking about,
x,y with height.

39
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.540
And also why I wanted to mention that for
paths,

40
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.930
don't worry about it too much right now.

41
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.900
And the reason why I wanted you to see it,
I mean,

42
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.020
I think it would've been prettier
if I took out the decimals [LAUGH].

43
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.390
These are generated so
that decimals are there.

44
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.046
But I wanted to let you see how not pretty
it is, and how potentially kind of hard

45
00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:18.466
it is to hand-code a bunch of these and
be like, this is where D3 comes in.
