00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.555
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I want to go through
with you kind of basic chart types and

2
00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:05.530
when to use them.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.185
So that if at work you're ever handed
a design with a chart visualization,

4
00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:15.877
you'll know if [LAUGH] it's
the right chart for the job or not.

5
00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:17.615
And once we have that,

6
00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:22.560
I want to break down how to draw
the chart with SVG in the browser.

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.381
And then I want to talk about
how to go from raw data to those

8
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:31.873
SVG shapes that we're
drawing in the browser.

9
00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:35.773
And then, [LAUGH] and then,
fourth one on the list,

10
00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:39.494
[LAUGH] is where we'll be
pulling React back in and

11
00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:43.516
using React to render both SVG and
Canvas in the DOM.

12
00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:48.671
And then, finally,
we'll talk a little bit about exceptions

13
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:53.548
to the number four, and
finishing touches to make a chart.

14
00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:57.358
So we're gonna get started
with the content right now.

15
00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:00.874
To start, I think it's really,
really important to, when we're

16
00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:05.454
talking about data visualization, to talk
about the data types, your raw data types.

17
00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:10.690
And here are some of the types
that I come across quite often.

18
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.417
The first being categorical.

19
00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:16.762
And so one of the easiest examples
of a categorical data type is,

20
00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:20.231
let's say for movies,
movie genres could be one.

21
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:25.649
Even movie actors could be
a categorical data type.

22
00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.034
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The second is ordinal.

23
00:01:29.034 --> 00:01:33.788
I think of ordinal like categorical,
but there's an order to it.

24
00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:39.130
So kind of the most traditional, I guess,
example for that, it's t-shirt sizes.

25
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.989
So small, medium, large.

26
00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.497
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Then there's quantitative.

27
00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:51.810
And quantitative, it could temperatures,
degrees from 0 to 100.

28
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.044
It could be for the movie example, again.

29
00:01:56.044 --> 00:02:03.131
It could be the meta scores
of the movies from 0 to 100.

30
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:06.660
And then temporal is to do with dates.

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.889
Years, months,
any sort of data that are dates.

32
00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.275
And spatials, so cities,
countries, regions.

33
00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:22.282
And these data types are really
quite important when we start

34
00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:27.301
talking about charts and
what charts could be good for what.

35
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:32.985
So I want to go through some of the basic
chart types that I see often and

36
00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.757
what to use them for.

37
00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:39.447
So bar charts are probably what we
learned in middle school and high school.

38
00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:44.375
And so bar charts are for
categorical comparisons.

39
00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:49.135
And so I think of it as, so
I'm calling it domain and range.

40
00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:55.270
And I just kinda mean an input, one axis
that's the input, that's independent.

41
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.966
And the other axis that's
the output that's kind

42
00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.780
of dependent on that input axis.

43
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.393
So domain for bar charts are categorical.

44
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.620
And range is quantitative.

45
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.900
So for this particular example, it's a bar

46
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.920
chart of movie genres on the x-axis.

47
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.609
And then on the y-axis is basically
the number of movies that have that genre.

48
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.355
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
then histograms, I have to admit,

49
00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:36.080
I never really thought about
the difference between bar charts and

50
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.091
historgrams until I was preparing for
this course and the next course.

51
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.929
[LAUGH] I was like,
they're all just bar charts.

52
00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:43.890
But clearly, they're not.

53
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.208
[LAUGH] I mean, I hear about
bar charts and histograms, but

54
00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.453
I never thought about the difference.

55
00:03:49.453 --> 00:03:54.852
So histograms are really good for
categorical distributions.

56
00:03:54.852 --> 00:04:00.759
And what I mean by that is that the domain
typically are quantitative bins,

57
00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:05.569
so it's some sort of data
attribute that's quantitative.

58
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.775
And it gets lumped into these bins.

59
00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:17.705
And the range is the frequency of elements
that go into those quantitative bins.

60
00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:22.039
So, for example,
that could be on the x-axis.

61
00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.116
It could be the movie metascores.

62
00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.806
And then that could be bucketed
by let's say every ten points or

63
00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.325
something like that.

64
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:32.845
And then the range, the kind of height,

65
00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:38.885
is the number of movies that
fall into that bin of metascore.

66
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:40.055
So that's a histogram.

67
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.830
And then scatterplots are for correlation.

68
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.770
I find this one extremely useful for
data exploration,

69
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.470
although I don't think I see it
as much as a final chart type.

70
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.514
And so scatterplots are basically
two data attributes and

71
00:04:55.514 --> 00:04:58.775
the relationship between
their quantitative values.

72
00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:02.467
So this particular one is
also a movie data set.

73
00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:07.395
And it's trying to look at the correlation
between if the number of votes for

74
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.938
that movie on IMDB has a correlation
with the number of votes, sorry,

75
00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:15.335
a correlation with the rating
of that movie on IMDB.

76
00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:20.998
I don't know if that's a very
meaningful correlation, but

77
00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:23.119
[LAUGH] that's the example.

78
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.071
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
line charts are quite useful,

79
00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:31.222
I think we see it all the time for stocks.

80
00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:33.322
But they're for temporal trends.

81
00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:38.122
And so one, the domain is temporal and
the range is quantitative.

82
00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:47.143
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think we
see trees quite often, too.

83
00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:48.199
They're for hierarchy.

84
00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.899
And in particular, they are for hierarchy
that have parent-child relationships

85
00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:58.233
across multiple tiers
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

86
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:02.745
this is my personal favourite,
node-link diagrams.

87
00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:06.840
And so these are to show connection.

88
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.202
If you want to see the relationship
between multiple entities,

89
00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:11.630
this is a really good one.

90
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.190
And the difference between this and
the tree is that these are good for

91
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.340
cyclical, sorry, cyclical links.

92
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.669
And then the other one is for
one directional.

93
00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.550
The trees are for
one directional relationships.

94
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.280
And I think the reason why I really
like this one is because for

95
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.032
node-link diagrams, if you want to show
in a network who's more central and

96
00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:38.651
who's more on the outlier,
this is really easy to show that.

97
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.080
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
a little bit about maps.

98
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.734
So the type of map size
you see quite often is

99
00:06:48.734 --> 00:06:53.274
these chloropleths for spatial trends.

100
00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:59.649
And the domain for this is spatial
regions and the range is quantitative.

101
00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:05.431
And I think I want to talk a little
bit about what they're best for

102
00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:12.513
or not good for, cuz I think it's one of
those could be misused sort of charts.

103
00:07:12.513 --> 00:07:17.792
And the place I'm getting this
from is Datawrapper Academy,

104
00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:23.083
which if you've never heard of them,
please check them out.

105
00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:28.202
They're really amazing.

106
00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:31.662
Well, their product is for journalism and

107
00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:36.374
helping build interactive
visualizations really easy,

108
00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:39.847
making that really easy for journalists.

109
00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:44.056
But they have this really good
section called Datawrapper Academy.

110
00:07:44.056 --> 00:07:47.673
And one of the things I really enjoy
about them is they'll write things like,

111
00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:50.023
what to consider when
creating choropleth maps.

112
00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:54.625
And they'll talk about when is the best
time to use them, how to make them better,

113
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.372
what are good examples, etc.

114
00:07:56.372 --> 00:08:00.707
And they'll have those for a few different
chart types that are easily misused.

115
00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:04.133
So I'm only going to be talking
about two of the ones that they've

116
00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:07.950
talked about today, but if you have
the chance, please check them out.

117
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.530
So for choropleths,
they are really best for

118
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.700
showing regional patterns and showing
only one variable in terms of the color.

119
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.030
And they're best for showing relative
data, so normalized across the population,

120
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.372
or else you're just going
to be showing population.

121
00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:32.179
I think this particular
example is unemployment rate.

122
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.261
It's colored by unemployment
rate by counties, I think.

123
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.576
And they're really not good for
subtle differences in the data,

124
00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:41.230
just because the color.

125
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.851
People can tell the difference
between different hues, but

126
00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:49.326
if it's really subtle changes in hue,
people can't tell them as easily.

127
00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:52.954
So not good for
subtle differences in data.
