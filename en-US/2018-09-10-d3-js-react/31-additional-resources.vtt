00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.990
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: A few last
notes about readability.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.410
We talked about axes before, the kinda
label, if you have one of those charts

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.752
that has an x-axis and a y-axis,
axes are really great.

4
00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:16.483
But if you have, like say if you have
visual mappings that are colors or

5
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:23.105
maybe you have that we were talking
about earlier that don't have axes.

6
00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:30.572
Legends are really, really important to
ensure the readability of your chart.

7
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.859
We are not going to talk about this today,
but

8
00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:39.397
definitely check out D3 legend which
makes drawing legends really easy and

9
00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:44.848
then also annotations are really
important because you might want to point

10
00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:51.240
out specific parts of your visualization
to have people pay attention to it.

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.640
And the cool thing is, for annotations,

12
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.670
it's also by Susie and
she has direct react support.

13
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.140
And so you can create any of these
annotations and put them directly

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.050
into your render function without having
to do the whole group element component

15
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.940
update or whatever thing, you can just
put them into your render function.

16
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.510
And so that's composable annotations.

17
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.042
Really, really cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

18
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:30.567
all of the other D3,
I guess packages that we looked at,

19
00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:35.566
do they have you think similar
things where you can just like use

20
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:41.110
like a remade React component?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I know that.

21
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.473
I have heard a lot about this

22
00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:50.026
which comes out of Airbnb and

23
00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:54.958
I think this one makes a bunch of

24
00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:00.838
things in d3 composable in React.

25
00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:06.903
Geo.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Shapes

26
00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:09.100
that we talked about.

27
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.960
And then this is some of the galleries
they have, so examples that they have.

28
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.860
So I know you can do that,
but I've never used it,

29
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.740
so I don't actually know
how flexible it is.

30
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.444
But it seems to be,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I

31
00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:32.004
think it seems to be just
passing the data, and

32
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:36.848
then it will draw things?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

33
00:02:36.848 --> 00:02:44.227
then there's also this one if you ever
want to check it out, is called Semiotic.

34
00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:50.945
And this is Elijah Meeks over at Netflix.

35
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:55.324
And this one is also I believe React.

36
00:02:55.324 --> 00:03:01.273
And this one is really interesting
because instead of organizing

37
00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:07.235
it as different charts that you
can put into React as components.

38
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:09.977
He does it as like layers.

39
00:03:09.977 --> 00:03:15.319
So layers of the visual elements or
like layers of bars or

40
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.311
layers of annotations or layers of axes.

41
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:24.097
And this one is all about being able to
quickly prototype as you're working with

42
00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:25.392
your stakeholders.

43
00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.255
So if your stakeholder is like,
I want to see my data this way.

44
00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:34.113
So this is supposed to allow you
to really quickly go from let's

45
00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:38.250
say a bar chart to a histogram or
something like that.

46
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.851
So this is, I read kind of

47
00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:47.102
his
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: His documents

48
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:52.502
on the philosophy behind it, and I'm
really a huge fan behind the philosophy,

49
00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:56.880
I just haven't personally been
able to test it out myself.

50
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.557
So these are the two that I tend to
recommend if you want to go with

51
00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:04.220
a charting library on top of React.
