00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:05.913
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Today I'm going to be doing
a workshop called Data Visualization for

2
00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:06.970
React Developers.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.640
I'm quite excited about this topic.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.210
I think it's like a few
years in the making for me.

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.155
But before we start I want to
introduce myself a little bit.

6
00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.135
My name is Shirley.

7
00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.645
This is a working title,
I'm basically a freelancer but

8
00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.295
I've been told that freelancer
has a bad connotation.

9
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:30.052
So, I'm trying to call myself
an independent creator of

10
00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.043
data visualizations.

11
00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:35.384
[LAUGH] Let me know how that sounds.

12
00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:42.234
I'm also a co-organizer
of the D3 user group.

13
00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:44.509
As well as a annual d3 unconference,

14
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.783
which we hopefully will be getting
to October or November of this year.

15
00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:53.398
And, like Mark said,
I've previously been an instructor

16
00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:57.105
at Frontend Masters, so
it's good to be back.

17
00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:02.332
And actually, so
I want this to be relatively casual, and

18
00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:07.490
interrupt me with questions
any time during the class.

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.380
I'm pretty all right with
getting back on track.

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640
[LAUGH] So ask me questions any time.

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.829
The whole point of this is that
you can get an understanding,

22
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.203
a good grasp of D3, Dataviz, React.

23
00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:27.077
So the goal of this workshop is to
use D3 to calculate the data and

24
00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:30.252
for React to render the visualizations.

25
00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:34.489
And the reason for
this is because I've been told over and

26
00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:38.373
over again at conferences,
like web conferences,

27
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:42.890
React conferences,
that there's a learning curve to D3.

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.870
And that it's a little bit intimidating
and they don't know where to start.

29
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.780
And I think a lot of it is because
of what is at the core of, well,

30
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.620
we all think that as the core of D3, which
is data binding and enter-update-exit.

31
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.240
And it's this kind of pattern
that helps you figure out,

32
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.220
based on your data, what elements,
what DOM elements to create?

33
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.018
What DOM elements to update?

34
00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:15.044
And what DOM elements to enter,
I mean sorry, exit or remove?

35
00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:18.550
And that's a little bit intimidating, but

36
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.951
the secret to it is actually that
enter-update-exit is basically

37
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:29.710
doing what the React virtual DOM
is doing underneath the hood.

38
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.678
So basically,
if we use React to do all the rendering to

39
00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:40.189
the DOM it means we're letting
React do all of the hard work.

40
00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.326
Whereas in D3,
we have to do it all ourselves.

41
00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:47.507
And so that's why I think that's kind

42
00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:52.137
of like,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The really big

43
00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:53.830
thing about this workshop.

44
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.023
Which is I knew we're going to talk
a little bit how to use React and

45
00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:00.260
D3 together.

46
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.048
But I'm not here to tell you, this is
the one way that you must use React in D3.

47
00:03:06.048 --> 00:03:09.384
Or this is the one way
that's the correct way.

48
00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:14.180
The goal of this workshop for me is
kind of teach you how easy it is to get

49
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.183
into data visualization and get into D3.

50
00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:20.767
If we just kind of strip away
the enter-update-exit part of D3, and

51
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.810
replace it with React,
and that's the first goal.

52
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.532
And the second goal is, I want to
teach you enough about the D3 API and

53
00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.902
library, and how to go around it.

54
00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:35.246
Or how to use it, so
that when you know when to use D3 and

55
00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:41.990
when to use React in your applications
when you're building data visualizations.

56
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.720
So yeah, that's my goal for today.
