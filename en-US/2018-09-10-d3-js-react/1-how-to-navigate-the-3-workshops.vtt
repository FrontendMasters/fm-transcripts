00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.229
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: By the end of tomorrow,

2
00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.876
we'll have three workshops
on Frontend Masters.

3
00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:10.355
And I kind of want to give my own personal
guideline on how to navigate through them.

4
00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:13.560
So the first one is the one
you're in right now.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.820
Data Visualization for React Developers.

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.341
And like I said, the goal for this is kind
of like a gentle introduction into D3 and

7
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:25.676
data visualization from
the perspective of a React developer.

8
00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:32.302
And then once you feel comfortable with
that, and if you want to dig more into D3,

9
00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:38.570
I have an intro to D3 course that I did
last year that covers what I mentioned.

10
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.530
The core of D3, the selection,
data binding, and enter, update, exit.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.293
So you can kind of know for
yourself how that part of D3 works.

12
00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:48.475
And finally tomorrow,

13
00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:51.913
I'm doing a workshop called
Building Custom Data Visualizations.

14
00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:56.257
That builds on top of
the Intro to D3 knowledge.

15
00:00:56.257 --> 00:01:00.675
And that one, I'm really excited for
because it's kind of, well,

16
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.965
like it says,
it's custom data visualizations.

17
00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:08.581
So that one I'm concentrating on
not only how to code custom data

18
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:14.234
visualizations that are a little bit
outside of the box of what D3 ships with.

19
00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:21.309
Andeverything that you see in the really
beautiful D3 example gallery.

20
00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:25.630
But not only just the code,
but the data exploration part.

21
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.603
So taking it from the data exploration
to the design and design principles,

22
00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:33.101
and then translating that into code.

23
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:37.580
So the whole process of
building a data visualization.

24
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.076
So those are my three workshops, and

25
00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:43.466
that's kind of the order
that I would recommend.
