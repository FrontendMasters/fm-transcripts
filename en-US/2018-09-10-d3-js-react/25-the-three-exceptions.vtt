00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.312
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think using React
to render, and D3 to calculate,

2
00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:09.494
is as simple as that,
as simple as those exercises.

3
00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:14.498
But what I do want to talk about, and
this is kind of the parts where React and

4
00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:16.976
D3 don't play so nicely together.

5
00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:20.451
So for all of the things over here,
in the first and second column,

6
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.822
these play really, really well with React.

7
00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.796
Because it's essentially D3
doing the calculation and

8
00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:29.840
returning a data object back to you.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.200
But the things that I've highlighted
in here, these four functions,

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.824
they need access to
the DOM to do their job.

11
00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:41.707
And so if you can imagine, React already
wants control of the whole DOM so

12
00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.428
that it can do its virtual DOM thing, and

13
00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:48.128
it can manage all of the updates and
changes to the DOM.

14
00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:53.102
And so when people say that D3 and
React don't play nicely together,

15
00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:57.743
they're talking about specifically
these few functionality,

16
00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:00.540
and actually also, the third column.

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.240
So the third column and these four,

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.740
because these are the D3 functionality
that needs direct access to the DOM.

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.170
We're going to actually go through
three out of four of these, and

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.911
I'll give you an example
of how these work.

21
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.978
But for these specific four
functions where D3 needs to do

22
00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:24.962
the rendering to the DOM,
the way that I usually do it is,

23
00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:28.870
I instantiate the D3 function
in componentDidMount.

24
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.810
I create a group container in render,
an SVG group container.

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.222
And then I place the D3
code in componentDidMount

26
00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:43.067
and/or componentDidUpdate.

27
00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:48.611
And the thing that I want to stress over,
and over, and over again is that if

28
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:54.595
you do decide that you need to use one of
these four functions with your React app.

29
00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:59.523
The thing I must stress over and
over again is never, ever, ever,

30
00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:04.119
ever let D3 and React manage
the same parts of the DOM, ever.

31
00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.667
Please, or
else you're going to get hideous bugs.

32
00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:12.533
I still remember four years ago when I
was doing D3 and React together, for

33
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.933
the first time ever.

34
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:18.633
And I sat there for a whole afternoon
trying to debug this super weird bug

35
00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:20.911
that I just couldn't figure out.

36
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:25.202
And it turned out it was because
D3 was updating this one

37
00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:28.952
attribute that React also
was trying to update.

38
00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:34.306
And then React was like,
no, and D3 was like, what?

39
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:37.058
And so, [LAUGH] it was not fun.

40
00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:40.510
It was traumatic enough that I
still remember it four years later.

41
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.250
So please never, ever let D3 and
React manage the same parts.

42
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.069
And that's why when you need
D3 to render something,

43
00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.812
you create a group container,
you give it a ref, you pass it to D3.

44
00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:56.601
D3 does everything within
that group container, and

45
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:59.460
React doesn't need to know about it.

46
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.978
So this is the section that's exceptions,
please proceed with caution, and

47
00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:06.860
please only do it if it's
absolutely necessary.
