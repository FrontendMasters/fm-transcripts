00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.280
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is what
we'll be building today.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.870
It's basically weather data for

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.834
San Francisco and
New York in the year of 2017.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.510
The data itself basically only has a date,
and the high temperature of that date,

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.320
low temperature of that date,
and the average of that date.

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.459
We will be building a variation of
this where there is a line chart,

7
00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:39.912
it started out as a bar chart but
no longer is a bar chart.

8
00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:44.477
And this one,
I've been calling it radio chart and

9
00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:49.270
someone else suggested
calling it a polar chart.

10
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.530
But we'll be building these three today
and we'll be using these to talk about

11
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.525
how to use d3,
how to use SVG canvas, and React.

12
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:03.007
I have Amsterdam in here too.

13
00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:08.607
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Also,
I don't know what happened on this day,

14
00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:10.110
where it dropped so low.
