&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And finally,

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.310
we weren't going to talk about basic
charts without talking about pie charts.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.228
[LAUGH] Pie charts get a lot of hate.

4
00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:11.650
People are like never use pie charts!

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.750
There is very specific use cases for
pie charts.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.710
They are really good visualizations.

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.460
It's like don't use pie charts for
most of the times except for asterisk,

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.140
the best for these parts.

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.289
Pie charts are for
hierarchical comparing part to whole.

10
00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.623
Again, Datawrapper has a really
great article about when to use and

11
00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:43.079
how to best improve a pie chart,
so please check that out.

12
00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.591
This is basically just
a little bit of their article.

13
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:53.430
They're best for when your values
are around 25%, 30% or 75%.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.640
And they're best for
if you're only trying to show three or

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.370
four parts, three or four slices.

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.447
Any less, if you have one or two,
then you don't need a pie chart.

17
00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:10.099
Any more than four makes it hard
to see the thinner slices and

18
00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:14.764
what you're trying to get
across with the thinner slices.

19
00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:18.219
They're not good for, like I said,
comparing fine differences, and

20
00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.706
they're not good for
if you have multiple totals.

21
00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:24.850
If you're trying to show multiple
pie charts next to each other for

22
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.255
whatever reason,
they're really not good for that.

23
00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:33.430
The Datawrapper article will talk about
better alternatives for those situations.

24
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.540
So that was a really quick run
through of basic chart types.
