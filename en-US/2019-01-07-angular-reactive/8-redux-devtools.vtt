00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.690
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And then I think in the div
it's saying like here's this new thing.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.280
So you can actually go and see

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.560
what is happening because now we're doing
it in one specific place and it's atomic.

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.256
And what is also cool is that
you can step backwards in time.

5
00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:19.900
So another we're gonna say,
let's just pop this object, but

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.255
it's actually an object off the stack.

7
00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.991
And so I could go all the way back and
play this forward.

8
00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:32.488
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And if I for instance,
now let's say I deleted this one.

9
00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:38.968
&gt;&gt; Lukas: And then let's say I went here,
and I updated this one.

10
00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:43.430
&gt;&gt; Lukas: We'll save this, so

11
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.550
now that we're seeing these actions
are moving through the system.

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.230
We'll go here and we'll go so we'll back
this out, back this out, back this out.

13
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.829
And then you can play it forward and
backwards.

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.330
So by now having your state in a single
place, and everything that's modifying

15
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.220
that state defined in a single action,
an object, that you can then stack in.

16
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.080
So if this object is going to modify
the entire state into a new state.

17
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.820
Well, if you know those actions somebody
could write them on a piece of paper.

18
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.250
This is a hypothetical scenario.

19
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.500
But somebody could sit down and
write in the right notation paper,

20
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.340
I could scan it using OCR.

21
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.910
Turn into text.

22
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.840
Side load it into an application.

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.820
And it would play those actions back.

24
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.257
And so by separating this out from the dom
and the response into an action and

25
00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:50.718
then the effect, this is when we're
able to start doing things like this.

26
00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:02.607
&gt;&gt; Lukas: To me, this is, [LAUGH] This
really changed everything for me.

27
00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:05.148
The ability to move forward,
and backwards, and

28
00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:08.364
know everything about my application
state at any given time.
