00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.389
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now that
we've defined the reducer,

2
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:11.810
let's hop into the state or
/index.ts file.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.607
So this is where we take our
feature level reducers and

4
00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:20.349
we combine them into a top level reducer.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.377
So the first thing that
we need to do is we'll

6
00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:31.478
just go import everything as fromProjects.

7
00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:45.022
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's update our

8
00:00:45.022 --> 00:00:47.340
entire application state.

9
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.840
So,

10
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.490
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So we'll go projects,

11
00:01:05.143 --> 00:01:08.029
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And from projects,

12
00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.582
ProjectsState.

13
00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:14.630
And so now we've almost just kind
of created a new table if you will.

14
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.020
Okay, here's some additional state or
the shape has changed.

15
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.770
And then obviously the reducers
is not super happy.

16
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.413
So then we'll go here and
we'll go projects

17
00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:31.688
fromProjects,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: projectsReducers.

18
00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:42.027
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
what we're gonna do is add in the feature

19
00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:47.412
reducer into,
basically a combined reducer.
