00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So the use case for
this is if you have a legacy.

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.820
Or an [INAUDIBLE] application
that's not using ngrx.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.870
It is kind of as you can see.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.940
There's a lot of kind of moving
pieces that you have to do

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.200
before you even get to the component.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.260
What you can do is create
a facade that will stand in place

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.980
of ngrx and communicate with the facade.

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.667
And so that may communicate with
your server directly, or whatever.

9
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:39.239
But then under the hood, then you start
to replace those pieces with ngrx.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.140
And so this is a really good way of,
I would love to use NGR racks, but

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.310
I don't really have the luxury of
tearing of the entire floorboards

12
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.930
from my application and gutting it and
then basically redoing everything.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.470
Because as you can see we've kind of
taken the entire project's component,

14
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.460
and kind of ripped it out and
put it back together.

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.840
Well now with a facade what you can
do is put that in place of NGR rex.

16
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.550
Communicate with the facade and
then piece it out is you're ready.

17
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.620
There's a situation now where we're
doing NGRX, but the backend isn't ready,

18
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.710
and so what we're doing is we're
simply putting a facade in.

19
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.640
We're feeding it in fake data,
and our components don't care.

20
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.890
And then, so it's a brand new application
but as we're building this out and

21
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.450
we're waiting for
some clarification from the back end,

22
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.400
is those pieces are pretty
much fundamentally decoupled.

23
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.930
And as we find here's a data concern, is
that we simply need to communicate it to

24
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.060
the facade and then whoever's working
on the other side of the facade.

25
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
Then it has an opportunity to say,
let's work with this.

26
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.740
And so now we're just taking mock data,
putting it in the facade.

27
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.170
And then once we validate the user flow,

28
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.880
then we move that into mock
services that we feed into NGRX.

29
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.220
And then once we're at that point,
then we once the back end's ready,

30
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.740
we flip the switch and we're good to go.

31
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.174
But by creating those
layers of abstraction,

32
00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:25.190
what you can do is when we
want to test the application,

33
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.910
because we've already built it out
with a mark back end, a mark data set.

34
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.870
Is that for instance when you
wanna do [INAUDIBLE] testing

35
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.960
that you can do it in a vacuum.

36
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.120
We are not doing it against a real server.

37
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.650
Is that you're just testing
the user flows in by feeding,

38
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.180
you know this data into NGRX,
which then feeds into your facade.

39
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.790
So it's just a way to create these nice
divisions where as you're working on

40
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.290
a piece you don't have to worry about the
implementation pieces on the other side.

41
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.480
And so
this is why I quite like facades and

42
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.720
where I really got hooked is I realized
that I don't have to do this all at once.

43
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.660
I can just, and you even saw how I was
implementing this, I'm picking it up and

44
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.930
I'm moving it into the facade.

45
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
It's almost like cut, copy, paste,
cut, paste, cut, paste or copy, paste.

46
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.900
Once it was there, then I just had to call
the facade and it was business as normal.

47
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.720
But then somebody could come along and
start to replace those things with NGRX.
