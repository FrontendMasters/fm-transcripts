00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:05.352
So guess what I'm gonna do for
you now, give you another thing to do.

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.327
So now you try it again, we're gonna
do the same exercise one more time.

3
00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:17.283
So here's your beginning code pen,
here's Mars again, and

4
00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:21.481
we're back to what we had here for
all of our numbers and so forth.

5
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.437
So what I want you to do this
time around is I want you to set

6
00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.183
up our layout with grid areas.

7
00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:31.994
So you gonna have five different areas.

8
00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:34.801
You've got this giant picture here, right?

9
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.468
You've got a giant picture here,
this one spanning two rows,

10
00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:40.206
Mars here spans two columns.

11
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.276
We have a couple of
images by themselves and

12
00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.914
we have a giant image down here at
the bottom that's spanning two columns.

13
00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:50.533
So you gonna need to come up with your
grid template areas that reflects

14
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:56.108
the design of this page, type that all out
and then assign those areas to the images.

15
00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.636
Great, so how did you do with
the grid template areas challenge?

16
00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:07.701
Hopefully that went okay for you,
let's go through my particular answer.

17
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.897
So here's what I have on the page.

18
00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:11.887
I have here grid template columns.

19
00:01:11.887 --> 00:01:13.713
I have 2fr, 1fr.

20
00:01:13.713 --> 00:01:16.522
It may confuse you that I'm
using grid template columns.

21
00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:19.853
In this case, I'm leaving it here to
make sure that I know that the first

22
00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:22.033
column is It's wider
than the second column.

23
00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.044
So I still wanna have that
extra width on my first column.

24
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:26.916
So I've put that in place.

25
00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:30.766
Then the second thing that I have
here are my grid template areas.

26
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.381
And we have different named spaces.

27
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:38.732
So this was sol 10,
this happen to be the Martian date,

28
00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:42.869
when this picture was taken was on sol 10.

29
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.563
So I've called this sol10 sol10.

30
00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:51.195
In other words, spanning across two
of those columns with the same name.

31
00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:54.328
Then we have the next row, okay?

32
00:01:54.328 --> 00:01:58.884
So I have Mars, which is,
obviously, that's Mars,

33
00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.756
stacked on top of each each other,

34
00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:06.426
so it's gonna occupy two rows,
one column, correct?

35
00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.538
And then we have media right and
we have microscope.

36
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:12.280
So that's what these
pictures are over here.

37
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.157
And then across the bottom,
I have intrepid in intrepid.

38
00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:20.630
So this picture down here will stretch
across the two columns because it has

39
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.553
the same name.

40
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:26.640
Then what we need to do once we've
established all of these names here in our

41
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.242
grid template areas, is we need to assign
those names to each one of the children.

42
00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:35.453
So where do we want each of
these children to display?

43
00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:40.499
So those names that we created up
here in our grid template areas,

44
00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:46.395
we then assign here in each of our
children using the grid area CSS property.

45
00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:49.808
And the value then are the names
that we gave those areas.

46
00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:52.438
And obviously, like salted and
Mars and intrepid,

47
00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.259
those are not values that
are in the CSS specification.

48
00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.504
You can call these grid template
areas anything you want.

49
00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:02.610
I called these by the names of
the pictures, you could have called them

50
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.204
Mary Sam and George and they would have
been perfectly happy to work out exactly

51
00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:11.125
the way that this dead provided that
you set it up the same kind of way
