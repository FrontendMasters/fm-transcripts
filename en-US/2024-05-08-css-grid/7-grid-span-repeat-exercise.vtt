00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:05.159
Okay, great, time for you to go ahead and
give the span syntax a try.

2
00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:08.266
So, we're gonna go back
to our Martian example.

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:13.476
If you go back to the beginning
CodePen here, all right?

4
00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:16.978
What I'd like for
you to do is refactor this code.

5
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.515
All of these numbers that are here.

6
00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:26.382
So, you don't have to change the HTML,
just refactor the numbers that we have

7
00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:30.388
here so that you're working with the span,
syntax, and grid.

8
00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:32.638
In other words,
nothing is gonna change on the page,

9
00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:34.892
it's gonna look exactly
the same when you're done.

10
00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:39.473
You are just changing the syntax
from numbers to working with span.

11
00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:47.100
Okay, so I'll just show you
what my CSS look like here.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.810
So for number one,
you could have said 1/ span 3, or

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.775
you could just say span 3,
it's already starting at 1.

14
00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:59.358
So in this particular case,
either one of those would work, so

15
00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:05.072
you could say 1/ span 3, or you could
say just span 3, either one of those.

16
00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:10.477
But for image number two,
we're starting in column number one.

17
00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:15.546
And then for the rows,
we start at two and we span over two,

18
00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:21.670
so I think two is Mars here,
if I'm not mistaken, yeah, two is Mars.

19
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.841
So we start at one and we span over
because this is one fat column.

20
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:31.849
So that's what's happening there.

21
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.764
For image number three,
I think it's this one, 1/span 2,

22
00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:40.936
four, we could just give it
the number of the column,

23
00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:45.045
would start at column two,
start at row number two.

24
00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:49.920
And then for five down here in the bottom,
we've rewritten this such

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.811
that it's number two and number three,
for where it starts, okay?

26
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.725
So this is just a simple conversion from
the numbers that we had before, like 1/3,

27
00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:03.358
2/3, we've just converted
them to the different syntax.

28
00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:07.134
Again, you can use whichever one of
these syntaxes make most sense to you.
