00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:05.271
Okay, great, time for you to go ahead and
give this span syntax a try.

2
00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.336
So we're gonna go back
to our Martian example.

3
00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:13.543
If you go back to the beginning
code pen here, all right?

4
00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:19.141
What I'd like for
you to do is refactor this code.

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.736
All of these numbers that are here,
so you don't have to change the HTML.

6
00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:26.966
Just refactor the numbers
that we have here, so

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.453
that you're working with
the span syntax in grid.

8
00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:32.748
In other words,
nothing is gonna change on the page,

9
00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:35.045
it's gonna look exactly
the same when you're done.

10
00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:39.298
You're just changing the syntax
from numbers to working with span

11
00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:47.219
Okay, so I'll just show you
what my CSS look like here.

12
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.213
So for number one, you could have said
1/span 3, or you could just say span 3.

13
00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:56.120
It's already starting at one,
so in this particular case,

14
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.660
either one of those would work.

15
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.700
So you could say 1/span 3, or

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.323
you could say just span 3,
either one of those.

17
00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:10.530
For image number two,
we're starting in column number 1.

18
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.871
And then for the rows,
we start at 2 and we span over 2.

19
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.474
I think two is Mars here,
if I'm not mistaken.

20
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:24.391
Yeah, two is Mars, so we start at 1 and

21
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:29.913
we span over because
this is one fat column.

22
00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:31.840
So that's what's happening there.

23
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.032
For image number three I think
it's this one, 1/ span 2.

24
00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:41.442
Four, we could just give it
the number of the column,

25
00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:46.538
which start at column 2,
start at row number 2, and then for

26
00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:52.239
five down here in the bottom we started,
do I have these out of order?

27
00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.350
I think I have these out of order.

28
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.629
In any case, we rewritten this so
such that it's,

29
00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.018
number two and
number three where it starts, okay?

30
00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:06.812
So this is just a simple conversion from
the numbers that we had before, 1/3,

31
00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:10.568
2/3, we've just converted
them to the different syntax.

32
00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:14.343
And again, you can use whichever one of
these syntaxes make most sense to you.
