WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:03.883
Now, once we have our pages
that are being laid out,

2
00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:08.805
we have some additional layout
considerations, as you see right now,

3
00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.414
we have 1 to 4 on the top 5 and
6 that are in the middle somewhere.

4
00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.829
There's big gaps between these things,

5
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.694
there's no gaps between other
elements that are here on the page.

6
00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:24.329
So why this and
how do we make it different?

7
00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.338
That's what these next
properties are all about.

8
00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:32.062
So I'm going to set my display to
flex my flex-flow to row wrap.

9
00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:38.780
And the next property we'll
look at is justify content.

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.805
So here for justifying content, this is
going to determine the distribution of

11
00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:48.905
all these little flex items, the li's,
in this case, within the container for

12
00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:53.706
the parent, this case, the ul, and
they're so-called on the main axis.

13
00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:55.996
What is the main axis?

14
00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.019
Anyone wanna take a guess at
what the main axis would be?

15
00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.209
&gt;&gt; Center the right.

16
00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:05.419
&gt;&gt; In this case it's the row,
because we've displayed

17
00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:10.279
flex-flow as row wrap,
if I said this as column,

18
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:14.237
where would justify content apply now.

19
00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:17.601
On the column, okay?

20
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:22.914
The main axis is the one that you
are specifying Justified in fle-flow,

21
00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:23.795
all right?

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.729
So justify content here,
we can say something like,

23
00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.609
these are all the fun ones,
all the fun properties here.

24
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.708
We could say flex-end,
that is gonna send us all the way

25
00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:46.495
over to the right so
now we have right aligned items.

26
00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.268
Guess what center is going to do?

27
00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:50.545
[INAUDIBLE].

28
00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:57.034
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go,
center all of our items in space, okay?

29
00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:01.403
And of course flex start as the default
property and that in this case, in our

30
00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:05.926
left to right world, it's gonna smash
everything over to the left hand side.

31
00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:10.360
So those are the easy ones,
start and center.

32
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.543
Then we have the ones that like,
make everybody think.

33
00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:19.822
So one of my favorite ones of those
that remain is space between.

34
00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:22.633
Anyone want to guess
what space between does?

35
00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.412
&gt;&gt; It's gonna put space
between each of the.

36
00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.015
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
this is going to take all the boxes,

37
00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.232
shove them all the way over to
the left and the right, and

38
00:02:32.232 --> 00:02:35.607
any extra space will go in
between each one of those boxes.

39
00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:36.935
So space between.

40
00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.195
So notice, 5 and 6, because there's
only two boxes in that row,

41
00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:46.457
there's a lot of space between them.

42
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:47.927
&gt;&gt; So it's like all justify.

43
00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:50.608
&gt;&gt; So it's all justified left and right.

44
00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:54.786
And any of that extra space which there
isn't much on that first row that will be

45
00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:57.330
placed evenly between
each one of those boxes.

46
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.125
So space between is generally the one
to use for like laying out nav-bars,

47
00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:07.150
occasionally you wanna use center, but
it's usually either space between or

48
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.432
center are the two that are going
to work for laying out a nav-bar.

49
00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:16.186
These other ones are also useful,
space evenly is another one.

50
00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:18.651
Anyone want to guess what
space evenly is going to do.

51
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:27.405
&gt;&gt; Now, even at the space
&gt;&gt; Even at the space on all sides,

52
00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:32.891
that's the key on all sides, so
if I say space evenly notice

53
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.937
that box number 1 is not quite
all the way to the left and

54
00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:43.139
box four is not quite all
the way to the right, see that?

55
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.690
So this is the downside to space evenly,
you might think, well,

56
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.449
why wouldn't we always use that?

57
00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.874
Because your designer friends
are gonna get mad that the edges of

58
00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:54.868
those boxes are not lining up correctly,
that's why.

59
00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:58.232
So space evenly looks great just
like this, but if you're really

60
00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:02.341
trying to align with other items on
the page, you probably want space between.

61
00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:06.078
Notice again that boxes 5 and
6, they are spaced evenly.

62
00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.353
That space to the left of 5,
to the right of 6, and

63
00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:11.880
in between those boxes is all the same.

64
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.611
Okay, then we have the mind-blowing one,
good times, is space around.

65
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:22.446
And I recommend just avoiding this one
because again this is one of the ones that

66
00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:27.353
I've never really needed to use in real
life, does anyone want to try to explain

67
00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:31.772
what's going on here for space around
&gt;&gt; The space around it is all even so

68
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:36.651
when you have two things like 5 and 6
like they add up together to make it look

69
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.718
like the space in between
them is twice as much.

70
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.775
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.

71
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:44.856
So, here we go.

72
00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:49.277
The space you can kinda see it
right here at 1 between 1 and

73
00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:54.075
the edge of its box and 4 and
the edge the edge of its box, okay?

74
00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.601
Right there, that is the space.

75
00:04:56.601 --> 00:05:03.128
So that's 1x,
the space in between here is 2x.

76
00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:08.117
So we have a space at the edge of 3 and
the space of the beginning of 4,

77
00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:08.986
all right?

78
00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:15.158
And likewise down here for number 5,
the space is right here and

79
00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:20.416
right here and as James was saying,
right in between,

80
00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:24.553
we have 2x, twice that space in between.

81
00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:26.950
So the hard part here is that, of course,

82
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.631
things don't line up on
the edges correctly.

83
00:05:29.631 --> 00:05:32.419
It makes your designer friends mad, and

84
00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.427
it's very confusing to remember that
we've got 2x between our boxes.

85
00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:42.318
And so, this is one that I just typically
avoid using when I'm working with flexbox.

86
00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:48.956
Space between and center are often
the two values that I use most.

87
00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:50.094
Any questions on that?

88
00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.202
Okay, cool.

89
00:05:56.202 --> 00:06:00.396
So I'm here to set my justify
content now to center, and

90
00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:03.528
I'm going to give you the next property.

91
00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:08.706
This one is align-items.

92
00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:12.646
Now, what is align-items do,
we're justifying our content.

93
00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:15.713
Aligning items just sounds like synonyms,
doesn't it?

94
00:06:15.713 --> 00:06:22.181
[LAUGH] it means exactly the same thing,
but we've just used different words.

95
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:25.982
So what is align-items mean and
how is it different than justify content?

96
00:06:29.374 --> 00:06:31.454
&gt;&gt; Stuff inside the boxes?

97
00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:34.700
&gt;&gt; It's not anything inside the boxes
&gt;&gt; Instead of like,

98
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.358
beginning in the end of the row or
like the, in this case the law left and

99
00:06:38.358 --> 00:06:40.162
the right, it's top and bottom.

100
00:06:40.162 --> 00:06:43.915
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so
this is the so-called cross axis.

101
00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:49.173
So whatever you have here in flex up flow,
that's our main axis, to the verge of

102
00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:54.996
the row, align-items is the cross axis, in
this case the column, up and down, okay?

103
00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:58.722
So how are we aligning these
things in that Cross-space.

104
00:06:58.722 --> 00:07:04.314
So if I said align-items center,
where are my boxes going to go?

105
00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:05.997
Anyone wanna make a prediction?

106
00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:06.734
&gt;&gt; In the middle.

107
00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:09.508
&gt;&gt; In the middle.

108
00:07:09.508 --> 00:07:14.683
So this is one of the favourites for
a lot of people justify content

109
00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:21.285
center align-items center to try to align
things in the middle of the page, okay?

110
00:07:21.285 --> 00:07:22.421
Yeah.

111
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:28.327
&gt;&gt; So, this is the first time we've
started doing any up or down adjustments.

112
00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.494
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I noticed that like 1 to

113
00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:34.362
4 are a specific amount of
space away from 5 and 6.

114
00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:35.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

115
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.008
&gt;&gt; What's the default there
that it's falling into.

116
00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:44.544
&gt;&gt; I think what you'll see is this
is 1x again above these boxes and

117
00:07:44.544 --> 00:07:48.350
1x is here and
this space in between is 2x.

118
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.133
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I mean even before
we added the align-items and

119
00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:54.891
still had a bunch of space in there,
think.

120
00:07:56.791 --> 00:07:57.909
You remember now?

121
00:08:00.277 --> 00:08:03.308
&gt;&gt; This space, what's going on here?

122
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:07.510
I think this space and
this space are the same.

123
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.185
So it's basically taken,
how much room do the boxes take up?

124
00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:18.207
Take whatever space is left over and
stick it in between evenly.

125
00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:21.403
&gt;&gt; It's because we've hard-coded
the height of the ul.

126
00:08:21.403 --> 00:08:22.925
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; 500 pixels.

127
00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:24.319
&gt;&gt; And that's part of it too.

128
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:28.425
We hard-coded the height of the ul and
we hard-coded the heights of our lis.

129
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.995
And the only reason to do that
ever is to do a demo like this, so

130
00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:34.586
that you can actually see what's going on.

131
00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:36.971
If I didn't hard-code these,

132
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:41.485
it would be very difficult to
see what was happening, yeah.

133
00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:48.394
Okay, so there's some other options here
for align-items that may be useful to you.

134
00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.590
I showed you center stretch
is always a good one.

135
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.764
What is stretch gonna do?

136
00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:55.887
Fill the space.

137
00:08:55.887 --> 00:08:58.596
Cool, probably cause I have a hard-coded.

138
00:08:58.596 --> 00:08:59.642
&gt;&gt; The high.

139
00:08:59.642 --> 00:09:04.088
&gt;&gt; High is hard-coded,
what happens if I take the high out?

140
00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:08.649
There we go,
that's what we would expect, okay?

141
00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:13.406
So stretch is going to stretch them unless
you have the high hard-coded in which case

142
00:09:13.406 --> 00:09:17.026
A shame on you and B, [LAUGH] it's
not going to do what you expect.

143
00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:21.041
There's some other ones that are here,
you're welcome to experiment with them, so

144
00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:24.627
flex-start, flex-end, space between,
space around, space evenly.

145
00:09:24.627 --> 00:09:27.235
I don't feel like I really need
to go through all of these,

146
00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:30.441
they're the same kind of values that
you just had for justify content.

147
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:32.864
Now we're gonna look at them in the space.

148
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.798
Make sense?

149
00:09:35.798 --> 00:09:38.948
Okay, so
all of these properties obviously,

150
00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:43.247
cuz they're on the ul are all
properties of the parent, okay?

151
00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:45.838
Let's take a look at the children now.

152
00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:49.925
So what we're going to do for
the children,

153
00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:53.026
let me just pull up the HTML here.

154
00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:57.780
We have two children that
have a class of flex2, okay?

155
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.784
Just so that you know that,
that is a thing.

156
00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:05.389
And so what I can do here is if I said,
flex2,

157
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:10.481
my class of flex2,
let's say border 2 pixels,

158
00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:15.210
dotted blue, and
it's gonna put a blue border

159
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.564
around this two items so
that you know what they are.

160
00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:25.060
I'm gonna make it fatter,
5 pixels so you can see it, okay?

161
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.394
Those are the two items that
have that class of flex 2.

162
00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:32.317
Now what we can do is we can
change the order of things here.

163
00:10:32.317 --> 00:10:37.015
So right now these, of course are in the
order that they appear in the allies 1,

164
00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:40.958
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 but
we can also reorder things here in space.

165
00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.589
So we could say, for

166
00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:49.295
example, order: 1;.

167
00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:52.594
That's actually going to
move our boxes to the end.

168
00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:58.550
All of the boxes that have that class
of flex2, they will go to the end.

169
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.726
Weird, right?

170
00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.556
&gt;&gt; Start at 0?

171
00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.140
&gt;&gt; It starts at 0.

172
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.802
So by default everybody has an order of 0.

173
00:11:06.802 --> 00:11:09.975
Sometimes we can't like humans and
sometimes we can't like engineers.

174
00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:13.979
I'm sorry, I wish we could just
count one way all the time.

175
00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:18.717
But, so anyway, so those boxes up
there are zeros and this is ones and

176
00:11:18.717 --> 00:11:20.771
that's why they come later.

177
00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:24.956
Okay, you could make those
numbers anything you want.

178
00:11:24.956 --> 00:11:29.562
If we make this -1, they move to

179
00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:34.166
the start, as you might expect,

180
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:40.097
because -1 comes before 0, all right?

181
00:11:40.097 --> 00:11:44.828
Now another property that we
can add here is flex-basis.

182
00:11:44.828 --> 00:11:47.730
And flex-basis is one that
people always forget about.

183
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.965
You always think about width, right?

184
00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:54.309
So if I said for my lis, if I said

185
00:11:54.309 --> 00:11:59.822
the width was 25%, there we go.

186
00:11:59.822 --> 00:12:03.379
So pretty, very gridlike, yes?

187
00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:07.562
But we have just killed all of
the flex in our flex boxes.

188
00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:12.634
Because with width,
those boxes will never be 24.9%,

189
00:12:12.634 --> 00:12:18.905
they will never be 25.1%,
they will always be 25.00000%.

190
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:22.804
They actually don't flex at all even
though we're working with percentages.

191
00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:27.920
So flex-basis is the appropriate dimension

192
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.502
to work with for quote with, all right?

193
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:37.288
And the reason why is
because flex-basis is we're

194
00:12:37.288 --> 00:12:41.527
going to make these 25% kind of, kind of.

195
00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:43.783
So sometimes they may
be a little bit less,

196
00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:46.678
sometimes they might be a little bit more,
all right?

197
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.702
And again, this is a little bit artificial
because I've got some stuff that's

198
00:12:50.702 --> 00:12:51.855
hard-coded in here.

199
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.936
So anytime you feel compelled to reach for
width and

200
00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:58.529
you're working with flexbox,
use flex-basis instead.

201
00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:04.475
&gt;&gt; So if Flex-direction is at column and
then flex-basis will be the height?

202
00:13:04.475 --> 00:13:07.019
&gt;&gt; Yes.

203
00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:10.134
Flex-basis, applies to the main axis, yes.

204
00:13:10.134 --> 00:13:11.179
Not the cross axis.
