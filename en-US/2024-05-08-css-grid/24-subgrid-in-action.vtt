1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.878
If we go back to our pictures
of all of our planets and

2
00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:08.060
moons here and
the work that we were doing earlier today.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.470
I'm gonna open this up, I think I, no,
I did not kill the media queries yet.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.501
Okay, so this is one of the ones where
we wanted to try to get things to align,

5
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:25.595
and it's particularly noticeable
when we get here to 700 and

6
00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:31.753
then 500 pixels, where the alignment
issues become really noticeable.

7
00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:39.009
So if I make my screen like,
I've got it like 525 pixels wide here,

8
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.014
you really see what's going
on with these cards, okay?

9
00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:47.608
And here we have cards that
are basically the same kinds of height.

10
00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:53.009
So at 500 pixels here with
this example that we were

11
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:58.982
doing earlier today,
we have the following going on.

12
00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:03.944
We have our card container here,
we have template columns that are 1fr and

13
00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:08.854
1fr, that's giving us our two
columns with each of the cards.

14
00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:13.188
To this I am going to add some rows,

15
00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:16.625
I'm gonna add three rows,

16
00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:21.710
grid-template-rows: repeat(3,

17
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.231
1fr;), Okay?

18
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.323
And so all I've done so

19
00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:33.012
far is just call out that there's three
rows here in the design, all right?

20
00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:37.478
That doesn't do anything for
us, that's just where we start,

21
00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:41.625
it doesn't do anything until
we go here to our card itself.

22
00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:48.524
And now instead of displaying block,
I'm gonna go back and

23
00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:51.943
have to display this as grid,
in order for this to work.

24
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:59.804
I'm going to say grid-template-rows,

25
00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:06.298
columns, sorry, grid-template-columns,

26
00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:12.158
1fr, grid-template-rows: subgrid,

27
00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:17.242
okay, and then grid-row: span3.

28
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.711
All right,
don't worry about the featured card,

29
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.379
we're gonna look down here
a little bit further.

30
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:34.152
We've got our border, we've got our
padding, we've got our border radius,

31
00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:38.523
and then I am going to add
to this align-items-start.

32
00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:46.618
That's gonna put the headline
up at the top of the card, and

33
00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:50.232
then I'm gonna have to
override what came before.

34
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:54.463
So the reason why at 500 pixels we had set
these cards to display: block was because

35
00:02:54.463 --> 00:02:58.132
we had a different layout with two
columns when we were working on mobile.

36
00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:02.716
And that's why this looks so weird right
now because this is pulling in those

37
00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:07.657
mobile definitions that we had in terms of
the image on the left and the headline and

38
00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:10.979
the button on the right or
the other way around.

39
00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.769
And now what we need to do is get
these to stack on top of each other.

40
00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.844
So we need to add those styles, and

41
00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:25.969
I am going to add .card h2 { grid-row:

42
00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:31.575
1/2; grid-column: 1/2}.

43
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:36.632
For my card image, I'm going to tell it

44
00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:41.997
to go to grid-row 2/3 grid-column,

45
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:48.538
1/2, there we go, looking much better.

46
00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:53.497
And now when we don't have cards that
have all radically different heights,

47
00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:57.461
that have similar kind of heights
to them in terms of content,

48
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:02.269
you can see how nicely sub-grid is doing
here lining up those headlines and

49
00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.893
the images and the buttons underneath.

50
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:07.787
See how well that's working, look so

51
00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:13.039
much cleaner than what we had before,
much, much prettier, okay?

52
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:17.424
All right,
our featured item here is still a mess, so

53
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:22.958
we would need to fix this up,
in order to get that working as well.

54
00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.808
So what are the solutions here for
all of these featured styles?

55
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:31.608
Remember that the order often matters
in CSS in what overrides what.

56
00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:35.517
We have our featured styles up
here early in our media query,

57
00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:38.842
where before they were working just fine.

58
00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:43.891
But in fact, because our featured card
has two classes on it, it has featured

59
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:49.262
class and the card class on it, and
those have equal levels of specificity.

60
00:04:49.262 --> 00:04:53.817
What's happening is that, we set things
up working correctly here on the featured

61
00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:57.329
card and then we override that
with the actual card display, and

62
00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.750
that's where our featured card is broken.

63
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.850
So the fix for this is to take
our featured styles, cut them,

64
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.865
and we're gonna scroll on down here and we
are going to paste these just after that.

65
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:17.865
And that did not work,
wow, look at that, cool.

66
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.038
Then the next thing we're gonna have to
do is we're gonna have to change some of

67
00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:22.739
the numbers here.

68
00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.759
So for my grid-row,
we're gonna change this from 1/2 to 1/5,

69
00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.379
that's gonna help a lot.

70
00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.344
Our grid column is still 1/3,

71
00:05:34.344 --> 00:05:38.876
all the other things are all good, and

72
00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:45.248
then I'm gonna add to this
.feature p:last-child

73
00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:50.927
{grid-row: 4/5; margin-top: 0}.

74
00:05:50.927 --> 00:05:55.871
So that's gonna move my paragraph
into the correct position.

75
00:05:57.181 --> 00:06:00.124
Okay, so my bottom cards,
still looking great.

76
00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:04.014
My top card has got
a lot of big gaps on it.

77
00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:10.170
And so the final thing that I'm
going to do here to tighten some of

78
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.304
this stuff up is up here on my
card container for my grid rows.

79
00:06:16.304 --> 00:06:21.307
What I'm going to do is
go to 0.2fr 1fr 0.5fr,

80
00:06:21.307 --> 00:06:25.978
and that's gonna tighten
everything up nicely,

81
00:06:25.978 --> 00:06:29.439
especially up here on this top card.

82
00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.580
It gives me a nice pretty little gap
before my button down here at the bottom.

83
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.370
And then the rest of these cards
are all aligned really nicely and well.

84
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.810
This is looking so much better
than what it did before, isn't it?

85
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.896
Really pretty, okay.

86
00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:47.300
The next thing we wanna do is
test this by making it bigger,

87
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.972
make sure we go to our next breakpoint.

88
00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:54.862
Remember that the sub-grid is gonna
carry over in our media queries

89
00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:56.822
to our later layouts.

90
00:06:56.822 --> 00:07:00.306
So these are actually all lined up and
looking really great just by themselves,

91
00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:02.761
there's very few changes
we need to make here.

92
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:07.396
We'd already made the major change,
which was to add the extra column as we go

93
00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:10.981
to the wider grid display, so
there it is there on the page.

94
00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:16.370
And when we go to our larger sizes here,

95
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.950
we have a big problem here
with the earth image.

96
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.192
And the issue is that
we have the feature and

97
00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:29.507
the card taking up the same number
of rows, because remember before we

98
00:07:29.507 --> 00:07:35.701
had our features spanning over three
rows and each card took up one row.

99
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:38.578
Now we have each card
taking up three rows, so

100
00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:41.314
our feature needs to
take up how many rows?

101
00:07:44.014 --> 00:07:47.874
If each card is taking up three rows and
we want three of those cards,

102
00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:50.264
how many rows should the feature take up?

103
00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:55.484
3 times 3 would be 9 rows.

104
00:07:55.484 --> 00:08:00.263
So what we would need to do here
when we get to our 900 pixels?

105
00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:04.568
Find it, there it is.

106
00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:11.109
When we get to our 900 pixels,
what we're going to do here for

107
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:17.185
our card is we're gonna add
this code grid-row: span 1.

108
00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:20.373
[LAUGH] And
that actually fixes all of our problems.

109
00:08:20.373 --> 00:08:24.892
Because we don't really have an issue
here with all the layouts going on here.

110
00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:27.552
These are actually
working all pretty well,

111
00:08:27.552 --> 00:08:31.612
by changing all of our cards back to
spanning only one row from three,

112
00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:35.392
then they'll snap back into
the layout that we had originally.

113
00:08:36.712 --> 00:08:41.074
That's the only thing I added here,
I just told the cards to span one column

114
00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:44.898
instead of spanning three, and
then the layouts all work again.

115
00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.908
Okay, so that was a really
nice way to enhance this.

116
00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:54.888
This is a really great looking layout now,
things look really wonderful.

117
00:08:54.888 --> 00:08:59.658
As we get it smaller,
they continue to line up and look really,

118
00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:04.547
really pretty,
your designer friends are so happy.

119
00:09:04.547 --> 00:09:08.477
Like, wow, this is really great,
look at all that, okay.

120
00:09:08.477 --> 00:09:11.492
And when we get to very small,
everything is still looking good.

121
00:09:11.492 --> 00:09:16.760
It was looking good before, we actually
didn't apply sub-grid to this dimension,

122
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.406
this is exactly what we had coded earlier.

123
00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:24.883
And then sub-grid is taking over here for
these later dimensions, okay?
