1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.005
So at this point, we've done extensive
discussions about laying out web pages,

2
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.370
media queries, grid based layouts.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.784
We've neglected the third
component of responsive design,

4
00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.750
which are responsive images.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.234
So I wanted to be sure to give you
an overview of responsive images and

6
00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:22.114
what is available to us today in the HTML
specific that might be helpful for

7
00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:23.968
your next project.

8
00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:29.278
So let us start with,
in the old days when things were easy.

9
00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:34.000
In the old days, all we had to do was take
an image, we'd throw it up on the screen,

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.051
and we'd say something like our image
source and an alt text for that.

11
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:39.648
Isn't that great?

12
00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:42.987
It was a beautiful world with unicorns and
rainbows.

13
00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:46.257
Unfortunately, that day
is no longer with us.

14
00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:49.787
Now we have a lot of things that we have
to think about with responsive images.

15
00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:52.887
These are images that are gonna
change across devices.

16
00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.817
So first of all, content choices.

17
00:00:55.817 --> 00:00:59.877
Some pictures look great when they're big,
but when they go tiny, you're like,

18
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:01.377
what am I looking at?

19
00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:03.897
So that is something to think about.

20
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.407
We have so many formats for
images these days.

21
00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:09.929
You have to think about what
are the appropriate formats for

22
00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:11.587
those particular images.

23
00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:13.607
You may have to think about pixel density.

24
00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.917
Remember that we have retina devices,
non-retina devices.

25
00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:19.147
So what are the density of the pixels?

26
00:01:19.147 --> 00:01:22.323
We have to think about the image
display dimensions and

27
00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:27.000
we have to think about who is going to
choose the image that will display.

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.849
Are you the webpage
author going to choose or

29
00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:33.260
are we gonna let the browser
make the choice?

30
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.890
So those are all the big questions.

31
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.560
In fact, this has gotten so complicated,
there is a whole book on this.

32
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.511
This is Image Optimization by
Addy Osmani from Google, and

33
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.484
it's a good sized book
with a lot of stuff in it.

34
00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:51.604
So if you're really into it,
I recommend you go get the book.

35
00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:56.639
So, just briefly about how
responsive images have come to be,

36
00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:03.764
wasn't even a thing we never thought about
it prior to about 2010 when Ethan Marcotte

37
00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:10.899
defined responsive images as part of his
article on Defining Responsive Design.

38
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.849
Between 2010 and 2014,
it was just an unmitigated disaster.

39
00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.589
We had no HTML specification for
dealing with responsive images.

40
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:25.212
We had back end solutions, with tests and
back end images being served up.

41
00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.024
We had weird JavaScript solutions.

42
00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.822
We had all kinds of craziness going on.

43
00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:31.642
Finally, we got our standards defined.

44
00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:37.661
Around 2014 or 2015, 2016, the picture
elements started to be supported and

45
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:40.721
by 2017 we got source set and sizes which.

46
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:43.351
Which are attributes that
go with the image element.

47
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.461
So we're gonna talk about picture and
source set and sizes coming up here.

48
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:53.625
As always, the prime directive always
the prime directive only one image should

49
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.071
load even if many are specified.

50
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:59.706
So it is possible that you may have two or
three or four or

51
00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:04.607
five different images that might load
depending on certain conditions,

52
00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:08.782
but we only want one of those
images loading into the browser.

53
00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:13.667
We don't wanna make the situation worse by
loading five images into the browser and

54
00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.707
then only displaying one of them.

55
00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:18.832
That adds a lot of weight
to your webpages, right?

56
00:03:19.902 --> 00:03:23.721
Okay, so here's some bad code for you.

57
00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:27.394
And if you take a look at
this over here on the side,

58
00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:31.221
we have a div with a class
of fake-responsive.

59
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:34.481
We have two images here, tiny and big.

60
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:39.751
And then we're going to use CSS and media
queries to display one of those images.

61
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.371
This is really bad.

62
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.401
Okay, and the reason this is really bad,
because why?

63
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.361
Anyone wanna take a guess, yes.

64
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.248
&gt;&gt; Marquee.

65
00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:52.431
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; The Marquee is a great start.

66
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.771
What else would be another, yes.

67
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.041
&gt;&gt; Maybe the naming conventions?

68
00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.891
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily naming conventions.

69
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.078
&gt;&gt; It loads both images.

70
00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:04.708
&gt;&gt; It loads both images and
then only displays one.

71
00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:09.128
And remember, we are the only crazy
people who do this with webpages.

72
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:11.774
Normal people do not do this, right?

73
00:04:11.774 --> 00:04:14.568
So this is not really the way to do this.

74
00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:20.781
Cautiously, you could do something like
this where you have big kind of image and

75
00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:25.064
then we're going to set a max width
on that big image, a big image,

76
00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:29.632
meaning let's download it off my
mobile phone and it's this big.

77
00:04:29.632 --> 00:04:32.042
We're gonna display it
this big on the page.

78
00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.532
What is the downside of doing that, yes.

79
00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:37.062
&gt;&gt; Mobile phones have tiny connections.

80
00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:40.582
&gt;&gt; Well, yes, they have tiny connections,
not a lot of data going through.

81
00:04:40.582 --> 00:04:47.021
So what happens here is,
how many megabytes is this picture?

82
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.392
&gt;&gt; 3.
&gt;&gt; 3, 6, 9 megabytes, right?

83
00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:51.512
And we're displaying it this big.

84
00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:54.082
What is the file size here?

85
00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:55.482
&gt;&gt; Kilobytes.

86
00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:57.256
&gt;&gt; It's the same file size.

87
00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:58.959
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; When we scale it this way,

88
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.605
it is the same file size, right?

89
00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:04.528
Unless you take it out and you run it
through Photoshop and you reduce the size

90
00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:09.701
of the image, you have the same bytes no
matter what dimensions you display, right?

91
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.191
Okay, so that is not necessarily
the best way to go about it.

92
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:17.471
You would be right to point out that
we have done it throughout this course

93
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:17.971
[LAUGH].

94
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:21.606
That we have had our images
all set to max width and

95
00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:24.718
they have scaled also nicely on the page.

96
00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:29.951
We are not very concerned with performance
of all of our various code pens, right?

97
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.238
So it depends on the situation.

98
00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:35.382
This can be useful if you
are working with smaller images,

99
00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:39.248
maybe they were only whatever,
40, 50k to start with.

100
00:05:39.248 --> 00:05:42.357
We don't really need to worry about
swapping out responsive images.

101
00:05:42.357 --> 00:05:46.245
But if you are using a great big, huge,
beautiful banner across the top of

102
00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:50.323
the page on your desktop site and you
are reducing its size on the mobile site,

103
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:54.188
this is a great time to start
thinking about responsive images.

104
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:58.498
Okay, so
the first one is the picture element.

105
00:05:58.498 --> 00:05:59.663
And this is you,

106
00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:05.520
the web page author are in control of
which image displays at which time.

107
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.460
So let's consider we have here our
beautiful balloon picture, so pretty.

108
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.030
Now we could turn this into
multiple kinds of images.

109
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.801
Obviously, we could take that
big beautiful picture and

110
00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:20.640
we could just simply reduce
its size inside of Photoshop.

111
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:29.085
So there it is small or we could just crop
it to one specific focus of this webpage.

112
00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:33.826
So here I'm focused on the balloons or
at bottom image is you might not

113
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:38.321
have even noticed that in the main
image as you were looking at it,

114
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:41.040
that tells a totally different story.

115
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.400
And then the other images
that are here on this page.

116
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.165
So through the magic of Photoshop and
similar tools, you could just

117
00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:54.120
crop your images to different dimensions,
different compositions.

118
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.450
And then we'll put them into the web page.

119
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.530
So here,
this is the picture element in action.

120
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.847
So let's talk about
what's here on this page.

121
00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:07.237
As you see, we start with picture and
we end with /picture, it's HTML.

122
00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:12.057
The second line there is
the image element itself.

123
00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.797
This is the default.

124
00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:17.899
So for whatever reason, the browser
doesn't support the picture elements or

125
00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:19.077
whatever else.

126
00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:22.447
This is the image that will display,
that bottom image.

127
00:07:22.447 --> 00:07:26.307
The one on top of it is
the one that says source.

128
00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:31.516
Source as the HTML element,
src as the source of the image, and

129
00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:38.257
then you'll see we have a media
attribute in which we put a media query.

130
00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:42.363
So guess when this image
is going to display?

131
00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:43.875
&gt;&gt; When you have more
than 850 pixels of width,

132
00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.528
&gt;&gt; if you have more than 850 pixels of

133
00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:49.503
width, you'll see the top image.

134
00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:53.696
Otherwise you're going to see
the bottom image, make sense?

135
00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:57.113
&gt;&gt; So
this is in contrast to loading two images.

136
00:07:57.113 --> 00:08:00.913
This is only loading one
depending on the media size.

137
00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:02.134
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

138
00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:04.878
&gt;&gt; So if you're loading on your phone or
your desktop?

139
00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:08.020
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the browser knows
how big your view port is and

140
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.644
whatever device you're looking at.

141
00:08:10.644 --> 00:08:15.424
If you're over 850 pixels wide,
the browser will request the big image.

142
00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:18.904
If you're less than that,
the browser will request the little image.

143
00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:19.522
Okay, and guess what?

144
00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:23.064
You can have multiple source elements.

145
00:08:23.064 --> 00:08:25.734
I've only showed you two here
to keep this really simple.

146
00:08:25.734 --> 00:08:27.414
Guess how many source
elements you can have?

147
00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:31.444
A ridiculous number.

148
00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:34.027
Okay, far more than you require.

149
00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:40.034
[LAUGH] Okay, all right, so there
are other ways you could deal with this.

150
00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:46.371
You could say that rather than using a min
width or max width style media query,

151
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:51.391
you can actually do tests
like orientation landscape.

152
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:55.813
So the orientation landscape
test to see if the width is

153
00:08:55.813 --> 00:08:59.241
greater than the height of the web page.

154
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:00.851
That is the test for landscape.

155
00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:05.687
And if that's If that's true,
it'll load the appropriate image, okay?

156
00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:07.427
So that's another way you could do this.

157
00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:10.576
We haven't talked a lot about all
the other kinds of media queries,

158
00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:13.187
but that's an alternative
kind of media query, okay?

159
00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:20.087
You can also use this kind of test for
different types of images.

160
00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:23.755
So WebP at this point is fairly
well supported but if for

161
00:09:23.755 --> 00:09:28.383
some reason you are supporting older
browsers than most people, and

162
00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:33.086
WebP is not supported by those browsers,
you can do a test here to say,

163
00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:36.725
basically, the first image
will load if it's WebP.

164
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.624
And if your browser supports WebP.

165
00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:44.269
If the browser doesn't know what it is,
it'll skip over that and

166
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:46.209
it'll go to the landscape.png.

167
00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:49.359
And if it still doesn't know what that is,
for whatever reason,

168
00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.351
it will go on to the fallback
image at the end.

169
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:54.976
So there's three different ways
that you might wind up working with

170
00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:55.861
the picture element.
