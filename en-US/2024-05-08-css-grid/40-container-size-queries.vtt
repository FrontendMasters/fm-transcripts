1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.372
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

2
00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:04.074
I have a couple of things
here to start you off with.

3
00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:07.441
First of all is
the reference CodePen here.

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:12.180
We are gonna build this exact
same item that we built

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.710
earlier in the grid layout
using media queries.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
We had all of these cards here.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.966
I've removed that titles that
we had down here in the bottom.

8
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:26.102
So we just have these five
cards in this crazy layout, and

9
00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:29.446
they do change over space and time.

10
00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.726
Okay, so
this is what we did with media queries.

11
00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:36.626
And now we're gonna try rebuilding
the same thing with container queries.

12
00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:39.583
So let me show you here what I'm talking.

13
00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:43.247
When we take a look at this
design here in this demo,

14
00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:47.445
we have several different layouts for
our cards, right?

15
00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:52.075
If we go all the way down small,
here's one layout for the card.

16
00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:58.305
If we get a little bit bigger,
here's a second layout for the card.

17
00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:00.809
Looks like this, okay?

18
00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.349
We get a little bit bigger still,
here's a third layout for the card, right?

19
00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.799
And I think actually down here,
I missed one.

20
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.739
Here's a fourth layout for
the card, make sense?

21
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.789
Four different card layouts, and
I put them all in one slide here for you.

22
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.649
So the difference with container
queries versus media queries,

23
00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.923
with media queries we were concerned
how wide the viewport was, and

24
00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:28.007
we adjusted everything to that viewport.

25
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.814
Now we're gonna turn that mental
model around, and we're gonna say,

26
00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:36.051
let's just build cards that
look this way at one dimension,

27
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:39.669
this way at another dimension,
this way at another dimension, and

28
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:43.689
this way at another dimension, and
we'll just plug those into our pages.

29
00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:48.585
So in other words, the media queries
are not doing anything to change the way

30
00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:52.416
the cards look, depends on the size of
the hole where the cards are fitting.

31
00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.156
So that kind of makes sense?

32
00:01:56.838 --> 00:02:00.341
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
well let's try building some of this and

33
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:02.100
we'll see how it goes.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.400
All right, so in our beginning CodePen,
what we're going to do is the following.

35
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.110
Here in our CSS, nothing is
different than what we had earlier.

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.630
We have a series of articles,
these are each cards.

37
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.190
They are inside of a div
with a class of photo cards.

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.252
Basically, all the things
that we looked at earlier.

39
00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:27.482
So now what we're going
to do is the following.

40
00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:31.117
We are going to set this up for .card.

41
00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.824
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: By the way,
just so you know,

42
00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:38.006
I've removed all
the formatting from before.

43
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.215
This is just the HTML that's here, okay?

44
00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:45.025
So there's no media queries or
anything here in our starting code.

45
00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:51.888
What I'm going to do is give this
a container name of card and

46
00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:58.911
I'm gonna give it a container
type of inline-size, okay?

47
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:02.492
So this is the way you're gonna
start all of your container queries.

48
00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:05.017
You're gonna give the container a name.

49
00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.200
In this case, it's a card, so
we might as well just keep the same name.

50
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.045
Although you could call
it whatever you wanted.

51
00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:15.315
If you wanted to call this George,
feel free, it's your documentation.

52
00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:18.280
Okay, and
then container-type of inline size,

53
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.455
that is something you are always
going to use with container queries.

54
00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:27.104
There may potentially be other values in
the future, but at this point in time,

55
00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:30.995
there is only one that makes any sense,
and that is this one inline-size.

56
00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:33.534
What is inline-size?

57
00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:36.669
Because this is a trend that
we have going on in CSS.

58
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.371
Do you know what is the inline-size?

59
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.601
The opposite of which is the block-size.

60
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:46.261
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like the height of a row?

61
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.791
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, you're on the right
track, you're on the right track.

62
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:57.446
According to logical properties,
which is a whole new CSS spec,

63
00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:02.578
the original CSS was written with
left to right in mind, right?

64
00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:05.084
Cuz it was written by
people who spoke English,

65
00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:10.058
people who spoke European languages, most
of which all go from left to right, okay?

66
00:04:10.058 --> 00:04:11.122
But as you know,

67
00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:15.668
there are many people in the world
who read right to left languages.

68
00:04:15.668 --> 00:04:19.444
There are people who read vertical
languages, especially like in Japan and

69
00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:21.108
Mongolia, and so forth.

70
00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:25.868
So what the W3C has been trying
to do is to get left, right,

71
00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:28.546
top, and bottom out of our code.

72
00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:35.532
So inline for us in the left to
right world, inline is basically

73
00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:41.622
like widths in the horizontal plane and
block is vertical, okay?

74
00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:46.778
If we went to a vertical world,
inline would be the across and

75
00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:53.261
block is still up and down, but it just
changes the perspective of the text.

76
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:55.597
It kind of makes sense vaguely?

77
00:04:55.597 --> 00:05:00.151
Yeah, it's a lot to wrap your head
around but when you see inline-size,

78
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:03.022
just think, okay, that's my left to right.

79
00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:07.487
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's still kind of related
to the flexbox, flexstart, flexend,

80
00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:08.829
not left and right.

81
00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:10.804
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly, the start and

82
00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.860
that's all part of logical properties,
yeah.

83
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.254
Okay, so,
now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna

84
00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:22.910
focus my designs here on the cards only.

85
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.544
I'm not gonna worry about where the cards
are placed in space, I just wanna make

86
00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:32.473
changes to how these cards look depending
on essentially the width of my container.

87
00:05:32.473 --> 00:05:37.492
Now my width of my container at the moment
is going to be the width of my screen.

88
00:05:37.492 --> 00:05:39.610
That just happens to be a coincidence for

89
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.283
the way that I'm coding this right now cuz
of course, I have all these cards here.

90
00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:47.093
They are as wide as their
parent which is photocards.

91
00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:48.313
How wide is photocards?

92
00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:50.103
It's the width of the screen.

93
00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:53.543
So everybody is as wide as
the screen at the moment.

94
00:05:53.543 --> 00:06:02.097
I am gonna squash this all the way down to
like 215 pixels to take a look at this.

95
00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:05.970
And we're gonna write our
first container query.

96
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.399
So this is gonna look like this,

97
00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:15.547
at container card (min-width: 200px).

98
00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:19.377
So at at least 200 pixels,
we're going to do something here.

99
00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:24.452
So let's try this, just card h2

100
00:06:24.452 --> 00:06:30.257
{ background-color: red, okay?

101
00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:34.464
Just to see if it works, always a good
thing to do, anytime you're trying new

102
00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:38.633
code is just to write yourself a really
simple example to make sure it works.

103
00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:41.545
If I get smaller than 200 pixels,
look it's not red.

104
00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:45.294
If I get bigger than 200 pixels,
look it's red, okay?

105
00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:48.751
So far our code is working, okay?

106
00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:52.533
Now that is for the h2 on the card,

107
00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:58.154
what if I just said card
background-color: red?

108
00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:00.158
Any one want to take a guess
what's gonna happen?

109
00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.419
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Wouldn't it
just like get all of them.

110
00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.308
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make all the cards red?

111
00:07:06.308 --> 00:07:08.481
How many say it's gonna
make all the cards red?

112
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.067
How many say it's gonna
make none of the cards red?

113
00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:20.512
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, if I change my
selector here from card h2 to just card,

114
00:07:20.512 --> 00:07:24.978
so the background-color is red,
will all the cards be red?

115
00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:26.760
Will none of the cards be red?

116
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.892
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Should be all the cards.

117
00:07:27.892 --> 00:07:30.042
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All the cards will be red,
right?

118
00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:31.820
Make the only thing that makes sense.

119
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.272
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: A whole card, not just a-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're doubling down.

120
00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:37.039
All the cards are gonna be red.

121
00:07:39.484 --> 00:07:41.113
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: None of the cards are red.

122
00:07:41.113 --> 00:07:43.784
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Jen never asked this

123
00:07:43.784 --> 00:07:46.568
question, unless it's
a non-obvious answer,

124
00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:48.831
you guys should know this by now, okay?

125
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.102
So why didn't this work?

126
00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:57.046
It worked with the h2, but it does not
work with the card by itself, why?

127
00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:59.414
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cuz there are no
containers that are not cards.

128
00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:00.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's right.

129
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.605
The card is the container, and so

130
00:08:02.605 --> 00:08:06.279
we cannot affect the card
itself in our container query.

131
00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:10.196
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Cuz the card comes first and
the h2 is underneath, it's like inside.

132
00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:13.896
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The h2 is a child,
so we can affect the children, but

133
00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.385
not the card itself.

134
00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:17.425
Yup, I had the same moment.

135
00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:21.288
[LAUGH] That's why it's in the course,
okay?

136
00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:23.450
So this is really important to remember.

137
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.353
If we wanna apply styling then to card,
what do I need to do?

138
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:34.131
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How could I make card,
a thing that I want to, the actual card

139
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:39.211
itself and I do want to style the card,
what would I need to do instead?

140
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:40.885
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: What are their parents?

141
00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:43.698
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'd have
to look at a parent, so

142
00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:48.507
I'd have to say something like photo-card,
right?

143
00:08:48.507 --> 00:08:56.130
And then I could say, .card,
background-color:red.

144
00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.361
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Photo card is.

145
00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:03.594
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Photo cards plural,
if I spell it right, it'll work great.

146
00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:05.434
There we go.

147
00:09:05.434 --> 00:09:07.672
Yeah, all right?

148
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.551
So now I've got red cards.

149
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:12.618
Boy, does that look bad, okay.

150
00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.481
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Too many sideline.

151
00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:18.122
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, but
photo-cards contains many cards and

152
00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:23.004
of course photocards will eventually
be as wide as our screen, so

153
00:09:23.004 --> 00:09:26.578
it's actually not
the container that we want.

154
00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:34.177
All right, so I'm gonna go back
then to my card as my unit here.

155
00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:39.267
But what I'm going to do
is I'm going to change my

156
00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:44.246
HTML to the following,
and here is why, okay?

157
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.182
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Around each of my articles,

158
00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:54.111
I am now gonna put a div
with a class of card, okay?

159
00:09:54.111 --> 00:10:01.669
Then I'm gonna have my article and
it will not have a class of card, okay.

160
00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:07.037
And then after my article will be a /div.

161
00:10:07.037 --> 00:10:09.136
Does that sort of make sense?

162
00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:15.852
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I have an extra div around my card.

163
00:10:15.852 --> 00:10:20.157
That is my container
that I can then query.

164
00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:25.675
Now I can style the article
as effectively my card?

165
00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:27.785
Does that make sense?

166
00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:32.425
Okay, so let's put in a whole bunch
of divs then and set this up.

167
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:40.949
So every article will have
a div with a class of card.

168
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:44.708
The article itself is not gonna
have the class of card, and

169
00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:50.247
then we'll end our /div after the article,
and we'll just do that a few times here.

170
00:11:51.137 --> 00:11:57.885
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so when you're done,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You

171
00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:02.713
should have the div with a class of photo
cards, then you're gonna have a div with

172
00:12:02.713 --> 00:12:06.767
a class of card and an article inside
of that without a class of card.

173
00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:10.941
So your HTML should be structured very
similar to mine by the time you're done

174
00:12:10.941 --> 00:12:12.491
making that modification.

175
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:18.310
Okay, so now when we go back and
we revisit my css,

176
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.615
I have my card becomes my container.

177
00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:26.597
I've given it the name of card and
I've given it an inline size.

178
00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:33.580
I'm gonna have my container query for
card with a minimum width of 200 pixels.

179
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.376
Then inside of this, we no longer ask for
card to be background color of red.

180
00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:43.364
We would say article would have
that background Ground color

181
00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:47.094
of red if that's what we wanted to do,
okay?

182
00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:51.813
So now we can make changes to the card
itself now that we actually have an extra

183
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.818
HTML element to make this work.

184
00:12:53.818 --> 00:12:58.644
Everybody clear as to why this
little modification works?

185
00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.059
Okay, fantastic.

186
00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.475
Then let's write some real code.

187
00:13:02.475 --> 00:13:05.082
For each one of my cards,
which are now articles,

188
00:13:05.082 --> 00:13:07.141
what I'm going to do is the following.

189
00:13:07.141 --> 00:13:10.599
I'm gonna give it some padding,
let's say 1rem.

190
00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:14.369
I'll give it a display: grid.

191
00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:17.666
And I'll give it a gap of 1rem.

192
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:21.056
So we have a little bit of space in
between all the elements there on my card.

193
00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:28.318
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now things look a little
bit big there on the page that's partially

194
00:13:28.318 --> 00:13:29.432
due to margins.

195
00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:36.403
So I can say article,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

196
00:13:36.403 --> 00:13:41.477
then all of its children of
article will say margin: 0.

197
00:13:43.352 --> 00:13:46.824
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that's a little bit better.

198
00:13:46.824 --> 00:13:51.317
So all of our cards look exactly the same.

199
00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:53.035
This is how we have to code this first.

200
00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:56.851
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We're going to just code how
our cards look at different dimensions.

201
00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:03.552
And then finally,
I'm going to say .text display: none.

202
00:14:05.987 --> 00:14:10.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so that is
gonna give us the first card layout,

203
00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:13.690
which is this one right here.

204
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.271
So we have the big image on the top,
the headline and

205
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:20.616
the button that is the cards
that we just coded.

206
00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:25.752
Those are the least why'd cards
when there was cards that we have?

207
00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:28.026
Make sense?

208
00:14:28.026 --> 00:14:30.583
Cool, all right.

209
00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:31.913
And I've done all the math for you.

210
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:37.764
I did all of the scrubbing and testing and
figuring out how big these cards could be.

211
00:14:37.764 --> 00:14:40.132
So I derived all of that
from our previous design.

212
00:14:40.132 --> 00:14:46.756
So now we're going to make your
window about 275 pixels wide or so.

213
00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:51.076
And we're gonna write our
next container query.

214
00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:53.173
So that's our first container query.

215
00:14:53.173 --> 00:14:58.268
We'll write another one @container card

216
00:14:58.268 --> 00:15:03.790
(min-width: 250 px)
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

217
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.522
just kind of like a media query
except it also has a name with it.

218
00:15:07.522 --> 00:15:11.198
And it's container instead of media.

219
00:15:11.198 --> 00:15:16.257
So now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say

220
00:15:16.257 --> 00:15:21.987
my article will have
a grid-template-columns of

221
00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:27.724
2fr 1fr
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Remember that layout?

222
00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:30.556
Yep, okay?

223
00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:37.833
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we wanna make sure our image,

224
00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:44.386
article image is going
to be on the other side,

225
00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:51.124
so grid-column 2/3 and grid-row 1/2.

226
00:15:51.124 --> 00:15:57.521
So that'll put our image over on
the right and our text over on the left.

227
00:15:57.521 --> 00:16:01.650
And then we have some wrapping buttons, so

228
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.824
I'm going to set Say .link,
grid-column 1/3.

229
00:16:06.824 --> 00:16:12.695
There's our second round of cards,
basically.

230
00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:15.545
So we have this layout here.

231
00:16:15.545 --> 00:16:18.488
We've completed this layout here.

232
00:16:18.488 --> 00:16:21.557
We coded that.

233
00:16:21.557 --> 00:16:22.999
Any questions on that one?

234
00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:30.735
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it matter
that the picture's on the right?

235
00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:32.506
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's what we wanted,
the picture on the right.

236
00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:34.300
Yep, no worries.

237
00:16:37.843 --> 00:16:39.567
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everybody okay?

238
00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:43.220
Cool, let's do the next one.

239
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.554
So the next one @container card and

240
00:16:47.554 --> 00:16:54.063
this one is gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're super creative,

241
00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:59.441
min-width will be 200 and,
sorry when with will be 500 pixels.

242
00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.984
So this pretty much holds
until we get to 500 pixels.

243
00:17:02.984 --> 00:17:08.344
So make sure your window
is bigger than 500 pixels.

244
00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:10.680
Min width, 500 pixels.

245
00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:22.125
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so here we're going
to say we have to make our text display

246
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:22.635
again.

247
00:17:22.635 --> 00:17:26.776
So text will be display block.

248
00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:34.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we want it to appear in grid column 1/2.

249
00:17:41.013 --> 00:17:43.161
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

250
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:46.635
In our image,
we want to stretch over all of our rows.

251
00:17:46.635 --> 00:17:51.668
So article image is gonna
stretch from grid row,

252
00:17:51.668 --> 00:17:56.956
1/4, so
it's gonna stretch over all of those.

253
00:17:56.956 --> 00:18:00.238
And that looks much better, yeah.

254
00:18:00.238 --> 00:18:03.330
So you can see the progress
that we're making here,

255
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.991
what we're doing is we're
literally coding just the cards.

256
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.697
So there they are.

257
00:18:08.697 --> 00:18:15.180
Skinny card, slightly wider card,
even wider card, okay?

258
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:22.100
And I think we have one more card to
do and this one happens at 550 pixels.

259
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.896
So @container
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Card,

260
00:18:27.896 --> 00:18:33.843
and this will be a min
width of 550 pixels.

261
00:18:36.557 --> 00:18:42.516
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so here,
I can refer to our pictures.

262
00:18:42.516 --> 00:18:47.778
We've coded this one that
was our skinning card.

263
00:18:47.778 --> 00:18:49.077
We coded this one.

264
00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:52.221
We coded this one.

265
00:18:52.221 --> 00:18:55.045
This one.

266
00:18:55.045 --> 00:18:56.291
No, I'm sorry.

267
00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:57.824
We coded these three over here.

268
00:18:57.824 --> 00:18:59.069
We haven't coded this one.

269
00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:04.816
So it's very strange then once
we get to the widest setting,

270
00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:09.775
that we're actually coding
this design again, but

271
00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:15.427
this is the way it worked out
in our original layout, okay?

272
00:19:15.427 --> 00:19:16.798
And I'll remind you of that.

273
00:19:16.798 --> 00:19:20.989
If we take a look at our demo again,
remember, here it is.

274
00:19:20.989 --> 00:19:22.990
There's that big huge one here.

275
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:28.066
This is taking up at least
550 pixels of space, okay?

276
00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:32.449
So that is why we need to code one like
this at the large size that kind of blew

277
00:19:32.449 --> 00:19:36.145
my mind to it was like really
we're going back to that design.

278
00:19:36.145 --> 00:19:39.374
Yes we are because that is
what the design requires.

279
00:19:39.374 --> 00:19:44.865
So here we're going to say our article

280
00:19:44.865 --> 00:19:51.048
has got our grid template columns of 1fr.

281
00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:52.578
There it is.

282
00:19:52.578 --> 00:19:57.285
Then our article img,

283
00:19:57.285 --> 00:20:03.976
article h2, article.text,

284
00:20:03.976 --> 00:20:08.449
and article.link,

285
00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:15.482
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Will be grid-column auto

286
00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:18.822
and grid-row auto.

287
00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:20.970
I'm keeping these as grid,

288
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.160
we could definitely have gone back
to block layouts, but remember,

289
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.170
we originally had some subgrid going
on here, and I wanted to leave

290
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.199
these in grid format so that maybe
they would line up with subgrid.

291
00:20:36.199 --> 00:20:37.070
Make sense?

292
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.519
That's why I didn't put it back to block.

293
00:20:45.303 --> 00:20:47.915
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
how's everybody doing so far?

294
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:50.187
Straightforward enough?

295
00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:54.646
So here are the things that
we should take note of here.

296
00:20:54.646 --> 00:20:57.085
We have a series of break points.

297
00:20:57.085 --> 00:21:00.473
They are way smaller than what we had for
media queries.

298
00:21:00.473 --> 00:21:02.563
That should make sense, right?

299
00:21:02.563 --> 00:21:05.534
Because these are based on
a container inside of your layout.

300
00:21:05.534 --> 00:21:08.158
Your layout is gonna be way bigger, right?

301
00:21:08.158 --> 00:21:15.678
Okay, and we've coded all of the possible
permutations of how our cards might look.

302
00:21:15.678 --> 00:21:19.401
All one right on top of the other there,
they all are.

303
00:21:19.401 --> 00:21:22.020
They get taxed and
then they get big again.

304
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.363
All right, so this is where we start
working with container queries.

305
00:21:25.363 --> 00:21:28.568
Here's all the possibilities
that we might possibly have.

306
00:21:28.568 --> 00:21:33.475
Now the next thing that we're going to do
is we're gonna start thinking about some

307
00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:37.188
exceptions to this rule and
then we can lay out the whole page.
