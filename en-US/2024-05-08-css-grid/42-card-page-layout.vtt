1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.222
We are onto, part C.

2
00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:07.626
So in part C, now we're gonna
lay those cards out on the page.

3
00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:13.218
So basically what we've done so far,
we did our card layouts, all four of them.

4
00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:16.883
We made our exception,
which is our featured card layout.

5
00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:20.450
Now we need to lay out those
cards somehow on the page.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.562
And what does that mean?

7
00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.885
Does that mean more container queries or
does it mean media queries?

8
00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.452
How many say more container queries?

9
00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:31.985
How many say media queries?

10
00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:36.115
The answer is media queries because
now we're laying out the cards

11
00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.375
on the page, okay?

12
00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:41.486
So our containers are going to
control the look of the cards,

13
00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:43.347
depending on their width.

14
00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:46.196
And then the media query is now
something completely different.

15
00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:50.209
Depending on the size of the window,
where are these cards located in space?

16
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:53.332
And then the size of their hole,
so to speak,

17
00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:57.209
on that page will determine
how the card is displaying.

18
00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:00.384
It's a completely backwards
way of thinking about layout.

19
00:01:00.384 --> 00:01:04.006
If you are accustomed to
thinking about media queries.

20
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.477
Make sense?

21
00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:09.019
All right, so let's get this programmed.

22
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.271
Okay, so here we are.

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.553
We have now all the things.

24
00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:18.677
We have our cards and
their various containers.

25
00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:26.311
We have featured, and
we have all of their featured,

26
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.827
the single featured container queries.

27
00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:34.348
And so
now we can write some media queries.

28
00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:38.948
Okay, so @media,
after all those containers.

29
00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:42.988
We'll say @media,

30
00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:48.379
min-width 200 pixels.

31
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.161
So it at least 200 pixels, remember,

32
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:54.819
our container queries don't
go smaller than either.

33
00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:01.258
We're gonna say .card,
.text, display block.

34
00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:05.643
And I'll explain why we're doing
this in a moment, but it is a little

35
00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:10.647
modification that we have to make to these
cards as we start to lay out the page.

36
00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:14.134
To this, we will also add the article and

37
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.861
the padding for
the article is gonna be 3rem, 1rem.

38
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:24.294
So it's gonna give us a little bit of
padding for these cards here on the page.

39
00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:28.179
This is for at least 200 pixels.

40
00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:32.943
Back here, okay.

41
00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:36.510
And I'm also gonna add in a line.

42
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.734
So, for .card, let's put

43
00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:46.195
a border-top, 1 pixel solid ccc.

44
00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:51.198
So that is going to create,
here's our featured card, right?

45
00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:52.577
And then after those,

46
00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:57.525
we have a little bit of space in between
our cards with the line in between, yeah?

47
00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:01.004
That is,
if we look at our demo from before and

48
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:06.967
we make our screen really narrow, that
is what we had here in our demo before.

49
00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:07.531
We did.

50
00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:08.719
We totally did.

51
00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.300
At really small screen sizes.

52
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.588
Okay.

53
00:03:14.588 --> 00:03:19.632
Then, we're gonna go to a larger size,

54
00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:24.538
@media, oops.

55
00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:29.796
Here we go.

56
00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:39.079
@media with a min-width of 500 pixels.

57
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.161
In this one, we're gonna say for
our photo cards,

58
00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:55.598
We're gonna say display grid,

59
00:03:55.598 --> 00:04:00.892
grid-template columns,

60
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:06.183
1fr 1fr and grid template

61
00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:10.337
rows auto 1fr auto.

62
00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.395
So if we get to at least 500 pixels

63
00:04:18.142 --> 00:04:20.704
Then we wind up with two columns of cards.

64
00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:24.163
Here's our featured card and
here's all of the other cards and

65
00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.931
they're forming two columns.

66
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.231
It looks like what we had before,

67
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:33.173
except our featured card needs to
stretch across two columns, right?

68
00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:37.198
And we had done some things with subgrid,

69
00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:41.117
I'm gonna put them in here even though,

70
00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:47.560
It may throw us off just a little bit.

71
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.924
Grid-row: span 3,

72
00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:56.412
grid: template-columns: 2fr,

73
00:04:56.412 --> 00:05:03.499
1fr, and grid-template-rows: subgrid.

74
00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:08.061
And then finally, our featured item,

75
00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:15.375
Grid-column: 1/3.

76
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:19.447
Okay, so
now we have our moon across the top.

77
00:05:19.447 --> 00:05:24.783
We have our little articles here
underneath just like this, okay?

78
00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.202
And they are not lining up.

79
00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:29.302
Notice that.

80
00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:33.086
So when we get to our bigger sizes here,
so

81
00:05:33.086 --> 00:05:37.424
we're missing our borders
here at the moment.

82
00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:41.241
But it does look very,
very, similar, yeah?

83
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:46.785
Okay, cool.

84
00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:52.042
&gt;&gt; And can you dash after
on line 82 template rows?

85
00:05:55.862 --> 00:05:58.825
&gt;&gt; Thank you, yep.

86
00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:04.763
You are absolutely right, cool.

87
00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:06.479
And then let's add our border.

88
00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.815
So for card whoops

89
00:06:10.815 --> 00:06:17.755
card:nth-child (2),

90
00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:24.700
card:nth-child(4).

91
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:32.260
Then we're gonna say
border-right: 1px solid #ccc;.

92
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.899
Okay, so now we have our borders.

93
00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.058
Okay, so this was one of
the things that I noticed here.

94
00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:43.919
Although we have subgroups setup,
sub grid is not working, okay?

95
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.911
And sub grid is set up correctly here and
I played around with this a lot and

96
00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:49.498
I googled the heck out of it.

97
00:06:49.498 --> 00:06:53.041
And I could not find anybody
who has made sub grid and

98
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.926
container queries work together
at this point in time.

99
00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:03.524
So I've been thinking about why subgrid
and container queries don't work together.

100
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:08.314
I'm thinking that container queries
are independent of what's going on

101
00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:13.117
with the media queries and so subgrid
is not talking to the media queries.

102
00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:16.205
The container queries are not
talking into the media queries and

103
00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.504
we can't get things to line up for
that reason.

104
00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:22.904
I could be completely wrong
container queries like I said,

105
00:07:22.904 --> 00:07:25.370
brand new and subgrid brand new.

106
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.387
It could be that I just I
haven't messed with this enough.

107
00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:33.338
Many people smarter than me have not
written the right blog posts yet

108
00:07:33.338 --> 00:07:34.597
about how to make this work.

109
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:38.034
But I was unable to make this work
here at this particular point in time.

110
00:07:38.034 --> 00:07:41.739
Maybe when are you guys
are gonna figure this out, okay?

111
00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:45.643
So the fact that the Subgrid isn't
talking with the container queries,

112
00:07:45.643 --> 00:07:49.870
let's just sort of file that away as a
thing that maybe we need to dig more into.

113
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.996
And we'll just sort of move on from there.

114
00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:59.865
Okay so then at this point,
now we can just kind of change

115
00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:04.739
our media queries to continue
to change our cards here.

116
00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:10.583
And so now, so
there's our 500 pixels media query.

117
00:08:10.583 --> 00:08:17.115
So when I get to add media (min-width; 750

118
00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:22.838
pixels) then we can say our photo cards,

119
00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:29.952
Grid template columns,

120
00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:34.676
repeat (4, 1fr) right?

121
00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:38.473
So make sure we're at screen size
where we can see what we're doing.

122
00:08:45.063 --> 00:08:51.688
And then our grid-template-rows:

123
00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:56.449
repeat (3, auto); and

124
00:08:56.449 --> 00:09:02.455
border-top, 1 px Solid #ccc.

125
00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:08.317
Our featured card is gonna be different,

126
00:09:08.317 --> 00:09:14.514
so featured is going
to take up grid-column

127
00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:18.702
1/4; grid-row 1/3;

128
00:09:18.702 --> 00:09:24.573
border-right 1px solid #ccc, okay?

129
00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:25.843
So we're progressing there.

130
00:09:30.783 --> 00:09:37.653
.card:nth-child(4),

131
00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:47.407
Card:nth child(5).

132
00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:54.443
Grid-column: span 2.

133
00:09:57.842 --> 00:10:02.130
And then finally,

134
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:09.098
card;nth-child 2.text,

135
00:10:09.098 --> 00:10:16.603
card:nth-child(3).text

136
00:10:16.603 --> 00:10:20.357
displa:none.

137
00:10:20.357 --> 00:10:26.298
Okay, so once we've done all of that,
then we wind up with,

138
00:10:26.298 --> 00:10:30.500
well, that didn't quite work out right.

139
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.913
I'm sure I missed something somewhere.

140
00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:33.609
Let me switch over to the answer here.

141
00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:38.393
Cuz I'm just typing in
things in at this point.

142
00:10:38.393 --> 00:10:43.118
So, okay, so here we go.

143
00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:46.550
So we have our series of card containers.

144
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.523
We have our series of featured container.

145
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.890
As there's one,
we have a series of media queries.

146
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.787
These media queries are gonna control
the look of the web page, okay?

147
00:10:57.787 --> 00:11:02.325
And if you compare the way
this page looks now with

148
00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:06.752
the way we encoded earlier
with media queries,

149
00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:13.520
it's basically the same except
the subgrid part is not working, okay?

150
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.602
Which is better?

151
00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:16.070
&gt;&gt; Media queries.

152
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.881
&gt;&gt; You like media queries better?

153
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:18.537
&gt;&gt; Subgrid works.

154
00:11:18.537 --> 00:11:20.132
&gt;&gt; Cuz the subgrid is working.

155
00:11:20.132 --> 00:11:23.355
Yeah, anybody else have an opinion?

156
00:11:23.355 --> 00:11:24.988
&gt;&gt; I think I'm with James,
I like media queries.

157
00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.332
&gt;&gt; You like media queries?

158
00:11:26.332 --> 00:11:30.438
Okay, do some of you see
the value of container queries?

159
00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:31.272
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

160
00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:32.608
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

161
00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.926
Maybe this isn't the best example for
it, but yeah,

162
00:11:35.926 --> 00:11:39.043
container queries could
potentially be useful.

163
00:11:39.043 --> 00:11:42.239
That's a completely different way of
thinking about how the page is put

164
00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:43.151
together, right?

165
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:43.796
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

166
00:11:43.796 --> 00:11:47.176
&gt;&gt; Seems like you can scale it more, like
you don't have to say the number of rows

167
00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:50.047
or columns that you have if you're
just talking about the cards.

168
00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:52.184
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

169
00:11:52.184 --> 00:11:57.800
And the whole point of this container
query thing is that this holy grail of,

170
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.189
I wanna distribute this thing.

171
00:12:00.189 --> 00:12:02.123
And you can just download this thing and

172
00:12:02.123 --> 00:12:05.813
you can put this thing into your code
base, and it will appear on the page and

173
00:12:05.813 --> 00:12:09.344
it will function exactly the way that
I've coded it at all dimensions.

174
00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:13.959
So now with a container query, I can
control exactly how my particular item is

175
00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:17.012
supposed to look at all
different dimensions, and

176
00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:21.911
I can ship that along with whatever else
I've got going on with that JavaScript and

177
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:24.630
whatever else you've got going on, right?

178
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.622
So that's what a lot of
people are thinking about

179
00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:27.942
with these container queries.
