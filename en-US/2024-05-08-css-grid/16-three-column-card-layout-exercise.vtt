00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.500
All right, so I wanna give you
guys a try at the next one.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.230
So we are gonna go from this design,
we just coded it, right?

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.120
Where we have our featured layout
here going across two columns.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.210
We have all of those
cards underneath of it.

5
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.178
When we get to 700 pixels,

6
00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:22.990
you have your featured cards
stretching across, now, three columns.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.580
Okay, with the big picture and
the headings and so forth underneath.

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.100
So take five minutes,
see if you can do this yourself.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.970
This is gonna come,
we have our 500 pixel media query.

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.928
So after this,
you're gonna continue to type code.

11
00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.499
You're gonna need to write
a media query for 700 pixels.

12
00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.572
And then you're gonna need to make
the changes in order to make this go to

13
00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:46.632
three columns.

14
00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:47.343
And remember,

15
00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:50.852
you'll want to make sure that your window
is big enough to see your changes.

16
00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:53.417
So make sure that it's
over 700 pixels wide.

17
00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:59.302
Tell me what I need to type here.

18
00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:00.970
Let's go through an answer here.

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.185
So what do I need to put in in order
to make the three columns underneath my

20
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:06.350
featured image?

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.682
What am I gonna put in, @media?

22
00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.690
&gt;&gt; @media, I was looking into the
collapse, and that was already written.

23
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.439
&gt;&gt; That's okay, no worries.

24
00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.857
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; @media (min-width: 700px), yeah, okay?

25
00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.591
Then you were saying card-container.

26
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:26.504
&gt;&gt; Yep, display a grid with three columns,
grid-template-column, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr.

27
00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:31.428
&gt;&gt; Okay, grid-template-columns,
and just for

28
00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:35.397
fun, I'll say repeat(3, 1fr).

29
00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:39.786
If you said 1fr, 1fr,
1fr, that totally works.

30
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.014
That's not a bad look right there.

31
00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:45.524
Yeah, it's kind of cool, but
it's not what the designer wanted.

32
00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:47.993
So what else did did you say, James?

33
00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:52.654
&gt;&gt; I have the feature
grid-column go from 1 to 4.

34
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:59.728
&gt;&gt; Yeah, feature {grid-column: 1/4;}.

35
00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.929
Hey, look at that.

36
00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.869
And if we scroll down, there we go.

37
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.207
There's our three cards going underneath,
nice.

38
00:02:11.207 --> 00:02:14.059
Again, we'll address
the alignment issues later.

39
00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.249
But for right now,
we are absolutely fantastic.

40
00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.694
Technically speaking, right here inside
of the card-container, the display: grid,

41
00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:24.131
we actually don't need that.

42
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:28.552
And the reason why is because we've said
display: grid up here at the 500 pixel

43
00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:29.761
media query.

44
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.583
So that will carry over into
the 700 pixel media query.

45
00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:38.121
We can just indicate what has changed
in this particular case, all right?

46
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:43.688
But if you say display: grid again, it is
not the end of the world, it's just fine,
