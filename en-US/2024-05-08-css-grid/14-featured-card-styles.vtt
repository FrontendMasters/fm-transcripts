00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.230
Okay, so now we need to take a look at
this featured item up here at the top.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.900
The featured item is laying
out exactly the same way.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.310
Why is that?

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.052
&gt;&gt; There's a different class.

5
00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:15.397
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it includes the card class.

6
00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:16.830
&gt;&gt; It includes the card class, see that?

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400
So it has the card class and
it has the feature class.

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.242
So right now, it's using that same card
layout here to layout all the information

9
00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:28.958
here at the top of the screen, which is
great, except that's not what we want.

10
00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.088
We want something different for
our featured card.

11
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:37.516
So if we go back to take a look at
our mobile version of the site here,

12
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.102
the featured card should have our
headline, should have our image and

13
00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:42.531
it should have our button.

14
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:47.554
So this block of text here
should not be showing, and

15
00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.631
we shouldn't have two columns, right?

16
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:55.241
So after all of my card styles,
because I want my

17
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:59.969
featured styles to override
those card styles,

18
00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.446
we're gonna say .feature img,
we can say grid column: 1/3.

19
00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:09.396
In other words,
stretch all the way across.

20
00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:12.538
And we can say grid-row: 2/3,

21
00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:18.626
because we wanna have the title on top,
followed by the card itself.

22
00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:24.668
Then we need to send our
button here to the bottom.

23
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:28.587
It's kind of there now, but it's really
squashed up against this picture,

24
00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.656
so I'm gonna add some styling for that.

25
00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:35.798
.feature, oops, p:last-child,

26
00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:44.378
so the last paragraph there in
the feature markup cuz we have two.

27
00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:46.811
We have the actual text, and
then you have the one with the button.

28
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:53.428
We're gonna say our grid-row is 3/4,

29
00:01:53.428 --> 00:01:57.074
it's probably is already there,

30
00:01:57.074 --> 00:02:01.612
and then we'll say margin-top: 2rem.

31
00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:04.698
And that'll give us a little bit of
breathing room between our picture and

32
00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:05.651
our button.

33
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:06.621
Make sense?

34
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:09.431
All right, now,
we need to hide the text here.

35
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:13.731
This lorem ipsum that we have here,
that needs to get hidden.

36
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:19.297
And so
we may do something like .feature p,

37
00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.761
and we say display: none.

38
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.541
That will actually hide
both that paragraph and

39
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.469
our button because both of them are Ps,
correct?

40
00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.469
Okay, so I wanna just hide
the one that is not the button.

41
00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.162
And for those of you who are funky
selector collectors like me,

42
00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:44.455
there's a cool way of doing this.

43
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:47.319
So we can say four
paragraphs that are not,

44
00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:59.025
:has(a), that is a really funky one.

45
00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:01.940
So has anyone seen
a selector like that before?

46
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:09.131
Selectors, we read from right to left even
though we write them from left to right.

47
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.810
So that's your first secret of CSS,

48
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.781
you always have to read your
selectors from the right.

49
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:21.895
So this says for any paragraphs that
do not have a link inside of them.

50
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:24.869
That would be this paragraph here.

51
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:31.121
Cool, so it will hide just the one
with the link inside of it.

52
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.091
That's our button, yes.

53
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.441
&gt;&gt; Why doesn't feature P first child?

54
00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:38.161
&gt;&gt; That would absolutely work as well.

55
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:41.465
&gt;&gt; Was it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yep, but I just decided to put in

56
00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:47.723
a funky one for the fans and the audience,
cuz I'm a fan of spunky selectors.

57
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.574
Okay, so at this point, what do you think?

58
00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:59.522
Let's compare our design here.

59
00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.904
We go, planets and moons.

60
00:04:01.904 --> 00:04:03.348
There's all the cards.

61
00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:04.868
And let's take a look at our code pad.

62
00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:05.694
What do you think?

63
00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:08.463
Pretty much the same?

64
00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:14.028
Not so bad, right?

65
00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:14.758
Not so hard.
