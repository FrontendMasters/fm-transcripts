1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.041
All right, so
let's go on to Chapter 2 here.

2
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.680
And in Chapter 2,
we're gonna do an introduction to grid.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.690
So now that you know how grid works, let's
explore its structure and its syntax.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.868
So if you click the button here for
the beginning CodePen,

5
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:20.856
this should open up in a new window.

6
00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:25.695
And in honor of the eclipse that's coming
to America, we've got a whole bunch of

7
00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:29.556
astronomy pictures here as a theme for
this particular course.

8
00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:33.584
If this is your first time using CodePen,
anybody here in this room,

9
00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:35.109
have you all used CodePen before?

10
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:35.973
&gt;&gt; That's my first time.

11
00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:37.376
&gt;&gt; First time, okay, great.

12
00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:40.778
So what you'll wanna do here as
you open up open up your CodePen,

13
00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.688
you'll probably want to sign up for
the free account.

14
00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:45.792
That would be a great thing to do.

15
00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:49.713
And then down at the bottom of the page,
way, way, way down at the bottom,

16
00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:52.037
there's a button down here that says fork.

17
00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.886
Fork is a fancy word for
make a copy of this grid or

18
00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:58.148
make a copy of this
CodePen to my own account.

19
00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:03.663
So if you click that button, it will,
Make copy of the code here for you.

20
00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:07.414
And then the last thing that I like
to do to try to set up CodePen is,

21
00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:10.980
by default all the code goes
across the top of the page.

22
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.090
I prefer it to be on the left hand side.

23
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.150
So up at the top here, there is
a thing that looks like a cupcake.

24
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.902
We're gonna tip that cupcake
over to the left, and

25
00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:23.466
then we'll put your code
on the left hand side.

26
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.166
And I like this because you can grab
the bar in the middle here, and

27
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.252
you can drag things back and forth and

28
00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:34.163
see how the screen is gonna look kind of
at larger or smaller dimensions, okay?

29
00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:36.952
So anytime we get started here,

30
00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:41.716
we always wanna start by just
looking at our HTML code.

31
00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:45.572
We still Start with an h1 here,
we have our Moons of Jupiter.

32
00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.402
Inside of this,
we have a series of figures.

33
00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:52.821
One of the features of CodePen, also
in VS Code, that I love, is the ability

34
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:57.472
to collapse things here using these
triangles, so we can see what's going on.

35
00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:00.302
We have four figures here
inside of our document.

36
00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:04.553
And if we Uncollapse one of those and
take a look at it.

37
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.892
If you're not familiar with
the HTML figure element,

38
00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:12.133
it's designed to associate a photo
with text that goes with it.

39
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.173
So in other words like a description for
the picture.

40
00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:19.912
On the top here we have our picture and
of course with its alt text.

41
00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:25.019
And then underneath of that,
we might have a caption of some kind.

42
00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.579
In this case, we have the fact that
this is volcanic activity on IO.

43
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.831
For those of you who like accessibility,

44
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:37.909
note that the alt text helps people
who can't actually see the picture.

45
00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.925
So I've written here a pizza looking moon.

46
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:46.055
[LAUGH] The outline of an erupting
volcano is on the left, okay?

47
00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:50.047
Whereas the caption just says
volcanic activity on IO, all right?

48
00:02:50.047 --> 00:02:52.171
So that is going to be the same for

49
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.569
all of our other figures
that are here on this page.

50
00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.046
And these are the four
Galilean moons of Jupiter.

51
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.862
Always super cool to look at, right?

52
00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:03.904
These are the ones you can see from Earth.

53
00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:07.905
Has anybody ever looked through
a telescope and seen these before?

54
00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:08.734
It's very, very cool.

55
00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:12.492
If you get the chance to just
use a regular old telescope,

56
00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.146
you can see them, okay?

57
00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:15.608
So-
&gt;&gt; Can I ask?

58
00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:16.534
&gt;&gt; Of course.

59
00:03:16.534 --> 00:03:20.926
&gt;&gt; Is the site HTML elements something
that belongs within fake captions,

60
00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:21.934
specifically?

61
00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.672
Or can that be used
outside of the caption?

62
00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:29.251
&gt;&gt; Site can be used anywhere
that a citation is taking place.

63
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:33.271
And of course, I in this case I'm
citing the source of my image.

64
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:35.611
So sites a great element for using them.

65
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:40.523
&gt;&gt; What is the point or
what does it do that the a Trump?

66
00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:41.610
Yeah, it doesn't?

67
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.131
&gt;&gt; So, what site does is it
flags this as a citation.

68
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.791
So in other words, we know that this
is now the source of something.

69
00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:51.041
And that's the purpose of it.

70
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.931
It'll be really helpful to people in
particular who have screen readers.

71
00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:58.140
So, the first thing that I would like
to do is, I would like to put all four

72
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.430
of these moons next to each other
in a nice little row, okay?

73
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.018
And what I have right now,
is I have four individual figures,

74
00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:09.700
one for each one of these moons.

75
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.870
So, if you think about it in your mind,
how is this gonna to work?

76
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.670
We're gonna have four moons
going here in a row, correct?

77
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.700
Make sense?

78
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.560
Okay, so, somehow we need to apply
grid such that these figures

79
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.080
wind up being the so called children.

80
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.410
And we need to have a parent that will
contain our declaration to display grid.

81
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.040
Right now we don't have
that here in our HTML.

82
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.860
So anytime you are in a situation like
this, and you started to markup your

83
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.319
content semantically, which is
what is already done here for you.

84
00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.266
What we're gonna do then is add
to this a div in this case,

85
00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:52.967
because all it's gonna do for us is serve
as a grouping mechanism for these items.

86
00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:58.580
So we'll say div with a class
of whatever you want to call it,

87
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.334
I'm gonna call mine grid-container.

88
00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.796
Grid container grid parent
mean the same entire thing.

89
00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:09.454
And we can close that
right after the figure.

90
00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:13.672
Okay?

91
00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:21.852
So, now I have grouped my figures all
together very very nicely here on my page.

92
00:05:23.942 --> 00:05:27.818
Now when I go into my css here,
just to point out what I have,

93
00:05:27.818 --> 00:05:31.172
I put in just a little bit
of basic formatting here.

94
00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.992
Basically assigning a font
family to the body.

95
00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:39.322
Setting up my images to
have a max width of 100%.

96
00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:44.300
This makes them scale be a little bit
flexible as the screen gets smaller.

97
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.680
We haven't swapped these out using picture
sources or sizes or source set just yet.

98
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.131
So we're just gonna work with this
max width little thing for now, and

99
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:57.830
figure by default has a little bit of
margin or padding associated with it.

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.764
So I've turned that off, all right?

101
00:06:00.764 --> 00:06:05.715
So here in my CSS style then we need to

102
00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:10.678
set up a grid-container- class.

103
00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:13.898
And we get started,
guess how we start working with grid?

104
00:06:13.898 --> 00:06:15.943
What would be the first
thing that I put here?

105
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:17.253
Anybody want to take a guess?

106
00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:18.346
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Display?

107
00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:19.866
&gt;&gt; Display what?

108
00:06:19.866 --> 00:06:20.515
&gt;&gt; Grid.

109
00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.870
&gt;&gt; Grid, awesome.

110
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.173
Well done, and absolutely nothing happens.

111
00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:27.830
Okay, we gotta keep going.

112
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.330
Now I want to have four columns.

113
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.120
Anybody know how I might state I want
to have four columns here on my page?

114
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.040
&gt;&gt; Call dashboard.

115
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.540
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.

116
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.813
That would be a perfect name for
a class, but

117
00:06:42.813 --> 00:06:47.559
the css property is grid-template-columns.

118
00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:49.778
So grid-template-columns.

119
00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:52.843
So in other words,
we're gonna set up a pattern.

120
00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:56.443
And this pattern is going to be some
number of columns going across the page.

121
00:06:56.443 --> 00:07:01.078
And I am going to type the following,
1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr.

122
00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.331
&gt;&gt; Online people said fraction.

123
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:06.130
&gt;&gt; Fraction,
fraction is what it stands for.

124
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.774
So, this stands for fractions.

125
00:07:08.774 --> 00:07:12.102
One of the wonderful things about
grid is we do not have to do math.

126
00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:16.025
We can just say hey grid,
break this page into four fractions,

127
00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:19.032
and it will do the math for
you and look at that.

128
00:07:19.032 --> 00:07:22.110
We have four evenly sized
columns here on the Page.

129
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.035
Isn't that amazing?

130
00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:30.360
With two little declarations here, we are
done, we actually have our four columns.

131
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.424
So that is gonna put these things all next
to each other with no space in between.

132
00:07:35.424 --> 00:07:39.754
I can hear the graphic designer
screaming already, how about you, okay?

133
00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:46.554
So we want some space between these,
we can say gap, something like two rem.

134
00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:47.507
What is a rem?

135
00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:52.788
&gt;&gt; Relative something.

136
00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:54.546
&gt;&gt; Relative something.

137
00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:55.830
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

138
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.006
&gt;&gt; It's the relative size of an M.

139
00:07:58.006 --> 00:07:59.116
It's the relative size of an M?

140
00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.308
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yep, kind of like that,

141
00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:03.352
it's a root relative M.

142
00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:04.606
What is an M?

143
00:08:04.606 --> 00:08:06.318
So, so helpful, right?

144
00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:07.601
What is an M?

145
00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:10.683
In typography land,
the letter M is often used as

146
00:08:10.683 --> 00:08:14.891
a reference letter to determine how big or
small something is.

147
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:19.379
So if you have one of those really fat
fonts, your letter M, it's one M wide, but

148
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.777
it's a really fat one M.

149
00:08:20.777 --> 00:08:23.686
Whereas if you're using like
the narrow width fonts,

150
00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:26.687
it's a really skinny M and
that's still one M, okay?

151
00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:28.268
So it's relative to that.

152
00:08:28.268 --> 00:08:32.028
Here we're looking at the root
of the documents of HTML.

153
00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:34.777
Usually, this means 16 pixels.

154
00:08:34.777 --> 00:08:37.615
Why would we wanna go through all
the bother of doing this with REMs?

155
00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:45.271
&gt;&gt; So if you change your font,
it'll change as well.

156
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:48.998
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if I change my font size,
if I want to scale things up,

157
00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:51.744
everything scales up proportionally,
right?

158
00:08:54.654 --> 00:09:01.520
Okay, so my gap number here, by the way,
2rem actually has two dimensions to it.

159
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.490
If you prefer,
you could have two numbers here.

160
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:12.577
We can say our column gap is 2rem,

161
00:09:12.577 --> 00:09:18.725
and we can also say we have a row gap.

162
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.681
Maybe you want a different number for
that, I don't know, 1rem, okay?

163
00:09:21.681 --> 00:09:23.757
We don't have any rows yet.

164
00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:28.312
But you can break those into two
numbers using that type of notation.

165
00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:30.432
You can also combine these.

166
00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.182
You'll also see this done.

167
00:09:32.182 --> 00:09:36.825
So we have just regular old gap again, and

168
00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:40.149
I think it's 1rem, 2rem.

169
00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:44.819
Yes, I always get confused,
which number comes first, so it's row, and

170
00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:45.944
then the column.

171
00:09:45.944 --> 00:09:49.551
What if I wanna have two moons on
the top and two moons underneath?

172
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:51.141
How am I gonna set that up?

173
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:53.971
Anyone have a suggestion
based on what you know?

174
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.611
Or at least what would be a start?

175
00:09:55.611 --> 00:10:02.982
&gt;&gt; Have two, 1 fr in the columns
&gt;&gt; I change this to just 1fr, 1fr.

176
00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:07.043
Hey, look that it worked.

177
00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:08.756
That's kind of cool.

178
00:10:08.756 --> 00:10:13.120
So let's talk about the it's probably kind
of surprising that that actually worked,

179
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.727
isn't it?

180
00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:16.742
[LAUGH] So why did that work?

181
00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:21.418
Well, this is grid trying to be
helpful and guess what you want.

182
00:10:22.568 --> 00:10:26.948
So what grid did was it looked at how many
figures we had, we have four of them.

183
00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:31.058
And we have in our template columns,
we only have two template columns.

184
00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:34.948
So grid said, well, I've got to do
something with these other two pieces

185
00:10:34.948 --> 00:10:38.799
of content that are affected by
the grid-container, what should I do?

186
00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:42.985
Well, I'll just wrap around and
put them in the next row, okay?

187
00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:46.457
Now, we can declare rows as well,
I often don't

188
00:10:46.457 --> 00:10:51.975
because I think usually columns is
sufficient for this very reason.

189
00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:56.715
This is called the intrinsic properties
of grid that it's gonna try to guess for

190
00:10:56.715 --> 00:11:00.126
you, but you can call out your
rows as well if you prefer.
