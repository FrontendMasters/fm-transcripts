1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
All right, so
let's go on to chapter two here.

2
00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:08.410
And in chapter two,
we're gonna do an introduction to Grid.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.411
So now that you know how Grid works, let's
explore its structure and its syntax.

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:17.815
So if you click the button here for
the beginning CodePen.

5
00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:20.543
This should open up in a new window and

6
00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:24.334
in honor of the eclipse
that's coming to America.

7
00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:28.631
We've got a whole bunch of astronomy
pictures here as the theme for

8
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:30.327
this particular course.

9
00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:33.386
If this is your first time using CodePen,
anybody here in this room,

10
00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:34.928
have you all used CodePen before?

11
00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:35.680
&gt;&gt; That's my first.

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.176
&gt;&gt; First time, okay, great.

13
00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:40.776
So what you'll wanna do here
as you open up your CodePen,

14
00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:44.152
you'll probably wanna sign up for
the free account.

15
00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:45.613
That would be a great thing to do.

16
00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:49.625
And then down at the bottom of the page,
way, way, way down at the bottom,

17
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.999
there's a button down here that says Fork.

18
00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:57.915
Fork is a fancy word for make a copy
of this CodePen to my own account.

19
00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:03.733
So if you click that button, it will
make a copy of the code here for you.

20
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:08.076
Then the last thing that I like to do
to try to set up CodePen is by default,

21
00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:10.727
all the code goes across
the top of the page.

22
00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:12.945
I prefer it to be on the left hand side.

23
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:17.948
So up at the top here, there is
a thing that looks like a cupcake.

24
00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:21.067
We're gonna tip that cupcake
over to the left and

25
00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.971
that will put your code
on the left hand side.

26
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.528
And I like this because you can grab
the bar in the middle here, and

27
00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:29.533
you can drag things back and forth and

28
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.946
see how the screen is gonna look kind of
at larger and smaller dimensions, okay.

29
00:01:33.946 --> 00:01:35.876
So any time we get started here,

30
00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:39.173
we always wanna start by just
looking at our HTML code.

31
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:45.294
We start with an h1 here,
we have our moons of Jupiter,

32
00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:48.148
inside of this we have
a series of figures.

33
00:01:48.148 --> 00:01:52.721
One of the features of CodePen, also in
VS Code that I love, is the ability to

34
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:57.236
collapse things here using these
triangles so we can see what's going on.

35
00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:00.752
We have four figures here
inside of our document and

36
00:02:00.752 --> 00:02:04.367
if we un-collapse one of those and
take a look at it.

37
00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.821
If you're not familiar with
the HTML figure element,

38
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.886
it's designed to associate a photo
with text that goes with it.

39
00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:15.041
So in other words like a description for
the picture.

40
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:20.106
On the top here we have our picture and
of course with its alt text and

41
00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:24.736
then underneath of that we might
have a caption of some kind.

42
00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:31.389
In this case we have the in fact that
this is Volcanic Activity on IO.

43
00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.728
For those of you who like accessibility
note that the alt text helps people who

44
00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:37.678
can't actually see the picture.

45
00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:40.749
So I've written here A pizza-looking moon.

46
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:46.065
[LAUGH] The outline of an erupting
volcano is on the left, okay?

47
00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:50.232
Whereas the caption just says
Volcanic Activity on IO, all right?

48
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:55.336
So that is going to be the same for
all of our other figures that are here

49
00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:59.915
on this page and these are the four
Galilean Moons of Jupiter.

50
00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.842
Always super cool to look at, right?

51
00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:03.634
These are the ones you can see from Earth.

52
00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:07.741
Has anybody ever looked through
a telescope and seen these before?

53
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:09.704
It's very,
very cool if you get the chance.

54
00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:13.965
Just use a regular old telescope,
you can see them, okay.

55
00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:15.357
So
&gt;&gt; Can I ask?

56
00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.310
&gt;&gt; Of course.

57
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.688
&gt;&gt; Is the cite HTML elements something
that belongs within fig caption

58
00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:24.693
specifically or can that be used
outside of fig caption also?

59
00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:29.213
&gt;&gt; Cite can be used anywhere
that a citation is taking place.

60
00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:33.139
And, of course, in this case I'm
citing the source of my image.

61
00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.434
So cite is a great element for using them.

62
00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:41.708
&gt;&gt; What's the point or
what does it do that the yeah, it doesn't.

63
00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.917
&gt;&gt; So what cite does is it
flags this as a citation.

64
00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:46.089
So in other words,

65
00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:50.868
we know that this is now the source of
something and that's the purpose of it.

66
00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.664
It'll be really helpful to people in
particular who have screen readers.

67
00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:58.433
So the first thing that I would like to
do, is I would like to put all four of

68
00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:02.287
these moons next to each other
in a nice little row, okay?

69
00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:06.970
And what I have right now is I
have four individual figures,

70
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.508
one for each one of these moons.

71
00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:12.709
So if you think about it in your mind,
how is this gonna look?

72
00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.458
We're gonna have four moons
going here in a row, correct?

73
00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:17.461
Make sense?

74
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.874
Okay, so somehow we need to
apply Grid such that these

75
00:04:21.874 --> 00:04:25.909
figures wind up being
the so-called children.

76
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:31.281
And we need to have a parent that will
contain our declaration to display Grid.

77
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:33.825
Right now,
we don't have that here in our HTML.

78
00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:37.451
So anytime you are in a situation like
this and you started to mark up your

79
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.904
content systematically which is
what is already done here for you.

80
00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:44.835
What we're gonna do then
is add to this a div,

81
00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:48.455
in this case because all it's gonna do for

82
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:53.015
us is serve as a grouping mechanism for
these items.

83
00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:58.633
So we'll say div with a class of,
whatever you wanna call it,

84
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:02.320
I'm gonna call mine grid-container.

85
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.152
Grid-container, grid parent mean
the same entire thing then we can

86
00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:09.660
close that right after the figure.

87
00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:18.623
Okay, so now I have grouped my figures all

88
00:05:18.623 --> 00:05:23.765
together very,
very nicely here on my page.

89
00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:28.526
Now when I go into my CSS here,
just to point out what I have,

90
00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:32.638
I put in just a little bit
of basic formatting here.

91
00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:35.866
Basically assigning a font
family to the body,

92
00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:39.424
setting up my images to
have a max width of 100%.

93
00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:44.092
This makes the scale be a little bit
flexible as the screen gets smaller.

94
00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:50.629
We haven't swapped these out using
picture sizes or source set just yet.

95
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.019
So we're just gonna work with this
max width little thing for now.

96
00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.482
And figure by default has
a little bit of margin or

97
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:02.144
padding associated with it so
I've turned that off, all right.

98
00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:10.729
So here it is my CSS style then we
need to set up a grid-container class.

99
00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.119
And we get started,
guess how we start working with grid?

100
00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.785
What would be the first
thing that I put here?

101
00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.076
Anybody wanna take a guess?

102
00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.291
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Display.

103
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:19.854
&gt;&gt; Display what?

104
00:06:19.854 --> 00:06:20.369
&gt;&gt; Grid.

105
00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:22.874
&gt;&gt; Grid, awesome.

106
00:06:22.874 --> 00:06:26.768
Well done and
absolutely nothing happens, okay?

107
00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:28.772
We got to keep going.

108
00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:31.112
Now I wanna have four columns.

109
00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:32.656
Anybody know how I might state?

110
00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:36.885
I wanna have four columns here on my page.

111
00:06:36.885 --> 00:06:38.683
&gt;&gt; Col-4?
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.

112
00:06:38.683 --> 00:06:41.161
That would be a perfect name for a class.

113
00:06:41.161 --> 00:06:47.542
But the CSS property is
grid-template-columns.

114
00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:49.773
So grid-template-columns.

115
00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:52.583
So in other words,
we're gonna set up a pattern.

116
00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:56.224
And this pattern is going to be some
number of columns going across the page.

117
00:06:56.224 --> 00:07:03.922
And I am going to type the following 1fr,
1fr, 1fr, 1fr.

118
00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:08.539
Does that mean I have four French
people here inside of my grid layout?

119
00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:09.619
What is an fr?

120
00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:14.148
&gt;&gt; Frame or
&gt;&gt; Frame.

121
00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:15.024
&gt;&gt; Front row?

122
00:07:15.024 --> 00:07:17.878
&gt;&gt; Front row those are all great guesses.

123
00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:19.091
First row, I love it.

124
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.489
Any other guesses?

125
00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:21.926
&gt;&gt; Online people said fraction.

126
00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:23.013
&gt;&gt; Fraction.

127
00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:24.777
Fraction is what it stands for.

128
00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.291
So this stands for fractions.

129
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:30.512
One of the wonderful things about
Grid is we do not have to do math.

130
00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:34.808
We can just say, hey Grid,
break this page into four fractions and

131
00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:36.585
it will do the math for you.

132
00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:40.563
And look at that we have four evenly
size columns here on the page.

133
00:07:40.563 --> 00:07:42.618
Isn't that amazing?

134
00:07:42.618 --> 00:07:46.229
With two little decorations here,
we are done.

135
00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.067
We actually have our four columns.

136
00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:53.826
So that is gonna put these things all next
to each other with no space in between.

137
00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.834
I can hear the graphic
designer screaming already.

138
00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:57.282
How about you?

139
00:07:57.282 --> 00:08:01.533
Okay, so
if we want some space between these,

140
00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:05.134
we can say gap, something like 2rem.

141
00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:08.030
What is a rem?

142
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.449
&gt;&gt; Relative something.

143
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.651
&gt;&gt; Relative something.

144
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:13.402
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Element?

145
00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:14.470
&gt;&gt; Relative size of an m.

146
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.079
&gt;&gt; It's the relative size of an m?

147
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.903
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

148
00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:19.173
&gt;&gt; Yep, kind of like that.

149
00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:22.023
It's a root relative m.

150
00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:23.285
What is an m?

151
00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:25.002
So helpful, right?

152
00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:27.149
What is an m?

153
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:29.040
&gt;&gt; The leader of MI6.

154
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.325
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice, not that.

155
00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:38.046
The letter m, that letter m.

156
00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:40.986
In typography land
the letter m is often used

157
00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:45.367
as a reference letter to determine
how big or small something is.

158
00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:49.289
So if you have one of those
really fat fonts, your letter m,

159
00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:52.204
it's 1m wide, but it's a really fat 1m.

160
00:08:52.204 --> 00:08:55.757
Whereas if you're using the narrow
web fonts, it's a really skinny m,

161
00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:57.107
that's still 1m, okay?

162
00:08:57.107 --> 00:08:58.803
So it's relative to that.

163
00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:02.686
Here, we're looking at the root
of the document so HTML.

164
00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:05.219
Usually this means 16 pixels.

165
00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:10.414
Why would we wanna go through all
the bother of doing this with rems?

166
00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:15.782
&gt;&gt; So if you change your font,
it'll change as well.

167
00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:19.666
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if I change my font size,
if I wanna scale things up.

168
00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:23.819
Everything scales up proportionately,
right?

169
00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:27.621
Okay, so my gap number here by the way,

170
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:31.901
2rem is actually has two dimensions to it.

171
00:09:31.901 --> 00:09:37.941
We can have, if you prefer,
you could have two numbers here.

172
00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:42.026
We can say our column-gap is 2rem and

173
00:09:42.026 --> 00:09:45.736
we could also say we have a row gap.

174
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:50.135
Maybe you want a different number for
that.

175
00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:52.610
I don't know, 1rem, okay?

176
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.413
We don't have any rows yet,

177
00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:58.782
but you can break those into two
numbers using that type of notation.

178
00:09:58.782 --> 00:10:00.869
You can also combine these.

179
00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.609
You'll also see this done.

180
00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:07.835
So we have just a regular
old gap again and

181
00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:12.149
I think it's 1rem 2rem, yes.

182
00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:14.809
I always get confused
which number comes first.

183
00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:16.565
So it's row and then the column.

184
00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:19.941
What if I wanna have two moons on
the top and two moons underneath?

185
00:10:19.941 --> 00:10:22.989
How am I gonna set that up,
anyone have a suggestion?

186
00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:26.046
Based on what you know or
at least what would be a start?

187
00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:31.205
&gt;&gt; Have two 1fr's in the columns.

188
00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:32.375
&gt;&gt; Change this to just 1fr 1fr.

189
00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:35.027
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

190
00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:37.793
&gt;&gt; Hey, look at that, it worked.

191
00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:41.501
That's kinda cool, so
let's talk about it's probably kind of

192
00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:44.532
surprising that that actually worked,
isn't it?

193
00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:47.440
[LAUGH] So why did that work?

194
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.011
Well, this is Grid trying to be
helpful and guess at what you want.

195
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:55.704
So what Grid did was it looked
at how many figures we had.

196
00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:57.450
We have four of them.

197
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.498
And we have in our template columns
we only have two template columns.

198
00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:04.378
So Grid said, well,
I've got to do something with these

199
00:11:04.378 --> 00:11:07.982
other two pieces of content that
are affected by the grid-container.

200
00:11:07.982 --> 00:11:09.063
What should I do?

201
00:11:09.063 --> 00:11:13.353
Well, I'll just wrap around and
put them in the next row, okay?

202
00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:17.513
Now we can declare rows as well.

203
00:11:17.513 --> 00:11:22.415
I often don't because I think usually
columns is efficient for this very reason.

204
00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:27.000
This is called the intrinsic properties
of Grid, that it's gonna try to guess for

205
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.199
you, but you can call out your
rows as well if you prefer.
