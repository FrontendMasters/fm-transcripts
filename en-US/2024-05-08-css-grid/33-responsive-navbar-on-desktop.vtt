1
00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:04.873
So, the next thing I want
you to try doing Is this,

2
00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:08.774
when you are on a desktop-based system,

3
00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:13.231
what you wanna do is put
the logo in the middle and

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:19.820
shove your navigation two items to
the right and two items to the left.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.457
Can anyone think of a way of
how that magic might work?

6
00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:31.149
Yeah.

7
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.724
&gt;&gt; Justify center instead of start,
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:36.568
&gt;&gt; It's okay.
&gt;&gt; You had it actually

9
00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:37.766
at the beginning, the wrap.

10
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.300
The wrap started at the center
instead of at the end.

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.741
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
we're gonna need to center things, right?

12
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.063
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Online change our order.

13
00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:49.796
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna have
to change our order, right,

14
00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:55.331
the Flexbox order property, and move our
logo from the very first item to later.

15
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:56.712
What else can we do here?

16
00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:03.774
How are we gonna get
the big space in between

17
00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:07.211
the edges of my logo and the words.

18
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:08.551
&gt;&gt; Auto.

19
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.840
&gt;&gt; Auto margin.
&gt;&gt; Auto margin, yeah, cool,

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.868
so you guys ready to write it?

21
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.229
Let's do it.

22
00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.233
Okay, so the way we're gonna set this
one up is up here on our nav-ul,

23
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:31.390
instead of justify-content flex-start,

24
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.662
let me make this big enough.

25
00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:39.195
I'm gonna change this to space-between,
and

26
00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:45.198
that is going to, it won't
actually look like any change yet,

27
00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:51.680
[LAUGH] because I've still got this
margin right on the first child.

28
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.043
But we need to reorder this first child,

29
00:01:57.043 --> 00:02:01.632
so we can say order: 2;, okay?

30
00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:05.743
So our first 4 items have no ordering
at all, they have order of 0, so

31
00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:06.801
they come first.

32
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:11.849
My logo has an order 2, so
it's gonna come second, okay?

33
00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.583
Then I can say, for

34
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:21.189
my li:nth-child(4),

35
00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:30.306
li:nth-child(5), we can say order 2.

36
00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:34.641
So in other words, the same order,
and what'll happen is,

37
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:37.873
courses in learn still
have an order of zero.

38
00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:42.534
Creative Space is an order of 2,
Workshops Enjoy Now have an order of 2,

39
00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:45.994
because creative space comes
first in the list items,

40
00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:48.725
it shows up before Workshops and Join Now.

41
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:50.599
Makes sense?

42
00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.086
Okay, and so now as I make this bigger,

43
00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:58.326
I have margin auto, hey, cool look that.

44
00:02:58.326 --> 00:03:02.203
I have margin auto over here on
the right side of the logo, but

45
00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:04.039
I don't have it on the left.

46
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.391
So if I go to my li:first-child and

47
00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:16.731
I add to this a margin,
Usually I can just say margin, yeah.

48
00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:23.441
Margin: 0 auto; cuz I want auto
on both the left and the right.

49
00:03:26.694 --> 00:03:29.235
Now we can get that logo in the middle and

50
00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:32.784
the other navigation items
can shift out to the sides.

51
00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:37.558
Cool?

52
00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:41.097
&gt;&gt; Sorry,
this is all outside of the media query?

53
00:03:41.097 --> 00:03:45.311
&gt;&gt; This is outside the media query,
cuz this is the desktop display, correct.

54
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.649
Okay.

55
00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:52.837
Now, if you like this layout,
you can keep it, that's pretty awesome.

56
00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:57.462
But if we wanna override this,
how would we override this?

57
00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:59.488
&gt;&gt; Change the order in the media query.

58
00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:07.256
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to change some order
numbers here in the media query,

59
00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:11.892
so we would say li:nth-child(2),

60
00:04:11.892 --> 00:04:16.665
li:nth-child(3) { order: 2;,

61
00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:20.968
now everybody's at the same And so

62
00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:28.122
it's effectively it's just like everybody
was zero before, now everybody is two and

63
00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:33.218
we're back to the layout that
we had here for a tablet before.

64
00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:38.216
So we've gone from this with
the logo in the middle to the logo

65
00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:43.214
still in the middle, but
now the navigation is underneath.

66
00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:44.684
How cool is that?
