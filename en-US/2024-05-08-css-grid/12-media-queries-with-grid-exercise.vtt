00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.080
So, depending on what syntax you're
comfortable with, here are some syntaxes

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.198
associated with that same Marsh
collage that we just went through,

3
00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:12.470
there's the span and
the area or the number.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.503
What I want you to do is fork it, and
then write a desktop first layout for

5
00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:18.465
this design using media queries.

6
00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:24.447
Exactly what we just did, just go ahead
and do it now with a different syntax.

7
00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:26.739
And if you are feeling
a little bit bored and

8
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.351
you wanna make this a little
bit more difficult,

9
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:33.237
see if you can reorder everything and
make this mobile first instead, so

10
00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:37.211
with a min with media query instead of
a max width media query, all right?

11
00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:46.057
Well, hopefully you were able to
address a particular issue, and

12
00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:50.062
we have the moon pictures here
I had said the Mars picture,

13
00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:53.682
that was a mistake,
it's the moon pictures.

14
00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:58.950
And so, I took the span syntax here,
append for

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.823
the moons of Jupiter,
and what I have here is

16
00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:08.978
a layout that goes like
this as we get smaller.

17
00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:14.627
So we went from stacking everybody
on top of each other just like this,

18
00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:18.645
one on top of the other,
and as I make this bigger,

19
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:22.378
then we've got the text next to the moons,
and

20
00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:27.641
then we have this kind of sort
of a layout like this, okay?

21
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:29.261
So how did I make that magic happen?

22
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.688
What I've got over here on
my content in the CSS here,

23
00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:40.218
basically this first part you kinda
know already in terms of the layouts and

24
00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:45.703
how we pull things out and make them
go to different parts of the page.

25
00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:50.853
So the interesting part of the media
queries, I have a max width media query at

26
00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:55.949
750 pixels, and this is going to stack
everybody one on top of the other.

27
00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.668
I have to turn off the positioning for
the third child, the Europa moon, and

28
00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:05.528
I have to turn off the grid column for
the last child, which is Ganymede.

29
00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:10.698
And when I turn those off, then things
stack on top of each other very nicely.

30
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:16.218
Okay, then the trick that I use when I get
to 500 pixels, and it's one that I use

31
00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:21.440
often, is I just turn off grid altogether,
so I just set it to display block.

32
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.177
And so block, of course,
is the figure default behavior,

33
00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:29.125
it's what is set in HTML by default.

34
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.391
And when you set it to display block,
there's nothing else to override,

35
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:35.606
you don't have to turn off grid
template columns, grid template rows,

36
00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:39.284
grid column, grid row, you don't
have to change any of those things.

37
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.503
We've just neutralized everything
with just display block, and

38
00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:45.454
now everything will stack on
top of each other really well.

39
00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:49.874
The one thing you will lose when you make
everything stacked on top of each other is

40
00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:55.164
the space in between each of these items,
because you also turn off your grid gap.

41
00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:59.392
So, what will happen instead is we need
to add to this a margin on the bottom of

42
00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:04.084
something like 2rem, and that will give us
a lovely space in between each of these,

43
00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:06.949
so that they aren't all smashed together,
okay?

44
00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.956
So this is a solution,
I was very nonspecific about what you

45
00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:17.625
should do in terms of making things
look different with media queries.

46
00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:20.265
It is very likely your
answers are different,

47
00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:24.085
possibly very different than mine and
that's totally cool.

48
00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:27.169
If things look different at all
these different breakpoints,

49
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.315
then you have gotten the whole point
of this particular assignment.

50
00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:35.105
Any questions at this point in time?

51
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:41.129
&gt;&gt; So, as of right now, the way you kinda
described it is let's say you have four

52
00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.242
breakpoints at 500 pixels 600 pixels,
700, 800.

53
00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:47.072
&gt;&gt; Great.

54
00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:49.181
&gt;&gt; You'd have to do a media query for
each one,

55
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.557
is there a way to combine them into
one media query that's [INAUDIBLE].

56
00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:57.668
&gt;&gt; If you want changes to
happen at each of those,

57
00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:01.250
then you have to have a media query for
each one of those.

58
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.840
And it could be that you're just
changing one tiny little thing, right?

59
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.280
I just want the font size
to go down this little bit,

60
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.770
then you need a media query for that.

61
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.346
You may have other things inside of that
media query, but it doesn't have to be.

62
00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:20.012
It could just be that one tiny little
thing, and then your next media query,

63
00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:23.051
maybe that's got ten things,
and the media query after that,

64
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.089
maybe it's only got two things.

65
00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:27.788
And that's totally cool,
the whole page doesn't have to change.
