00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.915
Okay, so I'm gonna save my changes here so
far, and

2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:08.507
what I'd like to do now is show you
some of the tools that are inside of

3
00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.710
the browser development environment,
the dev tools.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.796
And so, to do this with CodePen, here's
the way that you're gonna have to do this.

5
00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:21.250
It's this one, yeah,
under the little cupcake guy here,

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.251
look for the full page view, and so

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:27.625
that's gonna show you just the design
without the CodePen code in the way.

8
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:33.693
And then at that point, what I usually
like to do is, I'm interested in this moon

9
00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:38.846
right here, so I'm going to right click
on that, and I'm going to choose Inspect.

10
00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:46.054
All right, so here inside of your web
developer tools, if you find the HTML

11
00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:50.470
element that is the grid container,
the div with a class of grid container,

12
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.075
you'll notice that it has the word
grid right there after it.

13
00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:57.109
And if you click on that,
it's gonna show you some information about

14
00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.473
the grid that we happen
to be working with.

15
00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:04.993
So you'll see here that we have some
numbers that go across the top, okay?

16
00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:08.983
You'll also see that we have
some hatched areas here inside.

17
00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:10.779
So let's start with this,

18
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:15.163
what is this sort of red hatched
area inside of each of the figures?

19
00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:17.510
What would that correspond to?

20
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.809
&gt;&gt; Gap.
&gt;&gt; That's the gap, right?

21
00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:24.371
Okay, so remember we have a column gap
that's 2rem and a row gap that's 1rem,

22
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.209
and it's showing us that right here.

23
00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.965
We also have some numbers that
go across the top here, and

24
00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:35.816
these correspond with thinking about
grid in terms of all of its columns,

25
00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:40.322
and how we might count the lines
that go into those columns.

26
00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:44.772
So, we start here with line number one,
that's to the left of the grid.

27
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:47.806
Line number two is in
the center of the grid line,

28
00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:52.592
line number three is all the way
over here on the right, makes sense?

29
00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:57.362
We count like humans, not like engineers,
so we start with one, not zero, okay?

30
00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:03.891
And then going down the page we start
with one again at the top here, two

31
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:10.079
becomes the row here in between, and way
down here on the bottom is number three.

32
00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.851
You'll also see that there's some negative
numbers that are involved in here,

33
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.623
don't worry about those negative
numbers for the moment,

34
00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.467
just worry about the regular
numbers that are there, okay.

35
00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:23.847
&gt;&gt; Sorry, how did you select
to have the numbers show up?

36
00:02:23.847 --> 00:02:29.047
&gt;&gt; I'm in Chrome, and this is just
I click the grid button right here.

37
00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:31.955
So we can do other changes
right here inside of your code,

38
00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:35.877
if you've got your CSS up here,
we could make changes here in real time.

39
00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:41.349
So, for example, so far we've
worked with columns of same width,

40
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.765
what if I make a change here and
I make this 2fr, 1fr,

41
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.952
right here inside of my browser tools.

42
00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:56.718
So, now my left column is twice as wide
as my right, however wide that is.

43
00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:01.922
Cool, no math involved,
makes us happy, okay?

44
00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:07.346
We can even make more columns,
so what if I said 3fr, 2fr, 1fr?

45
00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.466
Of course, you can make those changes
in CodePen as well, so there we go.

46
00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:17.553
And as we add columns,

47
00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:20.772
you'll notice that the numbers
change up here on the top, right?

48
00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.366
Here's our one little moon down here
on the bottom in the next row, okay?

49
00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:35.430
&gt;&gt; So just to clarify the numbers, there
will always be one more than the number of

50
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.182
columns because it's
the lines that divide them?

51
00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:41.577
&gt;&gt; Correct, there always be one more, yep.

52
00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:50.901
All right so,
if everybody feels pretty good about that,

53
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:55.626
let's close out of our browser tools,
and I'm going to go back to view

54
00:03:55.626 --> 00:04:00.671
source code here in my CodePen should
be the button right up here on the top,

55
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:03.823
and this is gonna go back
to what we had before.

56
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:08.194
Any questions so far?

57
00:04:08.194 --> 00:04:11.866
Now again, this is the basic basics,
this is like, again,

58
00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:16.774
80% of what you're gonna use in grid
every day is what I've showed you so far.

59
00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:20.840
&gt;&gt; How many frames can you go?

60
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.183
Is it up to one through
how many of you want?

61
00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.786
&gt;&gt; Yep, you can have as many as you want,

62
00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:30.912
you will eventually run into some
limits with the width of your viewport.

63
00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:31.544
&gt;&gt; Sure.

64
00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.752
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So
you may not wanna have like a million.

65
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:35.987
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

66
00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:39.886
&gt;&gt; Right, but yeah,
there's no limitation on the numbers.

67
00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:41.247
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yep, no.

68
00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.632
&gt;&gt; I wasn't sure if was like a bootstrap
thing where it's like you've got multiples

69
00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:45.557
of like 12 or.

70
00:04:45.557 --> 00:04:49.061
&gt;&gt; Which is awesome, yes, Bootstrap
works in the 12 column grid system,

71
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.307
there are an infinite number of
columns here, however you wanna do it.

72
00:04:53.307 --> 00:04:58.231
So we don't have to worry about that
bootstrap math, like this one is six,

73
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:03.014
this one's three that one's three,
we can say 2fr 1fr 1fr, right?

74
00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:08.068
Which is what we really
mean instead of 633, yeah.
