00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.058
All right, we are up to chapter five,

2
00:00:02.058 --> 00:00:06.070
this is the third kind of syntax that
we have available to us inside of grid.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.210
This is the grid area syntax and
some people really like this I find

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.780
that designers really like
the area style of syntax better.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.939
Again, I personally prefer the numbers but
this is just yet

6
00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.076
another way of writing
exactly the same thing again.

7
00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:24.387
So we're gonna go back to
our moons one more time and

8
00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:27.606
basically what we're going
to do is as follows.

9
00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:31.709
So we are still going to have for
the layout of this web page,

10
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:35.616
we are still going to have two columns and
three rows.

11
00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:39.282
We're going to have exactly
that kind of thing but

12
00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:44.606
now what we're going to do is the
intersection of the columns in space and

13
00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:51.013
the rows in space, we can now designate
those as areas and we can give them names.

14
00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:54.031
So, what I'm going to say is as follows,
so

15
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.292
what I wanna do still,
as as we have been doing,

16
00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:02.188
I wanna put Europa over on the left
side and occupying the full column and

17
00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:07.205
putting the three moons next to
each other, one after the other.

18
00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.685
So here's the way that I would write this.

19
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.813
We are going to make a new property,

20
00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:18.625
it's called grid template areas,
what a great name.

21
00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:24.634
And the way we write grid template
areas is a little bit odd looking.

22
00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:28.434
I'm just going to type this in and
then we can talk about what it means.

23
00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:33.699
I'm going to call this feature a,
feature b,

24
00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:37.614
feature c; so what this means is,

25
00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:42.745
each one of those lines
with the quotations,

26
00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:46.120
each one of those is a row, and

27
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.593
we're giving each of the cells a name.

28
00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:57.230
So here the first cell is called feature,
the second cell is called a.

29
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.894
And then the second row,
it's still called feature, so

30
00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:02.847
in other words the The feature
in the feature merged together.

31
00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:09.217
Then we have b and
in the third row we have feature in c.

32
00:02:09.217 --> 00:02:15.426
So the three features merge
together to form one column and

33
00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:19.744
a, b, and c are the other areas, okay.

34
00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:21.549
So that's how you would read that.

35
00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:27.791
Yes?
&gt;&gt; So, our grid template areas,

36
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:31.173
by default, those are always rows?

37
00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:34.381
&gt;&gt; The series stacked
on top of each other,

38
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.893
each one of those would be a row, correct.

39
00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:42.993
So, if we had more columns here, we might
have additional names continuing on here,

40
00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:47.501
like, I don't know,
we might have header, header, right?

41
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.661
So now I have four columns.

42
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:54.641
So here I would have to
call out four columns.

43
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.201
Now b is gonna stretch across those four
columns does that kind of make sense?

44
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:00.161
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

45
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.909
&gt;&gt; Okay, and
c has got something else going on here,

46
00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.596
that's got footer and copyright.

47
00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:13.341
[LAUGH] So it's got three totally
different things down there on the bottom

48
00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:16.458
and we've just made a really crazy grid.

49
00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.977
&gt;&gt; It's almost like literally
taking the elements of a page and

50
00:03:19.977 --> 00:03:22.439
writing them out the same.

51
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.529
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly,
we're just giving them names, okay.

52
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.279
This, of course, is not what we want here.

53
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.252
Okay, so obviously I've assigned some
names now, so I have a name of an area,

54
00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:34.469
it's called feature.

55
00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.244
I have a name in an area called a,
a name of an area called b,

56
00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:40.725
and a name of an area called c, right.

57
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:46.050
So, I have those names now,
I need to assign the names, right?

58
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.270
So we're gonna match each of these
figures up with one of those areas.

59
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.819
Most notably, the one we need
to match up is the Europa image,

60
00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.880
which is our figure nth-child 3 and
to do that, I will say grid area feature.

61
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.071
Boom and it just works, how cool is that?

62
00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:18.617
Okay, now, io, Callisto, and Gani made
here, they're just gonna fill in.

63
00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:22.101
We don't have to actually
tell it to go to a, b and c,

64
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:27.651
grid is doing that best guessing there for
us but we could assign those, if we wanted

65
00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:32.995
them in a different order we could assign
those grid areas as well, make sense?
