WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:04.801
So, the next thing that we're gonna
do is we're gonna take a look

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.087
at the 750 pixel break point.

3
00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:12.333
And so this is between 750 pixels and
up at this point in time,

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:17.693
we're going to have our featured
card over here on the left side.

5
00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:20.882
We're going to have two cards next to it.

6
00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:26.145
Notice those cards are missing their
paragraphs of information, protip, okay?

7
00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:30.396
And then underneath of that, we're gonna
have our other two photo cards next to

8
00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.749
each other, and all beautifully lined up.

9
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:36.827
And then finally down here at the bottom,
we are going to have three headlines.

10
00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:41.219
There are going to be horizontally
next to each other, okay?

11
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.959
And what I've said here is that you
may find you want another media query

12
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.066
around 875.

13
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.247
And the idea here might be just
to tweak things a little bit.

14
00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:54.547
Things may start looking a little
bit wonky in terms of their layouts.

15
00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:58.134
Putting in a second media query here will
allow you to tweak things a little bit and

16
00:00:58.134 --> 00:00:59.208
make it look prettier.

17
00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:05.669
Okay, well, next thing to do, see if you
can make this particular layout happen.

18
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:09.616
Remember, these two cards over here have
a slightly different treatment in terms of

19
00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:12.522
their content than the cards that
are down here on the bottom.

20
00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:22.422
All right, so hopefully you were able to
work through that next media query and

21
00:01:22.422 --> 00:01:25.041
get us to the next design as shown here.

22
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.100
We're going to try to fit
our picture of Mimas and

23
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.161
the Death Star over here
on the left hand column.

24
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.562
We're going to stack up two cards.

25
00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.461
Notice that they're missing
their text underneath.

26
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.041
Stack those up on the right hand side, and

27
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.971
then we're going to have
the remaining two cards underneath.

28
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.955
And we're going to have our three
headlines in a row underneath of that.

29
00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:53.681
So let's go through
that particular layout.

30
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.173
So I'm going to start with what?

31
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:00.128
&gt;&gt; At media and min-width 750.

32
00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:06.577
At media and min-width 750 pixels.

33
00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:10.127
So at at least 750 pixels,
do these things.

34
00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:13.412
I need to change the layout of my page.

35
00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:18.007
So I'm gonna go to .photo-cards, and

36
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:23.550
I'm going to say, grid-template-columns,

37
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.562
and I'm going to say repeat (4, 1fr).

38
00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:32.237
So I'm gonna have four columns
going across the page.

39
00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:35.838
That kinda gets us close,
actually, just like that.

40
00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:39.973
But obviously,
there's a little bit more work to do here.

41
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:49.011
And then I'm going to say
grid-template-rows: repeat, 3, auto.

42
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:50.772
It's actually what we had before.

43
00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.133
I'm kind of repeating myself a little bit.

44
00:02:53.133 --> 00:03:00.765
And I'm going to add to this
a border-top of 1 pixel solid ccc.

45
00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.198
That will put one line
across the top right here.

46
00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:06.190
Okay, so we're putting it on photo-cards.

47
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.473
It's on the outside, so this will give us
a big line across the top of the page.

48
00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:14.854
Okay, then for our cards themselves,

49
00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:19.780
we want them to just have one
column at this point in time.

50
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.126
So grid-template-columns,
1fr, one single column.

51
00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:28.019
Thank you very much.

52
00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.235
We're gonna continue, though.

53
00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:30.991
It looks like it, quote, didn't work.

54
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.507
And the reason why is because earlier,
we assigned positions for

55
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.968
our h2s, for images for
our text, and so forth.

56
00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.598
And so
sometimes when you make this change,

57
00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.168
it looks like it doesn't work initially.

58
00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:48.384
It just means we have a little bit
more overriding that we have to do.

59
00:03:48.384 --> 00:03:54.454
And then I'm going to say my
grid-template-rows within my card,

60
00:03:54.454 --> 00:03:57.657
I'm gonna make use of minmax here.

61
00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:02.942
Minmax, 0, 0.7fr,

62
00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:08.228
so between 0 and 0.7,

63
00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:14.248
minmax, 0, 1fr and auto.

64
00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:18.651
So I'm really spelling out exactly
how big I want each row to be.

65
00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:23.987
And this has to do with our sub grid and
making sure that the layout works here.

66
00:04:23.987 --> 00:04:27.339
Okay, then,

67
00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:34.536
For my first card, my first child,

68
00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:40.115
we're going to say its grid-column is 1/4.

69
00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:44.349
So that is going to span it
over the first three columns.

70
00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.089
There we go,
spanning over the first three columns.

71
00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:51.444
I have one card remaining
over here on the side.

72
00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:57.044
So I actually want two stories over
here on the side of this card,

73
00:04:57.044 --> 00:05:01.103
so I'm going to need to say grid-row 1/3.

74
00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:03.967
And that'll give me two
stories over on the side.

75
00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:13.113
My second card, nth-child 2.

76
00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:21.345
I'm going to say our grid-column is

77
00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:26.314
4/5, and my grid row is 1/2.

78
00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:31.894
So that's gonna put my Titan article

79
00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:36.934
over here on one side of this, and

80
00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:43.956
then grid, sorry, card nth-child 3.

81
00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:49.434
We're gonna say grid-column 4/5,

82
00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:54.432
and grid-row 1, sorry, 2/3.

83
00:05:56.946 --> 00:06:00.025
So, now we have our two cards
stacked on top of each other.

84
00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:03.148
See that I've got Titan.

85
00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:08.912
And I've got, I think it's
Enceladus next to it at the bottom.

86
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.062
And my initial card is spanning
all the way down that.

87
00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:14.810
They look kinda long.

88
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.826
And the part of the problem is
that these two cards still have

89
00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:20.523
their text displaying.

90
00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:25.776
In our mockup, we showed that there was
no text displaying at that point in time.

91
00:06:25.776 --> 00:06:29.824
The other thing, of course, is that
our layouts are not quite right here.

92
00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:32.036
We've got our headline next to the image.

93
00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.678
We actually wanna have
the headline on top of the image.

94
00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:36.801
So we have some more tweaking to do there.

95
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:41.818
So I'm gonna continue on with
my nth-child 2 and 3 here.

96
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:48.219
You could combine these as styles here for
both of those have got images.

97
00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:55.172
So we're gonna say .card nth-child 2,

98
00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:59.426
.card:nth-child 3.

99
00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:03.892
Well, the word is Titan and Enceladus.

100
00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:08.507
What are we gonna do with their images?

101
00:07:08.507 --> 00:07:12.793
img, img.

102
00:07:12.793 --> 00:07:17.878
We are going to put their images in

103
00:07:17.878 --> 00:07:22.608
grid-column 1/2, okay?

104
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.962
So now we have this weird thing
going on where we have the image,

105
00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:30.353
we have the paragraph, and then we have
the heading, and then we have the button.

106
00:07:30.353 --> 00:07:31.391
Isn't grid fun?

107
00:07:33.777 --> 00:07:38.729
Okay, and
then we need to deal with that text issue.

108
00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.594
So, this is actually a very
similar looking next style.

109
00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:44.156
I'm just gonna copy that one.

110
00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:51.802
And I'm going to change this to .text.

111
00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:58.643
So this is the paragraph, and
I'm going to say display none.

112
00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:03.628
And that'll get rid of those
paragraphs of text, okay?

113
00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:07.324
So now I have my two cards
stacked on top of each other, and

114
00:08:07.324 --> 00:08:09.951
they are next to the one here with Mimas.

115
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.695
Okay, now for the fourth and
fifth child down here at the bottom,

116
00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.808
can anybody tell me what's going on here?

117
00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:21.956
So we've got these sort of
smashed over here on the sid.

118
00:08:21.956 --> 00:08:27.721
And in our design, we wanna have them kind
of stretching across the whole area here.

119
00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:32.625
So what is a change that I need to
make to these two cards to make them

120
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.131
stretch across this whole area?

121
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:37.474
Can you kind of describe
what I need to do?

122
00:08:37.474 --> 00:08:44.437
&gt;&gt; 2 out of 3 instead of, sorry,
1 outta 2 instead of 2 outta 3.

123
00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:45.925
The fractions are wrong.

124
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:48.025
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's something going
on with the fractions here.

125
00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:51.856
So right now we have each
card taking up one column.

126
00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:55.636
These bottom two cards, we need to
have each card take up two columns.

127
00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.872
And that would stretch this
all the way across the page.

128
00:08:57.872 --> 00:08:59.569
Makes sense?

129
00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:02.510
Okay, so
let's write some styles to do that.

130
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.983
&gt;&gt; 2 out of 4 instead of 1 out of 3.

131
00:09:04.983 --> 00:09:09.627
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so card nth-child 4.

132
00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:16.406
We're gonna say grid-column 1/3,

133
00:09:16.406 --> 00:09:20.795
that will span us across two columns,
yeah.

134
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:28.349
And grid-row 3/4, that'll put
us right where we are right now.

135
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:33.499
It's also going to link
us into the subgrid,

136
00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:41.372
and we'll also address that
grid-template-columns, subgrid.

137
00:09:44.564 --> 00:09:47.487
There we go.

138
00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:51.246
And then we're gonna do basically
the same thing for our fifth card.

139
00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:57.559
The numbers are a little bit different.

140
00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:03.734
We're gonna say 3/5 instead, and subgrid.

141
00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:08.329
So, once they're both on the subgrid,
then they lay out really, really nicely.

142
00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:11.878
We have our two columns,
we have our headline next to the image,

143
00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:16.548
we have our paragraph underneath, and our
buttons and everything is all lined up and

144
00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:17.561
looking pretty.

145
00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:18.890
Yeah.

146
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.552
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I definitely remember
asking about this yesterday, but

147
00:10:23.552 --> 00:10:28.129
I guess I thought that grid-column
meant that it was starting at

148
00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:31.962
the third column and
continuing to the fifth column.

149
00:10:31.962 --> 00:10:36.511
Right, so if we were counting lines here,
all the way over here,

150
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:41.423
just to the left of the first card,
that's line number one.

151
00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:43.600
&gt;&gt; Lines, okay.

152
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.971
&gt;&gt; Line number 1,
in the middle would be line number 2.

153
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.005
In between here, this is line number 3.

154
00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:53.852
4 comes in between these two,
and 5 is at the very edge.

155
00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:57.925
Yeah, remember, you can always
look at your developer tools and

156
00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:02.383
it will show you all of the numbers
right there in your developer tools.

157
00:11:02.383 --> 00:11:07.427
Okay, and then the last part here are
these headlines down here at the bottom.

158
00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:11.243
We wanna put these all right
next to each other in a row.

159
00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:16.084
So let us add the styles there for that.

160
00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:17.975
We're going to go to additional.

161
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.747
That is the class of my ul there.

162
00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:24.767
I'm gonna say padding 0.

163
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.674
We're gonna switch it over
to no padding at all.

164
00:11:27.674 --> 00:11:32.232
We're going to say display

165
00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:38.378
grid, grid-template-columns,

166
00:11:38.378 --> 00:11:43.142
repeat, 3,1fr, okay?

167
00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:45.859
So that puts them all next to
each other just like that.

168
00:11:45.859 --> 00:11:47.879
There they are.

169
00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:53.030
And then we can give them
a little bit of a gap,

170
00:11:53.030 --> 00:12:00.361
column gap, 1rem, and
we can give them a border on the bottom,

171
00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:06.927
1 pixel solid ccc.

172
00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:14.762
And then for the li's themselves,

173
00:12:14.762 --> 00:12:17.588
.additional li.

174
00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:23.427
All of those li's, you're not really
gonna be able to see it right now,

175
00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:28.309
but what I've got is I've got
sort of three lines down here on

176
00:12:28.309 --> 00:12:32.166
the bottom underneath
each one of these items.

177
00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:39.525
So what I'm gonna do is turn that
off by saying border-bottom none.

178
00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:43.010
That will get rid of those
three individual lines, and

179
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.871
it will be replaced by the one
ul line that I've got there, so

180
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:51.294
that will be continuous instead of
having spaces in the middle of it.

181
00:12:51.294 --> 00:12:57.667
And I'm gonna add a border-right
1 pixel solid ccc.

182
00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:05.062
And if I spell additional right,
everything will work.

183
00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:07.804
Here we go, okay?

184
00:13:07.804 --> 00:13:12.202
And then finally, for the last child,
we may not wanna have borders

185
00:13:12.202 --> 00:13:16.387
associated with it at all because
a lot of these are repetitive.

186
00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:23.618
So, we could always just turn them off
by saying additional li last-child.

187
00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:28.397
And we can say border none.

188
00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:36.438
Okay, [SOUND] so
we made it through that one.

189
00:13:38.548 --> 00:13:42.620
How are you doing so far, okay?

190
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.194
So this is currently at around 750 pixels.

191
00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:52.090
One of the things that happens
on our way to 1000 pixels,

192
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:59.003
if you watch particularly these bottom two
cards here, is as the screen gets bigger,

193
00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:05.258
what's gonna happen is our text starts
to slide behind the pictures, okay?

194
00:14:05.258 --> 00:14:08.106
That is not something that we really want.

195
00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:10.906
So around 875 pixels,

196
00:14:10.906 --> 00:14:16.127
determined by just kinda
sliding this around and

197
00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:21.346
taking look at numbers, around 875 pixels,

198
00:14:21.346 --> 00:14:25.569
we many wanna add another media query.

199
00:14:29.027 --> 00:14:37.731
And this is gonna be
a min-width of 875 pixels.

200
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:44.669
And here for our card, we're gonna say
our grid-template-columns are 1fr,

201
00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:48.546
and our grid-template-rows are gonna have

202
00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:52.534
different heights than
what they had before.

203
00:14:52.534 --> 00:15:01.412
So before we had, Up here,
we had one set of heights for

204
00:15:01.412 --> 00:15:07.055
our columns, now we're gonna change those,
and I'm going to set them to be,

205
00:15:11.442 --> 00:15:16.034
minmax of 0,

206
00:15:16.034 --> 00:15:21.780
1fr, and auto.

207
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.667
And that'll fix that particular problem.

208
00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:27.083
So, as we grow those particular cards,

209
00:15:27.083 --> 00:15:31.203
they will continue to not
be behind the picture,

210
00:15:31.203 --> 00:15:36.138
which is what we want so
the text continues to be readable.

211
00:15:36.138 --> 00:15:40.235
So never be afraid to add some of these
little minor media queries in here

212
00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:42.979
just to make those little
tweaks along the way.

213
00:15:42.979 --> 00:15:46.990
You don't have to stick with just
the media queries that you're given.

214
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.831
If you need to make little minor media
query tweaks along the way to keep

215
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:52.258
your design looking good,
you should absolutely do that.
