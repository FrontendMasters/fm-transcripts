1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.254
So we are moving on then to chapter 11.

2
00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.618
And in chapter 11,
we go back to our old friend Flexbox.

3
00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:09.616
Phew, everybody says, thank goodness,

4
00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.786
something that I kinda
know something about.

5
00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:17.488
So now that you know what Grid does,
all the amazing things that it does,

6
00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.590
what does that leave for Flexbox to do?

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.386
Great question.

8
00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:22.741
Let's take a look.

9
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.246
So if Grid is gonna do all
this amazing work for us,

10
00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:28.674
where should we be using Flexbox?

11
00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:31.471
So, I thought a lot about this question.

12
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:37.349
And what I have come up with are these,
particularly these items as guidance.

13
00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:42.624
So first of all, a series of
boxes that are not the same size.

14
00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:46.979
So remember with Grid in, even though
we can make Grid like different sizes,

15
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.465
those were different sizes all
the way down the page, right?

16
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.230
So Henry, if we said two fr,

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.509
one fr it was gonna be a fat column on
the left all the way down the page.

18
00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.801
With Flexbox,
we can literally have a different size for

19
00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:02.689
everything single item
that we are working with.

20
00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.698
Can anyone think of a structure on a page
where we routinely have a bunch of boxes

21
00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:08.176
that have different sizes?

22
00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:10.323
File, that one away, yeah?

23
00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:15.998
&gt;&gt; Google Photos has all these different
size and different ratio and asset ratio.

24
00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:19.002
&gt;&gt; There you go, that might be
something where Flexbox would be good.

25
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.302
That would be great.

26
00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:21.067
There's another answer.

27
00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.642
It's almost on almost every web page.

28
00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:24.860
I'll tell you in a minute.

29
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.296
A series of boxes that
are not in an even size grid.

30
00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:32.881
So somebody asked yesterday, what would
happen if I want three cards across, and

31
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:36.280
then I want two cards lined up
underneath those three cards?

32
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.841
Not possible with Grid.

33
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:42.327
Grid is designed to be a grid,
[LAUGH] and that is not a grid.

34
00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:45.951
So you need Flexbox in order to
achieve that kind of layout.

35
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:50.389
And I think another thing that we should
consider is that when the same space

36
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.996
between elements is really important, but

37
00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:56.604
not the same width of each
element in our particular layout.

38
00:01:56.604 --> 00:02:01.281
So Flexbox can keep that same space no
matter how wide or narrow each one of

39
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:06.198
those boxes are, that would also describe
one of these common UI elements.

40
00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:10.683
And then remember that
Flexbox is it's in the name.

41
00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:14.024
It wasn't designed to be locked down for
layouts.

42
00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:17.848
They're supposed to be flexible boxes,
right?

43
00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.730
Not really designed to be locked down.

44
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.486
So we have done a lot of hacking with
Flexbox through via Bootstrap and

45
00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:27.528
Tailwind and all the rest of those,
and we've even done our own hacking.

46
00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:30.049
If you look at previous
versions of this course,

47
00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.551
I have done that very hacking in
order to achieve those layouts, but

48
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:37.193
that was back before Grid was widely
supported by all of the browsers.

49
00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:40.810
So here's some examples of
what I was just talking about.

50
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.209
So here's a series of boxes that are not
the same size, but the space between

51
00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.562
is important because it looks weird
when the space is not the same between.

52
00:02:49.562 --> 00:02:52.666
I put a little border around
each of these items here and

53
00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:56.849
something that looks like a nav bar, so
that you can kind of see the space in

54
00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.437
between those items is
pretty much the same.

55
00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:01.603
And clearly the space are the widths for

56
00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:04.167
each one of those items is different,
right?

57
00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:07.425
So nav bar is great place to use Flexbox,
okay?

58
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:11.469
Here's an example of a series of boxes
that are not in an even kind of Grid.

59
00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.565
We wanna have three on the top,
we wanna have two on the bottom.

60
00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:18.570
This is what that kind of
layout would look like and

61
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.944
Flexbox is really good at this, okay?

62
00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:25.331
And so these are gonna be the two examples
that we're going to work through next,

63
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.438
how do we make that?

64
00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:31.280
[LAUGH] And
how do we make a navbar using Flexbox?

65
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.743
Which by the way, very cool,
we can of course change its layout across

66
00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:39.386
media queries as well, so
we're gonna look at that too.

67
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.105
There are a whole series
of Flexbox properties.

68
00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:45.641
Notice there are actually fewer
here than there were with Grid.

69
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:49.763
Please also pay attention
to the link at the bottom,

70
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:54.364
which is CSS tricks link to
all of the Flexbox properties.

71
00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:58.768
And again, we know CSS tricks is not
being updated on a regular basis, but

72
00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:02.332
Flexbox doesn't really have
much of anything new either.

73
00:04:02.332 --> 00:04:05.534
So this is still a really
great reference to use.

74
00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:09.128
And then finally,
you can have your Flexbox Froggy.

75
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:14.187
Remember that these games are gonna teach
you more about properties and values.

76
00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:18.436
They really don't teach you how to think
about the problems when it comes to

77
00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:19.724
laying out web pages.

78
00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:24.578
So a lot of people online will tell you
if you wanna learn Flexbox, just go play

79
00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:29.284
that Flexbox Froggy, and it is true you
will learn like justify content and

80
00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:32.969
you'll learn display flex and
all those kinds of things.

81
00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.788
But you're not gonna learn like how do I
think about the actual problem that I'm

82
00:04:36.788 --> 00:04:37.654
trying to solve?

83
00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:41.718
So Flexbox Froggy, Flexbox Defense,
and Flexbox Adventure,

84
00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:46.020
great places to go, super fun,
learn some properties and values.
