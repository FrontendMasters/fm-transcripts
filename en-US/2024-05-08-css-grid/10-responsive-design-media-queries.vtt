1
00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:03.789
Okay, so the next thing to take
a look at are media queries,

2
00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:08.853
because media queries are an important
part of responsive web design, or RWD.

3
00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:13.148
And there are two particular ways
that we use media queries when we

4
00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:15.735
are working with responsive designs.

5
00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:20.158
And those two ways are mobile-first or
desktop-first.

6
00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:24.260
And you may have heard these terms before,
they are actually attached to certain

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.561
approaches that we take
with media queries.

8
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:30.952
So mobile first is typically the way that
we teach people to lay out webpages.

9
00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:35.570
So we're going to put all of our styles
that pertain to our mobile display,

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.549
our narrowest width devices,
will have not been a media query.

11
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:43.502
They are the defaults for
the particular page design.

12
00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.506
And then we're gonna use a series
of min-width media queries,

13
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.775
so minimum widths.

14
00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:54.667
And that is going to stack on styles that
are going to override what came before.

15
00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:58.101
So we may have a media query that
overrides some of the settings that we had

16
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:58.675
in mobile.

17
00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:03.199
Obviously those media queries can also
add additional styles that were not

18
00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.090
present before in order
to lay out the webpage.

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.634
So we are going to order those
media queries from the smallest to

20
00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:12.186
the largest number.

21
00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:15.556
So we may start with a media query,
let's say it's 500 pixels,

22
00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:19.469
then we're gonna go to 700 pixels,
then we're gonna go to 900 pixels.

23
00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.335
You would never say 900 and
then 300 and then 500,

24
00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:26.208
you would not skip around between numbers.

25
00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:29.426
You're gonna put them in numerical
order from smallest to largest.

26
00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:30.547
Make sense?

27
00:01:30.547 --> 00:01:34.071
Desktop media queries take
the opposite approach.

28
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.873
So what that means is for your widest
monitors, those are your default styles,

29
00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:40.672
not inside of media queries.

30
00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:44.666
And then we're gonna use a series
of max-width media queries and

31
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.524
progressively smaller numbers
to override what came before.

32
00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:53.591
So now you're gonna go from
your max-width media query for

33
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:58.047
900 pixels to 700 pixels to 500 to 300,

34
00:01:58.047 --> 00:02:01.914
in order to change your
styles as you go down.

35
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.702
So, which is better?

36
00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:07.638
Anybody know the answer to that,
with the million dollar consulting phrase?

37
00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:08.313
&gt;&gt; Depends.

38
00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.410
&gt;&gt; It depends, exactly.

39
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.528
Yes, it depends which is better.

40
00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:17.226
So it depends on what you have
as you're starting code base,

41
00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:20.787
it depends on how you're coding
this from the beginning.

42
00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:25.508
What I tend to do is I use a lot of
desktop-first media queries often

43
00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:27.194
with navigation bars,

44
00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:32.861
because we go from usually very simple
styling on a navigation bar on a desktop.

45
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.417
So something that's fairly complicated
with a hamburger button on mobile devices,

46
00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:39.639
it's actually easier to go down in size.

47
00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.286
For other parts of the page,

48
00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:45.415
we may use mobile-first media queries
to go layout the whole web page.

49
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:50.352
And there's nothing wrong with mixing
both of these techniques when you lay out

50
00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:51.906
webpages, make sense?

51
00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:54.376
Okay, yep, questions?

52
00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.667
&gt;&gt; I tend to like the mobile-first
as far as like the layouts go,

53
00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.898
because I always start with the content.

54
00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:00.482
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So

55
00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:05.133
I get what you're saying as far
as navbar particular case, but

56
00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:10.336
usually you wanna start with
the content-first and not navigation.

57
00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:14.043
So it's like mobile fits my
brain better and it feels like-

58
00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:15.363
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact,

59
00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:20.186
that leads into my next slide,
which is the concept of website planning.

60
00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.984
Back in the day when mobile
devices were new and

61
00:03:22.984 --> 00:03:26.714
we were trying to figure out how
to make these work on devices,

62
00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:31.700
what Mark is talking about was actually
a matter of making a major mindset switch.

63
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.413
To that point in time,
Circa 2010, 2011, 2012,

64
00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:39.967
people had always thought about how
the page looks on the big monitor, right?

65
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.894
And your marketing department people
who are determining the design of this

66
00:03:43.894 --> 00:03:46.422
website, they have very big monitors,
right?

67
00:03:46.422 --> 00:03:51.380
So they had this beautiful layout in mind
for very large device, and what they

68
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.358
tended to do was then remove content as
they moved to a smaller mobile device.

69
00:03:56.358 --> 00:04:00.825
And what LukeW, or LukeW Wrobleski,

70
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:04.041
[LAUGH] did I say that right?

71
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.749
Sorry, Luke.

72
00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.375
What he had advocated was the concept of
mobile-first when it came to content.

73
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.769
In other words, let's plan the content
to fit on a small form device.

74
00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.757
So if it works on a mobile device,

75
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:20.165
we're only saying what we have
to say on our webpage, and

76
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:24.148
then we can take that information and
spread it out as we go larger.

77
00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.808
But we're not taking content and
removing it from the page,

78
00:04:27.808 --> 00:04:30.606
which is the model that
we had previously had,

79
00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:34.651
sort of how we started working
on responsive content in 2011.

80
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:40.725
So again, usually you'll see me working
desktop-first on things like nav bars,

81
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:45.425
but will most likely use mobile-first
when we do page layouts.

82
00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:47.688
So which is better?

83
00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:51.612
When planning content use
mobile first approaches, and

84
00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:57.019
you can absolutely mix your approaches
depending on the parts of the web page.

85
00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:01.590
As I said, max-width for nav bars and
min-width for the rest of the page.

86
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.541
And so, one of the things that I'm
gonna show you now though, just so

87
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.880
you get a sense of how
a desktop-first media query works,

88
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.145
is that we start with a desktop layout.

89
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:15.209
This is not as common as it used to be,
back ten years ago,

90
00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:18.531
this was your number
one consulting project.

91
00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:22.344
Somebody would give you their old website,
it would be desktop-based, and

92
00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:25.218
they would say,
please make this work on a mobile device,

93
00:05:25.218 --> 00:05:29.106
and the fastest, easiest way to do that
was with desktop-first approaches.
