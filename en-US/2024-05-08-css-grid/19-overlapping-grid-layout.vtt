1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.190
All right, so
everybody ready to make an art?

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.490
Let's make an art.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.821
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And so

4
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:09.650
we can use grid to make lovely art things.

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.517
This is what we're going to make.

6
00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:14.918
We're gonna take five of those
fantastic NASA images, and

7
00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:18.570
we're going to do this very
cool thing to all of them.

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.579
So does anyone wanna take a stab at how
we might put such a thing together?

9
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.809
Just sort of generally speaking,
can you look at that?

10
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.689
I can tell you it's done with grid.

11
00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.314
Can you make some guesses
about what might happen?

12
00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:36.819
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to rotate something?

13
00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:40.089
&gt;&gt; There is a way to rotate something,
not necessarily with grid.

14
00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.555
It would be with transform, but
yes, we can rotate something.

15
00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.689
We have five images, right?

16
00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:49.789
&gt;&gt; Four columns and four rows.

17
00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.124
&gt;&gt; Hey, yeah, four columns and
four rows, right?

18
00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:54.559
&gt;&gt; Cool.

19
00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.025
&gt;&gt; Four columns and four rows,
that would put the middle image

20
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.673
overlapping some of those columns and
rows.

21
00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:02.078
Can you kind of see that?

22
00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:05.119
&gt;&gt; You said, there's four columns.

23
00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.804
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you look here, okay,
here's one, right, on the very edge.

24
00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.410
If we put a second column
here in the middle, yeah,

25
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.779
put a third column here, and
a fourth column here, right?

26
00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:27.285
All right, so then each of
these images spans two columns.

27
00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:32.977
Then we're gonna put the Earth in the
middle, spanning two columns but offset.

28
00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:36.786
That'll get us to a square, right,
in the middle of all of the squares,

29
00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:38.595
likewise with the rows, right?

30
00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:43.797
Square in the middle of the squares and
then we'll turn it, okay?

31
00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:45.751
So let's sort of broadly
what we're gonna do.

32
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:46.675
You're ready to code it?

33
00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.893
All right, so
let's start with our beginning code pen.

34
00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:01.047
And what we have here in our beginning
code pen is always worth inspecting.

35
00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:05.240
So we have just a section on the outside
just to hold things together.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.180
There's a div around each one
of these images, all right?

37
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.200
And so there's all five of our images.

38
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.880
The fifth image, the one that's gonna wind
up in the middle eventually is earth.

39
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.497
All of the other images are Jupiter,
Pluto, Saturn and Triton, okay?

40
00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:24.652
So this is also gonna be,

41
00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:27.989
we're not gonna worry about responsive
design with this one either.

42
00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.187
We're gonna do that, cuz this isn't art.

43
00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:33.528
So we're gonna do it for
our one-dimension only.

44
00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:38.712
All right, so let's take a look

45
00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:43.132
at this and set up our grid.

46
00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:45.657
So I'm gonna use my section element.

47
00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:50.316
There it is,
that one on the outside, right?

48
00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:55.626
Because these divs with the images inside
of it, they are all the children, okay?

49
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.206
So just so that you see that.

50
00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.987
And so what am I going to put in here for
my section?

51
00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:04.023
&gt;&gt; display: grid?

52
00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:06.798
&gt;&gt; display: grid,
you guys are catching on.

53
00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.798
display: grid, then what?

54
00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:11.838
&gt;&gt; grid-template-columns?

55
00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:19.370
&gt;&gt; grid-template-columns, and
I actually have five columns.

56
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.199
Let's see, grid,

57
00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.834
I have repeat(5, 1fr).

58
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:33.691
And that's because each of those four
images spans two columns and two rows and

59
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:37.174
the middle cell will take
a chunk of the middle.

60
00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:41.051
And so having that fifth column and
fifth row is gonna help us.

61
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:45.959
So grid-template-rows,

62
00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.761
repeat(5, auto), okay?

63
00:03:55.741 --> 00:04:00.739
And then I'm gonna give this a gap and
I used 1vw.

64
00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.728
What is a vw besides the car from the 70s?

65
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.199
&gt;&gt; Viewport width?

66
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.381
&gt;&gt; Viewport width, right?

67
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.388
Viewport width, 1100th, okay?

68
00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:16.461
So it gives us a nice, even dimension
between all of those images.

69
00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:21.266
I'm using a viewport width, so that the
stays constant throughout all of my image.

70
00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.821
I don't want anything scaling.

71
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:25.061
It's art,
I want it to be the same everywhere.

72
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:31.021
Okay, so then we need to assign
these to their specific places.

73
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:36.911
So I've just done this with
section div:first-child.

74
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.969
For those of you who are learning
these child selectors,

75
00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.114
this is a great chance to go and
learn all of these.

76
00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:46.714
So here's our first child.

77
00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:48.951
It'll have a grid-column of what?

78
00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:54.383
&gt;&gt; 1/3?

79
00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:59.174
&gt;&gt; 1/3, right, grid-column: 1/3,

80
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.156
and a grid-row: 1/3.

81
00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:11.284
Then we're gonna go to our
section div:nth-child(2),

82
00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:14.317
the second one, the second image.

83
00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:18.882
We're gonna say grid-column of what?

84
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:23.092
I'll give it to you.

85
00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:23.830
&gt;&gt; 3/5?

86
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.366
&gt;&gt; 3/5, yep, 3/5,
there it is, there's Pluto.

87
00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:34.780
And a grid-row of,
I'm gonna still call it out, 1/3.

88
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.990
It's in the right spot, but
I'm still gonna call it out.

89
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.515
And then I'm gonna copy that one, and
I'm gonna continue to paste it here.

90
00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:48.393
So section div:nth-child(3),

91
00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.598
Is going to have a grid-column of 1/3.

92
00:05:56.626 --> 00:05:58.855
And a grid row of 3/5.

93
00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:04.056
So that'll put us down there
in that lower quadrant.

94
00:06:07.296 --> 00:06:12.345
And then our nth-child(4), that is going

95
00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:17.789
to be 3/5 for the column and
3/5 for the row.

96
00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:26.539
So if you look at all those patterns
there, we've got basically 1/3 or

97
00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.982
3/5 and various kinds of orders in
order to lay out our main grid here.

98
00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:36.055
Okay, so to put Earth in the middle.

99
00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:38.649
Earth's hanging out
there over on the edge.

100
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:46.148
To put Earth on the middle,
we're gonna say, section div:last-child.

101
00:06:46.148 --> 00:06:48.262
And the grid-column will be what?

102
00:06:50.085 --> 00:06:50.960
&gt;&gt; 2/4?

103
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.336
&gt;&gt; 2/4, okay, so
there it is in the middle.

104
00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:00.228
grid-row will be what, 2/4.

105
00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:05.724
There it is,
the Earth is in the middle, okay?

106
00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:09.500
So now, we don't really have a gap for

107
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.238
this middle image here,
so we're gonna fake it.

108
00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:18.441
We're gonna give it a border.

109
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:25.421
And the border will be 1vw solid white,
why 1vw?

110
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:28.954
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's the same as what we set the-
&gt;&gt; Match all the others, right?

111
00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:30.624
Cuz we want it to be pretty.

112
00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:33.964
Okay, now if you like that,
you can keep it.

113
00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:36.264
That's still pretty cool looking, right?

114
00:07:36.264 --> 00:07:39.437
But we wanna turn it and make it
a diamond and really make it sizzle.

115
00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:40.398
So to do that,

116
00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:45.057
does anyone have any idea how we would
make a diamond out of the earth?

117
00:07:46.747 --> 00:07:48.501
It's kind of profound.

118
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.669
How would we do that?

119
00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:55.524
So this would be transform
is the property and

120
00:07:55.524 --> 00:07:59.529
we can say rotate 45, oops,

121
00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:04.318
sorry, 45 degrees, there we go.

122
00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:07.538
So that fits it into place really nicely.

123
00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:11.088
Look at that, okay.

124
00:08:11.088 --> 00:08:14.630
But the Earth rotated, too.

125
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.338
And Neil deGrasse Tyson is now really
mad at us, cuz we know how he is.

126
00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:22.218
So what are we going to do?

127
00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:25.038
Well, be aware of what we just rotated.

128
00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.518
What did we rotate?

129
00:08:26.518 --> 00:08:28.208
We rotated the div, right?

130
00:08:29.288 --> 00:08:31.690
We did not rotate the image.

131
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:37.267
[SOUND] So what if we go to,

132
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:44.712
section div:last-child img?

133
00:08:44.712 --> 00:08:52.437
And this time,
we're gonna say transform: rotate(-45deg).

134
00:08:54.537 --> 00:08:58.545
Okay, so now Neil deGrasse
Tyson isn't mad at us, but

135
00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:01.866
we have another problem here,
what is that?

136
00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:03.721
&gt;&gt; Order didn't come with us.

137
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:06.219
&gt;&gt; It's an art, so
if you like it, you can keep it.

138
00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.998
But we probably need to make it a little
bit bigger to cover up all those lines,

139
00:09:11.998 --> 00:09:13.399
right?

140
00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:18.708
So we're actually gonna also
add to this scale, 1.42.

141
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:23.211
So we scaled it up,
we've covered up all the lines.

142
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:27.541
And so
now what we wanna do is hide the overflow.

143
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.128
Cuz that's what's going on here, right?

144
00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.198
We have some overflow of the image,
and we can see it.

145
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:37.245
So what we're going to do is on the div,

146
00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:41.918
then we're going to say overflow: hidden.

147
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:49.120
And that tucks the corners of the image
right away under everything else.
