1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.242
Now that you have a little
bit of background in Flexbox,

2
00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:07.307
we are going to move on to looking at
nav bars in a little bit more detail.

3
00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.642
Because this is one of the places
that we're gonna use flexbox

4
00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:12.964
very frequently for laying out a webpage.

5
00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:16.175
We are gonna put all
the focus on the flexbox and

6
00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:19.410
layout here with this particular navbar.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.259
We are not going to spend time going
all the way down to mobile dimensions.

8
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.168
In other courses here at Frontend Masters,
you'll find me talking through how

9
00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:31.367
to set up a hamburger button, both with
JavaScript powering that hamburger button,

10
00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.043
and without JavaScript powering that
hamburger button, in other words,

11
00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:37.062
a CSS-only hamburger button.

12
00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:40.614
So all of those answers are somewhere
in the Frontend Masters library.

13
00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:45.196
Today we're just gonna focus on doing
different kinds of layouts with flexbox.

14
00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:50.661
As always, the best place to start here
with our particular navbar example.

15
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:53.584
And you can get the link for
this CodePen from the course website,

16
00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:55.561
this is the beginning CodePen.

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.271
Take a look at your HTML
structure that we have here.

18
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:02.996
So this is the way navbar
should be marked up.

19
00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:07.392
And to talk you through what all
these elements are, first of all,

20
00:01:07.392 --> 00:01:12.984
the main navigation for the webpage should
always be marked up with the nav element.

21
00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:17.361
It goes above it and
closes just after all of that.

22
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.082
That is very important for
accessibility purposes, very important for

23
00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:21.998
screen readers.

24
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.559
So make sure that you mark your
navigation up with that nav element.

25
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:31.159
Inside of that nav element,
you're going to include an unordered list.

26
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.753
And that's because we have a list of
links, and that's the best way to mark up

27
00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:38.947
a list of anything that goes
in any particular order.

28
00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:42.856
Your marketing department's gonna want the
links to appear in a very specific order.

29
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:48.396
But you can visit them in any order,
so it is an unordered list.

30
00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:53.122
As you can see for the bottom four links
there, we have some kind of a href,

31
00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:56.412
some kind of link that's
gonna go somewhere.

32
00:01:56.412 --> 00:02:00.159
I'm not too concerned about where they're
going, so there's actually no URL.

33
00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.639
And there are the names of
those particular links.

34
00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.565
The very first item is
a little bit different, and

35
00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:09.568
that is because it is the logo itself.

36
00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:14.150
This particular logo is a link,
it's going around.

37
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.412
The logo is an SVG, and I'm including it
inside of the navbar, why would I do that?

38
00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:25.359
Well, first of all,
it links to the home page, so

39
00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.412
it is kind of part of the navigation list.

40
00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:33.004
The other part is, when it is part of your
navigation bar like this, there are some

41
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:38.102
cool flexbox tricks that we can do in
terms of laying out navbars with that.

42
00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:42.036
You'll find that some people take the logo
and they'll break it out and put it as

43
00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:46.522
a separate element, separate from the rest
of the navbar, that is okay to do as well.

44
00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:51.334
Just sort of depends on what you
are trying to do in terms of styling that

45
00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.549
header of your webpage, okay?

46
00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.445
So let's get started here,
writing your CSS.

47
00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:02.762
And the first thing that I wanna do
is make a quick little change here to

48
00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:03.362
my logo.

49
00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:08.252
Right now, my logo is set to
a max-width of 400 pixels, okay?

50
00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:11.154
And of course,
that will shrink down to nothing.

51
00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:16.538
But it is an SVG, so we're going
to assign it just a width for now.

52
00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:20.202
So I'm just gonna take the max
off in front of width and

53
00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:22.896
just set this up as a 400 pixel logo.

54
00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:29.613
Then the next thing to do is
to start styling our navbar.

55
00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:35.015
So we are going to start
with looking at our HTML.

56
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:38.541
And where would our parents and
children of interest be?

57
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:42.708
So what would wind up being our
navigation children on the webpage?

58
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.396
&gt;&gt; nav ul?

59
00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:52.521
&gt;&gt; The ul, so
it's gonna be one giant thing.

60
00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:56.124
&gt;&gt; So the nav-
&gt;&gt; The individual clickable elements,

61
00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:58.250
what are those going to be?

62
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.973
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are the links.

63
00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:02.811
&gt;&gt; The li's, right?

64
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:07.225
Yeah, the li's, each one of those
is gonna be one of our elements,

65
00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:08.553
what is its parent?

66
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:10.557
&gt;&gt; The nav.

67
00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:12.191
&gt;&gt; The ul, right?

68
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.761
So that is gonna be our parent, and
the li's are going to be the children.

69
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:20.751
That's always what we have to identify
as we start writing flexbox and grid.

70
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:26.920
So now that we know that that's in place,
we can start writing some styling.

71
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.340
So I'm gonna say nav ul, and what are the
three things that I need to put here?

72
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.590
Anytime I'm working with an unordered
list and I don't want to show my bullets?

73
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.896
&gt;&gt; list-style-type: none?

74
00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:43.146
&gt;&gt; list-style-type of none, yep, and?

75
00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.393
&gt;&gt; 0 padding and 0 margin.

76
00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:50.963
&gt;&gt; Padding is 0, margin is 0, awesome.

77
00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:55.353
So that's the first thing to do,
get rid of all of those unsightly bullets.

78
00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:59.670
Then the second thing to do is,
we can start laying this out with flexbox.

79
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.838
So we're gonna start with display: flex,
and that will immediately

80
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:09.580
put everything onto a row, and
doesn't that look impressive?

81
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.360
So we have our logo and
we have a mess that comes after the logo.

82
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.262
Cool, so usually, the next thing that

83
00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:22.289
I say is flex-flow: row wrap.

84
00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.619
You do want the wrap turned on here.

85
00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:29.093
Remember, by default,
flexbox is gonna give you row nowrap.

86
00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:33.167
But you will want to have your navigation
wrapping, particularly as you get to

87
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:37.626
smaller screen sizes, you're going to want
those links wrapping onto other lines.

88
00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.021
So we'll set that here.

89
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:41.780
We can't read that right now.

90
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.146
So we'll say gap of 2rem, and that'll
give us a little bit of breathing room.

91
00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:52.171
Notice that we have a link that's
wrapping on to the other line.

92
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:59.501
And then we can say
justify-content: flex-end,

93
00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:07.392
so this is gonna align us to the right
side of the page, just like that.

94
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:13.002
Okay, so now all of the links
are kind of up there at the top,

95
00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:18.292
in line with the word creative, kind of
sort of up there at the top of the logo.

96
00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:21.751
If I wanna push all those
links down towards the bottom,

97
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:23.748
how would I go about doing that?

98
00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:28.780
&gt;&gt; align-items: flex-end?

99
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.195
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I stick a border on this,
2px solid red,

100
00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:38.023
it'll show you that I've got
all of my links right now,

101
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:42.061
they're pushed to the top
of the screen here.

102
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:47.544
So if I say align-items: flex-end,

103
00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:53.902
that is gonna push me down to the bottom.

104
00:06:53.902 --> 00:06:57.814
And our alignment will be a little bit
better, just a little bit better, okay?

105
00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:07.027
And of course, we can always put on
another border, 2px dotted blue.

106
00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:13.784
And that'll show us where
that ul is in space as well.

107
00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:20.104
So if we want to align our links, then,
it looks okay where it is right now.

108
00:07:20.104 --> 00:07:24.601
But all of these items, Courses,
Learn, Workshops, Join Now,

109
00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:29.842
they are aligned with the bottom of
the tail, kind of here in Creative Space.

110
00:07:29.842 --> 00:07:32.455
Cool, but
not really what we're looking for.

111
00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:36.525
We probably want these words aligned with
the bottom of the word space, right?

112
00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:40.653
So what would be some way that I
could give each of just these items,

113
00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:43.837
Courses, Learn, Workshops, and Join Now?

114
00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:46.510
How can I give them
a little bit of a bump up?

115
00:07:50.978 --> 00:07:52.533
&gt;&gt; Padding, padding-bottom?

116
00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:54.527
&gt;&gt; Padding on the bottom would work.

117
00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:56.366
Margin on the bottom would work, too,

118
00:07:56.366 --> 00:08:00.630
makes no difference in this particular
situation, either one is fine.

119
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.695
So what I'm going to say then is,

120
00:08:04.695 --> 00:08:08.626
li:not(:first-child).

121
00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:14.063
So all of the other links,
but not the first one,

122
00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:19.910
we can say margin or
padding, bottom: 0.9rem.

123
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:26.382
And that's gonna push us up just enough to
align with the bottom of E in SPACE, nice.

124
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.166
Yes.

125
00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:36.162
&gt;&gt; Any reason that you decided to put
the list item not ahead of the list item,

126
00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:37.620
or no, just kind of?

127
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.249
&gt;&gt; Well, if you just say not in general,
so if you said not(:first-child),

128
00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:46.531
that would mean, anything on this
web page that isn't a first-child,

129
00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:48.302
that would be a lot of things.

130
00:08:48.302 --> 00:08:51.342
[LAUGH] So we wanna get more specific.

131
00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:55.857
&gt;&gt; I mean, sorry, is the reason that
you put it on line 15 through 17 as

132
00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:58.659
opposed to after the line 18, list item?

133
00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:00.654
&gt;&gt; No, you could go either way, and

134
00:09:00.654 --> 00:09:05.289
the li:not(:first-child) is more
specific than the li by itself.

135
00:09:05.289 --> 00:09:09.343
So then the last thing,
I'm gonna remove my borders now,

136
00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:12.499
they are ugly and
we don't need them, okay.

137
00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:15.159
So remember, right now,

138
00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:19.041
I've actually pushed everything over
to the right side of the screen, okay?

139
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:21.932
So just bear that in mind for the moment.

140
00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:26.312
The last thing that I wanna do is,
and just to keep things in line,

141
00:09:26.312 --> 00:09:28.793
I'm gonna stick this style up here.

142
00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:32.133
This is just regular old nav by itself.

143
00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.334
You might give this a max-width of,

144
00:09:34.334 --> 00:09:39.067
let's say, 1200px, you don't want
it to get any wider than that.

145
00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:42.459
Maybe you'd give it a little
bit of padding, 2rem, just so

146
00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.917
it's not shoved up against
the edges of the screen.

147
00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:50.827
And we'll center it as well,
margin: 0 auto.

148
00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:52.761
So now the navbar is centered in space,

149
00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:56.297
although it is still shoved over
to the right side of the screen.

150
00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:59.656
So the last part of this
is where the sizzle is at.

151
00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:04.406
So I've pushed everything to
the right side of the screen, but

152
00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:09.615
I want the logo to be on the left
side of the screen, right, correct?

153
00:10:09.615 --> 00:10:12.755
[LAUGH] So
how would I take just the logo, and

154
00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:15.895
push it over to the left
side of the screen,

155
00:10:15.895 --> 00:10:20.970
leaving the rest of my navigation
bar on the right side of the screen?

156
00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:27.732
&gt;&gt; li:first-child, justify-content.

157
00:10:27.732 --> 00:10:34.354
&gt;&gt; li:first-child, okay, so for
the first-child, then we're gonna do what?

158
00:10:34.354 --> 00:10:35.817
&gt;&gt; justify-content.

159
00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:36.422
&gt;&gt; Okay.

160
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.469
&gt;&gt; left, does that work?

161
00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:42.743
&gt;&gt; flex-start.

162
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:43.998
&gt;&gt; flex-start's good.

163
00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:45.151
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

164
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:49.039
&gt;&gt; That didn't do anything, why is that?

165
00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:52.288
Refer to your chart of properties,

166
00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:57.930
justify-content applies to the parent,
not the children.

167
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.121
So in this case, justify-content
isn't going to do anything, but

168
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:03.865
James is on the right track.

169
00:11:03.865 --> 00:11:09.522
What we wanna do is we wanna put all of
the space to the right side of that logo.

170
00:11:09.522 --> 00:11:15.157
And so, to do that,
we can simply say margin-right: auto.

171
00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:18.032
Whoa, look at that.

172
00:11:20.603 --> 00:11:22.812
How cool is that?

173
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:26.623
&gt;&gt; So
is auto trying to fill as much space?

174
00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:30.937
&gt;&gt; Whatever extra space there is, we're
gonna stick it to the left of the logo.

175
00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:35.009
And the navbar is gonna shove
itself all the way to the right

176
00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:37.846
because it's aligned with flex-end.

177
00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:46.880
Okay, super cool, questions on that?

178
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.386
&gt;&gt; So if we happen to be doing
flex-start for the whole parent,

179
00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:55.092
it wouldn't work because everything's
pushed up against to the left?

180
00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:57.737
&gt;&gt; Actually, we could do it that way,

181
00:11:57.737 --> 00:12:01.984
we could say instead
justify-content: flex-start.

182
00:12:01.984 --> 00:12:04.671
&gt;&gt; That's the parent one?

183
00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:07.075
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's the parent,
that's the ul there.

184
00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:13.510
And so now I have my logo and
all of the navigation after it.

185
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.867
When I turn on my margin-right:
auto on that same logo item,

186
00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:22.582
it still pushes it over to the side, okay?

187
00:12:22.582 --> 00:12:28.902
So either way, whether it's start or
end, it will work exactly that same way.

188
00:12:31.122 --> 00:12:35.311
&gt;&gt; This makes my previous question
make more sense, right align,

189
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:37.886
left align, it would be start and end?

190
00:12:37.886 --> 00:12:38.968
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; Because left and

191
00:12:38.968 --> 00:12:42.292
right are referring to,
well, it's too specific.

192
00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:42.987
&gt;&gt; Yes.

193
00:12:42.987 --> 00:12:45.440
&gt;&gt; Start and end are more flexible,
literally [LAUGH].

194
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.900
&gt;&gt; Literally, exactly,

195
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.988
because we'd never know if we're
talking about a column or a row.

196
00:12:50.988 --> 00:12:54.909
Yep, exactly, yep, very good.

197
00:12:54.909 --> 00:12:56.613
All right, so at this point,

198
00:12:56.613 --> 00:13:00.171
all we have left to do are maybe
a few tweaks to the navigation.

199
00:13:00.171 --> 00:13:03.915
Often navigation doesn't
have underlines on it,

200
00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:08.521
so we could say something
like text-decoration: none.

201
00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:11.911
That'll turn off the underlines,
there we go.

202
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:18.852
Maybe we want font-weight, Bold,

203
00:13:18.852 --> 00:13:22.841
cool, and maybe on the hover,

204
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:27.877
maybe we want, So my text-decoration:

205
00:13:27.877 --> 00:13:31.100
none on the hover doesn't really
matter anymore, we can turn that off.

206
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:36.448
But maybe I'll change
the color to like #fed330,

207
00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:43.089
which is a lovely color of yellow,
or whatever you wanna do, okay?

208
00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:50.142
And now you have a whole navbar driven
by a flexbox, how cool is that?

209
00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:52.024
You like it?

210
00:13:52.024 --> 00:13:57.110
Awesome, now, this is one of
the situations where I like to

211
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:03.211
work with desktop-first media
queries when I work with navbars.

212
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:06.899
So even though the rest of my website
might be mobile-first and being laid out

213
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:10.911
with min-width media queries, my navbar
is often laid out with desktop-first.

214
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:15.374
And the reason why is because it's
actually easier and takes less code to

215
00:14:15.374 --> 00:14:20.656
go down to the smaller sizes as you're
going towards a hamburger button.

216
00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:23.960
Otherwise, you do all kinds of crazy
programing to set up your hamburger

217
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.576
button, and you have to disable all
of it as you get to larger sizes.

218
00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:31.216
So for navbars, max-width media
queries are often the way to go.

219
00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:35.906
So let's say we wanna go
to a smaller dimension.

220
00:14:35.906 --> 00:14:41.887
Obviously, this is working totally
awesome, until we get around,

221
00:14:41.887 --> 00:14:46.914
this is like 883 pixels, so
let's call it 900 pixels.

222
00:14:48.174 --> 00:14:51.694
We probably don't want that behavior,
right, time to change the layout.

223
00:14:53.374 --> 00:15:00.547
So make your window a little bit less than
900 pixels and let's set up a media query.

224
00:15:01.907 --> 00:15:02.626
Yeah.

225
00:15:02.626 --> 00:15:06.477
&gt;&gt; Is that just kind of because of
the width that we set for the image,

226
00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:08.305
so if we-
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

227
00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.953
&gt;&gt; If it was different by 100 pixels,

228
00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:12.385
it would change your media
query by 100 pixels?

229
00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:17.373
&gt;&gt; Exactly so, so if my image did not
have a fixed size or other things,

230
00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:20.436
we could definitely get away with a longer

231
00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:24.213
period of time before we
have to change its layout.

232
00:15:25.503 --> 00:15:29.496
Okay, so I wanna set up a max-width
media query, how do I code that?

233
00:15:32.383 --> 00:15:33.151
&gt;&gt; @media?

234
00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:35.609
&gt;&gt; @media, always a good start.

235
00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:36.428
&gt;&gt; Parentheses.

236
00:15:36.428 --> 00:15:37.582
&gt;&gt; Parentheses.

237
00:15:37.582 --> 00:15:38.332
&gt;&gt; max-width.

238
00:15:38.332 --> 00:15:42.787
&gt;&gt; max-width: 900px, yeah?

239
00:15:42.787 --> 00:15:45.977
So no more than 900 pixels,
do these things.

240
00:15:47.817 --> 00:15:53.165
So now what I'd like to do is I'd
like to put my logo on top by itself.

241
00:15:53.165 --> 00:15:57.472
And I want the rest of the navigation to
appear on a second line and centered.

242
00:16:00.177 --> 00:16:06.276
Okay, so the logo will appear on
the first line all by itself, centered.

243
00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:11.905
And underneath of that is going to be
my rest of my navigation centered.

244
00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:16.127
Anyone think about what might happen,
how we make that work?

245
00:16:19.992 --> 00:16:24.036
&gt;&gt; Combining grid and
flexbox into some horrible thing [LAUGH].

246
00:16:24.036 --> 00:16:29.205
&gt;&gt; Gosh, wow, that's fabulous, I love it.

247
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:34.606
Yes, let's good to combine grid and
flexbox to make that happen.

248
00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:39.269
Fortunately, we don't have to do that,
but that's a great idea, I love it.

249
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:41.439
So first of all, let's center everything.

250
00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:46.546
So if I say ul, actually,
I think I had nav ul up there.

251
00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:54.394
So nav ul{justify-content: center;}.

252
00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:57.360
So we'll start by kind of
centering things on the page.

253
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.580
It doesn't really look like anything's
happened, because, well, first of all,

254
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.337
we're larger than 900 pixels.

255
00:17:04.337 --> 00:17:07.893
But as you see here, hey,
if we make it small enough,

256
00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.989
my navigation centers really nicely, yeah?

257
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:15.936
[LAUGH] That actually kind of points
towards some of our solution.

258
00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:20.670
I need to get this logo
on a line all by itself.

259
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:25.418
Can anyone think of a way that I might
be able to make my logo big enough to

260
00:17:25.418 --> 00:17:27.123
occupy a line by itself?

261
00:17:30.057 --> 00:17:34.634
Hint, flex children,
it's a child property.

262
00:17:41.205 --> 00:17:45.579
&gt;&gt; Can you just put display: block
that applies to first-child?

263
00:17:45.579 --> 00:17:47.736
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting idea,
let's try that.

264
00:17:47.736 --> 00:17:54.679
So li:first-child{display:block;}.

265
00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:03.834
Cool, that was a great idea, though.

266
00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.710
I thought that might actually work.

267
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.439
Okay, so, what you can do here is you

268
00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:15.180
could say flex-basis: 100%.

269
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.579
So we're gonna tell that li
to take up all of the width.

270
00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:22.505
So there it is,
taking up all of the width, and

271
00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:28.063
it pushes the rest of my navigation
down to the other line, yeah?

272
00:18:28.063 --> 00:18:31.540
Okay, so that looks really,
really cool, except for

273
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.786
the fact that my logo is offset and
the designer's yelling again.

274
00:18:35.786 --> 00:18:37.630
So what are we gonna do?

275
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.350
&gt;&gt; Align items?

276
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.885
&gt;&gt; Align items, text-align: center.

277
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:51.441
Hey, look at that, that looks nice.

278
00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:52.909
All right, how are you guys doing?

279
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:56.292
Good, very, very cool, right?

280
00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:58.381
And then, of course, as we get smaller,

281
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.691
somewhere in here is probably
where we put our hamburger button.

282
00:19:01.691 --> 00:19:03.660
But I'm not gonna worry about that today.

283
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.261
So this is great for
sort of tablet kind of widths, and

284
00:19:08.261 --> 00:19:13.907
then this will jump open to this
kind of thing for desktop, okay?
