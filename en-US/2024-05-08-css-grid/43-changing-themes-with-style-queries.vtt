00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.432
Now that you understand exactly how
container queries are working in terms

2
00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:11.220
of size and so forth, let's take a look
at how they work in terms of style.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.577
And what I would like to do now is I
would like to set up a dark theme for

4
00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:17.740
my web page.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.073
So you've probably done this kind of thing
before where there's maybe a checkbox

6
00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:25.838
on the page and it's light theme by
default, you check the checkbox and

7
00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:27.730
it turns into a dark theme.

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.040
We are gonna do that as well, and we're
gonna do it using container style queries.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.580
So let's get started with that.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.268
We are going to start here with
our example, as you see it here.

11
00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:45.449
And the first thing that
I'm going to do is,

12
00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.944
as you take a look at our HTML up here on
the top, we have our card-container and

13
00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:54.218
we have a series of cards afterwards,
right?

14
00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:57.713
Okay, so there's all of our cards.

15
00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:01.866
So far so good.

16
00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:08.167
Around these particular cards,
what we're going to do,

17
00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:13.385
is we are going to add a div
with a class of color-test, and

18
00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:20.010
we're doing this, of course,
because you can't query the container.

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.642
And I'm going to want to
query my card-container here.

20
00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:28.206
So I'm going to put in, color-test is
gonna be the div that comes first.

21
00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:32.007
color-container is the div that comes
second, and we'll close the div,

22
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:33.892
of course, down here at the bottom.

23
00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:37.252
Alright, so that's the first thing to do.

24
00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:41.303
Inside of our div,
we are going to add a checkbox.

25
00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:46.829
So the way to do this with accessibility
is to use your label element.

26
00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.439
So if you have never made accessible
form elements, here's how you do it.

27
00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.524
We're gonna start with a label element.

28
00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.984
That's what I thought.

29
00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:02.430
We start with the label element, and

30
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.614
we are going to give this
an input type of checkbox.

31
00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:12.921
And we're gonna give
this an id of theme-box.

32
00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:24.313
And then I'm going to say,
check for dark theme, Okay?

33
00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:28.653
And by putting the label
element around your checkbox,

34
00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:31.653
you make the whole thing clickable.

35
00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:36.568
So I do not have to just hover over and
check that tiny little box,

36
00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:41.864
I can also hover over the label and
check It here as well, make sense?

37
00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:46.264
And I kinda think I've
put it in the wrong spot.

38
00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:53.384
I think I actually wanna put this
checkbox inside of color-test.

39
00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:58.802
There we go.

40
00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:00.778
Or even outside of color-test.

41
00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:02.448
Let's put it outside of color-test.

42
00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:11.868
Let's put it just after the h1,
Because that's prettier, okay?

43
00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:16.348
So so
far we've got a checkbox here in place.

44
00:03:16.348 --> 00:03:19.585
After that we have our div with a class
of color-test, our div with a class of

45
00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:22.590
card-container, and then we have
a whole bunch of cards, awesome.

46
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.427
In JavaScript now,
we're gonna add a little bit of code.

47
00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:35.118
So in the JavaScript panel,
if you uncomment what's there,

48
00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:37.753
I will tell you all about it.

49
00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:43.323
Okay, so in the JavaScript box,
we are doing the following.

50
00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.433
First of all,
we are gonna set up a couple of variables.

51
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.933
I'm gonna call them checkbox, and
I'm gonna call them color-test.

52
00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:53.303
First thing I'm gonna do is check the
value of color box, and that is the id of

53
00:03:53.303 --> 00:03:57.783
theme-box that happens to correspond
with the checkbox that I just made.

54
00:03:57.783 --> 00:03:59.957
So we're gonna do a query on color-test,
and

55
00:03:59.957 --> 00:04:03.599
I'm gonna show you what we're going to
do with color-test here in a moment.

56
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.579
We're gonna setup a custom
property on that,

57
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.529
as soon as I'm done going
through this JavaScript.

58
00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.239
Then we're going to add an event listener.

59
00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.156
So we wanna listen for the checkbox,
and we're just listening for change.

60
00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:18.391
So we don't care if it's checked or it's
not checked, we're just gonna listen for

61
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.133
when it happens to change in time.

62
00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:24.083
When it does change,
we're gonna run the color-theme function.

63
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:26.614
And the color-theme
function looks like this.

64
00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:30.592
So if the checkbox is already checked,
okay, or

65
00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:35.294
if it's not checked,
we're going to set it to false.

66
00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:37.224
And if it is checked,
we're gonna set it to true.

67
00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:40.348
Basically, we're just making
a toggle here, that happens.

68
00:04:40.348 --> 00:04:42.568
And we're switching the value
from false to true.

69
00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:49.218
You'll notice that we're testing for
a thing called --dark-theme, yes?

70
00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:50.688
That is a CSS property.

71
00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:55.688
So we're actually using JavaScript to
change the value of a CSS custom property,

72
00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:58.168
the CSS variable in this context.

73
00:04:58.168 --> 00:05:01.632
So very,
very cool way of using JavaScript.

74
00:05:01.632 --> 00:05:05.728
What I love about this particular
piece of JavaScript is this

75
00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:08.882
is what JavaScript is for, everybody.

76
00:05:08.882 --> 00:05:11.092
This is not for styling.

77
00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:13.692
This is for, let's listen to the page.

78
00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:16.752
When things change on the page,
let's make something happen.

79
00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:20.596
And it leaves all of
the styling inside of our CSS.

80
00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:25.146
So I am a very happy person today to
write this particular JavaScript.

81
00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:30.126
And so when we go back into our CSS,
what I'm going to do is the following.

82
00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:32.416
I am going to make these changes.

83
00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:39.447
I'm going to my color-container, we are
going to set that variable --dark-theme,

84
00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:45.222
false, okay?

85
00:05:45.222 --> 00:05:51.294
So this is the variable that we're gonna
call down here in our JavaScript later,

86
00:05:51.294 --> 00:05:52.153
okay?

87
00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:54.463
That's what we're querying
up here at the beginning.

88
00:05:54.463 --> 00:05:57.043
We're changing the value of it
down here a little bit later.

89
00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:57.723
Make sense?

90
00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:02.626
Okay, and if you just do this watch so
far and you put this in DevTools,

91
00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.096
you'll see that this is in fact working.

92
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.968
The box is changing from false
to true in terms of its value,

93
00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.458
whether it's checked or not, okay?

94
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:19.516
And then now to this,
We will add our container style query.

95
00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:27.346
So @container style(--dark-theme) is true.

96
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:32.117
So if it's true, what do we wanna do?

97
00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:37.548
We're gonna say .color-container

98
00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:45.021
{background-color: black; color: white}.

99
00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:56.006
And now, when we check our checkbox,
this should be working.

100
00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:59.057
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Is that what I did?

101
00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:01.589
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's supposed to be [INAUDIBLE].

102
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:02.400
&gt;&gt; And above.

103
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.907
&gt;&gt; Here we go.

104
00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:05.877
Okay, or color tests.

105
00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:08.917
So what I did was I put
the two things together.

106
00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:10.087
That's what I did.

107
00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:11.150
Okay, color-test.

108
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.952
Thank you.

109
00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.757
So now it's gonna work.

110
00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:21.610
No, that's the container for
the container query.

111
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.275
So it is card-container.

112
00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:29.075
&gt;&gt; Line two also color-container or
card-container?

113
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:32.943
&gt;&gt; It is,
I'm very consistent in my errors.

114
00:07:32.943 --> 00:07:34.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go.

115
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.107
Now it's totally gonna work.

116
00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:39.308
There we go, okay?

117
00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:44.626
And if we write even better HTML,
we can get the whole page to do this,

118
00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:49.053
but I haven't written better
HTML at the moment, okay?

119
00:07:49.053 --> 00:07:52.169
In my answer,
I have it working on the whole page.

120
00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:56.636
Okay, so make sure that you actually
write the names of your classes and

121
00:07:56.636 --> 00:08:00.068
the places you should write
the names of your classes.

122
00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:04.993
So this should be card-container
is set to --dark-theme: false, and

123
00:08:04.993 --> 00:08:07.495
then inside of your container query,

124
00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:11.967
the card-container will be set to
black and white for the display.

125
00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:13.956
That's what happened here at the end.

126
00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:19.166
And we can take a look at the finished
version of this codepen and

127
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:23.899
you'll see that we've got it
working on the whole page.

128
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:28.746
Just a little bit of restructuring
here of my HTML, okay?

129
00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:29.652
How cool is that?

130
00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:36.916
Okay, so we're actually using these
variables here inside of CSS,

131
00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:41.974
something we created on the fly,
this thing called dark-theme, which as

132
00:08:41.974 --> 00:08:47.275
we change the value with our checkbox,
that's JavaScript monitoring that,

133
00:08:47.275 --> 00:08:52.072
then we can just load in a different
set of colors here for the page.

134
00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:56.916
So we go from black text and
white background to the reverse.

135
00:08:56.916 --> 00:09:00.339
You don't always necessarily
need JavaScript involved for

136
00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:04.096
this particular container query to work,
you don't necessarily

137
00:09:04.096 --> 00:09:08.103
need to have custom properties
that are equal to false and true.

138
00:09:08.103 --> 00:09:11.551
As I said, you could have,
say, a custom color here.

139
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.421
My custom color of primary
color has a value of red,

140
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.753
then execute this particular style query.

141
00:09:18.753 --> 00:09:22.583
That would totally work, okay?

142
00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:23.410
That would be fine.

143
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.710
You don't have to do things with false and
true, but

144
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.653
it was a really convenient thing
to do in this particular example.
