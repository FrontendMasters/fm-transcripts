00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.902
All right, so now that you've
worked with Flexbox a little bit,

2
00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.690
you are going to do the following.

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.454
You are going to take these
little cards here, at desktop,

4
00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:15.110
they're all going to align on
the bottom on their buttons.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.099
And then as we get smaller, then we're
gonna have three cards across the top,

6
00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.830
we're gonna have two cards on the bottom.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.938
Notice that our buttons don't align,
why is that?

8
00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:28.620
&gt;&gt; It's not a grid.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.286
&gt;&gt; It's not grid,
we're working with Flexbox, and

10
00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:34.139
there's no way to align all
the buttons here in space.

11
00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:40.766
And then in mobile sizes, we're going
to stack these up top to bottom.

12
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:45.896
So let me start you on this challenge.

13
00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:49.940
What we're going to do is start off by
getting all of these guys stacked up

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.616
like this.

15
00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:56.383
And I think they might already be there.

16
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:00.829
That's pretty close.

17
00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:08.547
Yeah, okay, so
when we get to less than 850 pixels,

18
00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:14.785
what I'd like for you to try to
do is code it to look this way.

19
00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:16.274
So we're gonna have our cards,

20
00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:19.040
you want to actually have to
change the layout of the cards.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.565
But I want you to figure out how to put
three of them on top and two of them

22
00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:29.124
underneath, centered on top of those three
cards that are on the top, makes sense?

23
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.243
Okay, fantastic, all right, so

24
00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:39.090
hopefully you got through the first
part of these Flexbox layouts.

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.297
Let's go through what
my answer looked like.

26
00:01:42.297 --> 00:01:47.523
So, what we're going to say is,
you could go all the way back

27
00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:53.176
to whatever starting point you wanted,
what I said was @media.

28
00:01:55.873 --> 00:02:00.186
And then min-width of 600px.

29
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:08.172
Then I'm going to do some
things to my particular layout.

30
00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:14.277
So two photo-cards, which is the parent,

31
00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:19.891
here in the HTML, I am going to say what?

32
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:20.692
&gt;&gt; display: flex?

33
00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:24.575
&gt;&gt; display: flex,
always a great start, okay?

34
00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:29.374
And that'll put all of my
cards there together, so easy.

35
00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:33.931
And then I'm going to
say flex-flow: row wrap.

36
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.149
And when I do that, it goes back
to looking exactly the way it did,

37
00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.005
why is that?

38
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.340
&gt;&gt; Cuz those images are big?

39
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.247
&gt;&gt; Those images are big, that's actually
an excellent answer, those images are big.

40
00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:56.022
And we have not set a width or
flex basis for each one of these cards.

41
00:02:56.022 --> 00:03:00.752
So, when we tell them to wrap, we expand
to the biggest piece of content that we

42
00:03:00.752 --> 00:03:04.855
have, which are these images,
and that's exactly what happens.

43
00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:08.770
It looks like everything goes away,
it's still Flexbox, though.

44
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.911
So we can say justify-content, actually,
you know what, before I even put in these

45
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:20.220
other properties here, let me go on
to the individual cards themselves.

46
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.407
So what I'm going to say here for
my card is,

47
00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:30.670
we need to give it a width such
that we get three across, okay?

48
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.580
And so you say, okay, well,
how do we manage that?

49
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.100
What unit should we use?

50
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.688
What I like to use in this
situation is a percent.

51
00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:45.175
Cuz I never know how wide the window I'm
looking at is, but I know it's 100% wide.

52
00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:51.238
[LAUGH] And so I can break each
of my flex items into something

53
00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:56.705
less than 100% and
try to get them onto one line.

54
00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:02.892
Through a little trial and error,
I'm going to do flex-basis of 32%.

55
00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.165
And that will get my cards onto one line,
okay?

56
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.294
So you see that I have a little bit
of space over here on the edge,

57
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:14.171
cuz these are still flex-start.

58
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.291
I haven't set my gap and
I haven't set any alignment, okay?

59
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.167
And what happens, of course,

60
00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:25.525
is that two of them wrap on to the next
line through row wrap, makes sense?

61
00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:28.605
Okay, so now I can refine my look.

62
00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:35.715
And the way I would refine my look is,
I could say justify-content.

63
00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:39.992
Here I said space-evenly, but
you can could certainly say space-between,

64
00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:41.432
that would be fine, too.

65
00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:46.592
And then I wanna have a little bit
more of a gap in between things.

66
00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:52.862
So you could say something
like column-gap of 2%, okay?

67
00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:56.642
So again, we can do math, 32, 32,

68
00:04:56.642 --> 00:05:00.666
32, add that together, that's 96.

69
00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:04.714
Add together the 2% between
each of those cards there,

70
00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:09.278
that's another 4%, so
it adds up to 100%, makes sense?

71
00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:17.153
And because we have the set to space
evenly, when we come down to the bottom,

72
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:19.846
the gap here is a little bit bigger, okay?

73
00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:21.769
And then maybe we wanna row gap as well.

74
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.259
Let's say that's, whatever,
4rem, just for readability,

75
00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.984
kind of push that down a little bit,
makes sense, cool?

76
00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:38.079
Yeah, all the marketing
people are super happy.
