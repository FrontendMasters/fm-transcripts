1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.490
We are moving on to letter 8E MINMAX.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.920
Anyone ever heard of MinMax?

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.990
What is MinMax?

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.856
What does it look like?

5
00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:16.926
&gt;&gt; I've used it for
numbers, like math.that-

6
00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:17.798
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,

7
00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:19.480
you use it in math for sure.

8
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.022
We might say a minimum and
a maximum inside of math, yeah.

9
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.739
&gt;&gt; I have seen it come
across it like in CSS too.

10
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.235
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and
you occasionally see it in CSS.

11
00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:32.958
As it says here, MinMax defines
a sign with range greater than or

12
00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.142
equal to min and less than or
equal to max, okay?

13
00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:41.115
So let us take a look at our Codepen and
see what this thing is.

14
00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:54.242
All right, so here in our Codepen,
I have my container.

15
00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:57.262
I have three columns that
are associated with my container.

16
00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:00.634
They're all 1FR, right, and
we know exactly how this behaves.

17
00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:02.704
We're gonna have three
evenly-sized columns.

18
00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:06.624
I don't have any media queries,
so it's going to do its thing.

19
00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:11.742
Basically, the skinniest it's gonna get

20
00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:14.634
is the longest word that's
inside of our text.

21
00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:20.341
Consecutor, right here,
that's the longest word.

22
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:22.471
Or yeah, I guess that's the longest word.

23
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:27.421
So that's the size of our boxes here
when it gets small enough, okay.

24
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.021
So MinMax would allow
us to do the following.

25
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.846
So instead of making these all 1FR,
let's just say

26
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:40.670
if I make the first box this,
MinMax 100 Pixels,

27
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.843
comma, 200 pixels, and then 1FR, 1FR.

28
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:47.843
Anyone wanna take a guess
what that is gonna do?

29
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.785
&gt;&gt; It's not gonna get any
smaller than 100 pixels wide,

30
00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:55.423
and it's not gonna get
any bigger than 200.

31
00:01:55.423 --> 00:02:00.318
&gt;&gt; Right, so that first column can
be no less than 100 pixels and

32
00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:03.414
no more than 200 pixels.

33
00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.894
So what's gonna happen as
I make my screen wider?

34
00:02:05.894 --> 00:02:07.944
What will happen to that
blue box over here?

35
00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:11.834
it's gonna stay kind of skinny, right?

36
00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:16.474
And potentially the pink and the yellow
ones are gonna get a lot fatter, right?

37
00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:19.484
So let's just see if that happens.

38
00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:24.314
Sure enough, there we go, okay.

39
00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:31.644
And likewise,
as we get smaller Look at that.

40
00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:36.164
When I get to this point, this must be
200 pixels wide or something, yeah?

41
00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:42.864
Everybody stops moving for a moment,
while my blue box gets narrower,

42
00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:47.192
down to 100 pixels,
notice it's ignoring the text, okay?

43
00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:50.388
And then everybody starts getting smaller,
and in fact,

44
00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:51.712
we'd start scrolling off screen.

45
00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:56.330
Okay, we can't get smaller than our word.

46
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.077
How cool is that?

47
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:06.721
All right, so that is something
that can come in quite handy for

48
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:10.811
various kinds of situations
that you might have where you

49
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.666
want to have a column that is gonna
flex maybe only a tiny little bit,

50
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:19.188
whereas the other columns
may flex more freely.

51
00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:24.020
So it's kind of like a responsive design
effect that's happening anytime to

52
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.629
one particular column here on the page.

53
00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.195
And people use this technique a lot for
that kind of effect.

54
00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:37.515
&gt;&gt; Why is the MinMax [COUGH] what can
we do that's only affecting that first

55
00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:38.095
column?

56
00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:41.221
&gt;&gt; Well, we can actually apply
it to a to all the columns too.

57
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.329
That's what I was just about to do here.

58
00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.956
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I was just saying,
cuz it's like that whole thing's wrapped

59
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:51.675
in a div of a class of container and then-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let me type this out for

60
00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:54.841
you so you can see what it looks like.

61
00:03:54.841 --> 00:04:02.257
So you could say repeat three, three,

62
00:04:02.257 --> 00:04:08.728
MinMax And

63
00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.845
then we could give it a range like this or

64
00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:17.254
we could say something like 200 pixels,
1FR, right?

65
00:04:17.254 --> 00:04:23.754
So never go skinnier than 200 pixels,
but don't go larger than 1FR, right?

66
00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:28.199
Okay, so
let's see what happens if we do that.

67
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.076
I broke something(
&gt;&gt; You need another-

68
00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:34.250
&gt;&gt; I need it, thank you.

69
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.766
Yep, I'm missing a parenthesis.

70
00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.556
Yep, there we go.

71
00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:38.136
That helps.

72
00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:41.304
All right, so let's see what happens.

73
00:04:41.304 --> 00:04:44.117
So these are basically 200 pixels wide.

74
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:48.101
Yeah, and
then they all start growing together.

75
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:53.017
All right, so here we're gonna
narrow down to 200 pixels.

76
00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:55.481
And then we can't go any narrower, so

77
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:59.271
we're just gonna start
scrolling off the screen, okay?

78
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:03.339
&gt;&gt; So was it kind of,
going back to your question,

79
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:08.322
the MinMax is in place of like
a third 1FR, instead of FR,

80
00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:11.194
FR, FR, the MinMax takes-
&gt;&gt; Yes,

81
00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:16.494
MinMax would be evaluated as the parameter
for the width of that column.

82
00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:17.904
&gt;&gt; That's why it's only for the first one.

83
00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:18.604
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, yeah.

84
00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:19.526
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And then when you do repeat,

85
00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:20.607
it gets all of them, obviously.

86
00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:23.343
&gt;&gt; Then it gets all of them,
exactly, exactly.

87
00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:28.021
Yep, so the last thing I
wanna demonstrate while we're

88
00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:32.973
here is the concept called auto fit and
auto fill.

89
00:05:32.973 --> 00:05:35.963
Okay, auto fit and auto fill.

90
00:05:35.963 --> 00:05:39.248
This will actually make grid kind of
behave a little bit more like flexbox.

91
00:05:39.248 --> 00:05:42.780
[NOISE] Who knew that that was a thing.

92
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.085
But let's see how that works here.

93
00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:48.562
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say this, just to start,

94
00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:50.765
let's just try out the syntax.

95
00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:53.922
So repeat, instead of saying three,

96
00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:59.905
I'm just gonna say auto-fit,
MinMax 200 pixels, 1FR.

97
00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:07.525
Okay, so what I'm asking you to do is say,
fit columns across the screen.

98
00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:11.775
I want them no narrower than
100 pixels no wider than 1FR.

99
00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:14.685
So what gonna happen as I
make the screen bigger?

100
00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:15.845
Anyone want to take a guess?

101
00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:21.208
&gt;&gt; It's gonna get no wider than 1FR so

102
00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:25.663
that the next one's gonna
go in to fill that space.

103
00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:26.493
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

104
00:06:26.493 --> 00:06:31.421
So as I make this bigger, it's gonna
grow until I have enough room to

105
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.823
add one more column at 200 pixels wide.

106
00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:36.228
Boom, there it is.

107
00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:40.903
And then it's gonna continue to
grow until I have enough room

108
00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:44.580
to get another column
in at 200 pixels wide.

109
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.240
And it's gonna continue to stretch
all the way across the screen.

110
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.193
So you see how everybody's
growing together.

111
00:06:53.193 --> 00:06:57.200
Okay, and now I'm gonna have
to zoom out a little bit.

112
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.430
Okay, so
if I start to squash these up again,

113
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.298
it'll get narrower until we can't fit
six 200 pixel wide boxes on the screen.

114
00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:09.883
In which case,
one is gonna go to the next row and

115
00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:14.287
the rest of them are going to
expand to fill that whole row.

116
00:07:14.287 --> 00:07:15.627
See what I'm saying?

117
00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:21.475
Okay so we're gonna squash the boxes
together until they get too narrow,

118
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:24.867
we can't have it, drops to the next line,

119
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:28.823
and the other boxes are gonna expand,
right?

120
00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.443
So that is auto fit.

121
00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.901
What do you think autofill will do?

122
00:07:39.603 --> 00:07:43.241
We have no idea, autofill.

123
00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:48.732
Okay, so if we do autofill,
we're gonna get narrower and

124
00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:54.571
then we expand, narrower and
expand, narrower and expand.

125
00:07:54.571 --> 00:08:00.432
So this is kind of Flexbox
kind of behavior, right?

126
00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:03.792
So we start with all of our
boxes on top of each other.

127
00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:05.037
As we get larger,

128
00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:10.552
then those boxes are just gonna
continue to wrap onto another line.

129
00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:13.312
When they're at least 200 pixels wide,
then there's room for them.

130
00:08:15.582 --> 00:08:16.404
Just like that.

131
00:08:19.393 --> 00:08:22.085
Okay, but here's the difference.

132
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.182
When this gets really wide,
like it is here,

133
00:08:25.182 --> 00:08:28.364
see how we have the space
over here on the side?

134
00:08:31.224 --> 00:08:32.999
So we don't have room anymore,

135
00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:37.385
we don't have any more columns to
put there that are 200 pixels wide.

136
00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:42.296
So what happens is we wind up with
boxes that are going across the screen,

137
00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:45.770
but they're all the way
over on the side like this.

138
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.223
If I was to switch this
from auto fill to auto fit.

139
00:08:56.314 --> 00:08:57.738
If I can see what I'm doing.

140
00:08:58.838 --> 00:08:59.791
It's very tiny.

141
00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:05.196
See, auto fit is gonna stretch those boxes
to fill whatever space is available to

142
00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:07.361
them, whereas autofill will not.

143
00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:10.523
So this is something that may be
helpful to you, for those of you who

144
00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:14.321
are thinking about Flexbox and you're
like, well, I really love my Flexbox.

145
00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:17.888
I love the fact that I can have
an infinite number of boxes all in a row

146
00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:18.870
like this.

147
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.577
Grid can kinda do that too and
it would look like this.
