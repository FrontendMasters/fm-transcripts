00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.976
So our first card has different
behaviors through these break points, so

2
00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:08.810
we wanna set up styles for
it as a featured card.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.261
The featured card actually never
changes layout once it's initially set.

4
00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:17.841
Okay, so if we look again on our demo,

5
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:23.719
look at the layout of our featured
card here, let me make it small, okay?

6
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:28.189
So we have picture,
headline, text, button.

7
00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.051
As I make this bigger,
the rest of the page is changing, but

8
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:32.439
look at this featured item.

9
00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.750
It's not changing at all, is it?

10
00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:42.837
It stays exactly the same the entire time.

11
00:00:42.837 --> 00:00:43.587
Everybody see that?

12
00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:46.137
Cool?

13
00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:49.795
We didn't realize that was happening,

14
00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.677
because we were thinking
about media queries.

15
00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.117
We were not thinking about
how each card is behaving.

16
00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:57.659
Now what I would like for
you to do is take that featured card,

17
00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.993
and I would like you to try to
write some container queries

18
00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.553
reflecting the fact that this
design never changes, okay?

19
00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:06.233
And I'll show you my
answer in just a minute.

20
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.528
Okay, so here's the way I'm going
to handle this particular issue.

21
00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:18.111
The first thing I'm going to do is my
very first card which is the one that

22
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.588
is our featured card.

23
00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:21.172
I'm gonna change it completely.

24
00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:23.462
I'm not even gonna leave
the card part with it.

25
00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:26.312
I'm gonna call it just featured, okay?

26
00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:31.042
And that means I'm gonna need
to set up some featured queries.

27
00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:35.042
So immediately, as soon as I do that,
all of my other cards have

28
00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:39.752
got whatever layout you got at this
particular width of the design.

29
00:01:39.752 --> 00:01:42.401
But my featured card
immediately looks different.

30
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:47.707
So I'm now gonna set up my featured card.

31
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:57.396
.featured, and container name is featured,

32
00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:02.763
and container type is in line size.

33
00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:06.238
Remember in line size, it's always gonna
be that thing, you just put it in,

34
00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:08.172
you can call it whatever
you wanna call it.

35
00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:12.942
Then I'm gonna write my container
queries just for the featured card.

36
00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:20.210
So @container featured and
a min width of 200 pixels.

37
00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.318
The article will be padding= 1 rem,

38
00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:32.114
display= grid, and gap= 1 rem.

39
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:36.311
Okay, so if that feels familiar,

40
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:40.217
we actually kind of wrote that
style earlier on the cards.

41
00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:44.750
We're now actually just copying that
over here for the featured card.

42
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.287
Then we're going to add this article,
greater than sign star.

43
00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:54.262
We're gonna set our margin to 0.

44
00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:56.922
It'll tighten everything
up really really nicely.

45
00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:57.772
And that is it.

46
00:02:57.772 --> 00:02:59.388
That is all we need to do for

47
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:05.374
our featured card because its layout never
changes after the 200 pixel minimum point.

48
00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:10.902
So at less than 200 pixels, there is
no formatting to any card anywhere.

49
00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:15.718
And when we get larger than 200 pixels,
then we've got similar

50
00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:20.966
layouts here initially,
although they're missing their paragraph.

51
00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:25.877
And as we get bigger this layout of
this featured card never changes

52
00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:30.362
even though the cards underneath
are continuing to change.
