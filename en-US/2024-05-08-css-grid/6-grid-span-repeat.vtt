00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.501
All right, we are moving on to chapter 4.

2
00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:08.601
And so to this point in time
we have talked about grid and

3
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.744
its syntax in terms of the grid row and
grid column using numbers, but

4
00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:17.388
I told you there were three kinds of
syntax that are available to us with grid,

5
00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:21.970
and the second kind that we're gonna
look at is called the span syntax.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.660
So I'm gonna walk you through
exactly how the span syntax works.

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.053
And if you open up your
opening CodePen here and

8
00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:34.060
fork that to your account,
we're still working with our moons.

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.373
All right so, I've scrolled down here to
roughly line number 13 here in my CSS,

10
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:42.068
and it says figure nth-child(3), so

11
00:00:42.068 --> 00:00:46.793
this is that picture of Europa here
that we had talked about before.

12
00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:52.539
And we had told it to span across
the first column from 1 to 2, and

13
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.037
we said to span rows 1 as the first line,
5 as the last line here in space.

14
00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:04.765
So there are other ways of
writing this kind of syntax, and

15
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.694
using the span syntax we could
do something like this instead,

16
00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.578
we could say something like span 3.

17
00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:20.808
So, by saying span 3, what this is going
to do is from where Europa is in space,

18
00:01:20.808 --> 00:01:25.766
which is now remember that's the third
child, span over three rows,

19
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:31.025
so from the third row it's going to
span over three additional rows.

20
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.136
That means that we only have one
moon next to us because that's all

21
00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:38.873
the additional content that we have,
if we had more moons,

22
00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:41.590
those three moons would be next to Europa.

23
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.080
So what if I want it to
still be the first item?

24
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.783
Then I could say 1/span 3,
so in other words,

25
00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:56.190
start at the first line and
then span 3 rows after that.

26
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.731
Make sense, kind of sort of?

27
00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:03.491
Okay, so when you say,
just to sort of repeat,

28
00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.755
when you just say span 3 by itself,

29
00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:10.886
this is going to mean from wherever you
are in space span over three whatever's,

30
00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:16.912
we could do this was three columns or
three rows, in this case it's three rows.

31
00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:21.863
If you give it a starting point
with a number, then it will span 3

32
00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:26.739
from that particular starting point,
so from 1 span over 3.

33
00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.249
Make sense, kind of, sort of?

34
00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:35.617
Okay, so by that logic,
when we're here at grid column,

35
00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:41.765
we really only have to say 1,
by default it will span to 2, okay?

36
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:47.735
Now, just cuz you can say just one doesn't
necessarily mean that this is the best to

37
00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:53.808
communicate to all of the other people who
are gonna be writing code with you, yeah?

38
00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:58.259
I think 1/2 looks a little bit more
intuitive than we're really clear about

39
00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.833
what's going on here, but
in this case you could just say 1 and

40
00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.196
it will work just fine.

41
00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:14.172
Okay, so how about this last child,
Ganymede, down here?

42
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:19.399
So if I said figure last-child,

43
00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:29.418
And I want this one to span across two
columns, just to show you how that works,

44
00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:33.848
what would I put here for
grid-column using the span syntax?

45
00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.119
So if I want Ganymede to
span over two columns, and

46
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.650
I wanna use the span syntax,
what would I write here for grid column?

47
00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:54.605
&gt;&gt; n1/ or 1/span.

48
00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.424
&gt;&gt; 1/span 1, yeah, there you go.

49
00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:09.288
So, start over here in the first column,
span over two columns,

50
00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:12.616
that does exactly what it should be doing.

51
00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:16.609
Like I said in a lot of cases you can just
stick with the numbers if you're totally

52
00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.603
fine, I find the numbers really into
Intuitive and I use them a lot.

53
00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:24.817
Span becomes helpful if you are going
to write a more generic style and

54
00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:29.483
you want it to just span over two,
whatever, I want it span over three rows.

55
00:04:29.483 --> 00:04:33.324
Whenever I sign this class,
the thing is gonna span over three rows,

56
00:04:33.324 --> 00:04:36.853
wherever it is in space,
that might be useful for that, okay?

57
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.791
The other thing I want to introduce
at this point is up here on our

58
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.101
grid container.

59
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:47.468
Now to this point, we have been writing
out however many columns we have, and that

60
00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:52.053
hasn't been a big deal because we have two
columns or we have three columns, so what?

61
00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:55.507
But sometimes you might wind
up with ten columns, and

62
00:04:55.507 --> 00:05:01.729
writing 1fr ten times in a row it's a real
pain in the neck, wouldn't you agree?

63
00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.999
Okay, so there is a better syntax for
this, and that is the repeat syntax.

64
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.555
So, we can swap this out for repeat, and

65
00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:15.639
then I would say 2, 1fr.

66
00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.825
Nothing is gonna change here
in the way the page looks,

67
00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:22.464
this is exactly the same thing, so

68
00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:27.573
now I'm telling it to make two
columns that are 1fr, make sense?

69
00:05:30.123 --> 00:05:34.238
So for my grid template rows where
I have three autos in a row,

70
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:37.397
how would I write this
with the repeat syntax?

71
00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:39.834
What would I say here?

72
00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.198
&gt;&gt; Repeat three auto.

73
00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:45.828
&gt;&gt; Repeat 3, auto, exactly.

74
00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:49.487
So the number, comma, the size,

75
00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:54.183
whatever that size happens to be,
FRs are really convenient,

76
00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:59.070
autos are convenient for rows,
could be anything, make sense?

77
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.667
Okay, fantastic, so

78
00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.970
those mean exactly the same thing,
you can write them however you want.
