00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.695
There are some things you can do with
grid that you may not necessarily

2
00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.885
think about in terms of design.

3
00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.432
You just don't even realize that
you can do these kinds of things.

4
00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:14.776
So one of these tricks that I just love
is the ability to overlap grid cells.

5
00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:18.828
And so I wanted to go through how we would
go about overlapping grid cells here.

6
00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:23.029
So in 8A, let's look at these overlapping
grid cells and figure out how they work.

7
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.421
So if we open up that CodePen, You'll

8
00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:34.395
see here that we have four of our
lovely planet pictures, so awesome.

9
00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:38.470
And underneath of those,
we have captions that go with them, right?

10
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.493
Saturn and the moons, Jupiter, we have
Triton and Neptune, Pluto and Charon.

11
00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:49.868
Okay, and
these are marked up as these are marked

12
00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:56.434
up as figures just as we saw them
earlier so we have a figure.

13
00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:02.414
The figure has two children it has an
image and it has a figure caption, yeah?

14
00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:07.233
Okay, so it's always good to take a look
at your structure of your HTML and

15
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:12.696
start thinking about where we could have
parents and children as we do our layouts.

16
00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:17.225
So here, our figure contains two children.

17
00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:23.937
What I'd like to do is I'd like to put
my caption on top of this image, okay?

18
00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:26.729
So rather than having
the caption underneath,

19
00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.043
I want that caption on top of the image.

20
00:01:29.043 --> 00:01:32.167
So let's go through how we
would make that magic happen.

21
00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:37.576
So first of all, I've got this
set to a min width of 600 pixels,

22
00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:42.613
which sets This is up with this
layout of the two by two images.

23
00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:45.908
I'm just gonna say we want
this to happen at this point.

24
00:01:45.908 --> 00:01:49.921
So I'm gonna put this inside of the media
query, but obviously you could have put

25
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.831
this outside of the media query and
then it would work throughout your design.

26
00:01:53.831 --> 00:02:00.285
I'm gonna say my fig caption,
let's change the way this look.

27
00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:04.623
So we'll give it a background

28
00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.314
color of 001219, okay?

29
00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:12.479
Which is a lovely shade of black.

30
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.365
We'll set the text color to white, so

31
00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:21.345
that we can actually read it and
maybe we'll give

32
00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:26.331
it a little bit of padding,
like one rem, okay?

33
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:30.045
So actually,
that looks cool just like that [LAUGH].

34
00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:35.716
It's not a bad look, but that is just
the starting point of our process.

35
00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:39.367
So now what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna take my figure and

36
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.965
I'm gonna To set it to display for grid.

37
00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:45.332
Grid, it will have two children and
it will have the image and

38
00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.189
it will have the figure caption.

39
00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.295
For the figure itself,
we'll say display grid and

40
00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:58.407
then we'll say grid template columns 1fr

41
00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:03.807
because there's only one column, okay.?

42
00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:08.208
And then I'm going to say my grid

43
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.941
template rows are 70% 30%.

44
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:17.686
So I'm not using something like pixels or
fr or whatever rims or

45
00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:22.354
anything else for my temple rows,
I'm just using percents.

46
00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:27.562
Whatever space is available,
assign 70% of it to the top row and

47
00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:32.313
30% of it to the bottom row,
whatever that happens to be.

48
00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:39.336
Okay, now we need our image to
stretch across all of the rows.

49
00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:42.854
So what would my value be for grid row?

50
00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:53.954
I need my image to stretch all the way
across, be the whole height of the figure.

51
00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:59.430
So all of my rows,
what are my numbers for grid row?

52
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.021
&gt;&gt; 1 to -1?

53
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:05.621
&gt;&gt; 1 to -1, sure?

54
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.235
I think that works.

55
00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:12.495
Although I'm a little concerned
about where my figure caption went.

56
00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:17.735
So I'm gonna change it to 1 to 3.

57
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:20.357
I'm still concerned where my figure
caption went, but that's okay.

58
00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:22.293
We'll just continue on and

59
00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:27.588
then I'm going to say my image is
going to be in the grid column.

60
00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:34.597
I know where my it went, 1/2, okay?

61
00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:36.530
And I have a note here in my notes.

62
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.889
It may look like the captions disappeared,
but don't panic.

63
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.134
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Don't panic, all right?

64
00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:48.623
Okay, so next we'll have the figure
caption display the same column and

65
00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.104
in the bottom row only.

66
00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:55.781
So for my fig caption, make sure
you have a style for that up here,

67
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:01.869
so we can just continue to add to that
I am going to say, grid column 1,

68
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:06.537
2, I actually want it in
the same column as my image.

69
00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:12.816
And my grid row will be 2/3.

70
00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:13.885
There it is.

71
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:16.954
See how it's overlapping the image now?

72
00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:20.030
See how it took a bite
out of all those images?

73
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.976
Okay, so it looks good.

74
00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:28.637
What would look better if
we add some opacity of 0.7,

75
00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:32.614
make it a little bit see through.

76
00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:37.976
Nice, and so then the last problem that
we have here is that the HTML inside

77
00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:42.907
of each of these captions,
inside of the caption, we have an h2 and

78
00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:48.817
we have a paragraph both of which have
some default margin associated with them.

79
00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:53.510
And that is what's causing this weird
cut off of the text here on the page.

80
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.135
So, what I can say here then,

81
00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:03.412
in my CSS is Figcaption

82
00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:08.601
greater than signed star.

83
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:13.113
In other words, for all of the children
of figure caption that would

84
00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:17.562
be the H2 in the paragraph,
we wanna set the margin to 0.5 rem.

85
00:06:17.562 --> 00:06:21.115
So we're just gonna tighten up
those margins a little bit, and

86
00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:23.941
then we'll pull the text
here up onto the screen.

87
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:27.290
So pretty, what do you think?

88
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.851
So we didn't have to use
absolute positioning and

89
00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:36.888
relative positioning because we all know
how that makes your brains explode, yes?

90
00:06:36.888 --> 00:06:42.859
We can just use overlapping grid cells,
it's a much nicer world to live in, okay?

91
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.759
Any questions on this?

92
00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.009
&gt;&gt; When you get smaller
towards that 600 pixel mark.

93
00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:55.543
&gt;&gt; Yep.

94
00:06:55.543 --> 00:07:00.604
&gt;&gt; Everything kind of gets shifted down.

95
00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:01.709
If you go a little bit bigger.

96
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.310
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

97
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.874
&gt;&gt; Right there.

98
00:07:05.874 --> 00:07:08.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Add padding to the bottom so

99
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.865
that both of those are centered
in that caption box.

100
00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.191
&gt;&gt; You could.

101
00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:18.702
Probably what's causing this issue right
now is that our grid template rows are set

102
00:07:18.702 --> 00:07:19.870
to 70%, 30%.

103
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.477
So we could change that to 60, 40.

104
00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:26.681
Right?

105
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And maybe what we need to do,

106
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.370
because this is now, so this is 600, and

107
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.534
then maybe by 700,
it's a little bit too much, right?

108
00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:43.497
So what we could do then is we can
do another media query, exactly.

109
00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:51.410
So we could say @media min-width 700px.

110
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.683
And then we could say for our figure.

111
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.685
And this may be the only thing
in this media query, figure.

112
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.425
Grid template rows will go to 70 30.

113
00:08:08.602 --> 00:08:10.508
There's nothing that
says you can't do that.

114
00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:14.156
You don't have to have a million billion
styles on every media query, right?

115
00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:20.609
So we could tweak it so
that it works there until it goes there.

116
00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:25.687
And the only crazy people who sit here and
do this on websites are us.

117
00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:28.948
So normal people won't do this,
and it'll be fine.
