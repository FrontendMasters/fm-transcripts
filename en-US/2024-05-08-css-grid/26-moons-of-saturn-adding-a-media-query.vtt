1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.320
All right, so let's move on then.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.340
The next thing you wanna code
is the very first breakpoint.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.540
This is for sizes of the screen that
are 500 pixels wide and larger.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.950
This is how it's going to look.

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.941
So remember,

6
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:18.144
what we're going to have to do is we're
gonna have to think about how we're

7
00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:23.531
going to make changes from our mobile
design into our first breakpoint here.

8
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:28.141
We now have two grid systems going on,
we have one within each card.

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.834
And we have one to lay all of
the cards out on the page.

10
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:37.144
So we've got, our featured card at the top
looks pretty much like it did before.

11
00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:40.647
We have our individual
cards inside of this.

12
00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:44.813
And a little subtle change here before
the image had gone all the way down

13
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:45.937
the screen.

14
00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:49.082
Now the image is even with the headline,
and

15
00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.655
then we have our headlines
down here underneath.

16
00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:01.892
So I hope you all did okay on this very
first media query that we have here

17
00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:03.823
inside of our layout.

18
00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.275
Make sure, first of all,

19
00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:08.953
that you have made your screen
large enough to see your changes.

20
00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:11.803
That's always the first error
that's very easy to make.

21
00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:15.843
If you have your screen set too small,
it will, quote, nothing will work.

22
00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.393
And that can be very frustrating.

23
00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:23.319
So make sure that you've got your screen
just slightly larger than your media

24
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.180
query.

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.290
And then we'll start coding.

26
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.166
So what is the first thing
that I need here on the page?

27
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.856
@media, and that'll be what?

28
00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:37.589
&gt;&gt; Min-width 500px?

29
00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:43.846
&gt;&gt; Min-width 500px, awesome, all right.

30
00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:48.747
So I've got this media query, I'm gonna
try to lay my cards out on the page.

31
00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:52.269
If I go back and take a look at my HTML,

32
00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:57.157
I have five articles, but
they have no parents.

33
00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.502
That means they're very unruly children,
yes?

34
00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:02.463
So what do we need to do?

35
00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:03.410
&gt;&gt; Wrap it in a div.

36
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.243
&gt;&gt; Let's wrap it in a div and give them a
parent and get some order in their lives.

37
00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:14.984
So I'm gonna call this div with a class
of, you could call it anything you want,

38
00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:19.799
I called mine photo-cards because
that's what's inside of this.

39
00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:24.438
You might have called
this grid-container or

40
00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:27.621
any one of a number of other
things you could have called it.

41
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.543
So now I have my parents and children.

42
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.569
If you don't have the HTML
structure of parents and children,

43
00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.103
grid is never gonna work for you,
by the way, and neither is flexbox.

44
00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:41.602
You gotta have parents and
children in order for this stuff to work.

45
00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:45.677
All right, so
now that we have that in place,

46
00:02:45.677 --> 00:02:49.981
then we can say that our
class of photo-cards,

47
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.542
We're ready to go here for the layout.

48
00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:56.492
So what is the first thing
that I could put in here?

49
00:02:58.142 --> 00:02:58.792
&gt;&gt; display: grid?

50
00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:03.917
&gt;&gt; display: grid, great,
and then I need what?

51
00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:06.995
&gt;&gt; grid-template-column?

52
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:12.281
&gt;&gt; grid-template-columns,
and what are those gonna be?

53
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.273
&gt;&gt; 1fr 1fr?

54
00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:20.883
&gt;&gt; 1fr 1fr, okay, and
then I'm going to also have some rows.

55
00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:23.961
You can put these in,
you might not put these in,

56
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.703
I'm gonna put mine in grid-template-rows.

57
00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:30.573
And this is gonna be auto 1fr auto.

58
00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:39.316
Okay, then I need to lay out
my actual cards themselves.

59
00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:46.108
And for the most part,
my cards are in good shape here.

60
00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:50.426
This is pretty much the layout
that I wanted for my cards, okay?

61
00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:55.715
So what I'm going to do is, for
my first card, .card:first-child,

62
00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:59.444
or you can continue on
with your first-of-type,

63
00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:03.441
because that'll select it, either way.

64
00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:07.802
I am going to say, my grid-column,

65
00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:11.894
Is gonna be what?

66
00:04:11.894 --> 00:04:13.176
&gt;&gt; 1/3?
&gt;&gt; 1/3,

67
00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:18.135
because we want this to span
across both of those columns.

68
00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:22.492
And then we're going to have
all of our other cards that

69
00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:24.866
are here underneath, okay?

70
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:29.159
There's actually nothing to do
with the additional items that

71
00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.109
are down here on the bottom.

72
00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.318
So this is pretty much the way that
this is going to look for now.

73
00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:38.694
The last thing you might wanna add
are some of those extra gray lines that go

74
00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:40.847
around this, okay?

75
00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.917
So we have some extra gray
lines that go around this here.

76
00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:52.247
And we can add those by saying
something like our .card.

77
00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:56.726
And we could say something like

78
00:04:56.726 --> 00:05:01.031
a border: 1px solid #ccc,

79
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:06.198
that's gonna give us those borders

80
00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:10.687
here around our cards, okay?

81
00:05:10.687 --> 00:05:13.133
We could also do something
like border-right.

82
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.510
That generally works too.

83
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.805
If we just put it on the right side, then
we're not duplicating all of our borders.

84
00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:28.608
And we don't actually need to turn
anything off when we get up here to

85
00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:31.493
the top, so both of those answers work.

86
00:05:31.493 --> 00:05:35.753
Okay, so this would be the basic solution
to this particular part of the puzzle.

87
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:39.526
Is there any questions on
the basic layout here?

88
00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:45.788
All right, so this is like the bread and

89
00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:50.638
butter of what we covered yesterday,
this basic stuff here.

90
00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:54.455
Now, if you take a look
at the design itself,

91
00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:59.778
notice that we have our headlines and
our images and our text and

92
00:05:59.778 --> 00:06:04.408
our buttons are all lined up together so
beautifully.

93
00:06:04.408 --> 00:06:11.676
Whereas inside of our layout here, well,
our buttons are a little bit askew, yeah?

94
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.851
And sometimes we have big gaps and

95
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:18.296
all kinds of other weird things
that are going on here, okay?

96
00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:22.569
So, does anyone know what
the solution might be to

97
00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.957
get all of these things to
line up across the cards?

98
00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:28.829
&gt;&gt; Subgrid.

99
00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:33.339
&gt;&gt; Subgrid, yes, subgrid is brand new.

100
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:38.822
Just got started supported in browsers
like in September, but it is supported.

101
00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:43.090
Okay, so if we were gonna go about
applying subgrid to this particular page,

102
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.730
let's walk through what
that would look like.

103
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.480
So in my card style here, what I'm
going to add to this is the following.

104
00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:03.891
I'm gonna say my grid-template-columns,
I guess I changed this a little bit,

105
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:08.538
2fr to 1fr, I've made the image just
a little bit bigger, so there we go.

106
00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:18.397
And then the important part here is
grid-template-rows subgrid, okay.

107
00:07:18.397 --> 00:07:20.652
So remember what subgrid means?

108
00:07:20.652 --> 00:07:26.582
It means latch on to the parent's
layout in terms of its grid system.

109
00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:34.172
And so right now, our parent has
three rows here, auto 1fr auto.

110
00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:39.618
And so our children, all of these cards,
they have latched on to that system.

111
00:07:39.618 --> 00:07:43.881
And they have put all of their
content all in the same row.

112
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.061
All right on top of each other.

113
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:49.571
Not really what we want,
but that's what's going on.

114
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:51.882
So now we can detangle all of that, and

115
00:07:51.882 --> 00:07:56.811
then things are gonna line up correctly
with the underlying grid system.

116
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:02.683
Okay, so card, .text,

117
00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:05.869
that's the paragraph of information.

118
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.444
We can say grid-column: 1/3, and

119
00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:14.189
we can say grid-row: 2/3.

120
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.837
We want that in the second
row of the design.

121
00:08:20.228 --> 00:08:22.833
&gt;&gt; All right,
this is still min-width: 500?

122
00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:25.771
&gt;&gt; Yep, this is all still
the min-width of 500, yep.

123
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:31.681
&gt;&gt; Can you remind me, min-width, it's
referring to everything 500 and above?

124
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:33.931
&gt;&gt; 500 and above, correct.

125
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:39.267
And the styles from mobile
are still carrying into this,

126
00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:44.059
but we're overriding some things as we go,
yeah?

127
00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:49.256
Okay, card .text, and
then we have .card .link,

128
00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:55.034
we're gonna tell it where to go,
grid-column: 1/3.

129
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:57.364
So we want it to stretch
all the way across.

130
00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:05.008
&gt;&gt; It's a little overlap here,
it's happening there, too.

131
00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:08.904
&gt;&gt; Yep, they're all stacked on
top of each other, never panic.

132
00:09:14.598 --> 00:09:17.347
Okay, there's my error, okay.

133
00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:19.340
And then each individual card also,

134
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.787
we need to tell it to span
across three rows of the parent.

135
00:09:22.787 --> 00:09:26.278
That's why everything's on
top of each other right now,

136
00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:28.638
because each card is taking up one row.

137
00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:32.716
We want each card to take up three rows,
so

138
00:09:32.716 --> 00:09:38.723
we're going to say,
grid-row: span 3, there we go.

139
00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:43.523
So now each card is taking up three
of the rows, as the parent would,

140
00:09:43.523 --> 00:09:47.133
the parent's rows were auto 1fr auto.

141
00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:53.003
And so now we have auto 1fr auto for
our layout here.

142
00:09:53.003 --> 00:09:58.235
And you can see that our second row
of cards are lined up so pretty.

143
00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:03.145
And as well as the first row.

144
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.953
Why is the second row,
why are those cards taller?

145
00:10:09.162 --> 00:10:11.513
&gt;&gt; The left one has so
much more text than the right.

146
00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:12.675
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,

147
00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:17.555
there's so much more text there under
Phoebe than there is under Iapetus,

148
00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:21.745
I think is how you pronounce it,
I could be wrong, okay, cool.

149
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.728
And I think we have all
of the borders in place.

150
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.337
All right, so I think that's everything,
we've got all of the stuff now.

151
00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:36.203
Any questions on that particular layout?

152
00:10:38.734 --> 00:10:42.027
So we incorporated subgrid here,
and subgrid,

153
00:10:42.027 --> 00:10:47.649
if you like the way your cards look when
things aren't exactly perfectly lined up,

154
00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:51.844
that is fine, you can continue
to lay your cards out that way.

155
00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:55.238
And in fact, you'd get that same
kind of effect with flexbox.

156
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:59.516
For this concept of subgrid is what
will allow you to align elements within

157
00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:04.611
cards and across cards, rather than
just within the individual card itself.

158
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:09.121
And it will give you that, I think,
a slightly more polished look.

159
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:12.668
So that is the benefit of using
subgrid in this particular example.
