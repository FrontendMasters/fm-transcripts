00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.182
So, we are moving on to Chapter 3,
and in Chapter 3,

2
00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:07.770
you are going to put
together a grid layout.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.040
I want you to make a little Mars collage.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.621
So, here we are with all of
the pictures from Mars, all right?

5
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:18.607
And good, you're gonna set the width
of the collage to 980 pixels,

6
00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:24.210
we're not gonna make this responsive yet,
we're just gonna make it fixed width.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.780
And as it says here,
center the collage if there's room, so

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.520
center the whole thing on
the page if there's room.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.349
And if there's not, that's fine,

10
00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.490
don't reorder the images from
the order that I give you in the HTML.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.952
You may need to make some changes
to the HTML to make it work,

12
00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:48.308
like adding classes and such,
or adding other elements,

13
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:53.009
but you do not need to
reorder the images themselves

14
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.428
in order to make this happen, okay?

15
00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:59.224
All right everybody, how did you
do with that particular challenge?

16
00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:01.690
Hopefully it worked out for you, okay?

17
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.005
Hopefully you've got a screen
that looks kind of like this,

18
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.800
you've got the Martian
landscape here on the top,

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.285
we've got some close-up of some rocks over
here with the planet, and then down on

20
00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:16.518
the bottom, we have one of those giant
craters there on the Martian surface.

21
00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:21.618
So the way that I have
set up my HTML here is

22
00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:26.434
I put a div around all of these images.

23
00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:30.274
Remember, you've got to have parents and
children in order for grid to work.

24
00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:32.382
So that's the first thing
that you have to add,

25
00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:36.324
I've added my grid container that goes
all the way around all of those images.

26
00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:41.000
The second thing that I did was I gave
all of my images a class just for fun.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.451
You could definitely use nth child in
order to select all these images if

28
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.550
you wanted.

29
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.131
But just to keep things a little simpler,

30
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:53.239
I gave these classes of the exciting
names 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as one does.

31
00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:58.147
Then in my CSS,
I have here a grid container where

32
00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:02.953
I displayed grid, and
I set up uneven columns.

33
00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:04.313
I have a 2FR and a 1FR,

34
00:02:04.313 --> 00:02:09.023
cuz Mars is bigger than the other two
little images that are over there.

35
00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:13.260
If you had different numbers,
you said 3FR, 1FR, totally cool,

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.533
cuz I didn't tell you what
the proportion should be.

37
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:22.717
I set a width on that container to 980,
that gives us a fixed width here,

38
00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:28.716
and then if you centered it, you could
center that just using margin zero auto.

39
00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:33.346
What do those two numbers mean again for
margin when it has two numbers like this?

40
00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:35.916
What does the first number mean?

41
00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:37.810
&gt;&gt; Top-
&gt;&gt; Top and bottom,

42
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.896
what does the second number mean?

43
00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.301
&gt;&gt; Left and right.

44
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:43.157
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, and

45
00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:45.854
what is auto mean when it comes to margin?

46
00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:47.282
&gt;&gt; Center?

47
00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:48.524
&gt;&gt; Yes, to center it.

48
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:52.902
So basically to take any extra space,
whatever extra space there is divided in

49
00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:57.174
half and stick it on the left in
the right, that's what auto does.

50
00:02:57.174 --> 00:03:00.226
Okay, and
effectively it centers it in space.

51
00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:05.266
Then we just have a whole series once
you've actually set up your grid,

52
00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:10.138
a whole series of numbers here
talking about what images are spanning

53
00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:15.269
which columns and which rows here
in space for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
