1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.577
All right, so we're up to Chapter 6,
and we're at part 6A,

2
00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.950
working with max-width media queries.

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.080
And if you open up your opening CodePen
here, we are here on Mars, once again.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.312
And this particular layout looks
totally awesome here at 980 pixels,

5
00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:21.959
but really,
not at anything smaller than that.

6
00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:27.329
So it's time to fix this and
make this work at smaller sizes as well.

7
00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.470
And we're gonna use desktop media queries
cuz we've already laid this out for

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.042
desktop.

9
00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:35.299
And now we're gonna add some
mobile versions to this.

10
00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:39.787
So one of the tricks that I
like using as I start working,

11
00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:42.175
inside of designs like this,

12
00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:47.636
I need to figure out where exactly
am I gonna place my media queries.

13
00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:51.967
And what are the nice features of CodePen
if you see down there at the bottom,

14
00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:57.081
there's a tiny little white pill that
will tell you the size of the screen.

15
00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:01.468
And that is the size of the image
just display over here on the side.

16
00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:03.407
So you can sort of scrub back and

17
00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:09.008
forth until you find a spot where things
kinda look like they need to be updated.

18
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.618
In this case, this is pretty fixed width,
it just starts to scroll off the screen.

19
00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:17.538
So what I am going to say is,
it's gonna be 700 pixels.

20
00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:21.377
This is gonna be a spot where we're
gonna need to start making some changes.

21
00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:24.758
The very first place we need to make
a change is right here on line number 5.

22
00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:30.004
The reason why this is all very,
very static and it scrolls off the screen

23
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:34.687
is that, we have a fixed width
that's set right here on line 5.

24
00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:38.437
We've just said the width is 980, so
it's never gonna be anything different.

25
00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:42.358
It's never gonna be smaller than 980,
it's never gonna be bigger than 980,

26
00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:43.810
it's always gonna be 980.

27
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.810
Let's change this to max-width of 980.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.050
So it will never get bigger than this,
but it can definitely get smaller.

29
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.736
So as we start making this screen smaller,

30
00:01:55.736 --> 00:02:00.001
then we can decide exactly where we
want that media query to happen.

31
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.800
At some point it starts to
look kind of ridiculous.

32
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.314
Yeah, okay, so
I picked around 700 pixels as I

33
00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:11.920
start to lose details
here in these pictures.

34
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.890
Let's make this a little bit different.

35
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.465
What I'm gonna do is scroll on down
just after style number 5 here.

36
00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:26.647
We'll put in a bunch of returns so
you can see what I'm doing.

37
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.675
And we're gonna set up a media query.

38
00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:32.482
So this is @media.

39
00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:36.778
And then we're going to say
max-width of 700 pixels.

40
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.747
Okay, so in other words,
what does this mean?

41
00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:51.047
If I said cuz you guys have not seen
media queries in action before.

42
00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:55.748
If I said body background-color, red,

43
00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:02.747
what dimension is my body
background color going to turn red?

44
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:08.399
So if my screen is at 950 pixels, what
color is the background of this web page?

45
00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.329
&gt;&gt; Black.

46
00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.305
&gt;&gt; Black, if I'm at 702 pixels,

47
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:17.036
what is the color of this
web page background-color?

48
00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:17.675
&gt;&gt; Black.

49
00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:23.018
&gt;&gt; Black, if I'm at 698 pixels, what
is the background-color of my web page?

50
00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:24.675
&gt;&gt; Red.
&gt;&gt; Red, okay?

51
00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:29.911
Notice that our media queries
come later here in our design,

52
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:34.130
and that is where this
stuff is gonna be applied.

53
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.852
As I make my screen smaller,
and this is not working because

54
00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:45.241
I have my body background
black down here at the bottom.

55
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:48.487
And guess what,
it's overriding what I have before.

56
00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:52.866
So if I grab this code here,
I'm going to cut it, and

57
00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.666
I'm gonna put this up at
the top of my screen.

58
00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:04.795
Now my media query can override it,
and, whoa, that red is very red, okay?

59
00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:08.038
You're definitely on the red planet now.

60
00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:09.616
Here we go.

61
00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.568
Make sense?

62
00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:15.819
So that's how media queries work and
in their simplest format.

63
00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.364
I don't know why you would ever
wanna do this, but you can, okay?

64
00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:24.336
So instead of doing that,
we're gonna do something different.

65
00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.818
What I wanna do instead is,

66
00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:29.709
I just wanna stack these images
one right on top of the other.

67
00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:34.636
So what might I say inside of my media
query so that when I get to these smaller

68
00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:38.489
dimensions I stack my images
one right on top of the other?

69
00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:38.989
What would I say?

70
00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:47.046
&gt;&gt; Do you do grid container and
change the number of columns?

71
00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:53.732
&gt;&gt; Correct, so I can say, .grid-container.

72
00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:58.853
And then I could just say,
grid-template-columns: 1fr

73
00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:07.190
Okay, I don't have to say all of the other
stuff, I don't have to say display grid.

74
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.000
I don't have to say any of
the other things that I had,

75
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.960
all of that will carry down
from what I had before.

76
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.630
Instead, what I'm going to do
here now is have a single column.

77
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.151
And sure enough, my images stack
on top of each Each other very,

78
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.433
very nicely, except for Mars.

79
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:25.353
What happened to Mars?

80
00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:26.243
Mars is gone.

81
00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:28.903
So what happened to Mars?

82
00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:31.148
Does anybody have an idea?

83
00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:41.404
Well, remember outside our media query,
we have a whole bunch of these specifics,

84
00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:44.197
right, where we placed
all of these images, and

85
00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:46.470
they're still going to those places.

86
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.697
So Mars is gone because, yeah,
it's somewhere off the screen, entirely.

87
00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:59.157
So to bring Mars back, we're gonna
need to make some changes here.

88
00:05:59.157 --> 00:06:05.872
And what I'm going to do,
I'm gonna copy styles one to five.

89
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:15.920
And I'm gonna paste them here
into my media query, okay?

90
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.621
And now we can override these.

91
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.983
And probably the easiest way to do this
is just to change my numbers to auto,

92
00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:27.021
because all I wanna do is make these
images stack on top of each other.

93
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:31.738
So one will become auto,
two will become auto for

94
00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:36.125
the grid-column, auto for the grid-row.

95
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:40.857
And yes, you can absolutely recombine
a lot of these styles into a single style

96
00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:44.239
that just says grid-row:
auto grid-column: auto.

97
00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:49.106
But for purposes of documentation,
I'm gonna keep these all

98
00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:54.168
broken out separately, but
we could say grid-column: auto.

99
00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:56.764
&gt;&gt; You took one through
five in copy of that.

100
00:06:56.764 --> 00:07:00.381
&gt;&gt; Yep, I took classes one
through five and copied and

101
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:02.830
pasted them into our media query.

102
00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:11.686
Four will be auto and auto,
five will be auto and auto.

103
00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:22.382
Okay, now let's see if we have five
images now, one, two, three, five,

104
00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:24.371
sure enough, there they all are.

105
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:30.981
Okay, so when I make my screen bigger,

106
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.561
we go back to our grid based layout where
we have multiple columns and spans.

107
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:39.311
And when I make this smaller then
they stack on top of each other,

108
00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:40.844
one image after another.

109
00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:50.231
By keeping grid turned
on in this dimension,

110
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:56.179
we are keeping the ability to reorder
our images this particular way.

111
00:07:56.179 --> 00:08:00.355
Ideally, you're gonna wanna put your
content In mobile order by default.

112
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.266
And the reason why is because
then screen readers and

113
00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:07.370
search engines will come in and
just read that content from top to bottom,

114
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.305
whereas the display of the page, it may
be all over the place in different spots.

115
00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:16.811
But we want our search engines and
our screen readers to be able to read that

116
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:21.036
content from top to bottom in the order
in which we wish to present it.

117
00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:21.721
Makes sense?

118
00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:24.241
&gt;&gt; Do we care about
portrait versus landscape?

119
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.711
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you mean a media query for
portrait and a media query for landscape?

120
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:31.101
Is that what we're talking about?

121
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:35.778
So ideally, what's gonna happen here is
we're very concerned with the width of

122
00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:39.376
the page, because the height of
the page is just scrollable.

123
00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:44.009
So if we have a small, let's say we're
looking at this in portrait mode,

124
00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:48.566
we'll see, I don't know, the first
image in the top of Mars there, and

125
00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:53.314
we'll just be able to keep scrolling
to see the rest of the images, right?

126
00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:57.661
If we're in portrait mode,
we're gonna see just what we see here.

127
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.959
And then we're gonna scroll to
see the rest of the images.
