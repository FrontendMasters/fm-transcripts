1
00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.997
Finally, there is a website,
I'm gonna do a demo for this,

2
00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:06.567
which is responsive breakpoints.com.

3
00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:11.312
And this is going to help us generate
a lot of the code that we need, okay?

4
00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:15.253
So I'm wanna start with working
with my picture element.

5
00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:22.219
So here I have, there's our Jupiter
moons again, we love them so.

6
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.591
So here they are,
stretched all the way across the screen.

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:31.667
Here I have them as a four-up and
here I've got them turned long ways and

8
00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.918
here I have them tinty-tiny, okay?

9
00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:38.981
So I have four images and
I have put them here in the HTML so

10
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:43.667
that you can see what they are,
there's my four images, okay.

11
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.321
So I'm gonna rewrite this for
you using the picture element.

12
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:52.135
So we gonna have one of these images
display depending on the size of our

13
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:52.795
screen.

14
00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:57.317
So how we would go about setting this up,

15
00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:03.435
we gonna start by putting
the picture element first and

16
00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:08.497
the slash picture element at the end,
okay?

17
00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:09.722
Easy start.

18
00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:13.151
This is all gonna be the picture element.

19
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:18.058
The next thing you have to do is
decide which one of these is going

20
00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.102
to be your small picture.

21
00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:23.744
I'm gonna say it's this one here, okay?

22
00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:29.228
And that is corresponding
with this one here, I think,

23
00:01:29.228 --> 00:01:34.255
this is default.jpg,
then moon's default jpg.

24
00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:37.255
All right, so this one we're
gonna leave alone the code for

25
00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:39.356
this we gonna leave alone just like it is.

26
00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:44.507
This is gonna be the alt texts that's
gonna serve for all of the other images.

27
00:01:44.507 --> 00:01:48.943
And there's nothing we need to
change with this image at all, so

28
00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.810
it's all set and ready to go.

29
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.017
Okay, as for the other items here,
the other three images,

30
00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:03.462
these are no longer going to be images,
they are going to be source, okay?

31
00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:07.592
So this is source and source set this

32
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:13.243
the attribute that pulls in the picture,
okay?

33
00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:15.537
No more alt text.

34
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:21.930
And here I'm gonna put my largest image.

35
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.860
So min-width 1200 pixels, okay?

36
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.693
Notice that it suddenly disappeared.

37
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.621
Everybody see that?

38
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.735
It's gone, all right?

39
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:40.676
Or maybe it's the only one showing.

40
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:44.560
Weirdness has happened, okay?

41
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.099
We haven't finished coding this thing,
so who knows what's going on.

42
00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.270
Okay, for our second one,
we're gonna do exactly the same thing.

43
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.569
We gonna change our image to source,
source to source set.

44
00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.970
No, u text, and I made an error there,

45
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.601
that's part of the reason
why that didn't work.

46
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:14.824
This would be media equals,
quote, min-width 1,200 pixels,

47
00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:19.051
that's why weirdness happened,
there we go.

48
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.989
Yes.

49
00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.160
&gt;&gt; Is it safe to assume media
is literally a media query?

50
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.423
&gt;&gt; It is a media query.

51
00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:29.626
Yeah, so
any kind of media query would work.

52
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:37.800
And so here for this one, let's say that
our media query is 900 pixels, okay?

53
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.403
So you can see that we have
some weirdness here, but

54
00:03:42.403 --> 00:03:47.237
it is in fact working,
look at that, uh-uh, cool.

55
00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:50.079
The picture changes depending
on the size of the screen.

56
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.290
All right, and
then the last one here on line four,

57
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.461
we need to change this one as well.

58
00:03:55.461 --> 00:04:01.352
So this will be source, source set.

59
00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:08.138
And no alt text, and
my media query will be for 600 pixels.

60
00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:14.805
Now I'm down to one image.

61
00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.626
Phew, that is what we want, right?

62
00:04:17.626 --> 00:04:23.001
So right now my screen size is 459 pixels,
so I'm gonna make it

63
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:28.791
bigger when I get to 600 pixels,
see I get now, now I get one image.

64
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:32.465
This one, okay?

65
00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:35.759
And you can argue with my art
direction choices here, by the way.

66
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:43.041
You can say that was a terrible choice,
Jen, and that would be fine, but it's my.

67
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:50.784
Okay, so as we make this bigger There
we go, now we go to my larger image.

68
00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:55.481
So there it is my big version of
the four moons all in the four up here.

69
00:04:55.481 --> 00:05:01.692
And then when I make the screen really
big, there they all are side-by-side.

70
00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:03.570
How cool is that?

71
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.506
&gt;&gt; It's very cool.

72
00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:08.694
&gt;&gt; Totally awesome, all right?

73
00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:12.939
So keep this in mind the next time
you are coding your next website and

74
00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.663
you have that giant banner image
across the top of the page,

75
00:05:16.663 --> 00:05:19.289
as is required by law in all websites now.

76
00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.294
This is how you might handle making
this giant banner picture resize,

77
00:05:25.294 --> 00:05:28.978
depending on the size of your web browser.

78
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:32.559
So, that is how the picture element works.

79
00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:38.195
The next thing I wanna look at is
the responsive breakpoints.com demo.

80
00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:44.062
So I am going to open up
responsive image break points,

81
00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:48.917
and I am going to download a picture for
that.

82
00:05:51.148 --> 00:05:53.014
Now I can't download this picture.

83
00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:57.365
Okay, save image as,

84
00:05:57.365 --> 00:06:01.952
put this on my desktop.

85
00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:04.761
Okay, so
now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go

86
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.648
to the responsive image
breakpoints generator.

87
00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:11.981
And what this is going to do is it's
gonna give us the code for sources or

88
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:13.382
source set and sizes.

89
00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:17.526
It'll actually write this code for
us and make all of the images.

90
00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:19.715
It is a beautiful thing.

91
00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:24.057
So you could do this manually if you want,
inside of photoshop and similar programs,

92
00:06:24.057 --> 00:06:26.365
or you can use a tool like
this to do it for you.

93
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.269
And I would not be surprised,
our backend friends,

94
00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:32.437
if there isn't a backend tool
that would do this for you.

95
00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:37.098
Where a user could upload an image and
this would spit out some number of

96
00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:40.351
background images with
the appropriated HTML.

97
00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.583
Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?

98
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:45.633
It sounds reasonable,
I'm sure somebody has written it.

99
00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:47.954
I have no idea exactly what it would be.

100
00:06:47.954 --> 00:06:52.531
Okay, so I'm gonna first
of all upload my image, and

101
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:55.897
I am going to take this from my desktop.

102
00:06:55.897 --> 00:06:58.929
And I'm gonna work with that same
big image we were just working with

103
00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:59.520
there it is.

104
00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:10.654
And we can set up then, before scroll
down, we can set up the resolution.

105
00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:15.593
So this is going from 200
to 1,400 pixels wide.

106
00:07:15.593 --> 00:07:20.577
So we could say well I have a max width
on my site set to 1200 wanna go smaller

107
00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:25.486
than that and you can't really see
this picture until it's 300 pixels so

108
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:28.269
let's say it's from 300 to 1200.

109
00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:31.147
The size step is happening
here every 20k so

110
00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:35.464
we could increase that let's say
we want it to happen every 30k and

111
00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:40.311
then we can have the maximum number of
images because this can get ridiculous

112
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:45.105
very quickly, so I'm going to say [COUGH]
give me no more than three images.

113
00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:46.763
I think that's fine.

114
00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:50.684
And then I'm gonna say regenerate.

115
00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:54.189
And then down here at the bottom,
down here at the bottom

116
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:59.051
you'll see we have our large image,
our medium image, and our small image.

117
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:04.999
And it's given us the source set and
sizes is all set here, okay?

118
00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.105
So it's all written for us.

119
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:11.604
So remember this is saying for
a max width of 1200 pixels,

120
00:08:11.604 --> 00:08:16.378
display our image at 100
viewport widths or 1200 pixels.

121
00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:18.819
So basically that's
kind of the same thing.

122
00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.759
You may wanna modify this, right?

123
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:27.057
So we may wanna say 33 viewport widths
as we had in the previous example.

124
00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:29.347
So may be something to modify there.

125
00:08:29.347 --> 00:08:33.010
But otherwise, this is,
here's the four images or

126
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:38.422
three images that it generated for
us of the different dimensions at 300,

127
00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:43.605
800 and 33 and 1200 pixels and
we have our default image as well.

128
00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:48.420
You don't need to write your alt text,
make sense?

129
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.279
Interestingly, it's also given this to
you as a picture, in a picture format,

130
00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:58.135
which is weird cuz it's a picture format
but it's got sizes and source set in it,

131
00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:01.660
which means the browser is
actually making the decision.

132
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.239
So, I don't know what the purpose
of that is, but there you go.
