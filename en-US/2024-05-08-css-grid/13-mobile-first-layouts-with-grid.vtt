1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.091
Great, so welcome to chapter 7 and we
are fortunate enough to have been hired by

2
00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:06.303
NASA to do some layouts for their website.

3
00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:07.693
How cool is that?

4
00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.670
My goodness, we're so excited.

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.785
So we are going to work on writing
some mobile-first media queries,

6
00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:17.292
working with Grid.

7
00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:21.576
So basically, we're gonna put together
everything that we've learned up to this

8
00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:23.854
point in time to work
through this example.

9
00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:28.907
And the graphic designer has given us
the layouts and how they should look.

10
00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:32.915
So if you look first in the column here
where it says less than 500 pixels.

11
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.809
So less than 500 pixels,
in other words, mobile dimensions,

12
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.043
this is the way the page is gonna look.

13
00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:42.861
It's gonna say planets and moons,
we're gonna have this amazing picture of

14
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:46.915
the solar system, and then we're gonna
have a series of items underneath of these

15
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:49.576
various planets with their moons,
all the way down.

16
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.569
We've got Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Neptune and Pluto.

17
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:59.966
Okay, then over between 500 and 699
pixels, they want it to look like this.

18
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.649
So we're gonna change the way things look.

19
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.871
We're going to stack our headline
image and button here this way, okay?

20
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.508
And make a column of two
going on down the page.

21
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:12.177
Make sense?

22
00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:16.072
Then when we get to 700 to 899 pixels,
once again,

23
00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:19.806
we've still got our leading
featured image here, and

24
00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:24.290
then underneath,
we'll have three items going across, okay?

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.292
Sharp-eyed graphic designers will
immediately notice the following.

26
00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:33.274
You'll notice that it says Earth and
Moon on one line, but Mars, Phobos, and

27
00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:37.520
Deimos wraps onto a second line and
it doesn't line up perfectly.

28
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.990
File that away for the moment, we'll get
to fixing that in chapter 9 with sub Grid.

29
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.850
For right now, this is the way
it's going to be built, okay?

30
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.816
And then finally, when we get to desktop,
we get this lovely layout.

31
00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:54.910
So we're going to have our
big featured item here, and

32
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.894
then we'll have our card sort of
going around that featured item,

33
00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.288
a whole bunch of different columns and
rows.

34
00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:06.669
Super cool?

35
00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.892
Okay, so we're gonna use four
min-width media queries,

36
00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:14.531
those will be at 500, 700, 900 pixels.

37
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.500
And we start, of course,
with our mobile layout.

38
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.287
Make sense?

39
00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.214
So if you open up you be
getting CodePen there,

40
00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:24.528
let's take a look at what we have for
starting code.

41
00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:29.233
So what we've got going on here
is we have a series of divs, and

42
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:32.684
once again,
I'm gonna fold up my HTML here.

43
00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:37.407
I find this a useful approach
when thinking about layouts.

44
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:41.737
So my first div has a class of feature and
card,

45
00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:45.300
this is my big solar system item here.

46
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.129
Okay, so that is both
the featured item and a card, and

47
00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.056
then all of the other items after that,
they are cards.

48
00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:57.860
So those cards consist of, if we were
to open one up, they consist of an H2,

49
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.532
that would be the In the title here,
it would consist of a very cool image.

50
00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:06.502
I love this image, that is, of course,
the moon orbiting the Earth, and

51
00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:09.015
that's the dark side of
the Moon right there.

52
00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:13.772
And then after that, we have a button
here where we can learn more at NASA.

53
00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:17.804
If you click that, you'll go to the page
that produced this picture, okay?

54
00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:23.613
The featured one's slightly different
in that it has our H2, our image,

55
00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:28.083
it has a paragraph of text, and then it
has its button, because it's a feature.

56
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.974
So it's got a little bit more
information on it, okay?

57
00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:35.498
So it's always good to just go through and
review that HTML.

58
00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:39.195
So one of the things we know,
if we take a look at our layout here,

59
00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:41.600
ignore the featured item for the moment.

60
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.384
Let's just take a look at what we have for
each one of the cards underneath.

61
00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:51.141
So can anybody make a comment
about how we might go about

62
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:53.841
laying out one of those cards?

63
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:54.781
What's going on?

64
00:03:58.692 --> 00:03:59.780
&gt;&gt; We have two columns.

65
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.613
&gt;&gt; We have two columns, exactly.

66
00:04:01.613 --> 00:04:03.573
So in column one, we've got what?

67
00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:07.834
&gt;&gt; Name and the button.

68
00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:09.223
&gt;&gt; We have the name and the button.

69
00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:15.129
So in column number one, we're gonna have
the name, that's this H2, and we're gonna

70
00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.433
have the button, that's this paragraph
with the button inside of it, right?

71
00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:25.663
And then in the second column
we're going to have the image.

72
00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:29.155
So what we have to do then,
if we think about that we have the H2,

73
00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:32.909
we've got to put that over on
the left column, we've got the image,

74
00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.068
we have to put that in the right column.

75
00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:37.966
And then the button we have to
put over in the left column.

76
00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:41.079
Okay, so
let's worry about coding that first.

77
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.216
Sometimes the problem with doing these
kinds of layouts is figuring out what to

78
00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:48.409
code first, and so I am just gonna
start by coding all of those

79
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.440
cards because that's a pretty
straightforward thing.

80
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.572
And I think that's gonna get me to most of
the way through this particular problem.

81
00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:59.103
Once we have the card in place, then we
can take a look at this featured item up

82
00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:01.821
here at the top, right,
which is a little bit different.

83
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:02.514
Make sense?

84
00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:07.985
Okay, so
let's start by coding those cards.

85
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.382
Down here in our CSS,

86
00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:17.976
you'll see that I have included a few
little bits of styling here for you.

87
00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:23.710
So first of all, we have this HTML,
box-sizing is border-box.

88
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.006
And then box-sizing inherit.

89
00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:30.595
So this has to do with the way
the box model works here in CSS.

90
00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:35.935
And the border box says that as
we are thinking about ordering or

91
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:39.280
doing math, going across our screen.

92
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.647
What we are gonna do is we are gonna
consider the border, the padding, and

93
00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:45.490
the content becomes one unit.

94
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.283
So if I said width is 500 pixels,
and I had a border of 2 pixels,

95
00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:54.737
and I had padding of 10 pixels,
all of that added together,

96
00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:59.132
including the content,
would sum to 500 pixels, okay?

97
00:05:59.132 --> 00:06:01.155
And then the margin is counted separately.

98
00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:03.500
So that's why we use this border box.

99
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.096
Otherwise, what will happen is,
if we said the width was 500 pixels,

100
00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:08.838
it would refer to the content only.

101
00:06:10.717 --> 00:06:13.115
So that's why your
layouts often don't work.

102
00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:17.945
You think you're working with a width
of 500 pixels, but it's 500 pixels plus

103
00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:22.573
10 pixels for the padding, plus two
pixels for the border, plus 10 pixels for

104
00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:27.290
the margin, and it gets bigger than you
expect and it blows out your design, okay?

105
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.986
So this is kind of a little thing
that you can put at the top

106
00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:35.799
of your CSS to help make your layouts
work a little bit more intuitively.

107
00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:38.199
It is, unfortunately,
a property that doesn't inherit.

108
00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.441
So we say box-sizing is border-box, and
then we say, the entire universe and

109
00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:48.855
everything that comes before and after
that universe we would like it to inherit.

110
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:49.851
Make sense?

111
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:55.696
Okay, so
that's what that first little part means.

112
00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:58.224
Then we have the body of the document,

113
00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:01.937
here I've just declared a font family and
some sizing.

114
00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:06.569
For the images, I've set them all up to
have a little bit of a border radius and

115
00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:08.218
a max-width of 100%.

116
00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:11.989
I've styled my button and
I've styled my button on hover, so

117
00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:14.685
I'm giving all of you that for free, okay?

118
00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:18.489
So we just have to worry about layouts.

119
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:22.436
So, we can start here then with our card.

120
00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:25.472
So we have a card here,
I'll just leave that up here,

121
00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:27.771
so you've got a little HTML to refer to.

122
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.342
All the cards are the same.

123
00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:35.493
So how would I start my CSS here
in terms of laying out my card?

124
00:07:35.493 --> 00:07:38.022
We decided it needed to have two columns.

125
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:42.983
So what is the first thing that
I would put here in my CSS.

126
00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:44.567
&gt;&gt; Display grid.

127
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:49.154
&gt;&gt; Display grid is definitely part of it,
but before I can put down display grid,

128
00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:50.069
what do I need?

129
00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.589
&gt;&gt; Media query.

130
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.563
&gt;&gt; No, not a media query.

131
00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:54.774
&gt;&gt; We just add the class.

132
00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:59.113
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the class, .card.

133
00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:01.334
Yeah, .card, that's where we start.

134
00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:07.310
And then we say, display grid,
great, what comes after that?

135
00:08:10.317 --> 00:08:13.409
I'll put up the picture again.

136
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.991
What does that look like
in terms of ratios?

137
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:18.461
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Pardon.

138
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:22.331
&gt;&gt; Sorry, [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Three to one

139
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:24.090
&gt;&gt; Like a three to one, right?

140
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.378
Like, 25% is the picture and
75% is the title and the button, yeah?

141
00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:32.413
So we could say then,

142
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:40.181
grid-template-columns would be 3fr 1fr,
yeah?

143
00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:41.123
Make sense?

144
00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:48.301
And if we take a look here again at
our card, you notice we have some

145
00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:52.080
space up here on the top and
we have some space here underneath.

146
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.680
Does anybody know,
is that padding or is that margin?

147
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.568
Cuz we have borders here too.

148
00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:00.485
Is that padding or margin,
that's causing that space?

149
00:09:00.485 --> 00:09:01.150
&gt;&gt; Padding.

150
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.546
&gt;&gt; It's padding, cuz padding is
always inside of the borders, right?

151
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.431
Okay, so let's put in some padding.

152
00:09:10.348 --> 00:09:17.640
3rem 0, and let's refresh my memory again,
what does two numbers mean?

153
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.461
&gt;&gt; Top and bottom.

154
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.316
&gt;&gt; Top and bottom,
the first one is the top and

155
00:09:21.316 --> 00:09:24.502
bottom and
the second number is left and right.

156
00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:27.605
So we're gonna put 3rem on the top and
the bottom of our grid cell.

157
00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:35.235
And then I'm also going to add to this

158
00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:40.544
a border-bottom of 1 pixel solid ccc.

159
00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:43.545
So nice, light gray border.

160
00:09:43.545 --> 00:09:45.939
And by putting it only on the bottom,
right,

161
00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.404
then I've just got one
right after the other.

162
00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:49.198
Makes sense?

163
00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:56.490
How about a gap between these?

164
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.623
Do we want any gap?

165
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.393
I think it's looking
pretty good the way it is.

166
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.960
So we probably don't need a gap.

167
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.283
So we can say gap is 0.

168
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.205
And then the last thing is,

169
00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:14.242
I would like to have everything
aligned in the center of that image.

170
00:10:14.242 --> 00:10:21.250
So let's do that align items of center.

171
00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.428
So it helps a little bit.

172
00:10:26.428 --> 00:10:28.979
Okay, so
explain to me what's going on here.

173
00:10:31.482 --> 00:10:34.332
What's in my first row
here inside of this card?

174
00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:42.516
So I have a card,
we said it has 2 columns, right?

175
00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:46.592
So in the first row in the first
column I have this h2, correct?

176
00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:52.434
What have I got in the first
row in the second column?

177
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:53.084
&gt;&gt; The image.

178
00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:55.143
&gt;&gt; The image, okay?

179
00:10:55.143 --> 00:10:58.535
What have I got in the second
row in the first column?

180
00:10:58.535 --> 00:10:59.271
&gt;&gt; The button.

181
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.608
&gt;&gt; The button, exactly.

182
00:11:01.608 --> 00:11:07.085
So this is not exactly
lined up quite right, yeah?

183
00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:09.049
So what's going on here?

184
00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:10.307
Anybody have any idea?

185
00:11:15.454 --> 00:11:16.999
When in doubt put a border on it.

186
00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:20.898
So let's put a border on it, border

187
00:11:23.343 --> 00:11:27.994
2 pixels solid red, okay.

188
00:11:27.994 --> 00:11:34.753
So I had this border on my H2, but I have
all of this space above and below it.

189
00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:36.680
Does anybody know what
might be going on here?

190
00:11:41.387 --> 00:11:45.805
It's the height of the image that's
causing it to be centered and

191
00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:49.834
then you've got like filling
in the rest for just nothing.

192
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:52.837
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, that's part of it,
that's definitely part of it.

193
00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:58.688
But remember every heading has got
some margin on it as well, right?

194
00:11:58.688 --> 00:12:02.684
So we may want to take our margin and
make it 0,

195
00:12:02.684 --> 00:12:07.198
that'll tighten things up
just a little bit there.

196
00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:13.248
And the other thing I wanna do is make
my font size a little smaller, 1.2 rem.

197
00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:18.648
These are tiny screens,
we don't need to have big,

198
00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:21.364
huge fonts going on here.

199
00:12:23.818 --> 00:12:27.566
So we still have this large
gap between the H2 and

200
00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:30.960
the image here and this button, all right?

201
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.434
So what could I do to minimize
the distance between these?

202
00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:37.217
We know that these
are actually separate rows.

203
00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:43.134
What could I do instead to maybe
make this image span over the H2 and

204
00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:45.783
the button, what could I do?

205
00:12:47.616 --> 00:12:51.672
&gt;&gt; Have the image take up both rows
&gt;&gt; Have the image take up both rows,

206
00:12:51.672 --> 00:12:52.266
right?

207
00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:54.426
So let's do that.

208
00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:57.656
So I'm gonna say this is my .card h2.

209
00:12:57.656 --> 00:13:01.872
So for my .card img,

210
00:13:01.872 --> 00:13:05.625
what can I do here?

211
00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.630
Can you tell me my numbers?

212
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.890
Cuz if I said grid-column,
what would be my numbers for the image?

213
00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.362
What column should it be in?

214
00:13:14.362 --> 00:13:16.850
&gt;&gt; 2.

215
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.013
&gt;&gt; 2 or 2/3,
either one of those would work.

216
00:13:21.013 --> 00:13:23.693
How about its grid row?

217
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:28.754
&gt;&gt; 1 through 3.

218
00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:32.757
&gt;&gt; 1/3, right,
cuz we wanted to occupy both rows.

219
00:13:32.757 --> 00:13:34.152
See how it happened there?

220
00:13:34.152 --> 00:13:34.984
Did you see it?

221
00:13:34.984 --> 00:13:41.140
Now we have our image and we have our
button up against the image like that.

222
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.881
See how that looks better?

223
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.780
It'll look even better when
I get rid of that border.

224
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:48.184
What do you think?

225
00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:51.698
Nice?

226
00:13:54.368 --> 00:13:59.450
Okay, something else I'd like to do,
let's also on the .card p,

227
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.196
so the paragraph that goes
around those buttons,

228
00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:08.302
let's take its margin off as well,
cuz it has default margin on it.

229
00:14:08.302 --> 00:14:09.183
Let's turn that off.

230
00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:14.214
Again, that sort of tweaks
things just a little bit more.

231
00:14:14.214 --> 00:14:18.188
And then one final thing to do before
we move on to our featured card,

232
00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:21.464
if we scroll all the way down
here to Pluto at the bottom,

233
00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:25.409
there is a border down here at the very,
very bottom of the screen.

234
00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:26.362
Why is that?

235
00:14:26.362 --> 00:14:28.254
&gt;&gt; The border bottom is 1 pixel.

236
00:14:28.254 --> 00:14:31.800
&gt;&gt; Exactly, cuz I told it to,
I said at the bottom of every card,

237
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.405
we should put a border on the bottom,
right?

238
00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:38.788
But the last card I actually don't
want the border on the bottom.

239
00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:39.956
How can I turn that off?

240
00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:44.132
Does anybody have an idea of how I
could turn off the border down there?

241
00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.523
&gt;&gt; Dot card-last-child.

242
00:14:45.523 --> 00:14:52.856
&gt;&gt; Yeah, .card-last-child,

243
00:14:52.856 --> 00:14:56.662
border: none.

244
00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:59.303
There the border goes there just for
that last card,

245
00:14:59.303 --> 00:15:02.019
all of the other cards all
have a border at the bottom.
