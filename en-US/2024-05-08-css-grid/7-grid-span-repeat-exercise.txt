>> Okay, great, time for you to go ahead and give this span syntax a try. So we're gonna go back to our Martian example. If you go back to the beginning code pen here, all right? What I'd like for you to do is refactor this code. All of these numbers that are here, so you don't have to change the HTML.

[00:00:23]
Just refactor the numbers that we have here, so that you're working with the span syntax in grid. In other words, nothing is gonna change on the page, it's gonna look exactly the same when you're done. You're just changing the syntax from numbers to working with span Okay, so I'll just show you what my CSS look like here.

[00:00:47]
So for number one, you could have said 1/span 3, or you could just say span 3. It's already starting at one, so in this particular case, either one of those would work. So you could say 1/span 3, or you could say just span 3, either one of those.

[00:01:05]
For image number two, we're starting in column number 1. And then for the rows, we start at 2 and we span over 2. I think two is Mars here, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, two is Mars, so we start at 1 and we span over because this is one fat column.

[00:01:29]
So that's what's happening there. For image number three I think it's this one, 1/ span 2. Four, we could just give it the number of the column, which start at column 2, start at row number 2, and then for five down here in the bottom we started, do I have these out of order?

[00:01:52]
I think I have these out of order. In any case, we rewritten this so such that it's, number two and number three where it starts, okay? So this is just a simple conversion from the numbers that we had before, 1/3, 2/3, we've just converted them to the different syntax.

[00:02:10]
And again, you can use whichever one of these syntaxes make most sense to you.
