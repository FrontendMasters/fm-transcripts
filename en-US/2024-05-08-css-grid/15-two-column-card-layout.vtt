WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:04.562
So by default with min width
media queries, in other words,

2
00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:08.747
where the mobile styles
are outside of the media queries.

3
00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:11.699
When we make the screen bigger,
those mobile styles

4
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.340
are gonna continue on forever after, so we
can make the screen as large as we want.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.403
We have no media queries in place, and
this is going to look exactly the same.

6
00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:27.320
The same layout for all of the other sizes
of devices that you might be using here.

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.657
And while that looks very cool, it is
not what our specification called for.

8
00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:35.659
So what we wanna do now,
now that we've got this working for

9
00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.637
smaller mobile sizes, we are going
to add a media query at 500 pixels.

10
00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:44.569
So what you should do now is
move your display window here,

11
00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:49.786
look at the number down on the bottom in
the little pill, and make sure that you

12
00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:55.541
are over 500 pixels wide, so that you
see the changes that are being made.

13
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:59.642
If you leave your design window small,
your changes will continue to take effect,

14
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.926
but you will not see them, because, of
course, they apply to larger size windows.

15
00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:07.828
So we wanna make sure that we have
the right size window in place.

16
00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:09.698
&gt;&gt; Said to 500?

17
00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:13.749
&gt;&gt; Over 500, okay.

18
00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:18.301
So now what we'll do is we'll
put in our first media query.

19
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:20.313
So how is this going to go?

20
00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.906
Anybody wanna give me the code for this?

21
00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:25.381
A min width media query for 500 pixels?

22
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:25.963
&gt;&gt; @media?

23
00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:29.336
&gt;&gt; @media, yep?

24
00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:34.294
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in parentheses, min-width, yeah?

25
00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.029
&gt;&gt; 500px.

26
00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:38.870
&gt;&gt; 500px, exactly.

27
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.308
So anything that comes inside this
media query will apply over 500 pixels.

28
00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:46.728
We can override what came before.

29
00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.758
We can also add new styles to this.

30
00:01:50.228 --> 00:01:55.752
So what I'm going to do now then is,
my next design,

31
00:01:55.752 --> 00:02:03.508
I have my featured card up here on
the top, it now has a border around it.

32
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:07.648
In fact, all of the cards have borders
all the way around them, right?

33
00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:11.145
And I have two cards sitting side by side,
and

34
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:17.143
all of the information in those cards
is stacked on top of each other, right?

35
00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:21.007
Okay, I always find it helpful to
actually say all of that out loud.

36
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:25.577
I mean, it looks really obvious, but
it helps you think through the problem.

37
00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:30.547
So what we need to do then is, we need to
recode our card to go from the headline

38
00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:34.990
and the button with the image next
to it to have everything stacked.

39
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.437
So that's one change we need to make.

40
00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:42.891
And we need to somehow figure out, whereas
these cards were all just stacked on top

41
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:47.948
of each other one after the other, what
I need to do now is have two columns for

42
00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:52.633
those cards and have the featured
card span across those two columns.

43
00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.964
Makes sense?

44
00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:55.971
So that's our plan.

45
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.087
Let's see what we can do about that.

46
00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:04.171
If we take a look at our HTML,
always a great place to start,

47
00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:08.185
how would I make two columns
out of all of these cards?

48
00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:10.528
Can I do it with the HTML that I have?

49
00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:14.101
You're saying no, James,
why are you saying no?

50
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:16.576
&gt;&gt; Because there's no way
to select all of them.

51
00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:20.242
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so
there's no parent to all these cards.

52
00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:24.313
We wanna lay out the cards on the page,
they need a parent.

53
00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:26.998
And right now they are just
unruly children, yes?

54
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:31.262
Okay, so let us add to this then a parent.

55
00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:32.923
I'm just gonna use div again.

56
00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:38.625
And I'm gonna call this
class of card-container,

57
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:42.521
because that's what it's doing.

58
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:48.059
And we can put a /div
after all of the cards,

59
00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:52.269
and I like to indent them, okay?

60
00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.351
Will that div impact our mobile design?

61
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:59.367
The one that I just added,
is that gonna impact my mobile design?

62
00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:01.888
Why do you say no, Tapper?

63
00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:04.900
&gt;&gt; Because we don't do anything with that

64
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.852
class
&gt;&gt; Exactly,

65
00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:07.861
we make no reference to
it in the mobile design.

66
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:11.568
So we can just add this now and
it's not going to break anything.

67
00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:13.601
Okay, great.

68
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:18.867
So now let's concentrate
on the layout of our cards.

69
00:04:18.867 --> 00:04:21.557
We wanna try to get them
into two columns and

70
00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:24.859
we wanna have the featured
card span across the top.

71
00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:27.077
How would I do that now?

72
00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:29.597
What is my style that I would put here?

73
00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:32.388
What is the selector?

74
00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:33.124
&gt;&gt; card-container.

75
00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:35.137
&gt;&gt; card-container, exactly.

76
00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:40.223
So from my card-container,
what am I going to say next?

77
00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:47.055
&gt;&gt; grid-template-columns.

78
00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:48.418
&gt;&gt; How about display: grid?

79
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:53.155
[LAUGH] You're absolutely right, but
first we need to display grid, okay?

80
00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:57.397
Then grid-template-columns.

81
00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.260
What comes next?

82
00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:06.043
&gt;&gt; grid-template-rows, no.

83
00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:09.886
&gt;&gt; Template columns, no rows yet.

84
00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:10.412
&gt;&gt; I see.

85
00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:11.901
&gt;&gt; 1fr 1fr.

86
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.599
&gt;&gt; 1fr 1fr.

87
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:20.178
Or you could say repeat, parenthesis 2,
1fr, either way, gives you the same thing.

88
00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:25.180
Okay, that's a mess, but can you kinda see
that we've got what we're looking for?

89
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.801
We have the two cards next to each other.

90
00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:31.681
Everybody see that,
even though it's messy?

91
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:38.443
Okay, now I need to give
this a little bit of a gap.

92
00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:41.246
So I'm gonna say 1rem for a gap,

93
00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:45.866
that'll make it a little less messy,
but not by much.

94
00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:50.132
Okay, so next,
I need to have that featured card,

95
00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:54.817
the first one,
I need that to span across both columns.

96
00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:58.689
So what is the next style I need to
put here inside of my media query?

97
00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:59.707
&gt;&gt; .feature.

98
00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:03.944
&gt;&gt; Yeah, .feature.

99
00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:06.066
And what am I going to say next?

100
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:15.552
&gt;&gt; grid-columns: 1/3.

101
00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:17.555
&gt;&gt; 1/3, exactly.

102
00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:18.455
Hey, look at that.

103
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:24.681
Are we done?

104
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:27.059
Actually pretty well,
we're pretty well done.

105
00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:34.358
That is all we really need to have
here for the layout purposes, okay?

106
00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:35.913
So it spans across the two columns.

107
00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:36.574
There we go.

108
00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:38.832
There's all the cards lined up underneath.

109
00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:44.863
All right, so
to finish up this feature design here,

110
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:50.370
we'll add to this a border
of 1 pixel solid ccc.

111
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.153
So that'll put a lovely little
border around the whole thing.

112
00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:59.087
We can give this a little bit of padding,
1 rem, because it looks

113
00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:03.782
kinda ugly when the border goes
right on the edges of the card.

114
00:07:03.782 --> 00:07:09.501
And then a border-radius of 5 pixels.

115
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:14.800
And that'll give us a tiny,
little bit of rounding of those corners.

116
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.838
Fashion tip for those of you who
are fashion challenged like me.

117
00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.872
Make sure all your border radii match.

118
00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:25.774
So if we're gonna call it 5 pixels for
your border radius here,

119
00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:30.789
make sure it's 5 pixels on your button,
make sure it's 5 pixels on your image.

120
00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:32.985
If you have all different border radii, or

121
00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:37.323
some have pointy corners and some have
rounded corners, then designers get upset.

122
00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:40.554
So make them all match, okay?

123
00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:43.661
So now I need to bring
back my paragraph of text.

124
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:47.312
If I take a look at my comp again here,
my text,

125
00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:51.911
lorem ipsum,
should be displaying here on this page.

126
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:53.721
So we need to bring that back.

127
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.816
If we go back in our mobile styles,

128
00:07:57.816 --> 00:08:03.827
that was controlled by this
funky looking style right here.

129
00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:09.376
So I'm just gonna copy that same style and
paste it into my media query.

130
00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:12.535
You want it to match in
terms of the selector,

131
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:16.955
because different selectors
have different specificities.

132
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.923
So you wanna use the same type of
selector here inside of your media query.

133
00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:25.558
So we'll override what came before, and
this time instead of display: none,

134
00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:30.014
we'll say display: block,
which will bring our paragraph back.

135
00:08:30.014 --> 00:08:32.026
At this point in time, we have a choice,

136
00:08:32.026 --> 00:08:35.484
we actually haven't formatted
our cards underneath.

137
00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:37.963
And we know that with
the rest of our design,

138
00:08:37.963 --> 00:08:40.386
there aren't two columns in those cards.

139
00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:45.102
So that difference with the two
columns on that featured,

140
00:08:45.102 --> 00:08:49.923
that's gonna go away actually
as we get to our later cards.

141
00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:53.457
So what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to just ignore what's here.

142
00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:56.391
I know it looks wrong,
you're totally right, it looks wrong.

143
00:08:56.391 --> 00:09:01.034
But I'm going to ignore it for the moment
in favor of styling up my other cards, and

144
00:09:01.034 --> 00:09:05.360
then I'm gonna revisit featured to get
it looking the way it should, okay?

145
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.279
That's my plan.

146
00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:14.802
All right, so for the rest of
my cards here, then what I wanna

147
00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:20.025
do is I wanna stack the headline,
the image, and the button.

148
00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:24.520
What would be an easy
way to make this happen?

149
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.197
&gt;&gt; display: grid and
then have just one column.

150
00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:29.345
&gt;&gt; You could do that.

151
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:34.836
Yep, you could say .card, and
then you could say display: grid.

152
00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:41.558
You could say grid-template-columns: 1fr.

153
00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:46.231
And then you have to turn off the settings
for the headline and the button because,

154
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.208
remember, the image is spanned.

155
00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:51.313
I'm sorry,
you have to turn off the settings for

156
00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:56.259
the image because, remember, the image
is spanning over two rows, right?

157
00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.805
&gt;&gt; display: block?

158
00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:02.908
If we do display: block, then we
save ourselves a little bit of work.

159
00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:08.515
So if we got a block,
then they just stack, how cool is that?

160
00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:14.801
[LAUGH] Okay, so
the only thing that we need to do now for

161
00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:21.088
these cards then is add a border,
1 pixel solid ccc,

162
00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:26.979
cuz we want them to match
with all the other cards.

163
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:31.684
We wanna give them the same padding,
padding 1rem.

164
00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:38.534
We wanna give them a border radius,
5 pixels, to match all the other cards.

165
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.763
Why didn't my padding pad?

166
00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:49.913
Cuz I forgot my colon.

167
00:10:49.913 --> 00:10:52.803
[LAUGH] There we go.

168
00:10:52.803 --> 00:10:53.567
There we go.

169
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.607
Hey, look at those cards,
don't they look great?

170
00:11:01.607 --> 00:11:06.443
Okay, we may wanna put a little bit of
space here in between the button and

171
00:11:06.443 --> 00:11:08.596
the image, sort of depending.

172
00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:13.405
But it's worth noting over here,
do you guys see Pluto and Charon?

173
00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:15.110
See, it has no border on it?

174
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.451
Why does it have no border on
it when all the other cards do?

175
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.371
So unfair,

176
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:22.686
the youngest child always gets the-
&gt;&gt; Because

177
00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:25.316
you're still on that
code with the last child.

178
00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:26.604
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did.

179
00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:30.915
Up here with the last child,
we said border: none.

180
00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:33.416
It's still doing that exact same thing,
isn't it?

181
00:11:33.416 --> 00:11:34.839
Gosh, I hate it when that happens.

182
00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.649
It's doing exactly what I told it to do.

183
00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:44.041
So we're gonna change
this to 1px solid #ccc.

184
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.785
And the border will come back for
Pluto also.

185
00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:51.115
Poor Pluto, man.

186
00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:58.918
Okay, so let's give a little bit of
space between the image and that button.

187
00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:02.585
So we can say .card img,

188
00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:06.608
margin-bottom: 1rem.

189
00:12:06.608 --> 00:12:10.851
And once again, notice that things
are not lining up perfectly, okay?

190
00:12:10.851 --> 00:12:14.670
We have Jupiter and Galilean moons
takes up two lines, Saturn and

191
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.346
its moons takes up one line.

192
00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:19.319
The buttons don't align
down here on the bottom.

193
00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:22.526
This is all just fine for
the moment, okay?

194
00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:24.233
I see it, I see the problem, but

195
00:12:24.233 --> 00:12:28.219
we cannot fix it with the tools
that we have at the moment.

196
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:34.589
This is a job for subgrid, and we're gonna
talk about that in chapter nine, okay?

197
00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:37.170
Let's revisit our featured card.

198
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.469
Hey, look at that,
it's kinda fixed itself, didn't it?

199
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.184
Well, we got rid of
the columns on our card and

200
00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:47.482
fixed our featured card, so
that is looking good too.

201
00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:51.331
Let's compare our comp,
make sure everything's looking all right.

202
00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:59.630
Pretty much got what
the designer had planned here.

203
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.651
We were pretty close.
