00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:04.271
Congratulations, you have made
it to the end of the course.

2
00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:09.283
We have taken a look at so many things
from start to finish in this course,

3
00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:13.160
we have dive deeply into CSS Grid and
how CSS Grid works.

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.756
We looked at all of its
different syntaxes.

5
00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:19.851
We looked at different kinds of
layouts across media queries.

6
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.869
We looked at Flexbox and
how we might apply Flexbox to

7
00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.615
things like navigation bars and to other
layouts that are not possible with grid.

8
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:29.946
We looked at responsive images.

9
00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:33.147
And finally we dug into container
queries here at the end,

10
00:00:33.147 --> 00:00:36.494
both container size queries,
which are widely supported.

11
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.087
And container style queries,
which are coming up and

12
00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:41.627
are gonna allow us to do
some some super cool things.

13
00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:43.640
I hope you enjoyed this course,

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.303
I look forward to seeing you
in another one sometime soon.

15
00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.378
Thanks a lot.
