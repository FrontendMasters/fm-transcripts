00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
Okay, so
we've got one more of these left to go,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.847
and that is putting
this together this way.

3
00:00:07.847 --> 00:00:12.771
And so now we're gonna have our featured
card, but instead of having only two

4
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:17.034
cards next to the featured card,
we're gonna to have four cards.

5
00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:20.726
We're hiding all of our
paragraphs of text and

6
00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:26.784
we are going to add our buttons here,
make sure everything is all lined up and

7
00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:31.347
continue on with our headlines
there across the bottom.

8
00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.517
So here we are at 1,000 pixels,

9
00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:41.210
make sure your screen is set
to at least 1,000 pixels wide.

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.662
Here we go.

11
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.631
And we're ready to add our final set
of media queries here to change this to

12
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.050
a desktop kind of layout.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.972
So I'm going to start by adding
my media query at media,

14
00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:56.922
min width, 1,000 pixels.

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.269
And then what I'm going to do is brake
all of the stuff that I came before.

16
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.028
Remember, in our last
media query at 750 pixels,

17
00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:13.221
each one of those cards had a separate
position inside of the grid system.

18
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:16.538
We had done a whole bunch of
overriding that's going on.

19
00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:19.670
The first thing I'm going to
do is turn all of that off.

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.416
And the way I'm going to
do that is as follows,

21
00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.581
dot card nth child (2), and

22
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:32.600
then I'm gonna repeat this over and
over again.

23
00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:42.576
Nth child (3), Nth child(4),

24
00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.920
And nth child(5).

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.625
So for all of those particular cards,
we are going to do the following.

26
00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:04.271
I am going to say my grid template

27
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:08.240
columns is 1fr, 1fr.

28
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.168
My grid template rows are subgrid.

29
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:19.661
Our grid column is auto and

30
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.658
my grid row is a span 2.

31
00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:29.617
And so what that's gonna get us
is kind of a mess at the moment.

32
00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:33.609
Never panic, we're gonna continue
on formatting everything here.

33
00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.484
So, this just gets our cards sort
of generally into the right place.

34
00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.805
Then we can work on the layout
inside of each of those cards.

35
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:45.280
So for my card image, I'm going to say,

36
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.346
grid-column, 1/2, and my grid-row, 1/2.

37
00:02:54.421 --> 00:03:01.136
For my card text, Display, none.

38
00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:04.402
So we wanna have the the text
turned off for all of these cards.

39
00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:14.498
.Text, there we go, .text, there we go.

40
00:03:17.677 --> 00:03:20.365
Then for my card link,

41
00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.923
I'm going to say grid-column,

42
00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:32.477
span 2, and grid row 2/3.

43
00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:33.833
So that's where that's gonna be located.

44
00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:42.498
Card first child,

45
00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:51.121
Grid column, Span 2, and grid row span 4.

46
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.701
So that is going to put all of our
cards here next to each other,

47
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:02.365
next to that main card,
exactly as we wanted.

48
00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:06.621
We've still got a couple of issues
going on here with the layout and

49
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:11.043
our headlines are all lined up here
underneath exactly as we wanted.

50
00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:13.229
So that's looking good.

51
00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:19.303
For the first child we
wanna show its text,

52
00:04:19.303 --> 00:04:24.366
so .card, first-child.text,

53
00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:27.076
display, block.

54
00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:30.018
So that'll bring back our
paragraph of information here.

55
00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:34.521
And I forgot one style up here at the top,
so I've got all of my individual cards,

56
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:36.591
I've got their layout spelled out.

57
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:42.634
The issue that I have right now is
I haven't told the h2 where to go,

58
00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:46.452
so let's do that up here, .card h2, and

59
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:51.565
that is our grid column 2/3,
and our grid row 1/2.

60
00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.410
Phew, there we go.

61
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.736
And so now that I've told the h2 where
to go, I've told the image where to go,

62
00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:04.093
I told the button where to go,
I told the text not to display, and

63
00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:07.835
I've got everything running
off of the sub grid here.

64
00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:12.494
We finally have a layout where
everything is all lining up here, and

65
00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:15.612
we have our big headlines
across the bottom.

66
00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:20.822
So now if we were to crunch this up,
we'll go back to the previous layout,

67
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.636
Crunch it up further,
Go to our next layout,

68
00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:32.507
and then of course crunch it up even more,
and we'll go to our mobile layout.

69
00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:37.130
Pretty amazing that that's all one code
base, that we have all this content and

70
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.696
it's displaying so very differently at
all of these different breakpoints.

71
00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:44.765
So that is the power of grid.

72
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:48.767
This kind of layout would be very
difficult to achieve with Flexbox,

73
00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:53.535
it would be impossible to get all of these
cards to line up exactly on the same line.

74
00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:57.132
Using Flexbox based layouts
just wouldn't happen.

75
00:05:57.132 --> 00:06:00.801
So this is part of the reason that grid
is so powerful and so wonderful for

76
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.915
doing page layouts.

77
00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:04.586
This is what it was designed to do.

78
00:06:04.586 --> 00:06:09.032
And so you can achieve amazing
things when working with CSS grid.
