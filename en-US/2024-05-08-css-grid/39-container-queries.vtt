WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.703
Great.
So for

2
00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.706
the last two chapters of this course,

3
00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:06.036
we're gonna take a look at
the so-called container queries.

4
00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:11.879
It is the latest, hottest,
coolest thing that's happening in CSS.

5
00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.947
So let's talk about what
container queries are and

6
00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.810
how we might wind up using
them on our web pages.

7
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.795
So first of all,
what is a container query?

8
00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:26.482
It's gonna enable you to apply
styles to elements nested within

9
00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:31.094
a specific container based on
the features of that container.

10
00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.929
If that makes no sense to you,
read it again and

11
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.869
file it away cuz it'll make more
sense once we get into the code.

12
00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:41.269
The query itself is gonna return true or
false,

13
00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.206
depending on whether the query
condition is true for the container.

14
00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:50.618
Okay, so there's a true/false thing that's
going on here and there's containers

15
00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:54.310
involved, that's probably about
what you take away from this slide.

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.079
That is the MDN definition of this.

17
00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.555
We're gonna dig into
what exactly this means.

18
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:04.496
So the first thing that you should ask
anytime everybody talks about the hottest,

19
00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:08.087
coolest, latest thing is, so
how is the browser support?

20
00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:12.445
Well, turns out there are two kinds of
container queries in the real world at

21
00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:13.612
this point in time.

22
00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:18.522
The first one is container size queries,
and as you see here,

23
00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:23.916
it is well supported and not supported
at all by the usual suspects.

24
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.939
So that is something that we
could go ahead and use, right?

25
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.601
So container size queries, these
are the first ones we're gonna build, and

26
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:35.198
we'll do this here in chapter
13 fairly well supported.

27
00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:40.187
When you look at container style queries,
you will see that notably here,

28
00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:43.037
it's partial support all the way across,

29
00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:47.172
we'll talk about why that is when
we get to the style queries.

30
00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:49.642
And we also should point
out the following.

31
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.701
Firefox has zero support.

32
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.386
Okay, there's no support at all for
style queries in Firefox.

33
00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:01.959
And as of this recording, Safari has got
it in their beta version of the browser.

34
00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.601
So it's coming, but whenever that
beta version of Safari is released.

35
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.896
Chrome and Edge are the only ones that
support container style queries at this

36
00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:11.765
point in time.

37
00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:15.934
So when we get to chapter 14, make sure
you're working in Chrome or Edge, and

38
00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:17.569
I'll remind you then, okay?

39
00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.422
So meanwhile,
let's focus on container size queries,

40
00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:26.881
so that's the first one
we're gonna take a look at.

41
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.321
Here is the difference between a media
query and a container size queries.

42
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:38.749
Media queries, if we're looking at width,
are gonna consider the viewports width.

43
00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:46.225
Container size queries,
consider the width of the container.

44
00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:50.323
Obviously, we have a browser window,
it has a width associated with it.

45
00:02:50.323 --> 00:02:53.111
If we're looking at that,
that's a media query.

46
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:58.545
Anything else, any HTML element inside of
your web page could be a container, and

47
00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:05.649
that is what we look at when
we do a container query, Okay?

48
00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:10.819
So that is what we talk about when we
talk about container size queries.

49
00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.365
Containers are the elements
that are being queried.

50
00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:19.183
As you've seen, we've talked a lot
about containers in this course, so

51
00:03:19.183 --> 00:03:22.633
your grid container,
your flexbox container, the container for

52
00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.434
the entire layout of the web page.

53
00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:28.194
All of those are legit for
containers to be queried.

54
00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:33.113
But the rules within effect
only the container's

55
00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:37.339
descendants, not the container itself.

56
00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.187
And this particular item tripped me up
more than once when putting together

57
00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.643
the notes for
this particular chapter, okay?

58
00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:48.692
So you can test the container
to see if something is true, but

59
00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:53.543
you cannot actually affect
the way that container looks,

60
00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:59.385
which may mean you need some extra
HTML in order to make this work well.

61
00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:03.104
So how do you affect the container itself?

62
00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:07.301
So if you have a container and you
actually want to change the way that it

63
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.877
looks, there's only two ways to do that.

64
00:04:09.877 --> 00:04:14.809
You actually, either you're gonna use
media queries to change that container, or

65
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:18.433
you'll use the container query
on the container's parent.

66
00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.857
This is a lot, I'm just gonna
put it out here on the slides.

67
00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:28.408
It'll start making sense when
we put it into the code.

68
00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:32.934
Container sized queries
are an addition to responsive design,

69
00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:36.217
they are not a replacement for
media queries.

70
00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:40.779
So one of the mental models we've
developed in JavaScript is that as

71
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.421
the latest hottests come out,
we leave the old Javascript behind and

72
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:49.759
we move forward and
we're looking at new things in Javascript.

73
00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.708
This tends not to be true in CSS, it's
never 100%, but it tends not to be true.

74
00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:57.942
CSS just continues to grow [LAUGH].

75
00:04:57.942 --> 00:05:00.898
All the things we had before,
we've still got '.

76
00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:04.288
So this does not mean that
the wave of the future,

77
00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:09.330
after I've just spent all this time
talking to you about media queries,

78
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.061
why did I bother to do all of that
if container queries are the thing?

79
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:17.861
That is not the case,
this is an and situation.

80
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.649
Sometimes you'll want a media query,
sometimes you'll want a container query.

81
00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.191
It depends, okay?

82
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.273
I'm just gonna throw this here for
the moment.

83
00:05:28.273 --> 00:05:30.734
We have container query units, and

84
00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:33.940
I am not gonna talk about
what all of those are.

85
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.411
You can just refer to them.

86
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:39.607
We love our units in CSS, and boy,
I'm sure we needed seven more of them.

87
00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:41.144
So here you go.

88
00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:44.324
There's all the units that you
can do with container queries,

89
00:05:44.324 --> 00:05:45.889
this is right off the MDN page.
