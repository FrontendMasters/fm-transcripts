1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.608
All right, so we are moving on to 8D.

2
00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:08.742
And in 8D, I just wanted to do
a little demo here about margin and

3
00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:12.546
grid, and
bring up some points about margin and

4
00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:17.014
grid that can be confusing to
wrap your head around, and

5
00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:21.035
that kinda make people
very confused sometimes.

6
00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:24.555
This is not nearly as fun, but
it is kind of an important topic.

7
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.695
So let's take a look at our
beginning code pen here.

8
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:31.635
So I've given you a pretty
simple example here.

9
00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.675
No fun images, sorry about that.

10
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:40.575
So what we have here is a div, and
inside of this we have some paragraphs.

11
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.765
They have numbers associated
with those paragraphs.

12
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:45.985
And we've set this up with grid.

13
00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.645
So we've said, display: grid.

14
00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.425
We've got our three columns.

15
00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:52.941
We've got our 2 rem gap, and
between each of these, and

16
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:56.695
our container has got some
padding associated with it.

17
00:00:56.695 --> 00:00:57.895
Super, super simple.

18
00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.855
So does anybody see any display
issues here that look really odd or

19
00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.020
that you're wondering about?

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.761
&gt;&gt; It might be nice if there were
a gap on the left and right?

21
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.233
&gt;&gt; Might be nice if we weren't shoved
up against the edges of the page.

22
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.263
Absolutely true.

23
00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:16.273
Well, here's one thing
that comes to mind for me.

24
00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:19.161
Here's the gap, the gap is set to 2rem.

25
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:23.182
Yeah, check out the gap here.

26
00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:26.644
We have a gap in the column and
we have a gap in the row.

27
00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:29.416
It should be the same but
they are different.

28
00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:33.331
What is going on here, right?

29
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:38.736
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
switch this over to my full page view,

30
00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:42.842
and I'm gonna go take a look
at this in Developer Tools.

31
00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:50.210
Okay, where's my inspect?

32
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.810
Inspect, look at it.

33
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.172
So here's my grid, we can turn that on.

34
00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.283
And you can see the hatched lines here,

35
00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:03.964
which we went over earlier,
that's the gap.

36
00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:07.796
But we also have a little bit
of extra space here as well.

37
00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:10.125
Where is that extra space coming from?

38
00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:16.172
&gt;&gt; Is there an auto margin or
padding or something?

39
00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:21.605
&gt;&gt; Well, there is an automatically
applied margin, yes.

40
00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:24.513
And then it is coming from the paragraphs.

41
00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:28.381
So the paragraphs, normally,
you have a paragraph,

42
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:33.187
it has a margin on the top, and
it has a margin on the bottom, right?

43
00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:36.628
And when you have two paragraphs and
they meet,

44
00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:40.423
what is the difference
between the two paragraphs?

45
00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:44.650
How wide is that margin, and why?

46
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.986
So I have a paragraph.

47
00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:49.461
Paragraph has 1 rem of margin on the top,

48
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.095
it has 1 rem of margin on the bottom,
okay?

49
00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:55.652
I have another paragraph, same thing,
one on the top one on the bottom.

50
00:02:55.652 --> 00:03:00.042
When they meet vertically, what is
the distance between the two paragraphs?

51
00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:01.477
I know it's very strange, but

52
00:03:01.477 --> 00:03:04.247
what happens with vertical
margins is that they collapse.

53
00:03:05.637 --> 00:03:07.417
And if you think about it,
that makes sense.

54
00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.879
If you have a series of
paragraphs on the page,

55
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.277
you want them to actually have the same
distance between each paragraph, right?

56
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:18.872
If we had margins that did not collapse,
we would have 1 rem on the top,

57
00:03:18.872 --> 00:03:23.543
we would have 2 rems between each
paragraph, all the way down the page,

58
00:03:23.543 --> 00:03:27.164
until we had 1 rem at the bottom for
the last paragraph.

59
00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:28.472
Can you kind of visualize that?

60
00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:34.755
Kind of vaguely?

61
00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:38.179
Okay, so normally your margins
collapse when they intersect, and

62
00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.536
that keeps you from getting too big of
a gap between your elements on the page.

63
00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:46.846
So, what's happening here with grid,
the margins are not collapsing.

64
00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:52.736
We still maintain our margin on
either side of our grid cell.

65
00:03:52.736 --> 00:03:54.566
So that's the point
that I wanna make here.

66
00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:00.861
This is what happens when 1 plus 1 in this
case is making 4, I think, cuz we've got

67
00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:04.829
one round of margin and another rem
of margin and 2 rem in the gap.

68
00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.296
So 1 plus 1 is 4.

69
00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:10.241
&gt;&gt; So it's because the gap
is separating the margins?

70
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.029
&gt;&gt; And
the gap is separating the two margins.

71
00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.319
That's what the picture here is telling
us, the gap is that Red Hat Sharia and

72
00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.699
the white is the margin that's
coming from that paragraph.

73
00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.915
Okay, so that's what's going
on with each one of these.

74
00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:27.704
So what we could do here, all right, so

75
00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:31.856
I think what I'm gonna do here is,
let's get out of this.

76
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:33.146
Let's go back to our source code.

77
00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:39.852
And what I'm going to do in my HTML, is I
am going to change this just a little bit.

78
00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:43.776
So instead of a div with
a class of container,

79
00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:47.093
let's give it a div with a class of 1.

80
00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:58.920
Okay, and then we'll just have
a regular old paragraph in here.

81
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.554
And let me put in on an h2.

82
00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.972
Lorem.

83
00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:18.326
Okay, so the gap looks
a little bit more even, maybe.

84
00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:19.830
Let's do this for a couple of these.

85
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.476
&gt;&gt; So is that kinda specific
just to paragraph elements?

86
00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.271
&gt;&gt; No, that goes for any HTML element.

87
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:36.503
Headings have margins associated
with them, as do paragraphs,

88
00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:42.868
as do some of the list items have
some margin associated with them.

89
00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:47.884
And of course, if you add your own margin
to any div or anything else like that, you

90
00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:52.631
will find that those margins will behave
in the same way if they are vertical.

91
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.002
Horizontal margins do not collapse.

92
00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:57.683
It's just the vertical ones that collapse.

93
00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:00.176
This is 2, right?

94
00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:02.789
Yeah, okay, so there we go.

95
00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.490
Now that I've put it inside of a div,
okay, so now I have a div, I have an h2

96
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.541
and I have a paragraph inside of it, our
gap looks much more even here now, yeah?

97
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:18.441
Okay, so we don't have a giant
gaping gap here down at the bottom.

98
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.498
So that is one possible way
to fix this particular item.

99
00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:28.239
And the other thing that you
could absolutely do as well,

100
00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:34.232
is you could say something like h2,
p {margin: 0;}.

101
00:06:34.232 --> 00:06:37.181
And that would also help
tighten things up and

102
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:41.539
give you a more even gap in between
your various boxes here as well.

103
00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.475
So the big point that I
wanna make here is this.

104
00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:48.051
If you are looking at your
layout of your webpage and

105
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:53.457
you see something weird going on,
particularly in the vertical direction,

106
00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:57.556
where your gaps are bigger than expected,
think margin.

107
00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:01.438
Margin may be your problem, okay?

108
00:07:01.438 --> 00:07:04.376
And it may not necessarily be
an obvious kind of candidate,

109
00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:06.195
like a margin on the outside of a div,

110
00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:09.924
it might be a margin coming from a
paragraph or a heading or something else.
