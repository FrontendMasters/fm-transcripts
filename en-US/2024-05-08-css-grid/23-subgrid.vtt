00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.195
We are here in chapter 9.

2
00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:07.120
This is some of the latest,
most cutting edge parts of CSS.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.721
And we encountered a problem earlier in
this course as we were laying out some of

4
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.160
our webpages and we wound up making
something that looked like this.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.444
So we had some titles that we're wrapping,

6
00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:23.075
we had images that we're doing strange
things, nothing really quite lined up.

7
00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:26.859
Our cards are just totally fine,
they were coded in the right way, but

8
00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.297
because we have different
numbers of words,

9
00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:32.665
we wind up with some of these
wrapping kinds of issues.

10
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.105
To this point in time,
there has been no way for

11
00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:37.835
us to fix those particular problems.

12
00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.558
We could try fixing those cards by
using some kind of fixed height for

13
00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:45.803
all of those items, for a fixed height,
for our headline, a fixed height for

14
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:49.193
our image, and
a fixed height for our button.

15
00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:51.511
But if you've been around
web development long enough,

16
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.983
you know that fixed heights
are generally a really bad idea.

17
00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:57.936
You never know how many words somebody
is going to want to put in in that

18
00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.104
particular space.

19
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:03.460
So, generally speaking, fixed heights
are something you wanna avoid.

20
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.660
So how on earth do we fix this problem?

21
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.200
Well, the answer is
a thing called subgrid.

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.311
And what subgrid is going to do,

23
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:16.070
is you remember the way these
cards were put together.

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.250
We had actually two grid
systems that were going on.

25
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.042
We had one grid system that
was laying out each card,

26
00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:26.583
and we had one grid system that laid
the cards out on the page, right?

27
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:31.541
So now what we're going to do is we're
going to take our cards and we're going to

28
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:36.203
ask the cards to look at the underlying
grid that's controlling the page,

29
00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:37.173
thus subgrid.

30
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:42.345
And if our card elements are in line
with the grid underlying the page,

31
00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.289
then everything is going
to line up perfectly.

32
00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.643
That is the theory, okay?

33
00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:51.989
And if that makes your head explode,
no worries.

34
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.509
We'll go through a bunch
of examples of this.

35
00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.662
So let's start here with
the exploring sub grid activity.

36
00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:02.151
And if we take a look
here at our code pen,

37
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.971
you'll see that I have put
together a series of cards.

38
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.491
One card has a picture in it.

39
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.815
It's got a paragraph of text and a button.

40
00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:14.541
All of the other cards have
different amounts of headline text,

41
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:18.551
different amounts of card text,
and a button associated with them.

42
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:25.854
And if we take a look at
the structure of these cards,

43
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.395
we have a series of divs here.

44
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:36.415
So we have our container and then we
have a series of cards inside of that.

45
00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:38.063
They have two classes each.

46
00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:42.322
Card is one of the classes and then
a number is the other class, one, two,

47
00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:44.467
three, four and five.

48
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:48.309
Inside each card,
every card but the first one,

49
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.159
we have a headline,
a paragraph, and a button.

50
00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:59.435
In the first card we have a headline,
an image, a paragraph, and a button.

51
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.005
That's what we've got going on.

52
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.430
We'd like everything to line up and
look pretty.

53
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.870
It's not currently doing that.

54
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.550
So what can we do to fix this problem?

55
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.749
So, first of all,
what we can do is, let's see if we

56
00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.730
can make our cards line up
by using our card class.

57
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.515
And we would do something
like display grid,

58
00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:28.235
grid-template-rows, or sorry,

59
00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:33.413
grid-template-columns, 1fr, and

60
00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:39.517
grid-template-rows, repeat, 3, 1fr.

61
00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:42.345
So here, we're doing what
I just told you not to do.

62
00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:46.636
I am going to set up all of my cards to
have three rows per template card, and

63
00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:49.925
they're each gonna be one fraction high.

64
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.865
So take a look at how that
winds up making our page look.

65
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:55.905
Not so hot?

66
00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:00.901
Even if we ignore the featured card for
now.

67
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:04.153
Which is definitely throwing things off,

68
00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:07.946
we can see that we've kind
of got our headlines and

69
00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:13.291
then we've got a grapey huge gap
because that's the fr in 1fr.

70
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:18.163
We've got some text, that long
text is defining what 1fr is, and

71
00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:22.887
then we have our button that's
the top of the next 1fr.

72
00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.107
So that's what's going on here.

73
00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:26.172
We actually do have three sections.

74
00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:30.537
1fr is defined by the tallest section,
which happens to be our paragraph.

75
00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:34.227
And then we just have blank space if
we don't have anything else to fill in.

76
00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:39.537
This is why setting heights for your rows
is not gonna fix that particular problem.

77
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:40.986
Just doesn't work.

78
00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:47.008
So instead, what we're going to
do is work on our container.

79
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:49.076
Let me get rid of that card display.

80
00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:53.346
And let's take a look at our container.

81
00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:58.076
So here we have our display grid,
we have our grid template columns.

82
00:04:58.076 --> 00:05:00.271
We've said we want four columns.

83
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.167
With a min max of 200 to 1fr.

84
00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:10.154
And to this I'm going to
add grid template rows,

85
00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:18.036
and I'm just gonna say repeat, 3, 1fr.

86
00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.370
Okay, so we're gonna have three rows.

87
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.362
And because this is on the container,

88
00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:29.080
each one of these Lorem ipsum guys here
is going to be in one of those rows.

89
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.252
And then we have an extra row down here on
the bottom that has nothing in it, right?

90
00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:41.720
Because we don't have enough
stuff to put in that third row.

91
00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:49.094
Then I'm gonna update my cards,
and I'm gonna say display grid,

92
00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:53.375
and I'm gonna say grid
template columns 1fr.

93
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:58.544
And then I'm going to say the magic words,

94
00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:02.140
grid template rows subgrid.

95
00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:13.285
And then grid row span 3.

96
00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:16.495
Okay, so what did I just do here?

97
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:22.811
So what we've told each one of these
cards to do then is to have one column

98
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:26.256
refer to the rows that are used
to lay out the web page

99
00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:29.882
rather than any rows that we
declare here on the card.

100
00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:34.023
Take a look at the structure
of the web page itself, and

101
00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:37.614
then have each card span over three rows.

102
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:41.554
And we've used span 3 here rather than the
number notation because we don't really

103
00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:43.509
know where these cards are gonna wind up.

104
00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.017
But wherever they wind up wherever
they start we want them to span over

105
00:06:47.017 --> 00:06:48.544
three rows.

106
00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:51.449
So now we have some alignment here.

107
00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.433
So you can see that we have
our headlines are all aligned.

108
00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:57.776
This happens to be the image plus
the paragraphs, they're all aligned.

109
00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:00.672
Our read more buttons they're all aligned.

110
00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:03.642
Why this paragraph is here
with this read more button?

111
00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:05.550
We didn't tell the paragraph where to go,

112
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.612
and so
they were both occupying the same space.

113
00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:13.884
And then down here in our second row,
we wind up with headlines that align,

114
00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:18.315
paragraphs that align,
and buttons that align.

115
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:22.352
Okay, so let's fix this first card so

116
00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:26.526
that it spans the right number of rows.

117
00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:31.258
So this first featured card here,
we actually wanted it to span enough so

118
00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:36.177
that we can have the cards stacked
on top of each other two at a time.

119
00:07:36.177 --> 00:07:41.250
If each card takes up three rows,
then that means that

120
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.131
our featured card needs to go
from number one to number seven.

121
00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:50.402
So let's put that style on in here.

122
00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:52.977
We're going to say,

123
00:07:56.506 --> 00:08:01.180
Card number one we,
take a look here in our HTML,

124
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.942
our very first card is card number one.

125
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:12.493
So I'm gonna say .1 and
I'm gonna say grid-column, 1/3.

126
00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:19.004
We want it to take up half the screen,
and grid-row, 1/7.

127
00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:23.844
So our featured item will
now take up seven rows,

128
00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.093
And there's the other little
cards here underneath.

129
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:35.275
So it did in fact work, but we still have
these gigantic gaps inside of these cards,

130
00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:38.303
so that's the next thing to fix.

131
00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:39.781
So what's going on with that?

132
00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:44.426
Well, there's some ways we can tighten
up the space because remember 1fr is

133
00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:47.868
being defined by the tallest
member of whatever is here.

134
00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:52.605
And so one of the ways we can
tighten up that space is by

135
00:08:52.605 --> 00:08:57.011
saying .card greater than sign star.

136
00:08:57.011 --> 00:09:00.900
So what is the star mean in CSS?

137
00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:06.051
Everything, everything, okay?

138
00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:08.813
And what does the greater than sign mean?

139
00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:13.132
&gt;&gt; Parent?

140
00:09:13.132 --> 00:09:17.354
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is for
all of the children of card,

141
00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:24.602
whatever those children are we're
going to turn off their margin.

142
00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:28.419
And that's gonna tighten some
things up here a little bit, okay?

143
00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:30.709
Some help, not a whole lot.

144
00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:39.019
So now what we can do is play around with
some of our heights on our container here.

145
00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:44.320
So right now I have three rows,
each height is one fr.

146
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.393
I'm gonna change that.

147
00:09:47.393 --> 00:09:53.498
And after a lot of thinking about it,
if we said something like .2fr, 1fr,

148
00:09:53.498 --> 00:10:00.272
.1fr, we wind up tightening up our cards a
little bit and they start looking better.

149
00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:01.879
See that?

150
00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:09.335
Okay, so that's gonna make that middle
paragraph a little bit shorter and

151
00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:13.479
tighten up the space between
the headlines and the buttons.

152
00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:17.239
But everything is aligned, so
that was our goal here on these cards.

153
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:20.545
So does that kinda make sense?

154
00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:24.347
Okay, so to go back and
take a look at this one more time and

155
00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:26.263
sort of review where we are.

156
00:10:26.263 --> 00:10:31.092
What we did was, with our container,
we set up our rows to have a little bit of

157
00:10:31.092 --> 00:10:34.585
height associated with them for
those template rows.

158
00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:39.854
We are having our cards
latch on to those rows and

159
00:10:39.854 --> 00:10:45.375
span over them such that now
things will line across the cards.

160
00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:46.846
That's pretty much what's going on.

161
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.860
&gt;&gt; Is there a reason why there's

162
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.460
two class selectors for one?

163
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.873
&gt;&gt; A great question.

164
00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:02.218
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just one of them myself.

165
00:11:02.218 --> 00:11:05.949
&gt;&gt; Thank you, probably because
I was not paying attention and

166
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:10.136
that first one should not be there,
should just be the second one.

167
00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:13.416
Thank you for pointing that out, awesome.

168
00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:20.402
Okay, so we definitely still have some
spacing issues that are going on here.

169
00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:22.476
When in doubt what do we do?

170
00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:23.936
We go to our dev tools.

171
00:11:23.936 --> 00:11:27.835
So, let's take a look
at this in dev tools.

172
00:11:27.835 --> 00:11:32.623
And I'm going to put this
into full page view, and

173
00:11:32.623 --> 00:11:36.970
I'm going to take a look
at this in dev tools.

174
00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:45.939
Okay, so here's our container.

175
00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:46.749
Woo, look at that.

176
00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:49.586
There's our grid.

177
00:11:54.382 --> 00:11:56.169
And there's our subgrid.

178
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.520
Now, what's causing all
of those big spaces?

179
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.506
Can you see it?

180
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.483
&gt;&gt; All the text from our future.

181
00:12:10.483 --> 00:12:15.026
&gt;&gt; The text from the feature definitely
causing a big gap here, yeah.

182
00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.904
But what about up here?

183
00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:19.419
What's causing the big spaces up here?

184
00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:24.764
&gt;&gt; There's one header that has two lines.

185
00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.354
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,
we definitely want those to align.

186
00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:30.034
But look at where these gaps are.

187
00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:32.824
Remember the gaps
are the shaded parts here.

188
00:12:32.824 --> 00:12:38.698
See how the gaps are really
pushing things apart?

189
00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:41.401
So if we scroll down a little bit more,

190
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:46.812
some of the gaps here are causing a lot
of the gaps that we see on the page.

191
00:12:46.812 --> 00:12:54.411
So this might be a case
where what we wanna do, Is,

192
00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:03.977
Here inside of our CSS I'm
gonna change my container gap,

193
00:13:08.783 --> 00:13:13.860
From 2 rem and
I'm gonna change my card gap to 1 rem.

194
00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:24.957
And that will again, help to tighten
things up a little bit more and so forth.

195
00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:30.036
Why are my top cards so
much longer than my bottom cards?

196
00:13:30.036 --> 00:13:32.946
Anyone have a suggestion on that?

197
00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:37.370
Why are my top cards so
much taller than my bottom cards?

198
00:13:42.771 --> 00:13:44.377
&gt;&gt; Because of that text on the first one.

199
00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:51.445
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the image here is setting the
height of our text for these two cards.

200
00:13:51.445 --> 00:13:55.585
And then this paragraph is setting
the height for our read more buttons here.

201
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.225
That's what's going on.

202
00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:02.154
So these cards on top wind up being much
taller, and these cards down here that

203
00:14:02.154 --> 00:14:05.618
that don't have any of those constraints,
they are much shorter.

204
00:14:06.918 --> 00:14:09.908
So there are some compromises that
we are making here with subgrid.

205
00:14:11.388 --> 00:14:12.128
Make sense?

206
00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:14.480
Kind of sort of?

207
00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:22.411
All right, so this is just
an initial demo here with subgrid

208
00:14:22.411 --> 00:14:27.798
on this sort of artificial
example here of what's going on.

209
00:14:27.798 --> 00:14:33.937
Let's try applying this now to our actual
work that we were doing earlier today.
