WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.270
So let's try one more of these.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.066
So now what I'd like for
you to do is to write the media query for

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:11.607
900 pixels and larger, and you want
to make the screen look like this.

4
00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:14.700
Okay, 900 pixels and larger.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.550
So tell me about the layout
that you see here.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.665
How many columns are we going
to need to layout this web page?

7
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:23.428
&gt;&gt; Three.

8
00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:27.403
&gt;&gt; We need three columns
probably of equal sizes.

9
00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.583
How many rows are we going to need
in order to layout this web page?

10
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:31.923
&gt;&gt; Four.

11
00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:33.243
&gt;&gt; Four, right?

12
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:36.403
One, two, three, and four, okay?

13
00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:41.155
So what I'd like for you to do right now
is I want you to see if you can just lay

14
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:44.222
out the cards in this
larger arrangement here,

15
00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:47.540
don't worry about the layout
inside of the card.

16
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.020
If you have time, you're welcome to work
on that as well because that has changed.

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.264
But for right now, just see if you can
achieve the cards in all of those places

18
00:00:56.264 --> 00:01:00.794
and we'll worry about the layout inside
of the card here in just a moment, okay?

19
00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:07.403
All right, so
hopefully you got that layout.

20
00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:09.553
The cards may not be perfectly formatted,
but

21
00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:12.733
at least you got them in the right
spots inside of our grid.

22
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.173
Let's see how we did.

23
00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:18.172
So what do I need to put here
in my code to make this happen?

24
00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:20.809
&gt;&gt; @media.

25
00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:23.015
&gt;&gt; @media and?

26
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.446
&gt;&gt; Min-width 900.

27
00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:27.207
&gt;&gt; Min-width:900pixels.

28
00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:28.951
Awesome, okay?

29
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.141
Great start.

30
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:30.938
Now, what?

31
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.651
&gt;&gt; Grid template columns.

32
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.431
&gt;&gt; Okay, and that goes with a selector.

33
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:38.651
&gt;&gt; For card container.

34
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:43.164
&gt;&gt; Yeah, card container, all right.

35
00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:44.554
&gt;&gt; We got three columns.

36
00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:50.544
&gt;&gt; Okay, grid template columns and
what are your numbers this time?

37
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.834
&gt;&gt; I want 1fr, 1fr 1fr.

38
00:01:53.834 --> 00:02:01.176
&gt;&gt; Okay, so repeat 3, 1fr, awesome.

39
00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:04.189
What else?

40
00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.328
So we've still got that going on.

41
00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:10.775
What else needs to change here in
order to make this layout happen?

42
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.551
&gt;&gt; We need to have the feature column or
feature class.

43
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:24.498
Take up the first two columns and
then the first three rows.

44
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:35.404
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we have our feature take
up the first two of the three columns,

45
00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:40.690
that leaves room for the cards to move
up here into the other column, right?

46
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.646
And there's three of them, there they are.

47
00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:47.339
Formatting's all wrong, makes the featured
card look kinda silly, but that's okay,

48
00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.646
we'll fix that.

49
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:51.464
And then we've got our three
cards here across the bottom.

50
00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:55.329
Nice, that's exactly it, all right?

51
00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.353
Now, we already have our grid
template columns of 3, 1fr.

52
00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:04.962
We actually have that here inside
of our min width media query of 700

53
00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:06.571
pixels, right?

54
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:10.871
So that actually carries over just
fine into our 900 pixel media query.

55
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.761
We don't have to repeat it.

56
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:17.092
If you want to repeat it, you can,
but you do not need to repeat it.

57
00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:22.165
And I actually added a couple of
other extra things here just for fun.

58
00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:27.385
I said the max-width of our card
container would be 1200 pixels,

59
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:32.955
just because otherwise it continues
to expand until forever, right?

60
00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:35.785
So let's put a little barrier on it.

61
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:39.240
And then when it gets
more than 1200 pixels,

62
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.174
we can say margin: 0 auto, and
that will center it in space.

63
00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:45.584
So it will only get so wide.

64
00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:48.934
And again,
that's an art direction kind of thing.

65
00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:53.044
It's that is neither here nor there for
the functioning of the design.

66
00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:56.054
Okay, fantastic.

67
00:03:56.054 --> 00:04:00.107
So let's now work through
the formatting of these cards.

68
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.500
So we have everything stacked currently,
but

69
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.437
what we need is we need to
have them side by side again.

70
00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:09.997
Does that layout look familiar to you?

71
00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:12.817
Kind of like that layout?

72
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:20.791
Okay, so maybe it's exactly the same
layout at our desktop dimension.

73
00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:27.575
Wow, that's pretty tricky, okay?

74
00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:30.767
So if we go back to our
mobile format here,

75
00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:35.805
what would happen if we just kinda
copy what we have here for card?

76
00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:42.357
And what if we just drag it on into our
900 pixel media query, just copy it and

77
00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:43.009
paste it.

78
00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.346
Does that get us pretty close?

79
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.099
Pretty close, pretty close.

80
00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.829
Okay, so we need a few tweaks
to what we have there.

81
00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:59.908
And what I'm going to do is the following.

82
00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:03.480
We're gonna say our grid template columns,
rather than 3 and 1,

83
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.182
we're gonna just say 1 and 1.

84
00:05:05.182 --> 00:05:07.324
We want that image a little bit bigger.

85
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:14.885
The gap, I'm gonna give it
a little bit of gap, 1rem,

86
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:19.552
we're at a bigger dimension,
so that is a good thing to do.

87
00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:24.148
We don't need the border anymore because
the border is already carrying in from

88
00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:27.649
before so
we're just repeating ourselves there.

89
00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.478
We don't need the padding at 3rem 0
because that's just giving us too much

90
00:05:32.478 --> 00:05:35.350
space here on the top and
bottom of this card.

91
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.445
So I'm just gonna change
this to 1rem overall.

92
00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:43.686
1 is a little bit prettier, okay?

93
00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:49.599
And then right now we have our
align items set to center,

94
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:55.146
meaning that the Earth and Moon and
the button are all centered on that image.

95
00:05:55.146 --> 00:06:00.675
I'm gonna change this to stretch,
not gonna do a whole lot here for

96
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:05.415
us but it'll allow things to
stretch a little bit more and

97
00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:10.502
give us a little bit more space
hopefully for this button.

98
00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:12.740
We're gonna continue to
address things here.

99
00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:20.047
Okay, feature broke when we
brought in that card layout.

100
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:21.436
Why did that happen?

101
00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:29.026
&gt;&gt; So we're displaying the future now
with the same properties of that card.

102
00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:31.634
So it has the grid and-
&gt;&gt; Exactly,

103
00:06:31.634 --> 00:06:36.115
because our featured item has
both a class of feature and

104
00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:41.415
card, this card style is
applying here to my feature item.

105
00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:43.995
So I am actually just going to cut and

106
00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:50.935
paste my feature class to come after the
card, because I'm gonna add to the style.

107
00:06:50.935 --> 00:06:56.025
And I'm going to say, for
the featured card, display: block.

108
00:06:56.025 --> 00:06:59.603
Because that actually is still
the style that I want here.

109
00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:01.563
So my one card will display block.

110
00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:05.613
My other cards are going to display
in some kind of grid format.

111
00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:06.383
Okay, and

112
00:07:06.383 --> 00:07:11.354
then I think the only other thing that
I have to do here is say .card a.

113
00:07:11.354 --> 00:07:19.020
And I'm going to make my font size 0.7rem,
okay.

114
00:07:22.623 --> 00:07:25.163
Maybe I need to tweak my
media query size too.

115
00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:28.796
Is this working for you guys at 900,
or are all those buttons wrapping?

116
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:32.893
All the buttons are wrapping.

117
00:07:32.893 --> 00:07:33.438
Okay, so

118
00:07:33.438 --> 00:07:38.023
maybe we need to tweak our media query
to where the buttons don't wrap anymore.

119
00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:41.686
Maybe we need to make it 950.

120
00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:47.392
So we'll make this a min-width of 950,
and that'll fix that problem too.

121
00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:53.982
We'll go from our cards like this at
949 to our cards like this at 950.

122
00:07:53.982 --> 00:07:54.996
How's that?

123
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.880
Now the only other thing
we might wanna do is and

124
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.249
I don't think I can make
my screen big enough.

125
00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:08.509
So I'm gonna just kind of zoom
out on my browser a little bit.

126
00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.189
What's happening here with my h1?

127
00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.492
What's going on with that when I
get to really big screen sizes,

128
00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:16.969
anyone have any idea?

129
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:19.926
&gt;&gt; Still left justified
against the whole screen.

130
00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:22.919
&gt;&gt; It is left justified
against the whole screen and

131
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:27.153
I have set my card container to
have a max-width of 1200 pixels,

132
00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:30.594
but the h1 is not inside of
the card container, right?

133
00:08:31.914 --> 00:08:36.541
What would happen if I moved my
h1 inside of the card container?

134
00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:37.545
Would that work?

135
00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:39.745
&gt;&gt; Would that be justified with the cards?

136
00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:42.245
&gt;&gt; It should be justified with the cards,
right?

137
00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:47.155
So if I take my h1 and I put it
inside of my card container, whoops.

138
00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:47.775
Not like that.

139
00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:50.385
&gt;&gt; Too inside.

140
00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:52.415
&gt;&gt; Very, very inside there.

141
00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:53.345
There we go.

142
00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:55.535
I put it inside the card
container like that.

143
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.629
What happens?

144
00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:57.325
&gt;&gt; It disappeared.

145
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.940
&gt;&gt; Actually, it didn't disappear,
what happened?

146
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.635
&gt;&gt; Just went over to the right.

147
00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:02.601
&gt;&gt; It's behind it.

148
00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:07.999
&gt;&gt; It's right here [LAUGH] great reaction.

149
00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:09.809
Yes, what just happened?

150
00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:12.419
Can anyone explain what just happened?

151
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.689
&gt;&gt; Our feature's overriding it.

152
00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:19.909
&gt;&gt; The feature card, we told it to
display starting in line number one,

153
00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:21.718
so it still is, right?

154
00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:24.595
What is h1 being treated like?

155
00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:27.790
&gt;&gt; The next element.

156
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.038
&gt;&gt; It's a child of the card container,
right?

157
00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.128
And so
it's being treated just like a card.

158
00:09:33.128 --> 00:09:37.618
If you like it, you can keep it, but
it's not what the designer said.

159
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:41.658
Yeah, so we can't really put this inside
of card container and that's why.

160
00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:42.641
That is not a bug.

161
00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:44.241
That's a feature, right?

162
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:47.921
h1 is a child of card container
just like everything else.

163
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.811
So it's doing exactly
what you told it to do.

164
00:09:49.811 --> 00:09:51.661
Don't you hate it when that happens?

165
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:56.711
Yeah, okay, so we'll take that h1
back out of the card container.

166
00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.845
We need to do something
else with its styling.

167
00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:04.877
So what I did here is I just added,
still inside of my 950

168
00:10:04.877 --> 00:10:10.039
pixel media query,
I'm just gonna add another h1 style.

169
00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:15.010
And I'll set its max-width to 1200 pixels.

170
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.146
And I'll set its margin.

171
00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:24.941
Actually I did a little bit different
here, I said 3rem 0 2rem auto.

172
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:29.513
Sorry, 3 rem auto, 2 rem auto.

173
00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:32.293
Now when you have four numbers like this,
what does that mean?

174
00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:34.523
&gt;&gt; Trouble.

175
00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:36.693
&gt;&gt; Trouble, awesome.

176
00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:38.713
You're the first person to ever say it.

177
00:10:38.713 --> 00:10:39.583
I love it.

178
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:43.089
Okay, so how you remember
what these four numbers are?

179
00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:46.519
They are top, right, bottom, and left.

180
00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:51.430
And if you can remember that you'll
stay out of trouble, T-R-B-L, yeah?

181
00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:03.942
Top, right, bottom, left.

182
00:11:03.942 --> 00:11:07.308
The other way people do this is
like a clock, the hands on a clock.

183
00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:09.983
You start at 12, you go 3, 6, and 9.

184
00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:12.693
Top, right, bottom, left.

185
00:11:12.693 --> 00:11:16.073
So if you're a visual person,
that works as well.

186
00:11:16.073 --> 00:11:19.571
Doesn't work for me,
this is what works for me.

187
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:22.624
Okay, so
now that we fixed that little bug so that

188
00:11:22.624 --> 00:11:28.175
the headline is in line with everything
else and it doesn't act like a card.

189
00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:29.335
Let me zoom back in.

190
00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:35.295
We should be all set here with our layout.

191
00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:36.615
It was a lot, right?

192
00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:43.221
But you see how those core grid concepts
that we learned right at the beginning of

193
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:47.807
the workshop are carrying on here into
more and more complicated designs.

194
00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:49.247
We just continue to iterate.
