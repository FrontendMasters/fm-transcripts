00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.565
Now that you have learned all of these
interesting little tidbits about grid,

2
00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:08.902
all of the interesting kinds of syntax
that are available to you, min-max,

3
00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.922
the ability to overlap grid cells.

4
00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:15.152
The ability to work with subgrid,
all kinds of other tips and tricks,

5
00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:19.383
we're gonna put this all together
in a exercise that we're gonna step

6
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.550
through here as part of this video.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.278
So, just to show you what
we're gonna wind up creating,

8
00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:29.669
we are going to put together
a page about The Moons of Saturn.

9
00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.478
And we will start off with, again, a
featured card and then underneath of this

10
00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:40.594
we gonna have some other cards that
are less important potentially.

11
00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.580
And then down at the bottom,
we have just some headlines.

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.337
This is likely a pattern that you'll see
a lot on news websites, you'll see like

13
00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:50.487
a big featured news article,
maybe some that are less important and

14
00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.605
then you'll see a whole
bunch of headlines.

15
00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:55.190
So that's the pattern that
we're working with here.

16
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.350
We've got a very mobile kind of layout,
very narrow screen.

17
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.983
When we get a little bit wider,
we gonna go to two columns, okay?

18
00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:05.993
And then still our headlines
stacked underneath.

19
00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:12.763
When we get to tablet, we're going to put,
two items next to that featured item.

20
00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:17.073
And then underneath we gonna have,
some other various kinds of displays.

21
00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:21.020
And then when we get to desktop,
we're going to put all of our images up on

22
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.039
the first row, and we're gonna put all
of our headlines down on the second row.

23
00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.759
You're gonna code all
this mostly on your own.

24
00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.089
Yeah, you actually have all
the ability to work on doing this.

25
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:37.282
So my advice to you is,
we're gonna start by reviewing that HTML,

26
00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:42.572
looking at those designs and
then just focus on the mobile layout.

27
00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:44.872
This is the first part of
what we're going to do.

28
00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:47.980
So right now,
just focus on this mobile layout and

29
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.346
consider how you might layout this page,
because if there is no card,

30
00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:57.772
the cards themselves are simply stacked
going down the page, that's a hint.

31
00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:00.637
What we have going on inside
of each of those cards,

32
00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:05.927
they are less than 500 pixels, is some
kind of layout inside each of those cards.

33
00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.313
And then down here on the bottom for
these headlines,

34
00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.446
that treatment is slightly different,
okay?

35
00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:13.427
So you actually probably have two
units of things going on here.

36
00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:17.027
We have the image based unit, and
then we have the headline based unit.

37
00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:20.373
And they're gonna require
slightly different treatments.

38
00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.443
So if you open up your,
opening CodePen here,

39
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:28.191
what I recommend that you do is start
just like I have showed you before.

40
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.115
Flatten up your HTML so you can see
the structure of your HTML, okay?

41
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:37.410
So we have a title, we have a series
of articles here that are our cards,

42
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.218
and we have an unordered list that has
a series of headlines inside of it.

43
00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:48.908
You can dig into that HTML, of course,
each list item has a link with a text.

44
00:02:48.908 --> 00:02:54.320
For each article, it's going to have some
kind of image on the top, it's going to

45
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.985
have an h2, it's gonna have some text, and
it's going to have a button based link.

46
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:05.712
And down in the JavaScript, I've given you
the instructions as one giant comment,

47
00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:09.354
and I've given you a little
bit of starting CSS here.

48
00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:14.878
We have our border box model at the top,
we have some, just some basic styling for

49
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:19.313
our fonts, our images, and
a basic button background.

50
00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:22.093
So that's just enough to get you started.

51
00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:25.443
See if you can just work on
the mobile layout part of this.

52
00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:31.243
Remember to make your mobile screen small,
make sure it's under 500 pixels.

53
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:35.133
And then see if you can start
by laying out those cards

54
00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.621
within this particular design.

55
00:03:40.326 --> 00:03:45.760
All right, so hopefully you've gone
through this first part of this exercise

56
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.092
where you set up the mobile layout just
like we saw on the course website.

57
00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:52.710
So at less than 500 pixels,

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.362
you should have one card that's gonna look
slightly different than all the others.

59
00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:01.854
These additional cards you're gonna see a
picture on the right, you're gonna see all

60
00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:05.005
the text in the button over here
on the left as we scroll down.

61
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:08.226
And then down on the very bottom,
we have three headlines and

62
00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:10.702
we have some lines between all of these.

63
00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:14.012
So let's see how I went
about writing this.

64
00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:16.852
So first of all, do we need a media query?

65
00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:18.051
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Why not?

66
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:21.891
&gt;&gt; Because you've mobile first.

67
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:23.581
&gt;&gt; Exactly, this is mobile first.

68
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:25.872
So, these are the mobile styles,
they're the default,

69
00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:28.341
there's no media queries
that are necessary.

70
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:33.053
So, where I got started here,
first of all,

71
00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:37.890
I said my h1, and
I said padding: 0 1rem and

72
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.485
that was just to get it off
the edge of the page, okay?

73
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:44.763
So that's all I did.

74
00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:46.677
That's actually not part
of our card system,

75
00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.353
but I did want it off
the edge of the page.

76
00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:53.986
Then for my card itself, tell me how
I'm gonna go about styling this,

77
00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:56.274
what's the first thing I need to do?

78
00:04:58.115 --> 00:04:59.175
&gt;&gt; Apply display grid.

79
00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:02.715
&gt;&gt; Display grid okay, display grid.

80
00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:06.979
And so an interesting misconception
I was heard from one of the students,

81
00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.760
which is that when you work with
flexbox and you say display flex,

82
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.485
immediately your screen changes.

83
00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:16.055
But when you say display grid,
nothing changes and

84
00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.494
you feel like it's not working.

85
00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:22.409
That is actually just kind of the way
these two specifications work, with grid,

86
00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.381
you gonna have to give it more information
about rows and columns, with flexbox,

87
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.474
it just defaults to a row right away.

88
00:05:28.474 --> 00:05:33.564
So just something to be aware of when
you see nothing happen, don't panic.

89
00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:37.009
Okay, so after display grid,
what is the next thing I'm going to do.

90
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.965
&gt;&gt; Grid display column or grid template.

91
00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:45.020
&gt;&gt; Grid template columns, yeah.

92
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.874
Grid template columns, and I didn't
really give you any specific dimensions,

93
00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:55.208
but it's probably something like 3fr 1fr.

94
00:05:55.208 --> 00:06:00.338
So maybe about one third in that,
or sorry, about three quarters in

95
00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:05.676
that first column and about one
quarter in that second column, okay?

96
00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:10.271
We gonna wanna separate them by a border,

97
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:14.874
border-bottom, 1pixel solid, ccc.

98
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:19.169
Then I'm gonna give this some padding,
3rem,

99
00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.790
1rem, and
maybe I'll give us a little bit of a gap.

100
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.862
And I'm gonna make my column gap and
my row gap different, so

101
00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:33.736
I'm gonna say my column gap
will be something like 1rem,

102
00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:38.127
my row gap will be something like 0.5 rem,
okay?

103
00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.902
So we kind of have
the outline of a card there,

104
00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:44.565
although everything is in the wrong place,
okay?

105
00:06:44.565 --> 00:06:46.555
So what does that mean?

106
00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:48.843
What is the next thing that I have to do?

107
00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:55.357
Maybe I should try getting my
image out of the left column and

108
00:06:55.357 --> 00:06:58.098
put it over on the right side, yeah, okay?

109
00:06:58.098 --> 00:06:59.447
And how would I do that?

110
00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:07.481
.card img, then we're gonna

111
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:11.801
say our grid column is where.

112
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:13.108
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

113
00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:17.298
&gt;&gt; 2/3, exactly, and

114
00:07:17.298 --> 00:07:20.873
my grid row is what?

115
00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:21.943
&gt;&gt; 1/3.

116
00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:26.683
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1/3,
because we want that image to

117
00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:30.810
span over all of the rows that are here.

118
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.776
Or at least the one from the headline in
the paragraph, I guess it's what I've got.

119
00:07:38.794 --> 00:07:45.219
Okay, for my h2 then .card h2.

120
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.896
You can optionally tell it
where to go grid-column 1/2,

121
00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:55.319
it's already there, but you could
put it in if you want and margin 0.

122
00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.968
They'll just tighten everything
up just a little bit here.

123
00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:08.480
And then, that pretty much takes
care of all of these cards here,

124
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.533
these four, but our featured cards
a little bit different, yeah?

125
00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:17.376
That's a very cool picture and now we've
made it so tiny we can't even see it.

126
00:08:17.376 --> 00:08:23.016
So, this first card,
how would I select that first card?

127
00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:25.986
What is my selector?

128
00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:26.826
&gt;&gt; First child.

129
00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:32.086
&gt;&gt; Yeah card, first child,
the very first card.

130
00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.232
What are we gonna do?

131
00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:36.963
Anybody have a suggestion for
how I can can style my first card?

132
00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:37.823
&gt;&gt; Display block.

133
00:08:37.823 --> 00:08:39.403
&gt;&gt; How about display block?

134
00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:43.671
In other words,
let's just turn off grid altogether.

135
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:45.973
Actually I know why it was going on.

136
00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:49.243
Card first child isn't gonna work
in this particular situation, why?

137
00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:52.833
What is our first child?

138
00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.485
Well, first of all,
what's our containing element?

139
00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:58.527
The body is our containing element here,
okay?

140
00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:00.676
The body is containing all of these.

141
00:09:00.676 --> 00:09:02.680
What is the first child of the body?

142
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.776
&gt;&gt; The Moons of Saturn.

143
00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:08.056
&gt;&gt; The h1 is the first child of the body.

144
00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:14.880
So, card first child, there isn't one,
but, there is one of card first of type.

145
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.770
So this is the difference between
first child and first of type.

146
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.110
So first child literally means all
of the children, whoever they are.

147
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.080
It's just like we have girls and
we have boys as children, right?

148
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.920
And so for those children, the first child
is whoever the first child is, right?

149
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.750
But we can also say we have a first boy,
and we have a first girl, yeah?

150
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.777
[INAUDIBLE].

151
00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.632
&gt;&gt; Exactly, in this case,
this is just first of type, and

152
00:09:41.632 --> 00:09:44.844
that'll select that first card, all right?

153
00:09:44.844 --> 00:09:47.387
Now let's deal with the end of this.

154
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.367
So this is all looking pretty good.

155
00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:51.267
Let's go all the way down to the end here.

156
00:09:52.517 --> 00:09:56.611
So at the end, the very bottom there,
we have our list.

157
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.038
List is the right markup because,
of course,

158
00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:03.099
this is just an unordered list of titles
that could be appearing in any order.

159
00:10:03.099 --> 00:10:07.651
But we need to give them a little bit
of styling so that they look like this.

160
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:10.811
Again, we still want to have
the lines in between them.

161
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:14.278
We want the text a little bit bigger,
we want it bold, and

162
00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:18.846
we want it green, and the text size is
about the same size as our h2, okay?

163
00:10:22.006 --> 00:10:26.686
So anybody have any suggestions for
how I might go about dealing with this?

164
00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:35.190
The first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna give this a class and

165
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.211
you don't have to,
you could just work with the ul and

166
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:42.615
li and that would work just fine for
the purposes of this example.

167
00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:46.138
In real life, chances are you're gonna
have more than one unordered list on

168
00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:50.235
the page like starting with the navbar,
the navbar should be an unordered list.

169
00:10:50.235 --> 00:10:54.335
So a class is generally a good
idea here just for the future,

170
00:10:54.335 --> 00:10:59.222
you're gonna add more lists,
most likely to this web page.

171
00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:03.604
And so
now then I can say my class of additional.

172
00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:11.695
The three styles you're gonna use
any time you don't want your lists,

173
00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:14.470
whether they're ordered or unordered,

174
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.801
to appear as just text on the page stacked
on top of each other are the following.

175
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:24.693
You're gonna wanna say
list style type of none.

176
00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:31.295
And that is gonna get rid of the bullets
or the numbers depending on what you

177
00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:34.356
whether you're working with an ordered or
unordered list.

178
00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:38.832
And then we're gonna say padding: 0,
margin: 0.

179
00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:44.934
These have historically been somewhat
uneven some browsers have done padding,

180
00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:46.882
some browsers have done margin.

181
00:11:46.882 --> 00:11:49.510
By zeroing up both of them,
then you cover all your bases.

182
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:57.654
Okay, then,
after that we can say .additional li.

183
00:11:57.654 --> 00:12:01.584
So for those list items,
what are we going to do?

184
00:12:01.584 --> 00:12:08.784
We need to make it bigger,
font-size: 1.4rem.

185
00:12:08.784 --> 00:12:14.853
We made a make them bold so
font-weight: bold.

186
00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:17.780
We need to have the border in
between them, just like we have for

187
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.978
everybody else.

188
00:12:18.978 --> 00:12:27.652
So, border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc.

189
00:12:27.652 --> 00:12:30.322
And then we just need to give them
a little bit of breathing room.

190
00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:37.185
Padding: 3rem 1rem.

191
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.638
And that'll give you a little bit of
space in between all of those, okay.

192
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:50.288
And then of course, the last part of
this is styling up the links themselves.

193
00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:54.326
So we can do that additional a.

194
00:12:57.758 --> 00:13:01.908
And the color here,
I'm not entirely sure what this color is.

195
00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:06.221
Let's see,
let's go stroll down to our button here.

196
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:12.170
The same color as our background color
of the button, so we'll just copy that.

197
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.783
And we'll make that
the same color as our a.

198
00:13:16.783 --> 00:13:20.124
Obviously, you could be using CSS
variables in order to do this, and

199
00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:22.493
then that would make things
a little bit easier.

200
00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:28.803
Oops, and I have to spell additional
right, there we go, okay?

201
00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:34.507
And then, we could give this
a hover state if you want,

202
00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:41.087
[COUGH] .additional a::hover,
text-decoration, none.

203
00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:43.767
So when we roll over our links,
the underline disappears.

204
00:13:43.767 --> 00:13:49.167
&gt;&gt; I guess CSS resets kind of
out of date now then, right?

205
00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:52.457
&gt;&gt; You can absolutely use
a CSS reset if you want.

206
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.184
There are various levels of reset.

207
00:13:55.184 --> 00:13:57.244
But there are some that normalize it.

208
00:13:57.244 --> 00:14:01.749
So whether it's padding or margin, you can
normalize all that resets will actually

209
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:05.430
turn everything off and then you
have to actually re-code all of it,

210
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.294
which I think is personally
I think is a waste of time.

211
00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:11.390
If I was gonna go anyway,
I'd use a normalize, and

212
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.204
it just depends on your
personal preference.

213
00:14:14.204 --> 00:14:17.595
In my case, I think it's a little bit
much for a lot of these exercises, so

214
00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:18.993
I tend not to use it.

215
00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:19.927
But if you like using it,

216
00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:22.443
there's absolutely nothing
wrong with including one.

217
00:14:22.443 --> 00:14:25.063
Certainly, you have a normalized
style sheet as part of Bootstrap,

218
00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.383
I think it's in Tailwind as well.

219
00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:30.383
&gt;&gt; It's not as necessary as it used to be.

220
00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:34.830
&gt;&gt; That is true, thank goodness
the browser manufacturers have actually,

221
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.631
we continue to standardize.

222
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:41.261
It's a 20 year process, [LAUGH]
we'll get there one day, hopefully.
