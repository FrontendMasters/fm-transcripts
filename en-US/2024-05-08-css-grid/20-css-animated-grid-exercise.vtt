1
00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:03.556
There's Pluto and the other Pluto, okay?

2
00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:08.135
You can do this with grid cells and
you can do this with animation,

3
00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:10.140
with CSS animation, okay?

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.450
So what you're gonna do here in
this particular code pen challenge,

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.654
you are gonna, I've given you a beginning
code pen and I've given you two images,

6
00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:23.692
I've given you Pluto and
I've given you Pluto squared, okay?

7
00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:28.468
So what I would like for you to do,
is to put the two images on top of

8
00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:33.334
each other and then we can use CSS
animation to fade the top image,

9
00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.251
which is probably the one
with Pluto on it, the dog.

10
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:42.425
You can fade it in and out in order
to make it appear and disappear.

11
00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.813
Feel free to Google, okay?

12
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:50.497
For how you might make an edit,
it's a very simple animation,

13
00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:54.585
make one image appear and disappear, okay?

14
00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:57.620
I'll just show you
the closing code pen here.

15
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.472
But this is what you're gonna
try to achieve with two images,

16
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:05.188
Grid, and CSS animation, okay?

17
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:12.363
All right, well, let's go through
how we might make this magic happen.

18
00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:17.266
So, here's the ending code pen here.

19
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:22.779
And what I've got here in the ending code
pen, it's pretty simple, I just have a div

20
00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:28.156
with a class of Pluto, and then I have my
two images, Pluto 1 and Pluto 2, okay?

21
00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:33.671
And then in my CSS,
we have our Pluto display grid,

22
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.893
one column, one row, yeah?

23
00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:40.835
And then the first child and the last
child, both of those images, we want them

24
00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:45.287
displaying in exactly the same place, grid
column of 1, 2, and a grid row of 1, 2.

25
00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:49.257
We want them to display exactly
together on top of each other.

26
00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:53.189
And then for the last child, what we're
going to do is an animation thing.

27
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.842
So you can look up the CSS Animation
course here at Frontend masters, but

28
00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:59.681
this is a really simple one.

29
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:04.433
So, the animation property
takes a named animation,

30
00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:09.391
I guess, that key frames thing there,
I've just said,

31
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:13.334
go from the opacity of
0 to the opacity of 1.

32
00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:16.889
You can make these key frame animations
much more complicated than that,

33
00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.908
and include timing and all the rest of it.

34
00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:23.473
I just went with the super simple,
and I gave it the name of pluto-Fade.

35
00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:27.744
So then you call pluto-Fade inside of the
animation property, which is shorthand for

36
00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:30.272
a whole bunch of different
animation properties.

37
00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:33.546
So we've called the key frames for
pluto-Fade, we said,

38
00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.522
make it happen over three seconds.

39
00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.759
Why?
Because that's what looked good to me.

40
00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.302
We want it to go on infinitely,
never stop, and we want it to alternate.

41
00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:44.830
So in other words, we want the image to
fade in, then we want it to fade out,

42
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.063
then we want it to fade in.

43
00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:50.651
Otherwise what will happen is, it'll jump
back to the beginning and it'll look very,

44
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:51.402
very choppy.

45
00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:55.946
So by going in and out like this,
alternating, you wind up with that

46
00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.761
smooth animation of the Pluto the dog
animating in over Pluto the moon.

47
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.818
By the way, I can't take credit for
any of this, when they took the pictures

48
00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:11.113
of Pluto back, I think it was 2017,
this meme went around on the internet,

49
00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:15.084
which I of course saved because
I thought it was hilarious.

50
00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:18.649
And it occurred to me that this would be
just a fun little animation thrown in

51
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:19.731
here for this course.

52
00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:22.175
So that's how it happened
to come into being.
