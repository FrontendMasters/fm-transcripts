1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.370
So now the next one we wanna take a look
at is how do we make this go on desktop.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.814
We wanna put all these guys in
one file next to each other and

3
00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:12.849
we wanna align them at
the bottom of their buttons.

4
00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.242
I don't know why you'd ever wanna do this,
but this is a good exercise just for

5
00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.730
Flexbox.

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.626
So, how about I give you like three
minutes to take a look at the next

7
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:28.009
media query and
to remind you what that's gonna look like.

8
00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.638
It's gonna wind up looking like that,
okay?

9
00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.564
All right, so
let's go through the answer here.

10
00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:42.664
So we're gonna make my screen
a little bit bigger now.

11
00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:45.424
And now we're gonna work
on our media query.

12
00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:53.002
So we search, of course, with media query,
@media(min-width: 850px).

13
00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.385
So at at least 850 pixels,
what are we going to change?

14
00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:02.195
Well, remember that we have some
styles that are coming through.

15
00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:07.295
So the display: flex will carry through,
the row wrap will carry through.

16
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:12.575
There are some things we might want to
change here, notably, the justify-content.

17
00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:20.674
So I'm going to say my
photo-cards are going

18
00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:28.071
to have a justify-content of flex-start.

19
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.361
So that's gonna push us all
the way over to the left side.

20
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:35.151
Okay, so there's our guys pushed over to
the left side there in the second row.

21
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:39.896
Now the hard part comes with math,
isn't it always math?

22
00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:44.118
Okay, so I'm just gonna set this
up here for the moment, card.

23
00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:49.567
And let's just say flex-basis is auto,
cuz I'm gonna turn off what I have here.

24
00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:56.129
And actually,
the other thing I'm going to do,

25
00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:02.278
these are just placeholders,
just flex-flow: row nowrap.

26
00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:07.045
Just so that we can look at this
layout here with the five boxes

27
00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:10.559
next to each other for the moment.

28
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:17.309
Okay, so we're working with 100%
going across this page, right?

29
00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.034
We know that we have 100% going across.

30
00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:23.545
We need to have some kind of gap in
between each one of these cards.

31
00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:29.013
So let's just say for argument's
sake that that is 2%, makes sense?

32
00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:35.155
So how many gaps do I
have here on this page?

33
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.044
&gt;&gt; Four.
&gt;&gt; Four gaps, right?

34
00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:39.270
Because there's a gap in
between each of the cards.

35
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.900
We don't need to count the gap on
the far left or the far right, but

36
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.740
we have four gaps here.

37
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.978
If each one of those is 2% wide, that
takes how many percent away from our 100?

38
00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:55.089
8%, right?

39
00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.689
Four gaps, 2% each, is 8%.

40
00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.564
100% minus 8% is 92%.

41
00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:08.737
We take 92%, and
we divide it by five, as one does.

42
00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:10.206
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You can do that in your head, right?

43
00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:15.629
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, it comes out to be 18.4%.

44
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.583
So, let me turn off my flex-flow here.

45
00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:25.543
And I'm going to set my card to 18.4%.

46
00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:31.170
So that'll give us our five cards here all
in a row with that little bit of math,

47
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.788
that's how we did that.

48
00:03:33.788 --> 00:03:36.388
And now comes the last little trick.

49
00:03:36.388 --> 00:03:38.394
How do we align them all on our buttons?

50
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:44.883
Did somebody get that?

51
00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:52.159
&gt;&gt; Flex and
justify-content inside the card.

52
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.312
&gt;&gt; Inside the card?

53
00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:59.887
So you want to say justify-content:

54
00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:04.204
flex-end, like that?

55
00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:06.254
Okay, doesn't work, why?

56
00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.850
Look up at your HTML.

57
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.626
What is the parent and what is the child?

58
00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:19.969
&gt;&gt; That needs to go in the parent,
not in the child, it's the right rule.

59
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.333
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so
it's gonna go in photo-cards, right?

60
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.939
But you're on the right track,
flex-end is is exactly what we want.

61
00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.006
It's not justify-content,
that row justify-content, and

62
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:32.619
we're working with a row.

63
00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:34.649
So that's the alignment across the row.

64
00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.039
We want the alignment on the column.

65
00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.819
So what we want then is

66
00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:46.510
align-items: flex-end.

67
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the word content refers
to the content of the parent.

68
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.300
&gt;&gt; If that helps you remember these
things, I think that's great.

69
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.435
Personally, I think all of these
are just kind of random words,

70
00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:02.890
they really don't mean anything to
you in one direction or another.

71
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.050
justify-content or align-items,
they're kind of the same.

72
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.598
But I have no better solution for
the names of these properties, honestly.

73
00:05:12.598 --> 00:05:16.948
So, go W3C for naming all these things.

74
00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:18.567
I can't suggest anything better.
