1
00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:05.817
I know that at some stage, probably
a big majority of the people watching

2
00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:11.340
this have had a go at doing this and
it's gone horribly wrong, right?

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.131
They've met resistance, okay?

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.945
They've come up against problems.

5
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:20.201
People do tend to be resistant to change.

6
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.216
And so
if you are suggesting changing things,

7
00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:27.563
people will come up with all kinds
of reasons why it can't be done.

8
00:00:27.563 --> 00:00:30.869
So I thought I'd knock off a few
of the most common ones, and

9
00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.969
how I tend to respond to those, I may or
may not work in your organization,

10
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.813
I can't make promises,
it depends on the people,

11
00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:42.209
it depends on the circumstances but I'll
give you a sense of how I deal with it.

12
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.413
So one of the big ones,
have you ever had this one?

13
00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:49.455
So, we can't get access to our audience,
have you ever had that one?

14
00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:54.812
Or we'd love to, we'd love to do user
research and testing, but it's really

15
00:00:54.812 --> 00:01:00.027
hard to our customers, our clients
are very busy or whatever else, right?

16
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.746
That's quite a common
scenario that comes up.

17
00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:08.500
So first thing I would say is
you can do user research just

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.657
using existing assets a lot of the time,
right?

19
00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:18.119
So there will be data, there will be
anecdotes, there will be online comments.

20
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.339
There'll be feedback that
the audience has given over time.

21
00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:29.364
So, often one of the excuses is, not that
we can't get access to the audience, but

22
00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:34.548
we talk to them so much we can't ask
them yet again about another thing.

23
00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:38.851
All right, well give me everything you've
ever talked about with them before, and

24
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.016
I'll have a look through it and
see what we can learn, right?

25
00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:45.669
So that's always my starting
point with this one.

26
00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:46.597
There may be gaps,

27
00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:49.794
there may be information that you
can't get out of that, right?

28
00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:52.338
It doesn't answer your questions, so

29
00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:55.813
the next thing I tend to do
is use surrogates, right?

30
00:01:55.813 --> 00:02:01.459
By that I mean people who are engaged
with your target audience.

31
00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.584
So the best one, and
I'm doing this right now,

32
00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:11.477
I'm working with a charity to
increase their fundraising values.

33
00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:16.339
They have fundraisers and a lot of people
don't get around to actually, they say,

34
00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.265
I want a fundraiser and
they never actually do it.

35
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.994
And so we're trying to work out why
that is and how we can improve it.

36
00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:27.751
But I'm meeting resistance in terms of
speaking to those fundraisers because

37
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:31.210
they're sending them so
many texts, so many messages,

38
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.744
they don't wanna interrupt them again.

39
00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:37.713
So what I've done is I sat down
with the support staff, the people

40
00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:42.332
that are answering their queries and and
talking to them in the chat rooms and

41
00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:46.400
people like that and saying,
well, what are the issues, right?

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.349
Well, one of the issues turns out that
you're sending them too many texts and

43
00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.707
too many emails and too many messages and
you're annoying them.

44
00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:57.465
So you can talk to people who've got
a close working relationship with

45
00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:58.301
the end users.

46
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:03.178
Cuz a lot of the time organizational
decisions being made by people that never

47
00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.439
spend any time with users, right?

48
00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.040
So bringing the voices of those who do
into the equation can work very well.

49
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.166
Work with colleagues is what I've
just described, that idea of working

50
00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:19.713
with people who are in a close
working relationship with users.

51
00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:24.006
The surrogates one is actually more
the people who are very similar to

52
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.494
your target audience.

53
00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:28.935
So let me give you
an example with that one.

54
00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:34.680
Let's imagine you wanna do
some usability testing, right?

55
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.712
Now that doesn't mean in that situation
you need your exact target audience.

56
00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:42.359
You probably don't, right?

57
00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.073
The truth is that, I don't know,
you and me, for example, okay?

58
00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:52.490
We're different generations,
we come from different countries,

59
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.374
we're different genders,
we're very different people,

60
00:03:56.374 --> 00:04:01.340
yet doing usability testing, we probably
would have very similar results.

61
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.367
Because usability just cannot use it,
right?

62
00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:09.929
We've got similar level of
computer knowledge, for example.

63
00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.220
And we're confident, maybe my vision is
causing me more of a problem than it is

64
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.527
you so that might be a slight difference
that would affect usability testing.

65
00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:20.166
But generally speaking,

66
00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:24.195
you could swap people out quite
easily with usability testing.

67
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:27.387
While if it was design taste or
tone of voice,

68
00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:33.183
then we would be very different over that,
cuz that's a more subjective thing and

69
00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:36.965
is more based on demographics and
that kind of stuff.

70
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:41.723
So your three options are look at
existing data, use surrogates, use,

71
00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:46.247
wear appropriate where you can get
away with using someone who isn't

72
00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:48.509
your specific target audience and

73
00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.132
work with the colleagues that are actually
interacting with people on a daily basis.

74
00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:59.061
So that's one big
objection that people have.

75
00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:04.494
Another big objection is, well,
you haven't spoken to enough people,

76
00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:07.659
or we don't have access to enough people.

77
00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.653
And so you'll maybe do a little bit
of testing and then people go, well,

78
00:05:11.653 --> 00:05:14.086
you only tested with three people, right?

79
00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:18.018
Acknowledge that speaking to
more people would be better, and

80
00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:22.852
then you would happily do that if you were
given the time and budget to do that.

81
00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:27.901
However, emphasize that,
even with a small number of people is

82
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:34.456
better than making guesses and assumptions
cuz that's the alternative, right?

83
00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:38.055
So really that this is
a false premise here,

84
00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:41.570
that we haven't spoken to enough people.

85
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.151
One person is better than
making stuff up yourself.

86
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:53.030
But this is actually a really useful
one for actually demonstrating that,

87
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.084
well, yeah, I'd love to test
with more people, let's do it.

88
00:05:58.084 --> 00:06:00.387
It's a good one to turn around.

89
00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:06.037
Another common objection that you'll meet
is where your results might be biased,

90
00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:07.121
all right?

91
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:10.233
No, no, yes,
I know you did a little bit of testing but

92
00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:12.146
the results are gonna be biased.

93
00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:15.600
And so they dismiss it because
they don't wanna face it.

94
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.782
So first of all,
you can minimize the bias.

95
00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:23.644
You can by being very careful
about the questions that

96
00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:27.545
you ask in a survey or
in your user testing.

97
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:31.590
And in fact, I often find AI is
really good for this, right?

98
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.674
These days, ChatGPT,
if you take your question and you copy and

99
00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:41.582
paste it into ChatGPT or
your large language Model of choice.

100
00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:43.576
Other services are available.

101
00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:47.932
If you take your question,
pop it into ChatGPT and say,

102
00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:52.481
make this as clear, concise,
and unbiased as possible.

103
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.547
It helps you remove bias very quickly and
easily, right?

104
00:06:56.547 --> 00:06:59.223
So that's a great way
of getting around that.

105
00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:04.598
But you can also, even if your results
are biased, that's kind of okay.

106
00:07:04.598 --> 00:07:09.205
It's okay as long as you're
aware of those biases.

107
00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:12.711
So you've got to be with
any usability testing,

108
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:18.101
especially if you're doing lean,
quick, and dirty usability testing,

109
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.703
anything you do is gonna be a bit rubbish,
right?

110
00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:23.693
It's gonna have its limitations.

111
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:28.685
And so as long as you're aware of
those limitations, that's fine, okay?

112
00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:32.588
And then if people believe
the results are biased by all means,

113
00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.172
let's do some more in-depth research.

114
00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:41.064
Again, you're upselling, the idea of
let's do more and let's do it better.

115
00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:45.798
So a lot of these kinds of
objections you get are actually

116
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:51.757
opportunities to kinda push for
something a bit more and a bit better.

117
00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:55.865
But this is the biggie,
this is the one you'll get the most.

118
00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:59.819
It'll be too disruptive and
take too long, right?

119
00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.002
Get this all the time,
we don't have time to do it or

120
00:08:03.002 --> 00:08:05.558
we don't have the budget to do it.

121
00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:10.140
We've got to get this done
by the end of the week etc..

122
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.046
Any excuse just to keep things moving
forward, especially project managers

123
00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:20.327
are the people that are really bad at this
because they just wanna get it delivered,

124
00:08:20.327 --> 00:08:24.262
and I can understand that
they're under enormous pressure.

125
00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:27.414
So, how do I get round this little one?

126
00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:30.937
Well, my best tip is, just do it.

127
00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:33.937
Just don't tell anyone you're doing it,
right?

128
00:08:33.937 --> 00:08:36.292
Don't give people
the opportunity to say no.

129
00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:39.583
Just do it as part of
your working practices.

130
00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:42.063
As the way you operate, right?

131
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:47.089
So was it Grace Hooper,
I think was the firs

132
00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:52.827
female admiral in the US Navy and
amazing woman.

133
00:08:52.827 --> 00:08:56.778
She came from a development
computer science background and

134
00:08:56.778 --> 00:08:59.706
credible woman and
she said a very famous, quote,

135
00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:04.424
which you'll all know is easier to ask for
forgiveness than permission, right?

136
00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:06.652
That's what you need
the usability testing.

137
00:09:06.652 --> 00:09:12.024
And when I show you the kind of
usability testing I'm proposing,

138
00:09:12.024 --> 00:09:16.322
you can easily slip that
under the radar without ever

139
00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:19.948
telling anybody you're doing it, right?

140
00:09:19.948 --> 00:09:22.135
Don't ask, right?

141
00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:25.671
Avoid asking for anything,
I know it's just said just do it,

142
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:27.441
which sounds like don't ask.

143
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:30.740
But what I'm talking about here
is don't ask for anything.

144
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.168
Don't ask for any money,
don't ask for any extra time.

145
00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:41.587
Just do the research without any
additional resources, all right?

146
00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:46.477
Don't ask anybody else to change the way
they work at least not to begin with.

147
00:09:46.477 --> 00:09:48.532
Because that's where
you'll meet resistance.

148
00:09:48.532 --> 00:09:51.463
And so
the extension of that is no extra time.

149
00:09:51.463 --> 00:09:55.307
Keep your research from impacting
the timeline of the project,

150
00:09:55.307 --> 00:09:59.016
build around the timeline that
already exists to begin with.

151
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.779
Now, I'm very aware that I'm making
a lot of, you're going, well,

152
00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:04.175
how can I do that, right?

153
00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:05.997
But that's what we're gonna come on to.

154
00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:08.983
This is why this is the kind
of foundational principles.

155
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:13.124
I'm hoping I can show you opportunities to
start doing some of these things within

156
00:10:13.124 --> 00:10:14.212
these constraints.
