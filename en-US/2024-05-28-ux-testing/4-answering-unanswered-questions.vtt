1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.920
So with that in mind, when should we be
doing this kind of research and testing?

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.310
I'm saying there's lots of opportunities.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.910
Well, what are these opportunities?

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.446
When your time and budget is limited,

5
00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:19.030
picking the most appropriate moments to do
testing and research is crucial, right?

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.818
The worst thing you can
do is save it all up.

7
00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.834
First of all, when it comes to
user research in particular,

8
00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:31.365
and testing, actually,
applies to both, avoid testing and

9
00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.769
doing research for the sake of it, right?

10
00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.761
So, one of the things that I come across
all the time is people have read stuff

11
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.531
online, right, they says you should
begin with a discovery phase.

12
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.831
And in the discovery phase,
you should do user research.

13
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:52.053
And once you've built a prototype,
you should test, and so people get to

14
00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:57.771
these points in the project plan, and they
go, right, I've got to do user research.

15
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.984
And then they do a load of use of
research without a good reason,

16
00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:06.453
[LAUGH] without a specific thing in
their mind that they wanna know.

17
00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:11.403
We've got this tendency to carry out user
research because that's what you're meant

18
00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.273
to do without any clear reason why, right?

19
00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:19.122
So don't do a comprehensive discovery
phase without having a clear idea, for

20
00:01:19.122 --> 00:01:22.307
example, of what you wanna discuss, right?

21
00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:27.282
What you wanna know, general background
research doesn't really provide

22
00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:31.067
the best return on an investment, right?

23
00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:37.017
Instead, you wanna get answers
to unanswered questions.

24
00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:41.707
So you've got a load of research
previous stuff, you've been briefed and

25
00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:46.844
all the rest of it, write down a list of
things you wanna know that you don't know,

26
00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:49.987
that's where you should
be doing user research.

27
00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:52.170
So things like this, right,
who are my audience?

28
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.372
What are their top tasks?

29
00:01:53.372 --> 00:01:54.532
What are the user goals?

30
00:01:54.532 --> 00:01:56.718
You can read what's on the screen.

31
00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.154
These are the kinds of questions that
pop into my head when I'm working on

32
00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.072
a project,
why I wanna know this kind of stuff.

33
00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:07.845
Some of it I'll have been told, in which
case I don't need to bother researching

34
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:10.241
it, some of it won't have
been clearly answered.

35
00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:14.543
So for example, you're almost always told
who your audience is, but you never know

36
00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:18.856
what their top tasks are, what the most
important things they wanna do are, right?

37
00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:21.261
They're never told that kind of thing.

38
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.335
So it's kind of working out
what you need answers to, and

39
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.908
that applies throughout the project,
right?

40
00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:30.911
So as a question comes up, then do a
little bit of research or a little bit of

41
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:35.325
testing, rather than having this kind of
formal process that you pass through.

42
00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:38.370
And I'm not criticizing
those formal processes,

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.123
I'm not criticizing discovery phases or
anything like that,

44
00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:47.227
I'm just trying to be pragmatic and do
the minimum we could get away with, right?

45
00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:50.742
If you can do a discovery phase go for
it, but

46
00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:54.357
oftentimes you don't get the opportunity.

47
00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:57.576
And the truth is,
at the beginning of projects,

48
00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.002
you often don't know what
the right questions to ask are.

49
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:03.160
I never do, perhaps I'm just rubbish.

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.194
[LAUGH] But the truth is, until you get
into the weeds of working on a project,

51
00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:15.005
you don't really know what exactly
you need answers to, right?

52
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.661
And things don't always
occur to you upfront.

53
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:19.823
I was working on a project recently and

54
00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:22.865
I was doing prototyping and
going, I actually don't

55
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:27.647
know whether they think that users think
that this is more important than this.

56
00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:31.135
Which of these two tasks do
they do the most often, right?

57
00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.621
And which one do they want?

58
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:34.437
And I didn't know.

59
00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:37.967
And I'd done a discovery phase, and
for some reason that hadn't come out.

60
00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:41.611
So that's when you need to do the testing,

61
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:44.254
is when the question is
fresh in your mind, right?

62
00:03:45.744 --> 00:03:48.954
Also, use it as a great way
of resolving disagreements.

63
00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:52.330
This is the time that I always do testing,
is when the moment comes,

64
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.154
people start disagreeing with one another.

65
00:03:55.154 --> 00:03:57.915
Any opportunity, where people disagree,

66
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:02.406
that's a chance to do usability testing or
user testing.

67
00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:04.707
So, questions like, does it work?

68
00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:09.726
Most stakeholders will go,
I don't think this is gonna work, right?

69
00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:12.656
They don't really know why, okay?

70
00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:17.476
And you could get into this debate of
trying to prove to them that it will work,

71
00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:22.147
or you could even try and reason them
round and/or ask them why they think it

72
00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:24.826
won't work and all the rest of it.

73
00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:29.626
Instead of doing that, use it,
say, well, let's find out, right,

74
00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:35.066
because it's an excuse to test much better
than getting into a debate with them,

75
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.806
or the kind of which is better?

76
00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:44.381
One stakeholder has one idea, another has
another idea, test it, let's find out.

77
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.601
And then the final one is,
will users like it, right?

78
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:54.625
So design is so subjective,
or certainly aesthetic

79
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:58.975
design is so objective, and so subjective.

80
00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:02.516
So you wanna test that stuff, right?

81
00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:06.743
You wanna put it in front of people and
test it rather than,

82
00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:12.372
one stakeholders saying, he wants it
to be blue because he's always loved.

83
00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:15.794
Blue is the corporate color, but
then another executive goes, well,

84
00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:17.962
I really don't like that shade of blue.

85
00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:22.183
And it turns out to be because his auntie
had curtains that were that shade of blue

86
00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:23.925
and he hated his auntie.

87
00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:28.895
You think I'm joking, but
things like that do happen.

88
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:31.361
And then so
they have an argument with one another and

89
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.445
you end up with insipid green or
something.

90
00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:40.195
Ridiculous scenario, put it in front of
users, let them choose, let them decide.

91
00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:45.218
So resolving disagreements,
that's when you wanna go in for testing.

92
00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:49.350
And then also where the information
that you've inappropriate,

93
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.978
is not the right word, right,
it sound like it's dirty.

94
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:57.803
Rude, when somebody says it's something
inappropriate, do some testing, know.

95
00:05:57.803 --> 00:06:02.535
When people give you information that
actually isn't relevant or right, or

96
00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:06.779
you've got concerns about it,
that's a good opportunity to test.

97
00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.502
So, a common one is, yeah,
we did personas, here's our personas.

98
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:13.105
When did you do them?

99
00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:16.659
2017, I think it was, right?

100
00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.543
Okay, well, maybe we need to check that
it's still relevant enough to date,

101
00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:25.244
or where people give you
biased information, right?

102
00:06:25.244 --> 00:06:28.340
So you're often presented
with survey results, and

103
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.594
you look through the questions and you go,
well, that was a loaded question, right?

104
00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:35.684
No wonder they got that answer.

105
00:06:35.684 --> 00:06:39.906
So that's another opportunity to go back
and say, well, perhaps we ought to just

106
00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:44.486
double check this, or you'll be given
information that's just unfit for purpose.

107
00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:46.946
So personas are a great
example of that actually.

108
00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:51.574
And often marketing teams will go,
yeah, we did personas and

109
00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:57.448
they give you personas and it's like,
this person reads the New York Times and

110
00:06:57.448 --> 00:07:02.077
drives an Audi and
has 2.3 children and a dog, right?

111
00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:06.197
Well, that doesn't really help me
as a UX professional [LAUGH] right?

112
00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:11.747
So in those situations, you're gonna need
to do different types of user research.

113
00:07:13.347 --> 00:07:17.819
So those are all opportunities
to do research, but

114
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:23.126
the kind of general rule is test early,
test often, right?

115
00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:29.259
Don't save up your testing,
I mean, one of the kind of go

116
00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:35.587
to books in the field of user experience
design is Steve Craig's book,

117
00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:40.458
Don't Make Me Think, right,
which is a superb book.

118
00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:44.034
And he wrote a follow up called
Rocket Surgery Made Easy,

119
00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:45.907
which is really good as well.

120
00:07:45.907 --> 00:07:49.795
It's actually very pragmatic
about introducing facilitated

121
00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:55.067
usability testing into an organization
without taking a lot of time or effort.

122
00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:59.107
But one of the diagrams from
his book is this one, right?

123
00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:06.176
Actually, the more rounds of testing,
the more problems you're going to uncover.

124
00:08:06.176 --> 00:08:10.553
And the reason being is because of users
will get stuck on the first round of

125
00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:14.717
testing, and they won't be able to
progress far enough to find some of

126
00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:17.166
the deeper problems in the site.

127
00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:21.614
But if you then go away and fix those
problems and testing again, then you'll

128
00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:26.142
uncover more problems that are deeper
in the site or the application, right?

129
00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:29.647
So actually more rounds of
testing often work better, but

130
00:08:29.647 --> 00:08:32.003
each round can be more lightweight.

131
00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:35.884
So instead of testing eight
users in one round of testing,

132
00:08:35.884 --> 00:08:39.527
you test three users twice or
three times, right, and

133
00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:43.203
then ultimately you'll find
more problems that way.

134
00:08:43.203 --> 00:08:48.003
Not only does it catch more issues,

135
00:08:48.003 --> 00:08:52.323
it also hides the cost, right?

136
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:56.127
Because if you're doing lots of little
bits spread out through the project,

137
00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:58.947
people are less likely to
notice the new turning around.

138
00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:03.483
And say, well, we need to Stop the project
for two weeks while we organize a big,

139
00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:06.375
massive round of testing
at the end of the project.

140
00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.449
Where then the results come back and
everybody goes, well,

141
00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:12.042
it's too late to fix all that now, right?

142
00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:14.098
So testing early and often.

143
00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:19.392
So in terms of testing earlier, there
are kind of several key reasons for this.

144
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:24.337
First of all, it's cheaper to fix
because the earlier you find a problem

145
00:09:24.337 --> 00:09:29.362
that it's not been developed yet,
it's probably in a prototype phase or

146
00:09:29.362 --> 00:09:32.708
where it's easy and
cheaper to fix the problem.

147
00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:38.080
Also fixing a problem earlier is faster
to do, which means that the whole project

148
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.373
gets to market faster, and then finally,
it's easier to adjust, right?

149
00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:47.758
So if you've got find a problem earlier,
it's much easier to pivot and adjust based

150
00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:51.483
on the feedback than it is once you've
sunk a big cost into the project.

151
00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:59.073
So a lot of the time, I'm doing
testing when I'm designing, right?

152
00:09:59.073 --> 00:10:02.467
And I'm producing mock-ups like this one.

153
00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:07.364
So you end up with a kind of page mock-up
of what your application might only

154
00:10:07.364 --> 00:10:09.677
be a single page, right?

155
00:10:09.677 --> 00:10:14.447
And these are great times to get in
there doing testing straightaway.

156
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:18.107
And the tests are really easy,
it's like, we're testing do they get it?

157
00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:21.732
Do they understand what
the website is about, right?

158
00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:24.182
Do they know how to navigate it?

159
00:10:24.182 --> 00:10:26.682
And can they see it?

160
00:10:26.682 --> 00:10:30.399
Can they see the call to action or
some specific thing?

161
00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.168
So when clients go,
we need to make the logo bigger,

162
00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:36.594
is cuz they're worried that people
won't see the branding, right?

163
00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.119
Well, I'm not sure actually matters,
but anyway, set that aside,

164
00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:43.780
you can prove the logo's bigger enough
by doing a little bit of testing.

165
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.902
Can they see the logo?

166
00:10:44.902 --> 00:10:46.502
Yes, they can.

167
00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:48.322
And then do they like it?

168
00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:51.142
So those are the main questions
I'm looking to answer

169
00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:53.802
in the design phase most of the time.

170
00:10:53.802 --> 00:10:58.312
Not particularly mind blowing
complicated questions, are they, right?

171
00:10:58.312 --> 00:11:00.291
But those are the main
ones you're gonna answer.

172
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:05.622
During the build, once you've built pages
and you've got something that's more

173
00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:10.891
interactive, then the questions become
things like, can they find it, right?

174
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.470
Does it answer their question?

175
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.386
It's another common one, so

176
00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:21.861
oftentimes people are going to websites
looking for answers to questions.

177
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:23.938
So, does it answer their question?

178
00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:27.161
And can they use it if it's
got an interactive component?

179
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:30.911
That is essentially all that
you need to know, right?

180
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:34.186
It's just different
variations of that question.

181
00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:38.445
And then when it comes to,
once you've launched the website, right?

182
00:11:38.445 --> 00:11:40.368
So what do you need to know there?

183
00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:41.259
Well, again,

184
00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:45.935
it's very simple, you need to know,
where are people dropping out of the site?

185
00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:49.892
What's stopping them from completing
their tasks that they're trying to do?

186
00:11:49.892 --> 00:11:52.387
How can we increase conversion?

187
00:11:52.387 --> 00:11:57.596
And what will work better, this new
version of it or the existing version?

188
00:11:57.596 --> 00:12:00.164
That's basically what it boils down to.

189
00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:05.294
So all of our testing is basically
answering questions, right?

190
00:12:05.294 --> 00:12:09.073
Once we get into that mindset of whenever
there's a question, run a bit of testing,

191
00:12:09.073 --> 00:12:10.254
it goes so much smoother.
