00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.070
Thank you so much for joining me today,
so what are we talking about?

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.841
Well, we're talking about
user research and testing.

4
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:12.647
And I've created this workshop for
a very specific reason, and

5
00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:17.453
reason that really is important to me,
because I get to work with

6
00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:22.348
a lot of different people across
a lot different organizations,

7
00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:27.254
and everybody knows the value of
user research and user testing.

8
00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:33.325
At least developers do, designers
obviously do, UX researchers obviously do.

9
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:37.926
We all know how important this stuff is,
but getting to actually do it can be

10
00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:41.431
really hard, all right,
it can be really challenging,

11
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:46.053
there's never enough money,
there's never enough time.

12
00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:49.332
It seems complicated and
difficult to do and so

13
00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:52.367
it doesn't really happen like it should.

14
00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:56.810
And so, in this workshop, I wanna
kinda really encourage you that you

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.703
probably can do more than you think you
can do, to maybe take off a little bit of

16
00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:07.237
the pressure that goes around, this is how
you're supposed to do usability testing.

17
00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:11.538
And if you don't do it this way,
you're not doing it right and

18
00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.336
encourage you just to get started in
it and to give you some tools of how

19
00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:21.087
you can get started without any money and
without any time, right?

20
00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:25.247
So I know that sounds impossible, but
trust me there are ways of doing it.

21
00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:27.347
So that's the kind of aim for today.

22
00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:32.185
Just to briefly introduce myself because
that's the kind of thing you're supposed

23
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.987
to do when you do these workshops.

24
00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:36.108
My name is Paul Boag, and

25
00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:40.958
really depressingly I've been
working on this field for

26
00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:46.970
almost 30 years now,
in fact it is 30 years 1994, yes.

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.997
So I know I don't look that old obviously,

28
00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:55.930
it doesn't look like I've been
working in the field 30 years, note.

29
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.130
No nothing no that's fair enough.

30
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.180
But I have and over those years,
I've kinda worked with all

31
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.536
kinds of organizations doing
all kinds of different work.

32
00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:10.384
So I've got a lot of experience
in user research and

33
00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:15.606
testing it's probably these days,
I would say 70% of what I do.

34
00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:20.934
So it's a really important area to me but
I've also worked with a huge range

35
00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:26.858
of organizations, right, from kinda tiny
little companies all the way through to

36
00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:32.047
enterprise clients across pretty
much every sector you could imagine.

37
00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:36.979
So, my clients include people like
Shopify, so kind of Silicon Valley

38
00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:41.829
type companies, PUMA big enterprise
companies, the UK Governments

39
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.290
have worked with governments and
charities I've worked with.

40
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.719
And I tell you all of this to say
that whatever I talk about today is

41
00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.228
applicable no matter what kind
of clients you have, right.

42
00:02:55.228 --> 00:03:00.157
So I don't care whether you've just
finished working with a really big bank,

43
00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:04.640
o obviously, you think big organization
they've got lots of money and

44
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.203
time for user research and testing.

45
00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:10.898
Well, in my experience,
that isn't always the case, right?

46
00:03:10.898 --> 00:03:14.390
Because there's deadlines and
you've got to get things out and

47
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.019
well we know what users want anyway,
we don't need to do testing.

48
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.688
So even big organizations suffer from
this and then small organizations often

49
00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:26.870
obviously do as well you know,
they don't have a lot of time or money.

50
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.429
So we're gonna start off by looking at
the principles of a lean user research and

51
00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:32.350
testing.

52
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.925
So this is kind of the foundation
of how I approach this problem,

53
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:41.943
right, of doing user research and
testing with no budget and no time.

54
00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:44.883
So that's where we're gonna start at.

55
00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:47.615
Then we're gonna look at, okay,

56
00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:52.432
what do we need to do up front
before we start any kind of work?

57
00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:57.217
We kinda all know we're supposed to
do some user research up front, but

58
00:03:57.217 --> 00:03:59.302
what do we actually need to do?

59
00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:01.742
What's the bare minimum
we can get away with?

60
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.036
And how can we fit that in alongside
everything else we're doing?

61
00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:10.783
And then we're gonna look at some
different areas of different opportunities

62
00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:15.146
to do some user research and
testing through the projects.

63
00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:19.386
So for example, one is planning
your information architecture.

64
00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:23.852
That's an area that often things go
horribly wrong, because they were not in

65
00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:28.263
any way talking to users so we're gonna
look at information architecture.

66
00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:31.083
We're also gonna look at
testing design concepts,

67
00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.732
you know when you have to do those
mock ups that you show to clients and

68
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:39.133
stakeholders, and
they're supposed to sign of on the design.

69
00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:45.277
Well, there is an opportunity there for
design testing to make a big difference.

70
00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:49.247
We're also gonna look at opportunities
that come from prototyping.

71
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.417
When you've got a prototype,
what testing can you do there?

72
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.967
How can you keep that really
lightweight and easy?

73
00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:57.720
And then finally,
we're gonna look at, okay, so

74
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.669
you maybe have an existing website or
an existing app.

75
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.539
What testing can you do on that
something that already exists?

76
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.287
And I wanna come back to this sentence,

77
00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.799
do what you can something
is better than nothing.

78
00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:14.259
I wanna come back to that again and again,

79
00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.729
that's the kind of underlying principle
of everything we're talking about, right?

80
00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.060
Start small doesn't matter
where you're at, just try and

81
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.720
do something a little bit better than
what you're already doing, right.

82
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.820
If you're doing no user research and
no testing, then just do something, right?

83
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.767
Maybe just run one question survey
before you start working work.

84
00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:45.880
If you're already doing
I don't know AB testing,

85
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.997
maybe consider adding some
qualitative stuff alongside it.

86
00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:52.177
Do you see what I'm meaning?

87
00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:56.054
Always look for the next level
up the way of improving, but

88
00:05:56.054 --> 00:06:01.279
never resent those small beginnings,
no matter how small it is to begin with,

89
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.392
doing something is always
better than nothing
