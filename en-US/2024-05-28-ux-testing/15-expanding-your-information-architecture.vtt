1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.541
So yeah, you've done your initial
information architecture,

2
00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:07.864
your top-level information architecture,
but

3
00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:12.306
we probably want to, well,
we do need to expand that out, right?

4
00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:16.054
So after we've done our top-level
information architecture focused on our

5
00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:19.120
primary tasks, well,
it's not all about our primary tasks.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.641
There was all those other tasks that
got voted on, but just didn't get votes

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.682
that were as high, so we need to
accommodate those as well, right?

8
00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:31.514
So to do that,
we need a two step process, right?

9
00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:35.072
Step one is we need to
integrate more tasks,

10
00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:38.543
those tiny tasks, let's call them that.

11
00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:42.803
But step two is, we also need to
accommodate subsections, right?

12
00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:47.012
So not everything's gonna be
in our top-level navigation.

13
00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.664
So, how do we do those two things?

14
00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:52.528
Let's talk about our tiny task first.

15
00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:56.959
So we did an open card sort
with about 30 cards, right?

16
00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.268
Now, if time is tight and
that's all you could do, all power to you.

17
00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:03.352
Fair enough, great.

18
00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:04.636
Something is better than nothing.

19
00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:05.836
Let's move on.

20
00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:09.663
If you get the opportunity
to do a little bit more,

21
00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:12.318
I would now run a closed card sort.

22
00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:18.535
Now in a closed card sort, notice how the
top-level sections are predefined, right?

23
00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:23.372
So this is where I've gone in and I've
said based on the results of the open card

24
00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:27.787
sort, this is what I think the top-level
sections should be, right.

25
00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:35.253
And then, but I've added one more,
if you notice, I'm not sure, right.

26
00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:38.533
So you've got all the sections
that I created, and

27
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:42.510
then we've got one extra that I
added in called I'm not sure.

28
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.852
So now because all users have got to do
is basically take a card and drop it in

29
00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:51.070
whichever box makes sense to them,
now I can test with a lot more cards.

30
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.150
I can add all of my cards in there and
they'll go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.011
and put them in different sections and
we're good to go.

32
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:02.338
And if they're not sure where to put it
they just put it in, I'm not sure, right.

33
00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:07.007
So this is a great way of making sure
our information architecture works for

34
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.761
every task, not just our top tasks, okay?

35
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:13.963
So to create this is really,
really simple.

36
00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:20.347
In UX metrics, again basically, instead of
selecting open card sort at the beginning

37
00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:25.867
you select closed card sort instead,
so you create a new closed card sort.

38
00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.896
Then what you do is you add all
the top-level sections you made up

39
00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:36.967
based on what you did on the open card
sort from looking at the results and etc.

40
00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.697
So now we we add those
all in as new groups.

41
00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:44.656
With that additional I'm not sure option.

42
00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:49.230
And then we go through and
add all of our cards in, right, for

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.103
all of our top tasks,
the whole seven list of 70.

44
00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:54.453
It's very annoying.

45
00:02:54.453 --> 00:03:00.334
They need a bulk import, which
doesn't exist in the app, but anyway.

46
00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:04.553
And then you just publish that online and
share it with whoever and

47
00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:07.172
get them to fill in the results, right?

48
00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:07.761
Yes.

49
00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:09.466
&gt;&gt; Can you do this live?

50
00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.636
If you were doing it on Zoom or
something, can you do it with a live?

51
00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.386
&gt;&gt; You could do it live, yeah.

52
00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:18.765
You could do it that way if you wanted to
talk to people and understand what they're

53
00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:23.013
doing, cuz at the end it's just giving you
a URL and whether you send that out via

54
00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:26.836
email, let people do it whenever
they want, or you do it facilitated.

55
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:28.509
That's up to you.

56
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:33.099
I don't see a huge amount of value
if I'm honest in doing it live.

57
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.925
You get the interaction and
the conversation,

58
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:42.380
which is always good, but
it's probably a bit of a luxury, right?

59
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.941
For me, I think I would prefer
larger numbers of people

60
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:51.218
completing it than a smaller
number facilitated.

61
00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:53.021
Does that make sense?

62
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.639
&gt;&gt; Cuz we've done it with Figjam.

63
00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.375
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

64
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:56.944
&gt;&gt; It's much clunkier.

65
00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:58.652
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not great.

66
00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:02.118
I mean, you could do it with Figjam,
or what's the other one, Miro.

67
00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:07.041
Yeah, but this tool just makes it so
easy cuz you can just send it out and

68
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:08.466
they get on with it.

69
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:12.471
And again, we got to analyze the results,
which is pretty much same as before.

70
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:18.546
You go to the results page, but this
time we're gonna click on Cards, right?

71
00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:23.793
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna look at all of the cards,

72
00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:29.542
and we're gonna be paying attention
to the agreement score, okay?

73
00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:34.328
So what the agreement score is,
is it's saying how many people or

74
00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:39.376
what percentage of people agreed
that that particular task, card,

75
00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:44.178
whatever you want to call it,
should be in that section, right?

76
00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:47.027
So if it's got a very
high agreement score,

77
00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:50.955
you can be confident that that
task belongs in that section.

78
00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:55.339
However, if it's got a low
agreement score, say below 50%,

79
00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:59.178
then it means people are unsure
about where it should go.

80
00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:04.577
And maybe there's an issue with the
information architecture then, all right?

81
00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:08.929
You also obviously need to pay attention
to cards that are assigned to the not

82
00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:13.621
sure group, because those are potential
problem areas as well that people don't

83
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:15.833
know where to put them.

84
00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:20.491
But you will often find that it's not as

85
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:25.302
bad as it first looks when you look at it.

86
00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:28.216
IA is not an exact science.

87
00:05:28.216 --> 00:05:31.739
It's not gonna churn out an information
architecture at the end of it.

88
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:34.322
It's just providing you evidence
to make good decisions.

89
00:05:34.322 --> 00:05:37.622
So it will need to be a judgment call,
right.

90
00:05:37.622 --> 00:05:42.380
You'll need to decide what agreement
score level is acceptable to you and

91
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.000
how to handle uncertain items, right?

92
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.606
And that will be largely dependent
on your organization's culture and

93
00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:53.608
their attitude to risk,
your audience, your content type.

94
00:05:53.608 --> 00:05:57.907
You have to go with your gut to a degree
on this which is a bit rubbish for

95
00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.035
workshop, but
there is no other way of saying it.

96
00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:05.412
However, as a general rule of thumb,
this is what I kind of think, right?

97
00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:11.587
If something has got an agreement
score of less than 50%,

98
00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:16.520
in other words, if only 50% of people,
or less than 50% of people

99
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.150
agreed on what section it should be in,
then I pay attention to it.

100
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.771
I also pay attention to items
that are marked not sure, right?

101
00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:30.338
In most cases,
the problem can easily be solved by

102
00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:35.576
assigning it to the second
highest rated place, right?

103
00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:40.960
So let's say we had a task of dental care,
right.

104
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.387
And there was a healthcare
group which had 48%

105
00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:51.558
of people assigned it to health care,
right.

106
00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:57.154
And then the next one down
was benefits where I know 32%

107
00:06:57.154 --> 00:07:02.062
of people or
designed it to benefits, all right.

108
00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:08.683
In most cases, if people aren't
agreeing on the top-level section and

109
00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:14.759
there is a relatively close second one,
you just assign it to one,

110
00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:21.400
doesn't matter which one and
then crosslink it from the secondary one.

111
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.160
Does that make sense?

112
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.272
So that would be a link in benefits
as well as a link in in healthcare.

113
00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:29.839
That way you're covering your bases.

114
00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.343
If people don't agree,
we'll just go for the second.

115
00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:35.424
Also in the not sure category.

116
00:07:35.424 --> 00:07:38.593
There'll be a lot of things
in the not sure category, and

117
00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:42.367
you'll freak out because they go,
these things are not sure.

118
00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:47.360
But if you look at it, they'll oftentimes
the second one was pretty high in

119
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.746
the number of votes it had, right?

120
00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:54.487
Not all might be coming in at 51% but
benefits was coming in at 49,

121
00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:58.490
well, we'll just put it in benefits then,
right?

122
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.484
So oftentimes just look
at that second option and

123
00:08:01.484 --> 00:08:04.558
that'll help you kind of
work it out a little bit.

124
00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:08.505
So that's your belt and braces approach
for doing top-level navigation.

125
00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:12.486
People are gonna have trouble arguing
with you if you use all that, but

126
00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:14.015
it's quite a lot I know.

127
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:18.754
So if you want to skip steps, go for your
life, whatever you can practically do,

128
00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:22.799
because we do need to think about
about lower level sections as well,

129
00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:26.802
cuz at the moment all we've done
is create top-level navigation.

130
00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:31.498
If you've got a large number of tasks
assigned to a single top level section,

131
00:08:31.498 --> 00:08:36.792
then we're going to need to organize those
tasks into subcategories, subsections.

132
00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:39.593
So typically I try and
avoid having more than

133
00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:44.525
about seven elements in a sub section
just as a general rule of thumb, right?

134
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:50.524
So if you've got 10 or 15,
then you're probably gonna need two or

135
00:08:50.524 --> 00:08:54.396
three sub sections in that section, right?

136
00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:59.985
So there's two approaches to
the sub section problem, right?

137
00:08:59.985 --> 00:09:01.770
One, and the grown-up proper,

138
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.314
you're gonna be taught to do it the right
way approach is more card sorting, right?

139
00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:08.853
You would do card sorting for
each section.

140
00:09:08.853 --> 00:09:13.273
You can see how this is gonna quickly get
out of hand and beyond what most people

141
00:09:13.273 --> 00:09:17.219
are able to do, because you could
have six top-level sections, and

142
00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:20.300
then you'd have to do card sorting for
each of those.

143
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.173
It's never gonna happen, is it?

144
00:09:21.173 --> 00:09:23.582
Let's be honest, right?

145
00:09:23.582 --> 00:09:28.929
So, option two,
make an educated guess, right?

146
00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:33.685
And this is where I get in trouble
with all the real UX research experts

147
00:09:33.685 --> 00:09:37.386
that tell me off for
having such a cavalier attitude.

148
00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:40.314
But sometimes existing knowledge and

149
00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:44.895
research is enough to identify
appropriate subsections.

150
00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:49.193
And anyway, we can use the tree testing,
which I'm coming on to in a minute,

151
00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:50.997
to double-check everything.

152
00:09:50.997 --> 00:09:52.669
Guess what I'm gonna say now?

153
00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:56.660
We can use ChatGPT to help us do that,
right?

154
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.747
So, ChatGPT is really good at organizing
conceptually similar concepts and

155
00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:03.477
ideas together, right?

156
00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:06.053
So we can say,
act as an information architecture.

157
00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:10.653
You've been asked to organize the content
I will give you into subsections within,

158
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:14.827
in this case, the university's HR
website's benefits section, right?

159
00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:19.579
Avoid having more than seven subsections,
cuz we don't want hundreds of subsections.

160
00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:22.534
Keep the label of each section to one or
two words.

161
00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:26.421
Avoid ambiguity,
cuz I said that earlier, in labeling, or

162
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.642
two labels becoming too similar.

163
00:10:28.642 --> 00:10:32.893
Assign content into subsections,
but based on conceptual similarity,

164
00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:37.362
the goal is to ensure users can easily
find the content within the hierarchy.

165
00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:39.442
Are you ready for the content,

166
00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:43.928
that list of section that we've
got within that benefit section?

167
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.044
Or do you have any questions?

168
00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:50.864
If it says it's ready,
you copy a listing of stuff that was in

169
00:10:50.864 --> 00:10:55.126
the benefits section and
it'll organize it for you.

170
00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:58.139
It's not the grown up way of doing it,
right?

171
00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:00.958
But it works most of the time.

172
00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.352
It gives you reasonably good results and
it saves time.
