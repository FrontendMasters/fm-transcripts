00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.945
So that's basically it for testing
an existing site is either AB testing or

2
00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:08.638
prototyping again, basically,
post launch testing and

3
00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:12.900
iteration are probably the most
valuable thing you can do.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.240
In everything I've talked about today that
kind of ongoing makes such a difference.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.755
Having that kind of backlog of friction
points that you add to regularly is

6
00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:23.632
really good.

7
00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:26.625
So rather than just having
them sit in analytics,

8
00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:31.072
you might actually wanna create some
kind of backlog with them all in.

9
00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.932
For more minor fixes,
just use a bit of A-B testing.

10
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:36.986
For larger fixes, consider prototyping and

11
00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.156
testing first before you
commit to something.

12
00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:44.322
Very last thing I wanna say,
cuz I haven't said it for a while,

13
00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:48.797
is I've shared a lot of stuff with you,
but just do what you can.

14
00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:50.607
Something's better than nothing.

15
00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:55.246
And if all you do out of every
in this entire workshop is run

16
00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:59.994
a semantic differential survey or
run a first click test.

17
00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:00.784
And that's all you do.

18
00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:02.004
Then that's great.

19
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:03.494
That's a step forward.

20
00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:08.704
And it's beginning to introduce
those kinds of things.

21
00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:13.533
Personally, I find this kind
of lightweight usability

22
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.904
testing really valuable.

23
00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:21.802
And it saves me time ultimately and it
saves me so much hustle with clients and

24
00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:26.134
stakeholders that I do most
of it out of my own pocket.

25
00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:28.453
I mean, it's got better over the years and

26
00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:33.084
now I've got better at persuading people
to actually part with money for it.

27
00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:37.024
But for a long time I would just do
it because it made my life easier.

28
00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.918
And hopefully it makes
your life easier too.

29
00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:44.179
So what we've covered just to
summarise what we've covered today we

30
00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.298
looked at a set of principles that
kind of underpin lean, lean UX.

31
00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:53.305
We've looked at doing upfront user
research and how it can be used to create

32
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:59.164
an information architecture, how we can do
some basic design testing around design.

33
00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:00.173
Comps and in many ways,

34
00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:03.774
I think that's the most valuable
part of everything we've covered.

35
00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:07.777
We talked about opportunities to do
usability testing with prototyping, and

36
00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:12.624
then the real powerhouse that's testing
existing services over the long term.

37
00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:17.672
But as I say on here, and
I 100% mean it, I really enjoy sharing

38
00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:22.542
this kind of stuff with people
because I know how painful it can be

39
00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:27.935
to make testing happen and
how painful the design process can be.

40
00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:32.827
And so if there's anything I can do to
help, by all means, email me anytime my

41
00:02:32.827 --> 00:02:37.725
email addresses in the slides pull up
by google.com and I'll happily answer

42
00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:42.461
questions in six months or a year's time,
it makes no difference to me.

43
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.001
But are there any closing
questions before we wrap up today?

44
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:49.091
Yes?

45
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:54.283
&gt;&gt; So early on in the principle section,
you mentioned how to translate

46
00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:59.448
the initial effort into actual
monetary value for the business.

47
00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:00.108
&gt;&gt; Yes.

48
00:03:00.108 --> 00:03:02.048
&gt;&gt; Time or actual money saved.

49
00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.718
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; How do you go about doing that?

50
00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:04.668
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

51
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.398
It's a lot of guesswork, right?

52
00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.498
But it is possible more
often than you think.

53
00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:15.916
So let's say, I know,
I'll give you a real,

54
00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:19.371
it's not a real example because
I was making it all up.

55
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:24.591
I was in Pizza Express one day, which
is like a chain restaurant in the UK.

56
00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:29.542
And the waitress came over to me and
she'd taken our order and

57
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:35.701
it was taking her forever,
put into an iPad, put this order in.

58
00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:39.634
And my wife could see,
she couldn't now mind read me.

59
00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:43.584
We'd been married so
long and she went, no.

60
00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:48.194
And I was mentally counting how long
it was taking her to place the order.

61
00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.794
And when she went away, I said, right.

62
00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:55.664
Let's say she knew, I knew she knew,
and it was one of those weird ones.

63
00:03:55.664 --> 00:04:02.081
But I said, what if we could shave 10
seconds off of it for every order, right?

64
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.121
And then I started making guesses, right?

65
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:07.241
And it's all guesses, I said, right?

66
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:12.181
Let's say the average number of
people at a table is four, right?

67
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:21.115
And let's say they do X number of
servings per day in this restaurant.

68
00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:25.705
Then I looked up on
Wikipedia [INAUDIBLE] life.

69
00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:28.525
I looked up how many
restaurants they have, right?

70
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:30.715
How many days they're open a year.

71
00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:36.905
And so I could calculate how many seconds
that added up to over a calendar year.

72
00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:42.080
Then I worked on the basis of
how much a person earned, yeah,

73
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.372
I put minimum wage for a serving staff,
and then I could calculate how much

74
00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:54.283
I could save the company by taking
off 10 seconds off of each order.

75
00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:59.730
So all of that was ghetto except for
how many restaurants there were,

76
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.441
in which I looked up,
all the rest of it was guesswork, right?

77
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:05.371
But that was fine.

78
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:10.098
And if they turned into a client,
they would have corrected me, and

79
00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:11.938
I would have adjusted those numbers, and

80
00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:14.951
we would have seen whether
the project was still worth it.

81
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.261
But doing that kind of thing
is incredibly valuable,

82
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:22.529
because it Attaches a monetary
value to what you're doing.

83
00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.169
And everything we do will have
some kind of benefit like that.

84
00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.049
That was a cost saving benefit.

85
00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:33.489
Sometimes it might be
a customer retention benefit.

86
00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:37.059
So for example,
let's take Frontend Masters, right?

87
00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.820
So they've got customer acquisition
that they've got to meet.

88
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.850
And so stuff on their frontend website
would be if you made improvements on

89
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.620
the front end website,
that would help customer acquisition.

90
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.632
So we could say, well, if we could
increase the conversion rate of

91
00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:55.571
people visiting the website
by 1% over a year,

92
00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.250
we could calculate how much that would
be worth to the organization, right?

93
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.152
It would be guesses, but
better than nothing, or

94
00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:07.520
we could focus on the back-end app where
people log in and use the courses.

95
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.740
Now we're talking about
customer retention.

96
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.602
So we could calculate, well,
if we could keep people for

97
00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:18.679
a year longer than we were previously,
how much would that equate to into?

98
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.109
In terms of extra profit.

99
00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:27.029
So it's making shit up but but
it's educated making stuff up.

100
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.663
And you're not claiming
these figures are real but

101
00:06:30.663 --> 00:06:35.929
it's starting a conversation about
what the real figures might be.

102
00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:39.507
And it's starting to put tangible
value on what it Is that we're doing.

103
00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:41.417
Does that make sense?

104
00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:43.917
Yeah, go for it.

105
00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:46.805
&gt;&gt; I sometimes see websites and

106
00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:52.647
apps that have a regular
feature to provide feedback.

107
00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:53.587
&gt;&gt; Yes.

108
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:57.157
&gt;&gt; What's your experience
of the value of that?

109
00:06:58.187 --> 00:07:01.193
&gt;&gt; Sure, so there are two types.

110
00:07:01.193 --> 00:07:06.163
One of my favorites,
I run a lot of one-off surveys.

111
00:07:06.163 --> 00:07:08.113
That's different to what
you're talking about.

112
00:07:08.113 --> 00:07:10.043
But I do find those very valuable.

113
00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:13.760
So one of my favorites to run is a one
question survey, cuz like I said,

114
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.933
I do a lot of conversion
rate optimization work.

115
00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:22.589
So I put one question It only
triggers as a popup on exit intent.

116
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.278
So as people are about to
leave the website, and

117
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:30.059
it says if you decided not to act today,
it would be great to know why, right?

118
00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:34.699
And here's a load of different options
that one question can be transformative.

119
00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.979
So there's that kind of thing.

120
00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.089
What you're talking about his
were at the bottom of the pages.

121
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:40.320
So did you dind this page helpful, right?

122
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.020
That kind of thing.

123
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.960
Is that what you're getting at?

124
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.940
&gt;&gt; Or even there might just be something
like there'll be a smiley face or

125
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.768
a frowny face and just you're.

126
00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.103
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that kind of, yeah.

127
00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:50.340
&gt;&gt; It's really open-ended.

128
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah
&gt;&gt; It's not soliciting [INAUDIBLE].

129
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:57.059
&gt;&gt; So those kinds of things,
they actually have their worth,

130
00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:02.684
but, probably not so much from
a user interface point of view but

131
00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:05.724
more from a content point of view.

132
00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:10.959
I use them a lot when I'm working
to improve the content on a website

133
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:16.383
because one of the big problems that
happens in a lot of organizations

134
00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:21.515
is that content production is
spread across the organization.

135
00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:24.099
So different departments,
different people,

136
00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:27.825
they own different pages on the website
and they've got to update it.

137
00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:30.825
And it's just an extra part of their
job and they don't care about it.

138
00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:36.205
And so the content is rubbish and
there's no feedback on it or whatever.

139
00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:42.104
But I often create dashboards that
will return the results of those,

140
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:45.256
was this page useful, smiley face,

141
00:08:45.256 --> 00:08:49.833
happy face kind of thing to
the owners of those pages so

142
00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:56.504
that they can see how their page
is performing versus other people.

143
00:08:56.504 --> 00:09:01.241
Now, suddenly they start caring when
their pages are scoring really bad, but

144
00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:05.621
their colleague in the next
department is scoring really well.

145
00:09:05.621 --> 00:09:09.121
They don't like that, and
that makes them improve their content.

146
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.613
So it can be a good internal motivator for

147
00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:15.161
stakeholders to actually
maintain their content.

148
00:09:15.161 --> 00:09:17.541
That's where I find it most useful.

149
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:22.267
So yeah, it has its place but maybe less
so from a usability point of view cuz

150
00:09:22.267 --> 00:09:25.359
it doesn't give us a lot
of information to go on.

151
00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:31.807
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have to say we we actually
implemented virtual assistant

152
00:09:31.807 --> 00:09:33.449
in the mobile application.

153
00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:37.619
And there were two types of
servers that we introduced.

154
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.722
If you close the survey, I'm sorry,
if you close virtual assistant,

155
00:09:40.722 --> 00:09:44.047
you'll be prompted for a survey to say,
how do you like virtual assistant?

156
00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:48.164
So it's feature specific in the mobile
application versus the whole mobile

157
00:09:48.164 --> 00:09:49.277
application.

158
00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:51.529
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then we had another survey where if

159
00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:56.101
you didn't wanna talk to virtual assistant
or a bot, you wanna talk to a real person,

160
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:57.007
you can do that.

161
00:09:57.007 --> 00:10:00.259
You say, I wanna talk to a live agent,
which is really a banker.

162
00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:02.189
And then the banker
answers your questions.

163
00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:06.957
And by the time you're done with that
session, inside live agent, you'll be

164
00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:11.669
prompted with a survey that says how I
was working with a banker in live agent.

165
00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:17.459
So there's multiple categories of surveys
that we use to collect whether or

166
00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:19.546
not Is this working for us?

167
00:10:19.546 --> 00:10:24.766
If it's not, what can we do to iterate and
make it better?

168
00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:27.946
But we initially planned for that upfront.

169
00:10:27.946 --> 00:10:31.643
&gt;&gt; I think surveys can be incredibly
valuable if it goes back to what I was

170
00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:35.816
saying earlier, you need to actually
do something with the data.

171
00:10:35.816 --> 00:10:40.112
You see so many people take surveys and
everyone sits around afterwards to go,

172
00:10:40.112 --> 00:10:41.751
ooh, that's interesting.

173
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:43.971
And then it gets put in a drawer and
forgotten.

174
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:45.741
And all it's done is annoy users,
[LAUGH] right?

175
00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:49.161
Cuz that's the danger,
you've got a balance the whole time.

176
00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:53.850
But in those kinds of examples,
in especially the second example where

177
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.878
you've dealt with a person, that is
feedback is valuable to that person.

178
00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:01.458
It helps them with what they're doing.

179
00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:03.438
And so in those kinds of cases,
it's really good.

180
00:11:03.438 --> 00:11:07.338
But you got to be careful with surveys
that they're not getting the users aren't

181
00:11:07.338 --> 00:11:09.928
being bombarded with them again and
again and again.

182
00:11:09.928 --> 00:11:13.148
Every time they go on the app,
the survey's there again.

183
00:11:13.148 --> 00:11:14.245
That kind of thing,

184
00:11:14.245 --> 00:11:17.868
you've got to be careful that
they're only seeing it once, etc.

185
00:11:19.268 --> 00:11:20.088
So yeah.

186
00:11:20.088 --> 00:11:24.256
&gt;&gt; There was a new feature that was
made available on the New York Times

187
00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:29.093
app website, or New York Times app that
I use, and it would read the article in

188
00:11:29.093 --> 00:11:32.148
a higher quality voice than the built-in
&gt;&gt; Yeah

189
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:33.908
&gt;&gt; IOS text-to-speech,

190
00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.778
and I had some feedback for them.

191
00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.980
And I was able kind of tap
something to say what is this?

192
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.740
And it took me a few taps to get there.

193
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.452
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I had to type in your message and

194
00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:49.433
I did get a good response but I am curious
like how many people go through that

195
00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:54.620
trouble and and is it I can tell by their
response that they were interested?

196
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.003
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So it must have been some valuable but

197
00:11:57.003 --> 00:12:00.568
I'm curious how valuable is It's like,
how common that is.

198
00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:02.578
&gt;&gt; It's more common than you think.

199
00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:07.561
The only thing you've gotta be a little
bit of aware of with things like

200
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:12.463
that is that generally speaking
the people that respond to surveys,

201
00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:17.158
either absolutely despise the thing or
absolutely love it.

202
00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:20.147
If you're ambivalent about something,
you don't bother filling in a form, right?

203
00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:24.317
It's only if you really love it or
really hate it.

204
00:12:24.317 --> 00:12:29.927
But presuming you understand that
basic bias, it's worthwhile data.

205
00:12:29.927 --> 00:12:32.127
You get a good number of responses.

206
00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.647
In fact, I've got a problem at the moment.

207
00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:39.820
I'm working with a charity where
we're optimizing engagement

208
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.951
funnel where we're sending emails out
to people that agreed to fundraise,

209
00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:50.435
and we've encouraged them to respond,
right?

210
00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:52.515
And actually they've overwhelmed us.

211
00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:58.462
I completely caught me off guard because
we wanna respond to them and we can't keep

212
00:12:58.462 --> 00:13:04.439
up and we were trying to get people in to
respond to all of these these messages.

213
00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:06.434
So sometimes you get the opposite problem.

214
00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:09.279
[LAUGH] That's quite unusual minor.

215
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.379
I've had that for a while.

216
00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:13.169
I should call it day.

217
00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:16.339
Thank you, everybody for for joining.

218
00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:19.357
It's been really nice to
have actual people in here.

219
00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:22.173
Last time I did this we were
kind of the end of COVID and

220
00:13:22.173 --> 00:13:24.437
then it was a bit kind
of me on my own some.

221
00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:27.184
Thank you for those people
that joined online as well and

222
00:13:27.184 --> 00:13:30.291
that have watched the course so
hopefully it's been helpful.

223
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:30.791
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
