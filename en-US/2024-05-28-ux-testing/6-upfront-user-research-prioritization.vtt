1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.309
Then let's talk about doing some
upfront research, shall we?

2
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.989
So yeah, like I've already said, upfront
research is something that a lot of

3
00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:16.339
people do, they do some kind of discovery
phase at the front of a project.

4
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.031
And that's absolutely great and that's
wonderful if you've got the resources and

5
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.279
the time to do that, but
it's not the only way of doing it.

6
00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.622
So what I wanna share with you is
some of the things you wanna know,

7
00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:33.798
how much you can strip it
back to its bare bones, and

8
00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:38.294
how we can get again the most bang for
our buck out of it.

9
00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:41.381
So how to approach upfront research,
right?

10
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:46.142
So considering the constraints
that we're presuming we're working

11
00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:51.061
under around time and budget,
it's important to have a clear plan of how

12
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.786
to address any initial
research you wanna do, right?

13
00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:59.045
And it is a reasonable question to say,
well,

14
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:06.157
why can't I just skip upfront research
entirely and just get going, right?

15
00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:10.928
That'd be super lean, and
I said earlier that you don't even

16
00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:15.078
know what the questions you
wanna ask when you start.

17
00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:19.347
So there is an argument to be made or
maybe you could skip it and

18
00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:22.629
just get going and
then do bits as you go along.

19
00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:28.490
I actually, I can understand that and
I've kind of tried that a few times,

20
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.599
but I've missed doing at
least something upfront.

21
00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.425
And I think there's kind
of a few reasons for that,

22
00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:39.566
first of all is without user research,
there can be a lot of assumptions and

23
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.086
misunderstandings that cause chaos later.

24
00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:46.122
Especially if you've got a group
of people working on something,

25
00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:48.571
it's a bit different if it's just you,

26
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:53.197
cuz you're all agreeing on the same thing,
you are the decision maker etc.

27
00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:56.089
You know what you don't know and
all of the rest of it, but

28
00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:59.060
once you start working in
the team it can cause confusion.

29
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.090
If you don't have some kind
of agreed understanding

30
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.193
in terms of any assumptions or
constraints that you're working within.

31
00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.783
The second is it can
lead to disagreements,

32
00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:20.610
different stakeholders can envisage
a very different thing, right?

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.868
Even something which you
think we'd all agree on,

34
00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:29.335
we're gonna have a carousel
on the homepage, okay?

35
00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:33.967
All of us will have a slightly different
view of what that carousel will be,

36
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:37.935
how it will work, what it will do,
how it will behave on mobile,

37
00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:39.794
all of those kinds of things.

38
00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:43.294
So it's very easy for our understanding
to diverse one another, but

39
00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:46.851
when you hear the phrase we're gonna
have a carousel on the home page,

40
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.290
you think everybody would agree on it,
right?

41
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.941
And they won't cause issues, so
it's quite important I think to do

42
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.034
atleast some kind of upfront research and
understanding.

43
00:02:58.034 --> 00:03:02.025
So that there is an agreed
understanding where to go and

44
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:06.191
maybe Carousel that's probably
not a good example, but

45
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.297
certainly around who you're
trying to reach, right?

46
00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:16.842
Agreeing on audiences is agreeing on what
those audiences what a need is a big one.

47
00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:21.619
And then the final one is often going
into it without any context can

48
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.470
cause some real problems
leading to poor solutions.

49
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.234
So in particular, oftentimes an app or

50
00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:34.715
a website whatever is part
of a broader journey, right?

51
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:39.266
The user has done something before they've
arrived on the website or use the app and

52
00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.227
they'll do something after to it.

53
00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:46.182
And knowing that context and what's going
on around the project is quite important

54
00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:50.015
in order to ensure that the solution
you deliver is worthwhile.

55
00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:54.798
So all of that is to say it's worth
doing a bit of user research upfront,

56
00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:57.110
it doesn't need to be massive, so

57
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.517
what's the minimum we think we
could get away with here, right?

58
00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:05.805
If we really strip it back,
what do we need to know before we start?

59
00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:08.388
Well, the first thing is
who's your audience, right?

60
00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:11.669
Having a clear picture of
who you're designing for

61
00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.882
what you're creating for
is crucial to success.

62
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:18.048
And not just for
you to have a clear picture but

63
00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:22.475
all of the stakeholders in the project,
absolutely crucial.

64
00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:25.835
Second thing we really need
to know is what do they need,

65
00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:27.701
what does this audience need?

66
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.414
What are they trying to achieve and

67
00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.902
how are they gonna go about achieving it,
right?

68
00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:37.385
Then the other thing we need to know
is what's the overall experience

69
00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:42.406
at least to some extent,
what brought somebody to this point.

70
00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:47.330
And what will help them progress to
the next step in their journey, and

71
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.430
that one's often an overlooked
one to be honest with you.

72
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.105
We focus so blinkered in on
the project that we're working on that

73
00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:59.426
we tend to forget what comes before and
after.

74
00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.792
And then the other thing
that I'm always looking for

75
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:03.738
is where are they encountering friction?

76
00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:09.415
So they're gonna be achieving this thing,
whatever they want to achieve in some way,

77
00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:14.649
either with the existing version of
the website or through another mechanism.

78
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.628
So where are the pain points,
where are things going wrong?

79
00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:22.097
We kinda need to understand that if we're
gonna try and fix it for them, right?

80
00:05:22.097 --> 00:05:26.122
But we can do all of that by
keeping it really lightweight,

81
00:05:26.122 --> 00:05:29.836
that doesn't need to involve
weeks of work, right?

82
00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:31.009
And I always try and

83
00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.567
make my discovery phases proportional
to the project as a whole, right?

84
00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:40.678
So if you're creating
a single landing page and

85
00:05:40.678 --> 00:05:43.883
you've got a no a day to do it.

86
00:05:43.883 --> 00:05:47.804
My discovery [LAUGH] phase might be
an hour at the beginning of the day or

87
00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:49.569
probably even less than that.

88
00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.235
If I'm doing a multimillion pound project,
then I'll probably put a bit of effort

89
00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:58.516
into the discovery phase upfront and
make sure I'm well prepared going in.

90
00:05:58.516 --> 00:06:03.010
So I normally look at about 10% of
the overall of all project value,

91
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.446
normally if I can get away with it, but

92
00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:10.267
if I can only get away with less then
I'll do less, it's as simple as that.

93
00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:13.027
You can achieve a huge amount
just by consolidating what

94
00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:16.268
other existing research and
information is available, right?

95
00:06:16.268 --> 00:06:21.020
Like I was saying earlier, there's
often documentation knocking around,

96
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.602
there's often existing user
research knocking around,

97
00:06:24.602 --> 00:06:27.171
grabbing all of that and hoovering it up.

98
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:32.215
I do a lot of these days cuz I'm lazy,
of uploading PowerPoint

99
00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:37.162
presentations and PDFs and
stuff to something like Claude,

100
00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:40.950
which is really good at
analyzing documents.

101
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.562
And ask it to summarize them for me and
I ask it questions about based on that,

102
00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:51.141
so I don't have to pour through
a 300 slide deck [LAUGH] etc.

103
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:53.858
So I cheat quite majorly, but

104
00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:59.944
it means that I can consolidate
a lot of information very quickly,

105
00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:04.850
sometimes just a single
workshop is enough, right?

106
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.883
So, if you work on smaller
projects that's absolutely fine,

107
00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:13.219
then just do a kick-off workshop and
ask some of these questions and

108
00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.357
dive into some of these
issues in that workshop.

109
00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:21.175
Try and make sure there's people that have
got answers to those fundamental questions

110
00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:23.554
we were talking about in the last section.

111
00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:28.359
And that's often you can supplement any
information you've got when you were

112
00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:33.552
looking at existing research and you can
get the additional answers you need there.

113
00:07:33.552 --> 00:07:38.554
So for example, sometimes I'll
run a workshop where we'll create

114
00:07:38.554 --> 00:07:43.116
a customer journey map or
your personas or things like that and

115
00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:47.260
again, I'll cover those
things in more detail later.

116
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.178
And then sometimes if there's nothing
that stands out that I need to know at

117
00:07:52.178 --> 00:07:53.271
the beginning,

118
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:58.439
there's nothing stopping me doing more
research later as questions emerge.

119
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:03.365
Again, don't feel you have to do
this stuff just because that's what

120
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:06.631
some article you read
somewhere tells you to.

121
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:10.017
And that applies to what I'm
telling you as well by the way,

122
00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:14.759
just pick and choose what is relevant for
you out of all this, cuz every situation,

123
00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:16.558
every project's different.

124
00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:21.343
So, I mean, one of the big things
is identifying your audience,

125
00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:25.867
and so this is one that I do really
spend a little bit of time on,

126
00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:28.744
getting very clear in my head upfront.

127
00:08:28.744 --> 00:08:34.339
And the reason is you can't really serve
everybody equally and this is the big

128
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:40.294
mistake, if you try to appeal to everybody
you end up appealing to nobody, okay?

129
00:08:40.294 --> 00:08:44.674
And here's a great example of this
that I was working on recently, I was

130
00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:49.274
working with the University of Florida
in this case with the HR team there.

131
00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:54.083
And they have a website, and they were
trying to present information about

132
00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.694
health plans and all this kind of stuff.

133
00:08:56.694 --> 00:08:58.878
We don't have things
like that in the UK but

134
00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.985
apparently it's important over
here to have a health plan.

135
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:05.297
So they were trying to present
all of this information and

136
00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:08.824
they were trying to present it
to everybody at the same time.

137
00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:12.813
So you had all these different audiences
with different needs all accessing

138
00:09:12.813 --> 00:09:13.632
the same page.

139
00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:18.391
So there were existing employees that
were probably primarily interested in

140
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.226
updating their health plan.

141
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.086
There were new employees that just wanted
to know what they were gonna get and

142
00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:26.031
in particular how to register for it.

143
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:30.663
There were HR managers that were
trying to help other people with

144
00:09:30.663 --> 00:09:32.906
their employee health plans.

145
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:37.514
And then there were people joining
the company that wanted to know what their

146
00:09:37.514 --> 00:09:39.967
health plan was gonna be if they joined.

147
00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:44.239
All on one page and there was so
many different audiences all fighting for

148
00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:45.015
attention.

149
00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:48.969
So really having a clear picture
of who your audiences are, and

150
00:09:48.969 --> 00:09:53.894
most importantly how to prioritize those
audiences is something that I try and

151
00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:56.446
flush out at the beginning of a project.

152
00:09:56.446 --> 00:10:02.607
Because prioritization in
particular can be really tricky,

153
00:10:02.607 --> 00:10:07.114
everybody will disagree over this, right?

154
00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:11.228
And so people just avoid coming
to these conclusions, right?

155
00:10:11.228 --> 00:10:13.531
And then you don't know who
you're working with, well,

156
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:14.808
we have to appeal to everybody.

157
00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:21.170
Yeah all right, fine, but of all those
people who do we appeal to most, right?

158
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.777
I believe in designing for
somebody alienating nobody,

159
00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:27.189
that's the phrase that I use, okay?

160
00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.926
So how do we go about
prioritizing our audiences and

161
00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:33.681
I do spend a little bit of time projects
doing this because I know it will

162
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.923
come back to bite me horribly if I don't.

163
00:10:35.923 --> 00:10:38.744
Well, I kind of use different
characteristics, first of all,

164
00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:39.956
I use business alignment.

165
00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:44.736
So prioritize groups directly
contributing to key metrics within

166
00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:49.514
the organization, so the first
question I will ask is what's your

167
00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:53.113
primary metric that you're
trying to move here?

168
00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:56.752
Is it revenue market share,
whatever, and I say, okay,

169
00:10:56.752 --> 00:10:59.740
which of your audience's
most help with that?

170
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.241
So don't ask people to prioritize, right?

171
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:07.992
No outright, I instead ask very specific
questions that are yes no answers,

172
00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:11.574
because if you ask people to
put things in priority order,

173
00:11:11.574 --> 00:11:13.935
then politics get involved, right?

174
00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:20.339
But if you just ask direct questions with
factual answers, you kind of avoid that,

175
00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:25.383
so that's the first one I do,
second one is user impact, right?

176
00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:30.078
And I look at groups whose needs if met,
would significantly

177
00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:35.153
enhance the overall user satisfaction and
engagement, right?

178
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:40.266
So I say okay,
which groups have got needs they're not

179
00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:45.377
being met currently, and
if we fix the problem would be

180
00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:50.506
really beneficial in terms
of overall satisfaction?

181
00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:54.337
So these tend to be the most vocal groups,
the largest groups,

182
00:11:54.337 --> 00:11:57.029
the groups are the biggest issues, right?

183
00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:03.038
And so I get people to brainstorm
those kinds of lists out of people.

184
00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:05.921
Then I talk about needs
prioritising user groups for

185
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:09.992
the most acute pain points some of
them having the biggest difficulties.

186
00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:14.623
Especially if these difficulties
are acting as a barrier for

187
00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:20.274
whatever the project's goal is so
I get them to list a few of those as well.

188
00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:25.220
Also look at things like growth potential,
so I say which is there a market or

189
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.251
a group of users that
you're looking to grow?

190
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:31.541
You want more business from those people,
right?

191
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:34.722
And then I ask about
regulatory requirements,

192
00:12:34.722 --> 00:12:38.936
is there a particular group that
you need to meet the needs of for

193
00:12:38.936 --> 00:12:43.727
example, people with with disabilities or
veterans or whoever else.

194
00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:47.156
And then finally,
I consider feasibility, right?

195
00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:51.564
The practical aspects of reaching and
engaging with each audience group.

196
00:12:51.564 --> 00:12:56.450
So I kind of discuss all of these
things with the client, and

197
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.848
with the stakeholders and
then I go away and prioritize, right?

198
00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:06.483
And I tend not to tell anybody that
I've prioritized in that way, because

199
00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:11.590
the minute I present back a prioritized
list everybody starts arguing about it.

200
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.906
And that's the project stalled for

201
00:13:13.906 --> 00:13:16.923
two weeks [LAUGH] while
they debate about this.

202
00:13:16.923 --> 00:13:20.994
But I then work on the presumption
that this is the order

203
00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:24.547
we're looking on based
on the the data we have.

204
00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:28.866
It's a bit of a kind of touchy-feely
process, there's not hard and

205
00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:30.140
fast rules with it.

206
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.013
But having it clear at least in your mind
who the priority audiences are will make

207
00:13:35.013 --> 00:13:37.569
your life lots easier, yeah, go for it.

208
00:13:37.569 --> 00:13:41.186
&gt;&gt; Can you apply this to
the previous example?

209
00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:43.092
&gt;&gt; The previous example being.

210
00:13:43.092 --> 00:13:45.689
&gt;&gt; The project you were working
on at the University of Florida?

211
00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:50.766
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that was a good one,
so can I apply it?

212
00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:56.376
Probably not very well,
to be honest with you, what came out

213
00:13:56.376 --> 00:14:03.200
of that is that there really wasn't
a strong priority in that situation.

214
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.158
So employee retention was very important,
so in other words,

215
00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:11.152
keeping existing employees happy and

216
00:14:11.152 --> 00:14:16.593
by extension them having good
managerial support was a part of that.

217
00:14:16.593 --> 00:14:21.893
So that's the important audience bringing
on new staff members it was very important

218
00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:26.765
as well because they were under-resourced
quite heavily as an institution.

219
00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:32.014
So all the audiences in that case,
it was very hard to prioritize,

220
00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:36.634
so what we did is we ended up
creating four separate sites.

221
00:14:36.634 --> 00:14:41.065
So we actually segmented the audience and
go, we can't serve all of these

222
00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:45.222
audiences on a single page,
they've all got very different needs.

223
00:14:45.222 --> 00:14:49.369
So actually we need four health
plan pages for example, one for

224
00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:54.545
each of the audiences, and that's how
we had to resolve it in that situation.

225
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:59.404
So unfortunately that example
doesn't prove everything I've just

226
00:14:59.404 --> 00:15:00.834
talked about here.

227
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:05.826
But actually it's quite nice that you
asked the question because it kind of

228
00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:08.997
shows sometimes you have
to improvise [LAUGH] and

229
00:15:08.997 --> 00:15:11.942
sometimes you have to
find a different way.

230
00:15:11.942 --> 00:15:15.932
Other times it does kind of shake
itself out, so I do a lot of work with

231
00:15:15.932 --> 00:15:20.625
the universities and student recruitment
is always a huge challenge things for

232
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:22.041
a lot of universities.

233
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:27.332
But then certain types of students
are a lot more valuable than others,

234
00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:32.901
so they tend to prefer postgraduate
students to undergraduate students.

235
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:38.612
They tend to prefer international students
because they get paid more intuition,

236
00:15:38.612 --> 00:15:39.191
right?

237
00:15:39.191 --> 00:15:43.365
And so you can tease all of this out
through conversations with them and

238
00:15:43.365 --> 00:15:47.043
ended up with a pretty good idea
of what the priority order is,

239
00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:50.466
even if they can't come out and
say it in black and white.

240
00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.652
&gt;&gt; So there would be business
alignment you're talking about.

241
00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:56.674
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that that would be
heavily business alignment in

242
00:15:56.674 --> 00:15:57.913
that particular case.

243
00:15:57.913 --> 00:16:02.563
But also to be honest with
international students,

244
00:16:02.563 --> 00:16:08.595
it's also user impact, user need,
and growth potential as well.

245
00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:11.422
Because there's normally
a big growth potential for

246
00:16:11.422 --> 00:16:15.834
getting more international students,
they have a big impact on the institution.

247
00:16:15.834 --> 00:16:20.894
And also they have profound
needs because they've got

248
00:16:20.894 --> 00:16:26.624
to learn all this stuff about
being in another country, etc.

249
00:16:26.624 --> 00:16:32.457
So really, they come out very
highly from using these criteria.
