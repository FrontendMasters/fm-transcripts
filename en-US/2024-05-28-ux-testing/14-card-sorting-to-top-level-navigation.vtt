1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.260
So I said we're gonna look at three
things called top task, card sorting, and

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.020
tree testing.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.790
So we're at the card sorting bit now.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.630
Anybody's done card sorting before,
in the room?

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.770
Yep, okay, right, card sorting's great.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.112
Card sorting is a way of allowing users

7
00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:24.154
to organize information in
a way that makes sense to them.

8
00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:25.540
So the way that I think and

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.445
organize the world will be different
to the way you think or you think.

10
00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:33.014
We all have different ways
of organizing things, right?

11
00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:36.892
And so a lot of people assume
that the job of information

12
00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:41.225
architecture is organizing
things logically, right?

13
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.165
That's easy, I can sit down and
organize a thing logically.

14
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:49.535
But what's logical to you is
not logical to somebody else.

15
00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:53.904
So it's really important that when
we organize something logically,

16
00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:58.045
it's based on the logic of the user,
not what makes sense to us.

17
00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:04.095
Now, this is particularly problematic
as we become more specialized.

18
00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:11.124
The more specialized you are, right,
the more you deviate from normal behavior.

19
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:15.226
So, for example, if you work
with a company for a long time,

20
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:19.658
you become specialized in the way
that company thinks and works.

21
00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:24.313
So the way you are organizing
information will bear no resemblance to

22
00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:29.060
how those outside of the company
will organize information, right?

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.791
Which is why companies cannot
be allowed to create their

24
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:37.224
own information architectures [LAUGH].

25
00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:41.951
So with card sorting,
we let the user organize things.

26
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:44.361
Now, there are two types of card sorting.

27
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:48.213
There's open card sorting,
where, basically,

28
00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:53.961
people can organize content in
any way that makes sense to them.

29
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:58.260
And then there's closed card sorting,
where you, basically,

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.841
allow people to organize content
within certain constraints, right?

31
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.924
You can use either or both, okay?

32
00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:11.065
But I'm gonna take you through the process
that I use if I've got lots of time and

33
00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:12.080
lots of money.

34
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.021
And then we'll pick out the bits that we
can do if we've got less time and money.

35
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.077
So the tool I use for
this is a tool called UXMetrics, right?

36
00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:25.917
It's got free tier,
you can give it a go, it's really cheap.

37
00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:30.064
There are other alternatives available,
but to be honest, they're not as good,

38
00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.367
they're more expensive and harder to use.

39
00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:35.187
So that's my recommendation.

40
00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:41.057
So, essentially, what I'm gonna do is I'll
show you a card sort and how it works.

41
00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:44.242
So this is an open card sort,
you can see all the cards,

42
00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:47.027
all of those tasks along the bottom.

43
00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:50.135
And then the user can go along and
pick a task and

44
00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:53.584
drag it into groups that
make sense to that person.

45
00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:57.377
And then they can label the task
whatever they want, right?

46
00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.167
Simple as that, okay?

47
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:05.626
And they can keep going and
create as many groups as they want to and

48
00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:09.275
organize the tasks into any amount.

49
00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:13.507
Now, with an open card sort,
you're asking people to

50
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:18.275
do a lot of thinking there in
terms of organizing stuff.

51
00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:25.153
So we're not gonna ask people to organize
all 70 plus tasks that we've identified.

52
00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:29.730
Instead, we're gonna only ask
them to organize the top tasks,

53
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.183
the top thirdish of our list.

54
00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:36.192
No more than about 30 tasks,
otherwise, they'll get bored and

55
00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:38.603
abandon on you, right?

56
00:03:38.603 --> 00:03:43.571
So, essentially, we're gonna ask
them to organize those tasks

57
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.367
into any groups that make sense to them.

58
00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.083
Now, once that has been done, and again,

59
00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:54.771
we can use a service like Askable if
we don't have access to our own users.

60
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:59.306
We can get friends and
family doing this, if we want.

61
00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.117
Although, ideally,

62
00:04:01.117 --> 00:04:07.080
I would prefer to have the actual
target audience doing this, right?

63
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.620
Because it's a more specialist
knowledge type of thing.

64
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.396
But again, getting anyone outside of the
company is better than using people inside

65
00:04:16.396 --> 00:04:18.680
of the company, right?

66
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.878
So we're getting to do this exercise.

67
00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:26.860
Don't need a lot of people to do it,
as many as you feel you can get.

68
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.698
But, I don't know, 13 might be
a reasonable number to get to do it.

69
00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:36.458
And then once you've done that,
you've got to analyze the results, right?

70
00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:40.920
So all of this you can do within UX
Metrics, makes it really simple for you.

71
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.058
You bring up, you go to the results page,
where it shows all the results.

72
00:04:46.058 --> 00:04:50.546
And there's various tabs where
you can see a card view,

73
00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:54.857
where you can see what each
card has been assigned to.

74
00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:58.540
We can see individual results,
and we can see a group view.

75
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.133
It's the group view that I tend to
work with, so we go into a group view.

76
00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.778
And what we'll find is, all these groups,

77
00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:10.544
there'll be a lot of them that
are similar, but not quite the same.

78
00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:15.217
So it goes back to what I was saying
earlier about, they might call it health

79
00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:20.034
care, or they might call it benefits or
dental care or whatever.

80
00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:23.879
If the name is very similar, right,
then there's a button you can press.

81
00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.243
You select the ones that are similar and
it merges them together,

82
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.703
right, merges the results together.

83
00:05:29.703 --> 00:05:31.813
So that needs a bit of cleaning up.

84
00:05:31.813 --> 00:05:36.412
And then once you've done that,
once you've gone through and

85
00:05:36.412 --> 00:05:41.631
merged any similar groups together,
you can then visit the card view.

86
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:46.750
And on the card view, you can see
what each task has been assigned to,

87
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.542
what group name it's been assigned to,
right?

88
00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:52.165
Once you've done that,

89
00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:57.284
you'll have the structure of the data
that defines the structure of the site.

90
00:05:57.284 --> 00:06:00.589
You'll still have to make some decisions,
right,

91
00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.921
about which sections to keep, which
sections to merge, and that kind of thing.

92
00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:08.267
But at least you'll have some hard data,
and

93
00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.871
you'll be able to see which tasks
should go in which sections, right?

94
00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:17.959
Again, you can use ChatGPT to give you
a bit of help here, if you want to.

95
00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:22.155
Because, although you can manually
do all of that merging and

96
00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:26.930
assigning and all of the rest of it,
on a smaller site, that's fine.

97
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.608
But when you get to a bigger site
with a lot of participants, right,

98
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:36.385
it starts to get a lot of information,
and can be a bit overwhelming.

99
00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:37.172
So again,

100
00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:42.778
I've written a ChatGPT prompt where you
can export the data out of it again.

101
00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:47.203
And I won't bother going through this one,
but, basically,

102
00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:49.469
it's a series of step by steps.

103
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:52.873
And it will output a kind
of nice clean list so

104
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:58.530
you can see where every card has
been assigned to each group.

105
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.834
So that will give you a sense of
the top level information architecture.

106
00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:08.740
But it won't set it in stone,
you'll have to make some decisions,

107
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.518
but at least you'll have
data to back it up.

108
00:07:12.518 --> 00:07:16.681
So I wanted to share a few tips with
you for making those decisions.

109
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:19.390
Because if you don't come
from a UX background,

110
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.569
you haven't been doing this for long,

111
00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.240
it's very easy to make some mistakes when
you're setting your top level navigation.

112
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.940
So just a general advice is,
fewer options are better, right?

113
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.400
We can only hold four things in
our short-term memory, right?

114
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.924
So if you've ever looked
at your credit card,

115
00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:41.588
where it's got 16 digits
credit card number.

116
00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:45.049
If you notice, it's always split
into four groups of four, and

117
00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:48.721
that's cuz we can only hold four
things in our short-term memory.

118
00:07:48.721 --> 00:07:52.825
I'm learning, in past, I've got out
my credit card to show you that, and

119
00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:56.188
it's been recorded and
posted on the Internet.

120
00:07:56.188 --> 00:07:58.158
So I'm making progress, right?

121
00:07:58.158 --> 00:08:03.875
So [LAUGH], so yeah, fewer options
are better, four would be optimal.

122
00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:08.421
But, obviously,
that's not always very practical, so

123
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.201
just keep it as low as you can.

124
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:12.821
If you're gonna have
more than four options,

125
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:14.621
you might wanna consider
grouping them together.

126
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:18.937
For instance, maybe categorizing
products into categories and

127
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.534
subcategories and that kind of thing.

128
00:08:22.964 --> 00:08:27.102
Keep the labels nice and short, the labels
shouldn't really be more than one or

129
00:08:27.102 --> 00:08:29.654
two words to aid scannability.

130
00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:33.657
Try and avoid ambiguity,
there's a tension between this one and

131
00:08:33.657 --> 00:08:36.219
the last one about keeping things short.

132
00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:40.941
Cuz, obviously, the shorter things are,
the more ambiguous they are.

133
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:45.677
But ideally, your labels must clearly
describe their content to prevent users

134
00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:49.741
from wasting time on sections
they don't understand.

135
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:53.851
Now let me give you
a real example of that,

136
00:08:53.851 --> 00:09:00.625
cuz it sounds obvious, but
it's more subtle than you think.

137
00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.897
So for a long time, as I already said,

138
00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:06.475
I do a lot of work on a lot
of university websites.

139
00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:11.695
And if somebody doesn't understand,
we were targeting undergraduates, right?

140
00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:13.292
We wanted to get more graduates, so

141
00:09:13.292 --> 00:09:16.355
we were doing an information
architecture around those.

142
00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:22.935
And we had a series of sections along
the top, one of which was alumni, right?

143
00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:26.070
And I can't remember the task
we were asking to complete, but

144
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.025
it was undergraduates,
it was nothing to do with the alumni.

145
00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:34.469
But when we were running the test,
people kept going in the alumni section.

146
00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:38.794
And it was like, what, and in the end I
ended up asking, why are you going in

147
00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:43.002
the alumni section, you're
an undergraduate, why you're going in?

148
00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:46.125
And the answer was,
I don't know what alumni meant, and

149
00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:49.249
I thought maybe my thing was under there,
right?

150
00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:51.891
So that's what I mean by ambiguity,

151
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:57.699
that each section has got to be clearly
understandable by your entire audience.

152
00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:00.464
Yes, go for it,
you can challenge that if you disagree.

153
00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:06.504
&gt;&gt; No, I've had the experience where
marketing jargon ends up in navigation.

154
00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:07.694
&gt;&gt; That's the big one, yeah.

155
00:10:07.694 --> 00:10:11.173
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to convince them
that nobody understands what

156
00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:12.214
growth-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

157
00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:14.414
&gt;&gt; What a tab for growth means.

158
00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:14.944
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

159
00:10:14.944 --> 00:10:19.013
&gt;&gt; Things like that, and
I haven't had much luck.

160
00:10:19.013 --> 00:10:20.173
&gt;&gt; It's a hard battle.

161
00:10:22.693 --> 00:10:27.033
The other really common one is people
use their product names, right?

162
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:31.173
Blade Pro, what the hell's Blade Pro?

163
00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:35.707
And in situations like that,
test it, right?

164
00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:42.162
So that's the classic example of
where I go, well, that's fine.

165
00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:46.996
What we'll do is, I mean,
there's various ways you could test that.

166
00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:49.129
But we'll mock it up, right,

167
00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:53.842
with the navigation with your version and
my version.

168
00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:59.753
And we'll do a first click test, and we'll
say, where would you click for X, right?

169
00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:04.770
And see whether people recognize that
growth is the section they would click on,

170
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.883
or whatever you've renamed
it makes more sense.

171
00:11:09.283 --> 00:11:12.705
Sometimes I don't even ask that,
I just run that test, and

172
00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.833
then present them with the results.

173
00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:22.868
But I never argue it, because the minute
you argue it, it becomes a confrontation.

174
00:11:22.868 --> 00:11:27.456
So what I always do is say,
yeah, I'll lie, I blatantly lie.

175
00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:31.133
I'll say things like,
yeah, growth might work,

176
00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:34.738
I wonder whether X might work better.

177
00:11:34.738 --> 00:11:38.422
Let's do a quick test, give me a half
an hour, or give me an hour, and

178
00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:40.519
I'll come back to you.

179
00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:43.919
So it makes it sound like I'm
taking their option seriously.

180
00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:46.705
Sometimes I'll even go as far as saying,
do you know what,

181
00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.569
that might be a really good idea,
let's just double check.

182
00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:51.605
And then I can come back afterwards and
go,

183
00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:53.819
I'm as shocked as you
that that didn't work.

184
00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.811
I shouldn't be actually saying this
when I'm being recorded, should I?

185
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:00.896
If that camera over there
just forget the thing.

186
00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:07.276
&gt;&gt; But when you do this like really quick
test, what does the test look like?

187
00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:12.274
&gt;&gt; So in that particular case,
I would do probably a first click test.

188
00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:14.229
So what I would do there is,

189
00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:18.912
let's say you'd already mocked
up the homepage, for example.

190
00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:22.461
And you've got your navigation on there,
and you've got your sections,

191
00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:24.502
and one of the sections is Growth, right?

192
00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:28.200
And growth is so ambiguous,

193
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.642
I haven't even got clue what
might be in a section like that.

194
00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:35.642
But let's say it included case studies,
I've just made that up.

195
00:12:35.642 --> 00:12:38.545
You think it should be
called Case Studies,

196
00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:41.145
they think it should be called Growth.

197
00:12:41.145 --> 00:12:45.187
So you do two mock-ups,
we change it to be Growth and whatever.

198
00:12:45.187 --> 00:12:47.176
Then I would use a tool called and

199
00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:49.947
I'll be showing you this in a minute,
actually, anyway.

200
00:12:51.117 --> 00:12:55.786
You would create two tests,
one that would show your version,

201
00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:59.117
one which would show their version.

202
00:12:59.117 --> 00:13:03.862
You would ask one question, which is,
the question on both tests would be,

203
00:13:03.862 --> 00:13:09.145
if you were looking for information about
how we have worked with previous clients.

204
00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:14.477
Notice I haven't used the word growth and
I haven't used the word case study, right?

205
00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:17.397
Where would you click?

206
00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:22.583
And they would click on the image at
the place where they would click,

207
00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:26.207
and that click is recorded, okay?

208
00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:30.277
Now, you would then send it out to
two different groups of people, okay?

209
00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:31.581
And that could be friends and family,

210
00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:35.017
it could be anybody, it doesn't really
matter, anybody outside the company.

211
00:13:35.017 --> 00:13:36.837
And then you'd see where
most people click.

212
00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:42.026
Do more people click on Growth, or
do more people click on Case Studies,

213
00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:45.014
and that proves your point, basically.

214
00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:46.604
Does that make sense?

215
00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:51.741
And, well, I mean the biggest
problem would be waiting for

216
00:13:51.741 --> 00:13:58.540
people to come back, but setting up
the test would take 15 minutes, maybe.

217
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:04.753
And if you paid for people to complete
the test, which is about $1 per person,

218
00:14:04.753 --> 00:14:10.128
and you'd only need half a dozen,
well, no, say, a dozen on each,

219
00:14:10.128 --> 00:14:14.987
so what's that, $24,
you'd get the results in an hour.

220
00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:17.613
So it's not too bad, is it, really?

221
00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:20.234
So yeah, avoid ambiguity.

222
00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.247
The other one is, be distinct, right?

223
00:14:23.247 --> 00:14:28.135
So another common problem, so
jargon is a great example of ambiguity,

224
00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:30.467
right, that's perfect.

225
00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:32.792
Yeah, being distinct
is slightly different,

226
00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:37.157
it's where you have two sections that
could be mistook for one another, right?

227
00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:41.558
So I'm trying to think of
a really common example.

228
00:14:41.558 --> 00:14:47.554
Sectors and industries, right,
are basically the same thing,

229
00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:52.242
but sometimes you will get
both on the navigation,

230
00:14:52.242 --> 00:14:57.051
and then forget it, so
you want them very distinct.

231
00:14:57.051 --> 00:15:01.321
The other piece of advice I would give,
or the last piece I would give is,

232
00:15:01.321 --> 00:15:03.080
don't fear clicks, right?

233
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.449
So often people go,
we got to have all the top level sections,

234
00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:12.220
and people don't like clicking, right?

235
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.094
If you ever heard that,
people don't like clicking,

236
00:15:15.094 --> 00:15:17.110
they didn't use to like clicking.

237
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.109
If you look at Nielsen Norman Group
research in it,

238
00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:21.793
they used to hate clicking.

239
00:15:21.793 --> 00:15:25.866
But that was on dial-up modem days
where you had to wait ten minutes for

240
00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:27.707
every click, right?

241
00:15:27.707 --> 00:15:29.761
These days, users don't mind clicking,

242
00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:33.482
as long as they're confident they're
progressing in the right direction.

243
00:15:33.482 --> 00:15:37.667
So don't get too hung up about how many
clicks it is before someone gets there.

244
00:15:39.197 --> 00:15:42.467
So, hopefully, at the end of this,
you're gonna have a kind of sense.

245
00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:43.997
Yeah, got a question?

246
00:15:43.997 --> 00:15:48.077
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm curious where things like
a search box would fit into this.

247
00:15:48.077 --> 00:15:50.477
I'm looking for this, and
you can just type it in.

248
00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:53.107
&gt;&gt; Search is a completely
different problem, right?

249
00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:56.537
I don't include search in
information architecture.

250
00:15:59.227 --> 00:16:01.578
It's obviously a very important component,

251
00:16:01.578 --> 00:16:03.814
a lot of people
instinctively go to search.

252
00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:08.541
So it's incredibly important
that you consider search.

253
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:13.786
But search is a whole set of usability
issues that's slightly apart from that.

254
00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:19.961
I haven't really included that in this
workshop, if I'm being honest with you.

255
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:26.055
Because oftentimes there's very little
that a UX designer can do about search,

256
00:16:26.055 --> 00:16:27.210
right?

257
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.454
Because a lot of search functionality
on websites are terrible.

258
00:16:32.454 --> 00:16:36.464
And they're terrible
because of the technology,

259
00:16:36.464 --> 00:16:39.362
not because of the user experience.

260
00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:43.132
That the technology is
not customizable enough,

261
00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:49.067
it doesn't allow you to do the things that
you need to do to make it accessible.

262
00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:53.830
So I've kind of skipped over search,
to be honest with you.

263
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.479
And also,

264
00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:59.960
there's various other aspects that are
kind of information architecture adjacent.

265
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.687
Like, for example, chat apps, or
these AI answer your question things.

266
00:17:05.687 --> 00:17:11.910
Or the fact that most people deep link
into a website from Google anyway.

267
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.722
So I could do a whole workshop on
information architecture, but,

268
00:17:15.722 --> 00:17:17.500
hopefully, you get the idea.
