1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.576
So let's move on to how to set or

2
00:00:02.576 --> 00:00:07.151
why to segment your audience and
kind of how to do that.

3
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:11.568
So, this idea of segmenting
your audience is

4
00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:16.927
a marketing thing basically,
he says pulling a face.

5
00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:21.907
But it is very important cuz different
audiences have very different needs,

6
00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:26.887
but the traditional ways of segmenting
your audience don't really work very

7
00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:28.357
well with UX, right?

8
00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:33.339
They work well with marketing, segmenting
people by their social economic group for

9
00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:34.451
example, right?

10
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.116
Makes sense when you're doing marketing
but from a UX point of view and

11
00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.425
the kind of work we do,
not so much, right?

12
00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:45.867
What we care about is things like
what questions people have, right?

13
00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:50.250
Audiences that have different
questions from one another should

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.168
be segmented differently.

15
00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:56.138
So going back to that
University of Florida example,

16
00:00:56.138 --> 00:01:00.460
the questions that I have as
an existing employee compared

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.357
to a potential employee,
compared to a HR manager.

18
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.396
We have very different questions, so

19
00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:09.081
it made sense to split people in that way,
right?

20
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:14.342
Based around their different question
needs, tasks is another one.

21
00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:19.512
So again using that example, well
splitting them along those lines because

22
00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:24.936
the tasks that somebody who had just
joined the institution is very different.

23
00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:28.593
From the tasks that somebody
who had been there for

24
00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:31.914
20 years need to do
with their health care.

25
00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:36.874
So splitting them around those made
sense again because you use questions

26
00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:40.077
in the tasks, and
third one are needs, right?

27
00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:44.879
Some users have specific needs that
you need to comprehend whether

28
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:49.175
that be around language or
cognitive requirements, etc.

29
00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:53.606
So you can see how the way
that I'm splitting it here

30
00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:56.402
isn't demographics, right?

31
00:01:56.402 --> 00:02:03.420
It is about their interactions,
their requirements, etc.

32
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.186
So whenever you get an audience and
you're defining your audiences,

33
00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:12.870
is always try and split them around
those three things, questions,

34
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.362
tasks, and
needs will make your life a lot easier.

35
00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:19.123
So just to kind of give
you an example of that,

36
00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:23.931
when we were segmenting around based on
needs with the University of Florida.

37
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:28.926
We have prospective employees that
wanted an overview of their healthcare

38
00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:32.107
options and
what they might get as an employee.

39
00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:36.049
Then you had your new employees
that needed to know how to pick and

40
00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.171
enroll on a specific health plan.

41
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:41.793
So again, different tasks,
different needs there,

42
00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:46.126
existing employees that wanted
to switch between health plans,

43
00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.921
maybe they just had a kid or
got married or whatever else.

44
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:54.769
So they had their own set of needs and
then managers that had to

45
00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.348
approve a health plan or
support staff in their choices.

46
00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:03.102
So how do you go about kind of
understanding the user's needs and

47
00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.222
what drives them?

48
00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:08.630
So once you've kind of defined
your different audiences, well,

49
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.791
let's look at what's useful to know,
right?

50
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:15.407
They're not all crucial,
you don't need to know all of these but

51
00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:19.283
I'm just giving you a list of things
that I tend to keep an eye out for and

52
00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:22.478
I kinda wanna know when I'm
understanding an audience.

53
00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:25.402
I've already said what
questions they have, right,

54
00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:27.254
what are they seeking answers to?

55
00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:31.209
Lot of the stuff especially with websites
obviously more so than apps, but

56
00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.252
with websites most of the time you're
trying to get an answer to a question.

57
00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:38.959
What objections is a common one?

58
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.977
So if you're Upselling something or
you've got a service that your website is

59
00:03:43.977 --> 00:03:49.084
offering, why are users not acting,
why are they abandoning the experience?

60
00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:52.987
We're stopping them,
what are their objections?

61
00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:58.805
I wanna know what their goals are, what
they try to ultimately achieve, and then

62
00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:04.556
I wanna know what the tasks are that they
have to do to achieve that goal, right?

63
00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:08.395
But then there are other things that are
of interest as well, so there's things I

64
00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:12.700
like to know about people's state of mind,
how they're feeling during the experience.

65
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.878
Which may sound like tree huggy territory,
but

66
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.702
it's actually very useful to
know with certain things.

67
00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:23.727
So for example, planning a holiday or
a vacation, sorry,

68
00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:26.635
we're in America, planning a vacation.

69
00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:29.309
So when you're planning a vacation,

70
00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:35.173
how you feel changes quite dramatically
over that planning process to begin with.

71
00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:38.996
You're very excited, the possibilities
as you narrow things down,

72
00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:41.471
you get more excited as
it gets more focused.

73
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:45.456
Then it comes to the moment of paying,
and suddenly you're a bit nervous and

74
00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:49.830
actually booking it is a bit scary, then
it gets exciting again before you go away.

75
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.730
But as you come up to the moment of
going away, they're all concerns and

76
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.510
worries about have you got the right
visas and all that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.188
Then there's the holiday, the vacation and
the excitement and enjoying that but

78
00:05:02.188 --> 00:05:05.307
there probably are difficulties
to overcome as well,

79
00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:08.525
do you see how it's a real
roller coaster emotionally?

80
00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:12.203
So there are certain situations where
state of mind is really important,

81
00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:15.717
I've worked with a mental health
charity that had a suicide hotline.

82
00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:19.806
State of mind is pretty important
on that one, so it does vary,

83
00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:24.454
influences, what's influencing
the experience the user is having?

84
00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:28.602
That may be people, it may be
publications, it may be social media

85
00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:33.429
influences, a lots of things will affect
how people respond in a situation.

86
00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:36.342
Then there are things like challenges,

87
00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:41.319
what pain points are users
experiencing during their interaction?

88
00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.041
And then the final one is touch points,

89
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.510
what different ways is a user
interacting with the experience?

90
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.776
I'll come back to touch
points in a minute,

91
00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:57.074
you got your primary things,
which are the main things you wanna know,

92
00:05:57.074 --> 00:06:01.154
and then your secondary things
which are nice to have.

93
00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:05.831
So touchpoints might be are they
going into a store like you were

94
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:09.979
talking about earlier, or
are they receiving emails or

95
00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.762
is it via a web app or is it a native app,
is it web based app, etc.

96
00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:19.615
So these are the kinds of things I
know as I've already said I start by

97
00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:23.375
consolidating what is
already in an organization.

98
00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:27.051
But to get really specific
about what I'm looking for

99
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.062
I tend to look see if there's
any existing user research.

100
00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:35.960
Don't really care if it's years old
as long as I'm aware it's years old,

101
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.537
it's still nice to see
anything that already exists,

102
00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:43.520
any existing testing that's
been done in the past, right?

103
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.501
Still interesting to see,

104
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:50.073
I often have a chat with customer
facing staff always find out.

105
00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:54.469
In fact, that's my number one go to first
thing I always do anybody who talks to

106
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.414
the customer,
I love to have a quick chat with them.

107
00:06:57.414 --> 00:07:02.101
Customer support staff
are particularly good the reason

108
00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:05.916
being is they keep lists
of common questions.

109
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:10.196
Which are wonderful to have,
cuz that's all of their problems and

110
00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.342
pain points, so that's great.

111
00:07:12.342 --> 00:07:16.853
Often dive into site analytics
just to kinda see where people

112
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:21.993
are dropping out is the main thing
where are people leaving the site.

113
00:07:21.993 --> 00:07:27.698
Often talk to the social media team if
there is one cuz that's really good for

114
00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:31.991
kind of things people are saying
about the brand online.

115
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:36.960
Sometimes I get into CRM data and kind
of have a nose around there but not so

116
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.176
much that's not such a big one.

117
00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:44.878
I sometimes look at what search terms
are used around the application or

118
00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:50.211
site so I can kind of see if there's
any reoccurring themes there.

119
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.159
And then finally obviously I'll
look at any existing personas,

120
00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:56.812
now I know that looks like a lot and I'm
not suggesting you do all of them, right?

121
00:07:56.812 --> 00:08:01.833
Again ,do what you can maybe you
can't get any of that stuff and

122
00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:05.166
that's fine, then fair enough you can.

123
00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:10.739
If it turns out to be there was some user
research that was done five years ago but

124
00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:16.574
nobody really knows where it is, don't
waste your time hunting around for ages.

125
00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:20.393
But if you can lay your hands on it
quickly great, give it a skim, right?

126
00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:25.586
So don't be intimidated by any of these
things that I'm saying, cuz you can

127
00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:31.450
just do what you can really, something is
better than nothing, back to that mantra.

128
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:37.174
So once I've kind of had a little look
over whatever there is, sometimes I'll

129
00:08:37.174 --> 00:08:42.655
spend a day doing that, sometimes
I'll spend an hour doing that, right?

130
00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:47.015
Sometimes occasionally I'll spend
several days diving into analytics,

131
00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:48.959
so I'm not an analytics person.

132
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:56.248
So once I've kind of done all that,
then basically there are gaps, right?

133
00:08:56.248 --> 00:09:00.189
There are things that I wanna
know that aren't there, and

134
00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:02.370
they kinda come in three forms.

135
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.022
There's missing information,

136
00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:07.568
there's particular things that I
wanna know that just aren't there.

137
00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:12.178
Then there's out date
information in other words,

138
00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:17.310
there's stuff that is there but
I can't really get at it,

139
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:23.406
or yeah, this is what so
long ago that I don't think it's relevant.

140
00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:27.778
And then there's stuff that sometimes
people write down and you go yeah,

141
00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:30.612
that's someone made up,
I don't believe that
