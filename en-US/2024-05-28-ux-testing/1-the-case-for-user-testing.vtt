1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.680
There are a set of principles that
I wanna explore in kind of how I

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.650
go about approaching lean
user research and testing.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.639
And so
let's take a moment to run through those,

4
00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.350
because I think those will be
maybe quite encouraging for you.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.658
The first thing I wanna talk about is
the case for user research and testing.

6
00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:28.389
We know in our heads this
stuff is important, right?

7
00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:33.026
But being able to articulate that
with stakeholders and clients and

8
00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:37.189
people like that is a really
important thing to be able to do.

9
00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:42.886
And also, to remind ourselves
of how beneficial it can be for

10
00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:47.171
us personally, not for the user, right?

11
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.861
Let's forget the user for a minute.

12
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.471
That's a great thing to say on a user
research and testing workshop.

13
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.171
But let's forget the user for a minute.

14
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:57.675
We know that user research and
testing will help them, but

15
00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:01.964
it will also help you in your job,
and it will also help your company, or

16
00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:06.744
organization you're working with, and
it will also help your colleagues.

17
00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:12.004
First of all, what benefits does doing
user research and testing have for you?

18
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.030
Because I know a lot of the people that
are watching this user research and

19
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.954
testing is not your primary role.

20
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.243
Your probably a developer, right?

21
00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:24.214
And as a developer, you think,
I know user research and

22
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:28.960
testing is important, but
do I really want to be doing this?

23
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.270
Do I wanna take this on,
on top of everything else?

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.833
Well, there are a lot of good
reasons to do it for a start,

25
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:42.538
because of your knowledge and
your expertise in the field of digital and

26
00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:45.390
in creating web apps and websites,

27
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.978
you're actually very
knowledgeable about what you do.

28
00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:52.861
But does your stakeholders,
your clients, and

29
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.392
your managers realize how
knowledgeable you are, right?

30
00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.323
In my experience, no.

31
00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:02.371
In my experience, other stakeholders
think they know better, don't lie.

32
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.640
So one of the huge benefits of doing
a little bit of user research and

33
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.152
a little bit of testing for you,
is you get to be proved right, right?

34
00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:16.329
You have some evidence to back up
the expertise that you've already had.

35
00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.859
So that's one good reason
to do it yourself, right?

36
00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.379
If there is something
you want to put prove,

37
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.409
there's a point you're trying to
make to stakeholders and clients.

38
00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.509
Little bit of research, little bit of
testing couldn't get rid of endless hours

39
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.392
of arguing, or headbanging, or
getting frustrated and swearing, right?

40
00:02:36.392 --> 00:02:39.703
Might be just me that gets sweaty but
there you go.

41
00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:44.190
The second reason that you want to
pay attention to it, is a client or

42
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.961
a stakeholder comes to me with a bad idea.

43
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.746
Let's just go with that.

44
00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:54.294
And you see it's got you sitting
there going, really, really?

45
00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:58.848
Well, instead of getting into this
argument with them where you're normally

46
00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:02.919
gonna lose, because normally that
stakeholder or kind is more senior

47
00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.128
than you, and so therefore thinks
automatically their idea is better.

48
00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:11.249
So instead of getting into an argument,
just do a little bit of testing.

49
00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.791
Show them that their idea is bad, and

50
00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:19.249
that way you can avoid confrontation
by just suggesting we test it.

51
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.209
So that's another reason.

52
00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:27.244
And the final reason for you to do it
is to avoid criticism later, right?

53
00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:32.422
Testing is a great way of
covering your ass, right?

54
00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:37.792
It's a great way of saying, well,
we tested it, we went and checked it.

55
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:42.373
So all of these are brilliant reasons for
you personally to do a little bit of

56
00:03:42.373 --> 00:03:46.172
research and testing even when
it's not primarily your job.

57
00:03:46.172 --> 00:03:49.405
But there are also organizational benefit.

58
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.388
And we need to talk about
these things in the right way,

59
00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:57.726
because we use the right words,
it tends to go much better.

60
00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:00.894
So let's go back to your bank, right?

61
00:04:00.894 --> 00:04:05.585
Bank is a big, established
organization that's been around ages.

62
00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:11.655
So those kinds of organizations, they're
all about maintaining the status quo,

63
00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:16.035
maintaining their position
within the marketplace.

64
00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:19.751
Also, there's a lot of compliance that's
going on there, a lot of rules and

65
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:20.935
regulations.

66
00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:24.060
So what you do is talk about
risk management, right?

67
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.503
They're terrified of risk.

68
00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:27.538
Don't wanna risk anything.

69
00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:32.440
Well, if we don't do our user research and
testing, this could backfire.

70
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.400
Accessibility, that's always
a good one to go with.

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.054
Yeah, if we don't test it with people,
it might be inaccessible.

72
00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:43.214
And then there would be a PR disaster,
and we would get sued, right?

73
00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:45.277
Great way to talk with people like that.

74
00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:52.184
Another organizational who benefit for
maybe the more startup side of things,

75
00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:56.717
the smaller hungrier organization,
is market fit, right?

76
00:04:56.717 --> 00:05:03.320
So in those situations, they're wanting to
know they can outperform the competitors.

77
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.774
That they can be more progressive,
more disruptive in the industry.

78
00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:12.245
But the only way you know that is to do
but if you have research and testing,

79
00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:12.761
right?

80
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:16.866
Or the other thing that smaller
organizations always wanna know is,

81
00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:18.718
they wanna get in there quick.

82
00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.445
They wanna establish
their market position.

83
00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:26.230
So actually user research and
testing can reduce debate and

84
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.389
the time spent on failed approaches and

85
00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.379
will get you to market faster
than if you don't test, right?

86
00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.935
And that's a big claim that
I'm making there, okay?

87
00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:42.086
I'm saying slowing down and
doing user research and

88
00:05:42.086 --> 00:05:46.528
testing will get you to market
faster than not doing it.

89
00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:51.508
And I will prove that later, but for
now I'll leave it hanging, right?

90
00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:55.239
So those are the organizational benefits,
but

91
00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:58.884
organizations are made up of people,
right?

92
00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:03.241
And people, he says,
remember I'm older now,

93
00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:06.764
I've become old and cynical, right?

94
00:06:06.764 --> 00:06:12.779
People are selfish, even if something
is the best thing for the organization,

95
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:18.099
if it makes their lives difficult,
they don't want to do it, right?

96
00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:19.889
They don't want to get on.

97
00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.050
Well, I've got a deadline to me,
and so your research and

98
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.900
testing might mean I'm not
gonna meet my deadline.

99
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.066
I don't care that it's beneficial for the
project or the user or the organization.

100
00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:32.958
It's gonna inconvenience me.

101
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.518
So therefore, I don't wanna do it.

102
00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:39.096
So you've gotta tailor your message to
the different people you're talking about.

103
00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:43.779
So imagine you're talking to
your finance team, right?

104
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.787
The finance department.

105
00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:48.579
We don't have budget for testing.

106
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:51.286
Well, you could talk
about how research and

107
00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:56.350
testing reduces the chance of the project
failing and going over budget, right?

108
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.838
So you can position it from a financial
point of view that it provides financial

109
00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:05.462
benefit, clean up planning because you
know how long something's gonna take,

110
00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:09.648
what's gonna be required,
all of those kinds of things.

111
00:07:09.648 --> 00:07:13.502
And equally when you're talking
maybe to say a sales and

112
00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:17.110
marketing team,
you can talk about how research and

113
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.936
testing will increase the chance that the
service will succeed in the market place.

114
00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:26.729
Or improve the conversion rate,
or terms like that,

115
00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:31.296
the kinds of things that sales and
marketing people care about.

116
00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:34.590
And equally when you're
talking to developers, right?

117
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.513
Which admittedly a lot of you guys are,
research and

118
00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:40.969
testing is gonna re-streamline
the development process and

119
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:45.554
reduce wasted efforts, because they're
not gonna ask you to build something and

120
00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:49.432
then ten minutes later turn around and
go, now we've had a new idea.

121
00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:51.971
Now, we want you to build this instead.

122
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:57.140
Cuz it's based on data and
real world stuff, rather than just what

123
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.047
they made up on that particular
moment in that particular day.

124
00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:04.860
So it can be hugely valuable.

125
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.727
Again, getting to know how to present
it right to stakeholders is a big part

126
00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:10.356
of this.

127
00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:14.299
But it's also about proving
the value over time, right?

128
00:08:14.299 --> 00:08:19.500
You cannot go and this is the biggest
mistake I see all the time, right?

129
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.542
I often help organizations
establish UX teams within

130
00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:28.935
an organization that traditionally
hasn't had a UX team.

131
00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:32.735
And what often happens is they hire a UX
lead who goes in hell for leather and

132
00:08:32.735 --> 00:08:35.796
says, we need to be doing this and
we need to be doing that and

133
00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:37.356
we need to be doing the other.

134
00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:40.786
And immediately is butting up
against the existing culture and

135
00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.776
the way people are thinking
within the organization.

136
00:08:43.776 --> 00:08:47.628
And it's going to cost a lot of money
it's going to cost a lot of time,

137
00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:51.433
it's gonna be disruptive,
we don't wanna do any of that, right?

138
00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:55.873
What you're better off doing is
proving the value by going in

139
00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:59.018
small to begin with and growing over time.

140
00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:03.649
Carrying out small tests to show
the value of user testing without

141
00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:06.522
delaying the project or costing money.

142
00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:10.057
And I'll show you ways to do that later.

143
00:09:10.057 --> 00:09:15.624
Very small, very simple to get it
into the culture of the organization,

144
00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:21.665
get people used to doing it, and then you
grow on that gradually over the time.

145
00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:24.817
So once you've done one bit
of testing on one project and

146
00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:29.660
the next project is easy to say, well, we
did that one last time, let's do it again.

147
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.139
But this time you make it a bit bigger,
a bit more complete.

148
00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:37.621
Also, another great way of proving
the value is to actually to involve

149
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:39.269
stakeholders in the testing.

150
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:41.900
Don't just go away and
do a bit of testing, but

151
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.627
invite them try to watch usability
testing if you do some of that.

152
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:50.109
Or provide them at least a summary of
the testing that was done and the results.

153
00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:54.240
And maybe talk to them about the results,
or maybe discuss with them what

154
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.395
the testing should be and
how we should go about doing it.

155
00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:03.078
We tend to exclude stakeholders from the
process, because they just mess stuff up.

156
00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:06.971
[LAUGH] But, in truth,
we're better off including them,

157
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:11.907
because if we include them, then they
begin to have a sense of ownership.

158
00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:14.275
If they've got a sense of ownership,

159
00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:19.240
then they're more likely to support
the results of it, and get invested in it.

160
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.875
And then the final thing that I try and

161
00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:25.360
do to prove the value is
communicate successes.

162
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.189
So make sure that you put effort into
promoting the benefits of your user

163
00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:33.503
research and
testing through success stories.

164
00:10:33.503 --> 00:10:35.590
Include them in presentations,

165
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.216
maybe start a newsletter sharing UX
best practice in your organization.

166
00:10:40.216 --> 00:10:42.983
Whatever opportunities you've got,

167
00:10:42.983 --> 00:10:47.352
start talking about how user
testing helped things, right?

168
00:10:47.352 --> 00:10:49.302
And if possible, even try and

169
00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:53.440
associate $ value with
the difference you've made, right?

170
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.427
And a lot of that will be guesswork.

171
00:10:55.427 --> 00:10:59.123
You'll be making up figures,
now don't actually make up stuff,

172
00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:00.513
I'm not advising that.

173
00:11:00.513 --> 00:11:04.829
But make estimates and be open about the
fact that you're making guesstimates, and

174
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.372
people will come back and say,
well, those are just guesstimates.

175
00:11:08.372 --> 00:11:11.287
Well, why don't we do some research and

176
00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:15.077
testing to find out how
accurate these numbers are?

177
00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:17.457
So you can begin to build an interest and

178
00:11:17.457 --> 00:11:20.718
demonstrate the value of
user experience over time.

179
00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:26.317
So recognize that, if you wanna
start introducing user testing and

180
00:11:26.317 --> 00:11:30.273
research into your organizations,
with your clients and

181
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:34.951
stuff like that, your job is gonna
be as much about convincing them of

182
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:39.412
the value as it is going to be doing
the user research and testing.
