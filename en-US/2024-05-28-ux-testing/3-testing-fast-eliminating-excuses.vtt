1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.290
Find opportunities, right?

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.346
There are loads of opportunities
available to you to do testing and

3
00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:08.737
research that could just pass you by and

4
00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:12.790
you could easily miss if
you're not paying attention.

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.359
Use every tiny moment in a project
to cram in some usability testing or

6
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.363
user research, cuz you really
can get a lot in there, right?

7
00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:27.443
So I do a lot of tests,
a lot of people write when they think

8
00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:32.219
of usability testing,
they kinda save up their testing, right?

9
00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.784
Yeah, we need to test that,
when we're a bit further on in the bill,

10
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.708
we need to test that,
we need to test that.

11
00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:39.448
And they end up with a whole load
of things that they wanna test,

12
00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:42.255
which obviously is gonna
take a lot of time, right?

13
00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:46.965
What I do is lots and little bits of
testing that I kinda sneak in, right?

14
00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:49.505
Somebody asks a question,
let's do a test for that.

15
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.695
So most of the tests I do take
less than an hour, right?

16
00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:57.181
Most of them take less
than 30 minutes to set up,

17
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.758
get results back in another half an hour,
I carry on with my work.

18
00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:06.654
That is literally what I do, most of the
time I do things like first-click test,

19
00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:09.606
5- second test, eye-tracking simulation,

20
00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:12.350
which doesn't take any
time at all that one.

21
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.150
And there's so
many other opportunities just to

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.488
do quick lightning testing in a situation.

23
00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:24.471
And focus on fast results, right?

24
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.865
There are a lot of services out there that
will get you results back in a couple of

25
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:30.671
hours, literally, right?

26
00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:35.581
For example, Pollfish, I use Pollfish for
surveying all the time.

27
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:42.283
And basically, I can write a survey and
I can pay a very small amount of money.

28
00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:46.188
I think it's about $1 per person
that would complete the survey,

29
00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:48.663
presuming it's not a really long survey.

30
00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:54.583
And I will get results back
in under an hour, okay?

31
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:59.337
And to be quite frank, some of the time
I pay that out of my own pocket.

32
00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:04.411
Because, and
paying a tenner to get ten users opinions,

33
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:10.752
rather than sitting in a meeting for
an hour and a half arguing about it,

34
00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:15.530
is worth that tenner to me,
I mean, so fast results.

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.770
And then I also use those
natural breaks in projects,

36
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.002
they're always brakes in project.

37
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.227
Someone hasn't delivered
the content on time,

38
00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:26.459
someone hasn't done whatever
they're supposed to have done.

39
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.159
There are always opportunities to sneak
in a little bit of testing, right?

40
00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.869
And also you can manufacture excuses,
I do this all the time as well, right?

41
00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:41.058
So let's say, you've been asked
to prepare a presentation.

42
00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:44.743
Well, wouldn't this presentation be
a lot better with a little bit of user

43
00:02:44.743 --> 00:02:46.320
research in it?

44
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.680
So I've been given permission
to do the presentation.

45
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.711
So I could do the presentation, okay,
well, let's do a bit user research

46
00:02:55.711 --> 00:03:00.167
to shove in my presentation,
I've manufactured an excuse.

47
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:03.087
Also people are always asking questions,
right?

48
00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:08.787
So somebody will ask you a question, you
go, yeah, I don't know the answer to that.

49
00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.467
Give me an hour, and
I'll go away and find out.

50
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.040
And I'm not gonna do bit user research,

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.227
user testing in an hour and
I can come back to them.

52
00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.305
And then options as well,
so sit in a meeting and

53
00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:25.967
the minute two stakeholders disagree
which is inevitable normally happens

54
00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.927
within five minutes of being in
most meetings in my experience.

55
00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:34.451
So they disagree with so and say, let's
not get bogged down in that right now.

56
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:39.095
Give me a give me a few hours I'll go away
and testing come back to you, go, and

57
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:41.123
everybody loves it, right?

58
00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:44.904
Because when two stakeholders
start arguing in the meeting,

59
00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:46.853
everybody goes, right?

60
00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:48.483
That's gonna make the meeting longer.

61
00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:52.464
If you cut in with a, say,
I can resolve this offline,

62
00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:57.758
let's move on to the next agenda point,
everybody jumps on it, right?

63
00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:01.743
So it's a great opportunity
to getting a bit of testing.

64
00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.987
At this point, I wanna give you
a little bit of a warning, and

65
00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:09.249
I've kind of touched on it already, but
I wanna emphasize it again, which is,

66
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.085
this can't cost anything, right?

67
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.285
This can't cost any money
that people are aware of.

68
00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.235
So if there is a cost involved,
hide it, right?

69
00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.287
Hide it in any way you can.

70
00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:24.585
If you're, say, somebody,

71
00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:29.689
an external person working with clients,
just quote another hour or

72
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:35.347
two hours on a project to give yourself
a bit of space for this kinda thing.

73
00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:39.600
Don't put it in as a line item on your
proposal, the minute you put it in a line

74
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.015
item in your proposal,
people will take it out, right?

75
00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:46.755
It's like project management, nobody ever
wants to pay for project management.

76
00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:51.842
So just hide the cost away, if,
for example, you work in house,

77
00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:58.635
maybe you could put that on the company
credit card cuz it's only a tenner, right?

78
00:04:58.635 --> 00:05:02.624
Rather than going through procurement
to get a big platform approved,

79
00:05:02.624 --> 00:05:04.816
can you imagine, right?

80
00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:07.376
So there are lots of ways
of kinda hiding the cost.

81
00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:10.457
So there you go,
that's a bit of introduction, but

82
00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:15.306
I'm gonna come back to this sentence
one more time cuz it is so important.

83
00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:17.999
Doing something is better
than doing nothing.

84
00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.206
So if you can't do all of this stuff,
don't worry, it's okay.
