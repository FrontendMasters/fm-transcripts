1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.775
So let's talk about the first
test that I like to do,

2
00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:05.340
which is testing comprehension, right?

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.890
So when you're testing comprehension,
you're essentially attempting to

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.600
understand what the users understand
what the page is about and

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.910
what action they can take from it, right?

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.960
So it's more on the usability
side of things.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.583
We're not worried about
whether people like it,

8
00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:25.215
we're just worried about whether
they understand it and can use it.

9
00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:29.122
One of the tests that I've really
liked is called an eight-second test,

10
00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:32.555
when it's not,
it's called a five-second test, right?

11
00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.203
Which really annoys me because I never
do it for five seconds, always do it for

12
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.125
eight seconds, and I'll explain why.

13
00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:44.709
So users spend on average
about eight seconds

14
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:48.697
assessing a page when they hit it.

15
00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:54.260
This is based on some possibly dubious
research that was done previously,

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.438
but it's the best that we've got by time,

17
00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:00.811
which has been published
in various places.

18
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:05.264
Who knows how accurate it is and
how represented it is overall, but

19
00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:07.981
it seems to be a reasonable number.

20
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:12.939
You could look at your own analytics if
you really wanted to get an idea of it,

21
00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.636
but yeah,

22
00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:19.301
about eight seconds assessing a page
before they decide if it's helpful or not.

23
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:22.455
If they don't think it's gonna be helpful,
they're gonna abandon it, right?

24
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:26.218
So one of the things that we want to
ensure is that they consider this page

25
00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.233
helpful, right?

26
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.479
And they understand what's going on.

27
00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.621
So with this test,
which we'll call the eight-second test,

28
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:40.649
we first of all need to understand who
we need to do this test with, right?

29
00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.979
Obviously, with all testing,
in an ideal world,

30
00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.719
you wanna test with your average user.

31
00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.909
However, it doesn't necessarily
need to be that way.

32
00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.659
You can get away with testing with
people that aren't as familiar with it.

33
00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.113
And I said this before, and
I just wanna repeat it here that there is

34
00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:04.511
a lot of good reasons for making something
usable and comprehensible by everybody.

35
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.058
They might be new to the sector.

36
00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:08.114
English might not be their first language.

37
00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.761
They might have a cognitive disability,
etc.

38
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:15.787
So long and short of it is you can
do this first eight-second test

39
00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:20.628
with anybody you want that's
outside of the organization and

40
00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:27.069
that is approximately equally able
as your target audience, right?

41
00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.375
I regularly use friends and family to the
point now where there are certain family

42
00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:35.680
members I can't use anymore because
they've become so competent at doing these

43
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.260
tests that they're not representative of
the average user anymore, problematic.

44
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.964
So yeah, it's officially
called the five-second test.

45
00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:48.504
I show it for eight because that's the
average time somebody says on the site.

46
00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:53.382
So essentially, a five-second test
involves showing the user your

47
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:58.261
design concept for eight seconds,
after which you ask them to recall

48
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:02.653
specific details or
their first impression or both, right?

49
00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:04.532
It's totally up to you what you wanna ask.

50
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:10.206
And all of this is about assessing the
effectiveness of the visual communication.

51
00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:15.626
So typically, what I will do is I
normally ask them two questions.

52
00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:20.843
The first question was,
what was that page about, right?

53
00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:24.323
And the second question is,
what do you remember from that page?

54
00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:28.043
What elements do you remember
seeing from the page, all right?

55
00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:29.383
That's basically it.

56
00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.663
And it's really easy to set up, right?

57
00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:35.974
You just go into the site and
you select five-second test.

58
00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:37.891
You give it a name.

59
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:39.478
You upload your image.

60
00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:41.064
You write your questions.

61
00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:43.487
You press publish, and that's it.

62
00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:47.500
It gives you a URL, and that URL you
can give out to friends and family or

63
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.871
whoever else, right?

64
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:53.727
And then what they will see is this, look
at the interface for eight seconds and

65
00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.502
remember as much as you can.

66
00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.997
That's what I've asked them to do
in this particular case, right?

67
00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:04.651
And when they hit that button,
the image then appears for eight seconds.

68
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:08.034
And then at the end of the eight seconds,
it disappears and

69
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.635
they're given a box to fill in
what they remembered, right?

70
00:04:11.635 --> 00:04:14.522
Such a quick and easy test, okay?

71
00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:17.644
You can see how you can get results in
a few minutes from a test like that,

72
00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:20.372
takes few minutes to set up,
few minutes to run.

73
00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:25.198
And what you'll get back is that,
basically a word cloud saying all

74
00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:30.092
of the different words that people
used and different phrases.

75
00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:31.268
So in this case,

76
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:37.242
I was pretty happy with this because it
was a site about doing direct mail, right?

77
00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.877
Something, that word worried me slightly.

78
00:04:39.877 --> 00:04:43.822
[LAUGH] So I did have to go in and
check the individual results to find

79
00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:48.438
out why people, they were saying things
like something about direct mail.

80
00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:49.927
So that's fair enough.

81
00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:52.137
I didn't need to worry
about that too much.

82
00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:55.844
So yeah, and you can get a very quick
idea very quickly about whether

83
00:04:55.844 --> 00:05:00.283
people comprehend what they're looking at,
brilliant, wonderful, super.

84
00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:05.152
I mean, an alternative approach if you've
got a little bit more time is you could

85
00:05:05.152 --> 00:05:06.799
do some user interviews and

86
00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:11.123
do it that way because user interviews
are always very enlightening.

87
00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:13.036
I mean, they're more in-depth for a start.

88
00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:15.043
You can ask follow-up questions.

89
00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:19.149
And you could also see people's
non-visual cues cuz sometimes you get

90
00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:20.253
great reactions.

91
00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.571
You showed the design and
they go like that.

92
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.499
[LAUGH] And then you know,
or they lean clubs,

93
00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:29.905
which is maybe an indication,
it's not as obvious as it should be.

94
00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.388
And there are things like
that which are quite nice.

95
00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:36.899
But let's be honest, it's a long lead
time to set up something like that.

96
00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.103
It takes time to actually run it.

97
00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:42.030
And it's often smaller
numbers you're looking at.

98
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.760
So do what you feel is
appropriate in those situations.

99
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.070
Yeah, user interviews are great, but
they do come with their drawback.

100
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.039
But I tell you, that five-second test is
a corker for giving you solid advice that

101
00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.318
says, no, people did see the logo,
we don't need to make it bigger, right?

102
00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:04.588
Or, yes, people did understand
what the site is about.
