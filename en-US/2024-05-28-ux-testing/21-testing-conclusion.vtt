1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.084
So essentially, what I'm encouraging
you to do is to test early,

2
00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:08.872
even with a single mockup
if that's all you've got,

3
00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:12.090
it has considerable
benefits from doing so.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.712
And focus your testing primarily
on aesthetics at this stage, but

5
00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:19.461
if you want you might as well do a bit
of usability while you're at it,

6
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.421
cuz you can send it all out in one go.

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.532
And if possible do some comprehension and
usability testing as well.

8
00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:28.409
I cannot recommend doing this enough.

9
00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.341
Out of everything that I've covered today,
for most people,

10
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:38.273
this is the one area of usability
testing they're not doing and

11
00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:43.132
that is easy to do and
will make your life the easiest, right?

12
00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:47.639
Other areas people are more familiar
with doing usability testing in, but

13
00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:51.228
this is the one which I think
makes the biggest difference.

14
00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:54.354
So before we move on to
testing your prototype,

15
00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:58.350
any questions around any of that,
or thoughts or opinions?

16
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.629
Yeah, go for it.

17
00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.718
&gt;&gt; I think I understand a break,
but lorem ipsum

18
00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:05.557
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

19
00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:08.369
&gt;&gt; Did you use that make up for
fake content?

20
00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.219
&gt;&gt; Yes.

21
00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.079
No, I mean, I don't do that.

22
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.483
I think I described lorem ipsum
as the devil spawn or something,

23
00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:19.383
I think it was something like that.

24
00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:27.899
For me usability is so intrinsically
tied to content that you cannot,

25
00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.222
if you're just testing
aesthetics fair enough,

26
00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:37.895
knock yourself out use lorem ipsum.

27
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.745
But the minute you want to pay any
kind of attention to usability,

28
00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:43.287
do people understand it?

29
00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:44.007
Do they comprehend it?

30
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.856
Can they interact with it?

31
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.225
You're gonna need real text in there.

32
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:53.811
It doesn't need to be perfect real text,
it can be draft.

33
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.649
Now, the big problem always
comes to that is extracting that

34
00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.951
from clients because clients
are terrible at delivering content.

35
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.764
I've given up, right?

36
00:02:04.764 --> 00:02:09.932
I've learned that actually clients
are terrible at delivering,

37
00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:12.063
in fact, people, right?

38
00:02:12.063 --> 00:02:12.919
We're all like,

39
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.043
I don't know why I'm singling out clients
like there are some freakish subspecies.

40
00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:23.262
As human beings, we are no good at
creating something from scratch.

41
00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:28.266
We are very good at taking something that
already exists and improving it, right?

42
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:33.480
So let's take the burden off
of our clients from creating

43
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.159
something from scratch and
we can do it ourselves.

44
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.339
Now that sounds everybody is now go, whoa,
especially this audience, developers.

45
00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:48.389
I mean, unless it's written in binary or
JSON, then they're not interested.

46
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.529
But honestly,
this doesn't need to be complicated.

47
00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.886
All I do, in most cases, if we have
done that information architecture work,

48
00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:59.394
we already have a list
of all the questions and

49
00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:03.104
all the tasks that people wanna complete,
right?

50
00:03:03.104 --> 00:03:06.594
So it's really simple from there.

51
00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:10.237
We know on any given page what
question that page has to answer,

52
00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:12.364
maybe multiple questions.

53
00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:17.760
So all I do is I write the questions out,
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang as a list.

54
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.375
If I have got a rough idea of
the answers to those questions,

55
00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.659
I bullet them out, right?

56
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.901
Just literally bullet points.

57
00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:31.609
If I don't, I ask the client, give us a
couple of bullet points for each of these.

58
00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.244
That's all and
normally that's not too bad.

59
00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:37.982
Or even ask them over the phone and
just fill it in, right?

60
00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:39.834
And then I take all of that.

61
00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:45.622
Yes, what I do with it, I dump it into
ChatGPT and I provide it with a load of,

62
00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:50.234
I've got a whole different
workshop on content creation and

63
00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:55.662
content management, but essentially
I drop it into ChatGPTand I say,

64
00:03:55.662 --> 00:04:00.389
draft me some website content
that answers these questions.

65
00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.616
And will fit in these kind of word length.

66
00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:08.472
And if I used bullets and headings and
stuff like that, and it churns stuff out,

67
00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:09.571
is that any good.

68
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:11.686
Probably not, I don't really care.

69
00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:15.812
It's better than lorem ipsum and
it'll get the client to respond to it.

70
00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:19.082
So that tends to be how
I do it these days.

71
00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:22.226
It takes me a quarter an hour extra, but

72
00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:27.157
for the sake of it,
it's probably worth it most times.

73
00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:30.527
It just makes it really hard to do
any kind of testing around usability.

74
00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:37.200
But soon as you get something,
because the devils in the detail in it

75
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.080
because you could say for example,
if you're testing a prototype.

76
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.431
And you're saying to somebody, find out
whether you're you've got dental coverage

77
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:49.660
for example, going back to what
we were talking about earlier.

78
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.566
It's like unless you've got content
that answers that question on the page,

79
00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:58.672
how are they gonna know whether
they're on the right page or not.

80
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:02.974
So it's so limiting in the amount
of usability testing you can

81
00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:06.792
do without content in there,
that it's impossible.

82
00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:11.114
Sometimes they lift content
from the existing site, but

83
00:05:11.114 --> 00:05:15.175
oftentimes it's so
bad that I don't want to do that.

84
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:19.241
And that actually even taking that and
running it through ChatGPT helps.

85
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:23.492
I'll tell you another really good app
these days for that actually, if you've

86
00:05:23.492 --> 00:05:27.679
got existing content, if the client has
given you content that's terrible or

87
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:31.254
an existing website content,
there's an app called Hemingway.

88
00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:35.791
And you can copy and paste the content
into Hemingway and for a start it'll tell

89
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:40.398
you how terrible it is by telling you that
it's got really high reading level and

90
00:05:40.398 --> 00:05:44.549
all the sentences are too long and
all the things that are wrong with it.

91
00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:48.829
But then it's got a magic AI
button that you can click.

92
00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:53.332
I think you have to pay for
the AI, but it's not a lot.

93
00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:57.924
It'll even go through and add sections and
put bullets in and bold bits and

94
00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.999
it really does clean it very nice and
it's a lot better than things

95
00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:07.073
like Grammarly because it is created
specifically for good web copy.

96
00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:11.049
It doesn't say that but the way
that it works is very web friendly,

97
00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:15.452
short sentences, not too many
conjunctions, all of that kind of stuff,

98
00:06:15.452 --> 00:06:17.667
but that's a whole other workshop.

99
00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:18.997
Yeah, go for it.

100
00:06:18.997 --> 00:06:22.940
&gt;&gt; So, now you've got
the information architecture.

101
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.690
&gt;&gt; Yes.

102
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.470
&gt;&gt; You're ready to present to the client.

103
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.490
&gt;&gt; Yes.

104
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.479
&gt;&gt; How do you present that?

105
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.197
How would you go through your presentation
about after I've done all this research,

106
00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:35.220
all this information and
everything that I've done?

107
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

108
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.700
&gt;&gt; That are, here those.

109
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.066
&gt;&gt; Right, two things.

110
00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:48.421
One is I never sign off,
which is very controversial.

111
00:06:48.421 --> 00:06:54.129
And the second thing is I kind
of present but not in a big,

112
00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:59.268
not in the old fashioned tada way, right?

113
00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:05.196
So this whole thing about signing
off a design, doing a big pitch and

114
00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:11.030
presentation, comes directly out
of kind of Mad Men era, right?

115
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.989
And it's fundamentally flawed for
a number of reasons.

116
00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:20.157
One is that it's based on this lone genius
having an incredible creative concept and

117
00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:23.087
then pitching it and wowing everybody.

118
00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:25.496
And I don't work like that at all.

119
00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:32.588
I have a process of testing and data
gathering that delivers a result, right?

120
00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.482
So I am basically drip
feeding the customer,

121
00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:38.384
the stakeholder along the journey, right?

122
00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:43.828
So as soon as I've done the information
architecture, I'll drop them in email and

123
00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:47.816
say these are the results of
the information architecture.

124
00:07:47.816 --> 00:07:52.052
This was the findings on the basis,
this is what I'm proposing.

125
00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:54.565
Unless I hear back from you,
I will just carry on.

126
00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:57.363
Then when I do the aesthetic,
here are the mood boards.

127
00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:00.767
These are what the tests that I ran,
these are the results that I found.

128
00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:03.304
If you've got anything else
that you would require

129
00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:07.141
me to test that you don't feel I missed,
just let me know, or I'll carry on.

130
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:11.680
This is the mockup that I've done and
I've done a five second test and

131
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.583
these were the things
that I've done on it.

132
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:18.036
If there's anything that you
would like me to clarify or

133
00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:20.831
to do additional testing on,
let me know it.

134
00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:23.560
And I just keep going like that,
step by step.

135
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.003
And so as a result of that,

136
00:08:26.003 --> 00:08:31.790
there's never a moment where
we have this big ta-da moment.

137
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.893
I'm taking them on the journey.

138
00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:35.859
Sometimes I'll send them a video,
I'm making it sound like it's all email.

139
00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:38.401
Sometimes I'll drop them a video,
sometimes we'll jump on Zoom.

140
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:42.955
But it's that process of just
going through thing by thing and

141
00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:48.135
just moving forward continually and
not asking them to assign it off.

142
00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:53.231
Because the minute you say sign off
the design, it becomes this big

143
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:58.145
moment in time where they've got
to get it right and they pick and

144
00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:03.439
pick and pick at it and you get
caught in this iteration hell, right?

145
00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:04.826
And it just doesn't work.

146
00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:06.003
And the truth is,

147
00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:10.409
the idea of signing off made a lot
of sense in the print era, right?

148
00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:12.795
Because once you ran it to print,
that's it, you're done.

149
00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:17.361
But if there's typos, if they decide they
want a slightly different color green,

150
00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:19.985
if they decide that they
want a different font.

151
00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:23.241
All of that can be changed quite
easily in the build stage.

152
00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:28.102
But in most cases, by that stage,
they've lost interest.

153
00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:32.257
When they first see the design,
because there's this initial shock,

154
00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:36.688
whenever you see anything design,
there's this moment of shock of going,

155
00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:39.126
that isn't what I had in my head, right?

156
00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:43.708
So then they'll start saying, can we go
with a Serif font or a Sans Serif font or

157
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.272
whatever, whatever their thing is, right?

158
00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:49.963
If you say, well, look, live with it for
a bit, we can always in the build.

159
00:09:49.963 --> 00:09:53.891
If you still feel like it will change it,
you'll never hear from them again and

160
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:55.687
you'll never have to do anything.

161
00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:58.858
But if you say you've got
