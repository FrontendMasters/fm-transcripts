1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.290
Testing existing websites or apps.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.999
So let's imagine now
you've built your new app,

3
00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:13.440
you've launched it, it's all working,
the world has seen it, it's rolled out.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.370
You're not done.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.280
And this is the biggest
mistake people make.

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.675
The best testing is once you've gone live,
nothing,

7
00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:26.977
no amount of usability testing
before you go live will

8
00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:32.291
replicate the real experience
of people using a real website.

9
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.321
It's always gonna be artificial.

10
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.211
It's always not gonna be as good.

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.280
The best opportunity to
improve an application or

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.264
a website is once that
website has gone live.

13
00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:44.782
Unfortunately, that's often
where all the money and

14
00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:48.776
time disappears because everybody moves on
to the next feature, or the next project,

15
00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:51.334
or the next whatsoever,
which is very frustrating.

16
00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:54.138
But there is a real opportunity here, so

17
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.611
it's worth talking about
just to wrap things up.

18
00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:59.705
So why?

19
00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:03.286
Why, post-launch testing and
iteration are crucial to success?

20
00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:05.772
Well, there's a couple of reasons.

21
00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:11.732
One is that, that's only when you see
real natural behavior at scale, right?

22
00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:15.189
So once a digital service goes live,

23
00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.544
we can observe user behavior
completely natural without

24
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:25.128
them worrying about being watched or
whatever.

25
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:31.535
We can watch sessions back for
all users at an unprecedented level.

26
00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:37.016
You can compare that to usability testing
where people know that they're being

27
00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:42.657
watched, you can only test a handful of
people, then suddenly you have the option

28
00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:47.521
to watch sessions of every single user
on your site if you had the time.

29
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.960
That is incredibly powerful.

30
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.957
And the second is that
it delivers results.

31
00:01:52.957 --> 00:01:57.839
Post-launch optimization
consistently delivers a dramatically

32
00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:00.157
improved conversion, right?

33
00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:04.059
I once worked on a website for five years.

34
00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:07.073
We didn't redesign it once
over that five years,

35
00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:11.641
doing a redesign where you throw
everything out and start again.

36
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:17.511
And we increased their conversion
rate a hundredfold, a hundredfold.

37
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.622
And it was a high base to begin with,
right?

38
00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:27.512
And that's through
post-launch optimization.

39
00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:31.557
Post-launch optimization helps
every kind of website, but

40
00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:37.012
particularly it helps those that are
e-commerce focused or conversion focused.

41
00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:38.264
But it can improve everything.

42
00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:40.242
It can improve web apps a lot.

43
00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:44.619
So what's the process that we
typically do, it's this, right?

44
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:52.669
It's basically a version of Agile and the
Agile kind of loop that you go through.

45
00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.189
So you start by identifying
your top problems, right?

46
00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.329
Why are things going wrong on the website?

47
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.209
What are the issues?

48
00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.646
Once you've identified those, you diagnose
the problems with that particular page,

49
00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:08.279
where the problem is occurring.

50
00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:13.258
You propose one or more solutions to
solving that particular problem, and

51
00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:15.959
then you test those solutions.

52
00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.508
And finally, launch the best
option out of those solutions.

53
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:25.868
And then you go back to the beginning
of the list and start again, right?

54
00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:26.698
Simple as that.

55
00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:28.845
That is it.
That's what you're doing,

56
00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:30.523
infinitum forever, right?

57
00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:33.341
So, let's work through that process and

58
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.488
break down what you do
at each of those stages.
