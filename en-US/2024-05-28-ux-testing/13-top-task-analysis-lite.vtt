1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.904
Now, I highly recommend top task
analysis if you could get to do it,

2
00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.984
but I'm gonna make the presumption
that maybe you aren't

3
00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:12.910
going to have the opportunity
to do it that thoroughly.

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.932
So what I'd like to do is introduce you to
what I've called top task analysis lite,

5
00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:18.451
right?

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.895
[LAUGH] Which is where I've gone through
and I've kind of hacked it around a bit.

7
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:28.418
Probably Jerry would freak out if he saw
what I've done to his lovely technique.

8
00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:32.578
And try and make it a little
bit faster to turn around.

9
00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:36.533
It's still not the fastest and
easiest thing to do, but I think now

10
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:41.209
we're in a position where the return on
investment of putting that effort in.

11
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:44.890
In terms of cutting dead debate and
arguments and politics and

12
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.947
all the rest of it, means that in
many cases it is worthwhile doing.

13
00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:53.554
And obviously, on smaller sites, it's
easier to do anyway because there's not as

14
00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.557
many tasks, there's not as many questions.

15
00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:57.281
So, here are my steps and

16
00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:03.617
what I recommend you do on each step in
order to establish your list of top tasks.

17
00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:05.787
Starts off the same, right?

18
00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:08.947
Start off by gathering a list
of potential tasks, right?

19
00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:11.844
Everything that people might wanna know or

20
00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:14.747
might wanna do on your website or
your app.

21
00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:17.500
And there's a whole lot of
places you can look, and

22
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.407
we've kind of touched on these already
in some of the earlier stuff where

23
00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:24.176
I was talking about looking
at existing material.

24
00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:28.466
You can look at existing user research,
testing, customer-facing stuff,

25
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.963
analytics, etc, right?

26
00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:34.950
So you look at all these sources, and then
what you do is you write a big-ass list

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.280
of everything that you think someone
might want to do on the website.

28
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.101
Now, that's quite our work, right?

29
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:45.976
That bit takes a little while to do.

30
00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:51.443
So, if you're really need to cut things
back to the point where you're on the edge

31
00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:56.850
of being pretty dodgy in terms of quality
of data, but let's go with it, right?

32
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.719
If you really need to cut back, your
other option is to ask ChatGPT, right?

33
00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.856
It's remarkably good at
brainstorming this stuff, right?

34
00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:12.392
So, and you can kind of get away with
skipping this stage, because later

35
00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:18.186
on we're gonna give users the option
to add in anything we've missed, right?

36
00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:19.943
So our list doesn't need to be perfect.

37
00:02:19.943 --> 00:02:23.195
It just needs to be a starting point,
right?

38
00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:27.170
So yeah, it's great to base it on a load
of research and that kind of stuff

39
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.055
to get our initial list, but it's not
the end of the world if we don't, right?

40
00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:35.085
We just need something to
start people off with.

41
00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:39.075
So, yeah, I'll just do a prompt like this.

42
00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:45.015
Somebody considering signing up for front
end masters or whatever the thing is,

43
00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:50.484
what tasks or questions you might
have when visiting the website?

44
00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:54.024
Write these as a list that we could
use as part of the top task analysis.

45
00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:57.654
Sure enough, it'll come up with a load of
perfectly reasonable sounding questions.

46
00:02:57.654 --> 00:03:00.237
Some of them you'll look through and
go, well, that's a bit rubbish.

47
00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:01.407
And so you'll get rid of it.

48
00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:06.689
It might inspire you to adds some others
install it yourself, but it's actually

49
00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.517
not a bad way of starting if you're
really are strapped for time, right?

50
00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:17.619
So we've got pretty,
let's say poor quality initial list, but

51
00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.231
it is a starting point.

52
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.296
So the next step in the equation
is to create a survey, but

53
00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:28.291
it's a particular type of
survey we're gonna create.

54
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.951
Well, what we're gonna do, is we're
going to use a tool called poll unit.

55
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.420
Now, there are other tools available, but
that happens to be the one that I use.

56
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.710
And poll unit, allows you to create a list

57
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.219
of options that people can either vote on,
right?

58
00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.447
Vote up, or they can add their
own additional options on it.

59
00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:58.421
So all we're doing is pre populating
it with some initial ideas, but

60
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:03.147
people could always suggest their own and
then other people can come in and vote for

61
00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:04.054
those things.

62
00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:04.964
Does that make sense?

63
00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:07.474
Am I making sense there, right?

64
00:04:07.474 --> 00:04:09.301
Kind of, yeah, okay?

65
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:12.701
So hopefully I'll be able to show
you it and make a bit more sense.

66
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.289
So, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
create a new survey on pole unit and

67
00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.186
then we're gonna populate that
survey with some initial tasks.

68
00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:24.755
So you can see on the right
hand side of the screen there.

69
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:27.141
This is one I created and
is running at the moment.

70
00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.830
What information do you need
from the network rail website?

71
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.404
That's the question that we're asking.

72
00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:38.225
And then I pre-filled it with a load
of ideas that ChatGPT came out with,

73
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:42.587
and my use of research came up with,
just to get people thinking.

74
00:04:42.587 --> 00:04:45.989
So sustainability information,
information for the media,

75
00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:48.308
what it's like working for Network Rail.

76
00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:51.480
Getting involved in community rail and
various other things, right?

77
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.392
So I just dumped a load of ideas in there.

78
00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:58.996
Doesn't need to be comprehensive,
because remember, if someone find

79
00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:03.906
something that isn't in the list,
then they can add it themselves, right?

80
00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:08.053
So, then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna ask users, we're gonna

81
00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:12.995
send this out to users and we're gonna
say, have a look through that list, right?

82
00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:17.164
If you find the thing that you want to
know, or the thing that you care about,

83
00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:19.326
click the heart and it'll vote for it.

84
00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:23.137
She will vote and
that will be your yes I want that.

85
00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:27.093
If you find it's not there,
you can click the big add idea button and

86
00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:31.937
put in your own idea and
then other people can vote on that, right?

87
00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:37.728
So, it's basically like, you get those
vote for a feature on an app sometimes, so

88
00:05:37.728 --> 00:05:42.802
you can suggest a feature and
the very top down, it's exactly the same.

89
00:05:42.802 --> 00:05:47.943
So you'd leave that running for
a while, you send it out to some users,

90
00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:53.228
or use a tool like askable to recruit
users to complete it if you need to.

91
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:58.248
You send that out and
you'll get back a load of results, right?

92
00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:03.508
Wonderful, so now we've got a load of
results of people that have voted for

93
00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:05.774
and suggested various things.

94
00:06:06.954 --> 00:06:09.854
And our job then, is very simple.

95
00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:13.714
We just got to clean up the results a bit,
because it will be a bit messy, right?

96
00:06:13.714 --> 00:06:16.984
What you'll do is you'll have,
for example, duplicates.

97
00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:22.825
There'll be somebody who has said I
want us to go back to the University

98
00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:29.793
of Florida example from earlier, somebody
might have put it in as health care.

99
00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:34.623
And somebody might have put health care
packages, or health care plans, and

100
00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.793
it's all health care basically.

101
00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:38.899
So you're gonna kind of
group those ones together.

102
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.102
And then probably you're gonna simplify
the wording a little bit as well,

103
00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:47.440
because sometimes they put in long things
like I want to know about healthcare

104
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.866
packages where you just need
it to sell healthcare, right?

105
00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:53.895
Yeah, so it's doing a bit of a tidy up.

106
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:58.753
Now, depending on how popular this has
been, that can be quite a lot of work.

107
00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:00.973
Going through and
tidying up those results.

108
00:07:00.973 --> 00:07:06.393
So once again, let's get ChatGPT to
do some of the hard work for us.

109
00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:10.725
ChatGPT turns out to be a really useful
tool for user research and testing,

110
00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:13.123
so I will be leveraging it a bit.

111
00:07:13.123 --> 00:07:15.599
So in this particular case,
what I basically say,

112
00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.843
I'm gonna give you a prompt, right?

113
00:07:17.843 --> 00:07:21.703
You'll get the slides, so
you can see this yourself later.

114
00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:23.293
I want you to act as a data analyst.

115
00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:27.393
The attach file is the results
of a top task analysis.

116
00:07:27.393 --> 00:07:31.358
So basically I've downloaded
the results off of pol unit,

117
00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:35.653
opened them up and I've narrowed
it down to two colons, right?

118
00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:37.083
It's got a load of other junk in there.

119
00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:42.496
I delete all the other junk and
it ends up being two columns, ideas, which

120
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:48.137
are the ideas that have been submitted or
I've added to the list and votes.

121
00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:50.732
So the ideas columns
contain suggestions for

122
00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:54.897
tasks users might want to complete
in this case on an HR website.

123
00:07:54.897 --> 00:07:59.456
And the votes columns is the number of
times the user has voted for the task.

124
00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:02.576
Please complete the following
steps in order.

125
00:08:02.576 --> 00:08:06.455
This is important, the wording of this
because I've done this many times and

126
00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:09.200
Chat GPT needs to be told
very specifically what to do,

127
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.416
otherwise it gets upset.

128
00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:15.407
First of all, simplify each
entry into the ideas column to

129
00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:19.766
less than three words while
attempting to maintain meaning.

130
00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:24.396
So that's where it gets rid of health
care packages and just puts healthcare.

131
00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:29.136
Step two, identify any ideas
that conceptually similar.

132
00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:33.228
So healthcare and
dental care, for example.

133
00:08:33.228 --> 00:08:35.248
You could argue those
are conceptually similar.

134
00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:40.002
Combined similar ideas into a single
row with a clear and concise name.

135
00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:44.477
Also add together the votes for
any idea that has been combined.

136
00:08:44.477 --> 00:08:46.367
So it'll add dental care and

137
00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:50.553
healthcare together into a single
thing combining the votes.

138
00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:55.173
Output the new list of tasks with
the associated combined votes as

139
00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:58.383
a new CSV file with the same columns.

140
00:08:58.383 --> 00:09:03.101
The goal is to end up with a simple
simplified list of less than 70 ideas with

141
00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:05.326
the associated votes, right?

142
00:09:05.326 --> 00:09:08.959
So we don't want hundreds and hundreds of
ideas, otherwise it's gonna be too big for

143
00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:10.886
what we're gonna do next, right?

144
00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:11.956
But about 70.

145
00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:16.805
So what you will see when
you've done that exercise is

146
00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:22.084
basically a list of 70 ideas and
the, the number of votes

147
00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:27.612
will be very much stacked towards
about a third of that list.

148
00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:31.116
It'll be like, imagine a curve
where most of the votes and

149
00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:34.128
then it tails off to this
long kind of tail, yeah.

150
00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:37.073
&gt;&gt; I'm missing one little part here.

151
00:09:37.073 --> 00:09:38.645
&gt;&gt; Only one?

152
00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.402
It's quite a complicated
thing to explain to you-

153
00:09:40.402 --> 00:09:43.469
&gt;&gt; So you've taken all your data,

154
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:46.991
you've put it into chat GTP first and

155
00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:50.285
then you put this-
&gt;&gt; Yes, so basically-

156
00:09:50.285 --> 00:09:51.349
&gt;&gt; How do you do that and

157
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:52.794
sequentially in Chat GPT?

158
00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:57.415
&gt;&gt; So, in chat GPT,
you need the pro account events,

159
00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:00.793
you need to pay a bit money, right?

160
00:10:00.793 --> 00:10:03.793
But you only need to do it for one month.

161
00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:07.893
And then it'll give you a little paper
clip next to the search text box.

162
00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.693
It gives you where you can upload a file,
right?

163
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.546
So it knows the file is attached,
does that make sense?

164
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:14.887
&gt;&gt; I didn't know that part about it.

165
00:10:14.887 --> 00:10:18.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, if you haven't used
the pro account, you wouldn't know.

166
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.743
I think Claude,
which basically is ChatGPT, very similar.

167
00:10:23.743 --> 00:10:29.240
I think that lets you upload a file on the
free account, in which case, use Claude.

168
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.148
It doesn't really matter, any large
language model will do the trick, right?

169
00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:38.048
So the great thing is that's gonna
now churn out this list of tasks, and

170
00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:43.029
you're gonna be able to see very clearly
what the top ones are bonus, right?

171
00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:48.043
So immediately you now know what it is
that the website's got to be built around,

172
00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:48.572
right?

173
00:10:48.572 --> 00:10:49.366
Yay, anyway,

174
00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:53.169
what you'll end up with is a list that
looks something like this, right?

175
00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:55.919
So the top third of the list
are gonna be your top tasks.

176
00:10:55.919 --> 00:11:01.127
Notice how it's slowly tailing off and
it goes down further until nothing.

177
00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:06.188
So most of the top third
of your votes are gonna be,

178
00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:12.347
really stacked towards a certain
number of tasks at the top.

179
00:11:12.347 --> 00:11:14.667
And those are your top tasks.

180
00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:19.514
Now, that might be enough for you, right?

181
00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:24.167
If time is tight, money's tight,
you might go, great, I know the top tasks.

182
00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:28.017
Now let me create an information
architecture around it, right?

183
00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:32.603
However, if you think there's
gonna be a lot of arguments

184
00:11:32.603 --> 00:11:35.693
about the information architecture,

185
00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:41.414
if you want to do something that's
a little bit more user-orientated.

186
00:11:41.414 --> 00:11:47.834
We can actually use those top tasks to
define our top-level navigation, right?

187
00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:51.942
And this is where it gets really,
really quite powerful, and

188
00:11:51.942 --> 00:11:56.394
you end up with an information
architecture that is rock-solid.

189
00:11:56.394 --> 00:11:58.726
A, it'll work well for users, and B,

190
00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:02.476
it'll be really difficult for
anybody to argue against.

191
00:12:02.476 --> 00:12:06.503
Not that I'm obsessed with
shutting stakeholders up, but

192
00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:08.846
sometimes it's needed, right?

193
00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:13.416
So we're gonna use top tasks to
establish our top level navigation.

194
00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:15.076
So why focus on the top task?

195
00:12:15.076 --> 00:12:19.447
Well, it's crucial that users can
complete their primary tasks and

196
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.859
those tasks are readily accessible,

197
00:12:21.859 --> 00:12:27.388
because they're the main actions people
want to do on the website, right?

198
00:12:27.388 --> 00:12:30.510
And it's imperative that the smaller
tasks don't get in the way and

199
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.892
stop you doing the top tasks.

200
00:12:31.892 --> 00:12:34.973
It's the old needle in the haystack thing,
you can't find the one

201
00:12:34.973 --> 00:12:37.903
thing you really want to do,
because of all the other clutter.

202
00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:43.820
So that's why we're focusing on top tasks,
but why top level navigation, right?

203
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.213
We're gonna start by looking at the top
level navigation, because there's been

204
00:12:48.213 --> 00:12:51.536
some really interesting research
done around this, right?

205
00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:58.758
If a user gets their first click correct
when they're trying to complete a task,

206
00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:05.602
they've got an 87% chance of
completing the action correctly.

207
00:13:05.602 --> 00:13:10.898
If they get the first click wrong, if they
start off by going in the wrong direction,

208
00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:13.072
that drops to just 46% chance.

209
00:13:14.492 --> 00:13:16.058
So that first click,

210
00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:21.604
in other words the top level
navigation is absolutely critical.

211
00:13:21.604 --> 00:13:26.434
So if we can build our top level
navigation around the main tasks that

212
00:13:26.434 --> 00:13:30.415
somebody wants to complete in your app or
your website,

213
00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:34.653
then the chance of them
successfully complete finding that

214
00:13:34.653 --> 00:13:38.401
top task is gonna be much,
much higher, all right?

215
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.338
So that's all logic.

216
00:13:40.338 --> 00:13:47.536
So how do we build a top level
navigation around top tasks?

217
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:49.817
Well, we do that with card sorting.
