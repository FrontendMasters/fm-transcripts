1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.885
Afterwards, once I've got survey results,
once I've got the interviews or

2
00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:08.821
if I've done one or the other, or
I've done a little bit of both or

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.486
just gathered consolidated information.

4
00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:14.734
Basically anything that I've got,
whatever I've got,

5
00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.665
I tend to turn into an empathy map.

6
00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:20.200
So an empathy map is a bit like,
very much like a persona,

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.791
I call it an empathy map so
that stakeholders don't go.

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.745
Well, our marketing department did a
persona recently, we don't need to do that

9
00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.920
now and of course their persona
doesn't give me anything I want.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.380
So I just gave it a different name and
suddenly everybody went, all right,

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.059
let's do that then, right?

12
00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.765
So he's a personian puppetry picture
of them in the middle you put their

13
00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:45.146
made-up name on it, and
then you just kinda list.

14
00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:50.374
What questions and tasks people have,
what pain points they were experiencing,

15
00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:54.935
what their goals were, what kind of
journey they were having overall.

16
00:00:54.935 --> 00:01:00.888
What was influencing them in their
behavior and what feelings they had.

17
00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:05.103
So it's a kind of summary of all those
things we talked about earlier or

18
00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:06.608
just put into a persona.

19
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:11.529
And I kind of use those for
my reference but also shoved them

20
00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:16.460
into presentations and
I referenced them as much as I can.

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.556
I've been into offices before at night and
taken down all the fun photographs

22
00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:23.655
corporate offices have
important people shaking hands.

23
00:01:23.655 --> 00:01:27.633
And big expensive buildings that they
have and I put up personas instead,

24
00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.566
which always gets me into trouble.

25
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.508
But it's a way of raising the attention
about user experience and getting people

26
00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:39.101
talking about it, but I get in trouble for
that so properly don't do that.

27
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:45.536
So oftentimes an empathy map is, I create
a few of them for the different segments.

28
00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:50.587
If I've got more time,
if I'm feeling super ambitious because

29
00:01:50.587 --> 00:01:57.524
I've managed to get a little bit of time,
sometimes I'll do journey mapping, right?

30
00:01:57.524 --> 00:02:02.984
So journey mapping is a bit like
a persona, it kinda shows you

31
00:02:02.984 --> 00:02:08.886
those persona elements over time,
if that makes sense, right?

32
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:14.152
So this can be really useful for
understanding, how your project fits into

33
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:19.765
other things or the steps that people
will go through during your your project.

34
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.902
This is a bit more of
a luxury if I'm being honest,

35
00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:28.075
if you already got your foot in the door,
maybe the last project you did personas.

36
00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:34.023
This one next time you might wanna do
journey maps, so what is a journey map?

37
00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:37.253
Well, basically a lot of people misuse and

38
00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:42.380
misunderstand journey maps cuz
really it's only a story, right?

39
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.322
Everybody starts thinking about
journey maps is we're gonna map

40
00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:46.398
the customer journey.

41
00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:49.854
Now you know, because every
customer has a different journey,

42
00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:52.928
everybody is different kind
of doesn't work like that.

43
00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:58.287
But what we can do is we can tell
a story of a hypothetical customer

44
00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:03.364
going through hypothetical
journey using our app, right?

45
00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:08.096
It's not gonna be 100% accurate, but
it will at least give us a sense of how

46
00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:12.417
things are working, so it basically
uses an archetypal user, right?

47
00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:17.466
So in the same way as a persona does,
because every user experience is

48
00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:22.879
obviously unique, but we're mapping
being a typical archetypal user.

49
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.914
And it's typically a very
oversimplified journey cuz people

50
00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:32.654
we're very haphazard in the way we work,
so for example,

51
00:03:32.654 --> 00:03:36.838
let's say typical e-commerce journey,
right?

52
00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:41.952
A kind of a typical e-commerce journey
from a customer journey map will say,

53
00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:45.586
you discover a need and
then you research the options.

54
00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:49.433
And then you shortlist the options and
you buy your option thing and

55
00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:51.227
you get it delivered, right?

56
00:03:51.227 --> 00:03:54.038
In truth, most journeys are much
more complicated than that,

57
00:03:54.038 --> 00:03:56.584
you recognize a need,
you don't do anything about it for

58
00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:59.041
six months because you've
got other things going on.

59
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.557
And then you research some options and
you couldn't find one quickly, so

60
00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:04.435
you kind of give up and forget about it.

61
00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:08.538
Then later on you remember the need again
and then you do some research again and

62
00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:11.834
maybe shortlist and your bookmarket
to come back to it later but

63
00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.344
never quite get round to it.

64
00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:15.910
So you're kind of pinging
all over the journey, and

65
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.249
there's no way you could show that
realistically in a journey map.

66
00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.456
So instead,
we do this simplified version and

67
00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:26.734
then finally you slot into that
some insights into the user and

68
00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:31.024
the journey that they have and
the steps that they go through.

69
00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:35.528
So you can see each of the steps of
an experience someone has gone through and

70
00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:39.187
the different things they're
experiencing along the way.

71
00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:42.940
And that helps you to understand
where your project fits into it,

72
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.406
what the project has got to deliver, etc.

73
00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:49.118
So let's give you a real example,
you remember earlier on I said,

74
00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:52.654
don't worry I'm not expecting
you to be able to read all this.

75
00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:57.346
Earlier on I said I worked with a mental
health charity that's a suicide hotline,

76
00:04:57.346 --> 00:05:00.678
this is the customer journey
actually produced for that.

77
00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:04.983
So basically, you can see along the top
the various steps in the journey.

78
00:05:04.983 --> 00:05:09.150
So you have a life event something
horrible happens in your life,

79
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.429
maybe you lose a job,
a loved one dies or whatever.

80
00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:16.900
Then you have a realisation you're
not coping in that situation that

81
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.148
you're struggling and
fInding life difficult.

82
00:05:20.148 --> 00:05:24.017
You then seek help,
typically maybe with friends and family or

83
00:05:24.017 --> 00:05:25.773
healthcare professional.

84
00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:30.509
Then the point comes where you make
contact with this charity in this

85
00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.846
which was called the Samaritans,
and you then receive help.

86
00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:39.307
And then hopefully after you've
received help from this charity,

87
00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:42.680
you recover and
you have a post-help experience.

88
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.228
So those are the kind of steps in
the journey and then if you go down

89
00:05:46.228 --> 00:05:50.994
vertically, you've got different aspects
that are relevant to that user journey.

90
00:05:50.994 --> 00:05:54.320
So obviously, how people are feeling
is a huge part of it, so

91
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.775
that's where you've got your emojis
with the different emotions around them.

92
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:03.359
Then you've got the questions that
a user is asking themselves, right?

93
00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:08.015
Or other people, then the actions
that they're taking, now on this

94
00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:13.329
particular journey we decided to add
weaknesses where we felt we the charity.

95
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:18.655
We're letting the patient or
I can't remember the proper term for

96
00:06:18.655 --> 00:06:23.037
it that's gone out of my head,
the user down, right?

97
00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:27.326
So it's a very useful tool in kind
of understanding the entirety of

98
00:06:27.326 --> 00:06:28.483
the experience.

99
00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:33.622
Now, you might be thinking this
all sounds quite like a luxury and

100
00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:36.893
more than I'll get to do on projects, but

101
00:06:36.893 --> 00:06:41.297
just to help you sell the idea
if you wanna have a go at it.

102
00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:45.328
The reasons that journey mapping is worth
considering is cuz it provides context,

103
00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:49.261
mapping the journey provides you the
context of the project you're working on.

104
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:53.496
You can see what happens before
the project deliverable and

105
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.872
after the project deliverable.

106
00:06:55.872 --> 00:07:00.772
It's great for identifying failings and
points of friction in a journey to

107
00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:04.127
help you understand where
things have gone wrong.

108
00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:10.487
So it's really worthwhile, so the front
end masters is a great example of this,

109
00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:15.257
you could map from first
discovering about front end masters

110
00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:19.295
all the way through to
being a regular subscriber.

111
00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:23.950
There'll be different friction points
along that journey from signing up and

112
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.676
the sign-up process through to seeing
which courses you've covered before,

113
00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:31.228
those are all potential friction points.

114
00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:36.108
I'm sure they're all perfect and
they don't exist, but

115
00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:41.498
that's the kind of thing that
a journey mapping would uncover.

116
00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:45.906
They're great for planning projects,
so, you can actually look at

117
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:50.632
a customer journey map and go well,
we're really rubbish at that stage.

118
00:07:50.632 --> 00:07:55.127
We need something to address that
stage of the journey there needs

119
00:07:55.127 --> 00:07:56.849
to be a project created.

120
00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:00.238
So it's a great way of kind of
defining future projects, and

121
00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:03.361
they're really good for
getting everybody aligned and

122
00:08:03.361 --> 00:08:07.162
understanding what the journey is and
what the experience is like.

123
00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:11.980
So they're a really good tool
if you can find time to do them,

124
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.152
in terms of how you do them,

125
00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:19.267
let's talk about the most stripped
down version of it, right?

126
00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:23.669
If you wanna have a go at this but
you don't wanna spend too much time on it,

127
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.523
you can do a workshop, right?

128
00:08:25.523 --> 00:08:29.253
It works so much better if you
can do it in-person workshop,

129
00:08:29.253 --> 00:08:31.384
I recognize that's a bit tricky.

130
00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:35.625
To map a journey, one journey is
gonna take you about three hours, so

131
00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:40.470
it's a half day workshop basically,
if you can manage that then it's great.

132
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:46.687
Often I kind of position, it as a kind
of alternative to a kick off meeting or

133
00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:53.422
an alternative to a meeting that you're
already gonna have if that makes sense.

134
00:08:53.422 --> 00:08:57.968
So if you're gonna talk about
the scope of the project for example,

135
00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:03.392
then you might be better off mapping the
customer journey than making up a scope,

136
00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:05.810
anyway, how to run that workshop?

137
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.627
First of all you wanna who's in
the room is really worthwhile,

138
00:09:09.627 --> 00:09:14.034
there are some people that are more
valuable to the process than others.

139
00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:18.732
So, I'll show you the thick people
that most want all the way through to

140
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:23.430
people that are your backups if you
can't get the people you most want,

141
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.941
does that make sense?

142
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:29.015
So sometimes you'll struggle to get the
ideal people in the room so you can kind

143
00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:33.170
of compromise down, so the best person
to have in the room is end users, right?

144
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.920
It can't do better than that,
it's their journey,

145
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.096
let's get them in the room doing
a customer journey math, but

146
00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:42.047
that can be a bit tricky to
find those people and get them.

147
00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:45.161
So if you can't get them,
get some customer facing staff,

148
00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:48.356
people who do customer support,
that kinda stuff, right?

149
00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:53.086
If you can't get them, then try and
get some people that have got

150
00:09:53.086 --> 00:09:57.825
data on user behavior and
know a little bit about user behavior.

151
00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:02.700
If all else fails, then try and get the
most senior people you can in the room,

152
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.230
right?

153
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.907
And that's because those people although
they probably don't know a lot about

154
00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:10.993
the user,
by getting them thinking about the user.

155
00:10:10.993 --> 00:10:15.366
Even the act of thinking about
the user will improve the quality of

156
00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:20.392
the product [LAUGH] so oftentimes you end
up with a bit of a mix of all of those.

157
00:10:20.392 --> 00:10:25.751
You might be able to get one end user that
you could persuade to come in for it.

158
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:31.920
And you might get one executive sponsor
and then the rest is people in between,

159
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.513
do what you can something is
better than nothing, right?

160
00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:39.719
You're so
gonna be bored of that by the end of this,

161
00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:42.788
then you've got to decide on the scope,
right?

162
00:10:42.788 --> 00:10:47.747
There are kind of two ways of doing
customer journey mapping, the macro and

163
00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:48.542
the micro.

164
00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:53.014
What it basically comes down to is if
you're gonna visualize the user journey,

165
00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:56.901
I mean, most user journeys consist
of like dozens of steps, right?

166
00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:01.011
And you can't put all of that
in a pretty info graphic, right?

167
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:02.886
You kinda got a narrow down and

168
00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:06.871
you can't really do a lot more
than kind of five steps, right?

169
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:08.538
If you start having 10 steps,

170
00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:12.677
it's gonna be a really complicated diagram
that no one's gonna understand and

171
00:11:12.677 --> 00:11:15.905
no one's gonna look at and
it's gonna be valueless, right?

172
00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:18.914
So you gotta kind of go, well,
I can only have five steps, so

173
00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:20.217
what are my choices here?

174
00:11:20.217 --> 00:11:25.295
I can either look very broad high
level at the entire journey or

175
00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:29.982
I can focus in just a part of
the journey that's related to

176
00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:34.104
this particular project,
does that make sense?

177
00:11:34.104 --> 00:11:37.525
So, if you're say for

178
00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:43.475
example doing a landing page, right?

179
00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:47.222
If you do the customer journey mapping for
just the landing page project,

180
00:11:47.222 --> 00:11:50.561
you would look at what happened
before the landing page project.

181
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:55.433
Couple of steps on the landing page and
then step after,

182
00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:58.034
if that makes sense, right?

183
00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:02.336
Or you could look at
the entire customer buying

184
00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:06.984
journey from end to end,
but at a very high level.

185
00:12:06.984 --> 00:12:11.380
So the very high level stuff works really
well for planning out projects and

186
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.257
finding weaknesses in
the overall experience.

187
00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:19.664
The drilled in level is great for
individual projects,

188
00:12:19.664 --> 00:12:25.656
so just pick your poison basically
depending on the context.

189
00:12:25.656 --> 00:12:28.738
A customer journey map basically
comes down to an Excel spreadsheet,

190
00:12:28.738 --> 00:12:30.053
which is deeply depressing.

191
00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:33.854
But you don't present it like that, but
that's what it is under the hood, right?

192
00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:39.336
So it's a series of steps and then
information you wanna know on each step,

193
00:12:39.336 --> 00:12:43.964
so your stages are the different
parts of the journey, right?

194
00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:47.604
So discovering a need, researching
your options, making a purchase,

195
00:12:47.604 --> 00:12:51.618
getting it delivered post-sales would
be a typical e-commerce one, right?

196
00:12:51.618 --> 00:12:55.778
Your ones will be totally different,
but you pick a series of steps.

197
00:12:55.778 --> 00:13:02.141
So you've got to decide on those,
then what you've got to decide on is what

198
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:07.400
you wanna know about the user for
each of those steps, right?

199
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.839
So typically you might wanna know things
like what tasks are they trying to

200
00:13:10.839 --> 00:13:11.401
complete?

201
00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:15.507
What questions do they have,
what touch points do they encounter,

202
00:13:15.507 --> 00:13:16.884
how are they feeling?

203
00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:20.828
What's influencing them and
maybe where things are going wrong,

204
00:13:20.828 --> 00:13:22.455
what weaknesses, right?

205
00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:26.921
Just to clarify something cuz it always
causes confusions, touch points refers to

206
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:30.389
any form of interaction between
the user and the organization.

207
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:35.237
So at different points in the journey
there'll be different touch points, so

208
00:13:35.237 --> 00:13:40.094
a touch point might be a website,
an app, social, email, in-store, etc.

209
00:13:40.094 --> 00:13:44.305
So some of the touch points will
be offline, some will be online,

210
00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:49.372
some will be within your app that
you're designing, others won't be, etc.

211
00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:55.600
So once you've kind of mapped out the kind
of rough structure of your journey map.

212
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.620
What you wanna know,
what steps to include in it,

213
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.557
then really for
each of the those cells, right?

214
00:14:03.557 --> 00:14:09.097
So like discovery tasks,
you're basically brainstorming

215
00:14:09.097 --> 00:14:13.876
ideas of all the tasks
somebody might wanna complete

216
00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:18.232
when they're in the discovery stage,
right?

217
00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:22.324
Which probably wouldn't be many because
you've only just discovered a need so

218
00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:24.837
you're not doing a huge amount,
yeah, right?

219
00:14:24.837 --> 00:14:29.537
But you might have some initial questions
like, can I make do with what I've already

220
00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:33.724
got, could I get what I've got repaired
rather than buy a new one, right?

221
00:14:33.724 --> 00:14:37.361
So there are potential questions
that someone might have, and

222
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.518
their touch points probably
aren't gonna have any yet

223
00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:44.377
because they haven't actually
interacted with the company yet.

224
00:14:44.377 --> 00:14:48.837
So you get the idea, so you kind of
brainstorm a whole load of things for

225
00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:53.008
each of those steps, yeah,
sorry, someone's got a question.

226
00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:54.152
&gt;&gt; I do.

227
00:14:54.152 --> 00:14:57.245
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So if the whole thing here is it's like

228
00:14:57.245 --> 00:15:02.783
a in-person workshop where you're talking
him through the user journey, right?

229
00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:06.818
So how do you pitch people
to show up to this?

230
00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:10.131
&gt;&gt; That's actually that's
a very fair question,

231
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:15.392
part of the time I piggyback on an
existing meeting, as I was saying earlier.

232
00:15:15.392 --> 00:15:20.254
And I'll say something like, well, instead
of it's just all having a meeting where we

233
00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:22.302
sit around and arguably about this.

234
00:15:22.302 --> 00:15:26.348
I have this exercise called
a customer journey mapping that maybe

235
00:15:26.348 --> 00:15:29.218
we could run through
that together instead and

236
00:15:29.218 --> 00:15:32.843
I talk about the advantages
of customer journey mapping.

237
00:15:32.843 --> 00:15:37.776
So oftentimes I'll piggyback on something

238
00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:42.707
that's existing, if I can't swing that,

239
00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:49.521
then I will invite people and
I will say, I often paint it as.

240
00:15:49.521 --> 00:15:54.566
This meeting will help
define the functions

241
00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:59.485
of the new whatever it is we're building.

242
00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:04.461
And this is your opportunity to express
what you think that functionality should

243
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.202
be cuz that's always a killer,
everybody wants their say.

244
00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:13.565
So that often makes them turn up,
other times you can't

245
00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:18.484
make it happen and
it is possible to do this online.

246
00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:22.605
And I use a slightly different
methodology to do this online,

247
00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:28.004
which I couldn't fit into this workshop
because otherwise it'd go on forever.

248
00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:32.004
But by all means,
drop me an email to Paul@bowagwill.com and

249
00:16:32.004 --> 00:16:35.333
I'll give you a presentation to that or
something.

250
00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:40.130
So you can do it online,
it's a bit laborious and

251
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.931
failing all that,
I give up on the idea, right?

252
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:49.427
I'm pragmatic I go, okay, so customer
journey mapping is not gonna work,

253
00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:52.185
let's do some empathy maps instead, right?

254
00:16:52.185 --> 00:16:57.081
Or other times I might go well, I really
need a customer journey map which is quite

255
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:59.395
unusual, they're a bit of a luxury.

256
00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:02.307
And I'll go, all right,
I'll have a crack at it and

257
00:17:02.307 --> 00:17:05.699
I'll send that around to people and
see what reaction I get.

258
00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:09.584
Cuz often people are happy to
criticize but they're not so

259
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:12.924
easy to get them to turn up to contribute,
right?

260
00:17:12.924 --> 00:17:17.131
So if you send them something, suddenly
everybody becomes opinionated about it.

261
00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:21.673
And I have used that to actually trigger
then having a follow-up meeting because

262
00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:23.291
I've got so much feedback.

263
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:26.171
I've gone well,
we really need to meeting about this and

264
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:29.353
that makes the meeting happen [LAUGH] so
it's a bit convoluted.

265
00:17:29.353 --> 00:17:32.539
But that's generally my approach, but

266
00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:37.408
it's not the end of the world
if you can't do it be pragmatic,

267
00:17:37.408 --> 00:17:41.828
something's better than nothing,
all right, cool.

268
00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:45.475
So as you're going through this,
you're gonna generate way more ideas

269
00:17:45.475 --> 00:17:48.062
than you could ever fit on an infographic,
right?

270
00:17:48.062 --> 00:17:51.435
It's not unusual sometimes
to come up with 30,

271
00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:55.224
40 questions just on one
step of the journey, right?

272
00:17:55.224 --> 00:17:59.079
You can't show all of those
on an infographic, right?

273
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:03.893
So what you then need to do is I just
do dot voting, I don't know whether you

274
00:18:03.893 --> 00:18:08.492
ever come across dot voting, but
basically I say you got three votes.

275
00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:12.208
You can either put all three
votes on one question that you

276
00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:16.481
think is a super important question,
or you can spread them out.

277
00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:20.848
And so everybody votes on which questions
come out the most and then I take

278
00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:25.301
the first half a dozen or however many
I think I can fit on the infographic.

279
00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:30.160
Because those are the top questions
that we wanna focus everybody on anyway,

280
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.661
and I'll come more onto that idea of
top questions and top tasks later.

281
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:38.165
So yeah, that's what I do with
customer journey mapping,

282
00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:42.089
it can be very useful sometimes,
but it is a little bit of a luxury,

283
00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:45.685
it's a little bit time-consuming and
difficult to set up.

284
00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:50.477
So it's one of the ones that I tend to
drop sooner rather than later if it's not

285
00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:54.786
working out, I'd prefer if I can to
do a little bit of upfront testing
