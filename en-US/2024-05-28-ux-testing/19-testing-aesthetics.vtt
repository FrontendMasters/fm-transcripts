1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.082
So that's the kind of
comprehension side of things.

2
00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:07.795
But let's talk about aesthetics,
because this is where

3
00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:12.211
the proverbial poop hits
the fan in a lot of projects,

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:18.907
because everybody has different ideas
about what makes good aesthetic design.

5
00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:25.272
So bringing some objectivity to this is so
valuable, right?

6
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:28.743
And this works a treat,
what I'm gonna show you.

7
00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:30.937
So, why don't we want to test aesthetics?

8
00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:33.121
Well, it's gonna lead to a better design.

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:38.050
Testing a design with users ensures
the design is compelling as possible for

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.136
that audience.

11
00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:43.643
It's gonna lead to [LAUGH] way fewer
arguments, which is my primary reason for

12
00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.944
doing it if I want to be honest with you.

13
00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.581
And then also it's more objective.

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:52.240
So stakeholders preferences should not
define the design direction, but so

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.036
often does.

16
00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.822
So testing provides some objectivity.

17
00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:00.637
So in this case, the rules around who
we test with are slightly different.

18
00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:05.815
You can't just use friends and family
here, and this is the only drawback with

19
00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:10.915
this approach, that you do need to use
a real audience here or as close to a real

20
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:16.024
audience as you can possibly get,
right, because design is so subjective.

21
00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:20.314
So use your primary audience,
if you possibly can.

22
00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:25.384
It's crucial that you use the actual
people and you take into account because

23
00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:30.073
people have different design
preferences based on their background.

24
00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.356
Also, I would try and go for
more numbers here, right?

25
00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:36.984
So where the other one you
could J test six people and

26
00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:38.892
you'd be in a fairly good position.

27
00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:43.272
Here Ideally you wanna get it out to
as many people as possible, right?

28
00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:47.570
And that's because you wanna avoid
statistical anomalies of some

29
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.557
guy who's got a particular problem with
a particular color or whatever, and

30
00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:54.338
it throws everything out.

31
00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:58.896
The more people you have, that some
guy is then swamped in the masses.

32
00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:04.100
So, it's a bit trickier to do, it's the
kinda thing you wanna send out as an email

33
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.549
to your target audience, existing customer
base, something like that, ideally.

34
00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:10.872
So, what you wanna do?

35
00:02:10.872 --> 00:02:13.189
Yeah, that's your biggest problem there.

36
00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.215
Beyond that,
everything is really easy to do.

37
00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:20.896
First of all, at the beginning of
the project, before you do the mockup or

38
00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:27.037
the style tile or whatever it is we're
gonna be testing with, you'll wanna get

39
00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:33.476
your stakeholders to agree the words they
want the design to communicate, right?

40
00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:37.366
No more of this, well it doesn't wow me,
because that's absolutely vague and

41
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.528
doesn't help in any way, shape, or form.

42
00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:44.469
You want them to agree,
we want the design to be progressive,

43
00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.184
liberal,, hippieish, whatever, right?

44
00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:51.582
Whatever words they want,
they need to express those words up front.

45
00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:56.743
Now, actually, there's an excellent tool,
if you do a lot of brand work, called

46
00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:02.075
brand deck, which is brilliant for helping
to determine these tools, these words.

47
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.398
So basically, people can pick from
a whole load of different words and

48
00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:08.682
they can say what they are and
what they're not and that kinda thing.

49
00:03:08.682 --> 00:03:14.006
So once you've agreed those words, those
words are gold dust, because you have

50
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:19.581
now got your stakeholder to commit to what
they want to take from the design, right?

51
00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:21.747
So, how then do we do it?

52
00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:24.941
Well, we've got a couple of
options of how we test this.

53
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:26.477
It's very much up to you.

54
00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:30.308
Personal preference,
how you're feeling that day,

55
00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:33.482
time of the year,
whatever rocks your boat.

56
00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:37.033
But option number one is a preference
test, this is the simplest and

57
00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:37.851
most obvious.

58
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:42.208
Preference test is an excellent way of
seeing how your design resonates with

59
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:43.033
an audience.

60
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.568
Now, this obviously works well if
you've got multiple options, right?

61
00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:51.144
Maybe you've done multiple style tiles or
multiple mood boards, but

62
00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:54.733
it also works with comparing yourself
with the competition, right?

63
00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.606
Yeah, it's really good to be able to
compare yourself with the competition

64
00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.886
because the big thing is,
the design doesn't look as good as X.

65
00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:04.284
They do it really well,
that comes up a lot.

66
00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:06.839
So, a preference test can help there.

67
00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:11.484
So, you can either test different
versions of your style title or

68
00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:15.375
mood board, or
you can test against the competition.

69
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.909
And it's so simple to run a game, right?

70
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.320
What you do as you upload your two
designs, maybe your design and

71
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.733
the competitions, or
maybe multiple style tiles or whatever,

72
00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:30.098
you can have as many as you want,
within reason.

73
00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:37.499
And then you ask them, which of these
designs is most hippieish, right?

74
00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:42.623
On which of these designs is most liberal,
which design is most doer, right?

75
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:46.779
So, you're getting people
to basically confirm or

76
00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.427
deny that your brand words work.

77
00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:52.698
So basically, they get a screen like this.

78
00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:56.242
Which of the following do you most
associate with the words dependable,

79
00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:57.936
accomplished, and responsive?

80
00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.061
If, right, they just select,

81
00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:04.012
and then you end up with results
that are like that, right?

82
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:10.071
Okay, version three it is,
pish push posh, job done.

83
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:12.433
No more debate, no more argument.

84
00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:14.114
Stare in black and white lit.

85
00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.019
Yeah, go for it.

86
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.364
&gt;&gt; And did they do that for mobile too?

87
00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:22.458
Yeah, you can do, yeah,
if that doesn't appeal to you, right?

88
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:25.415
Let's mix it up every once tomorrow,
we can do.

89
00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:30.511
Now, this one I like,
cuz of its name, right?

90
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.010
It's called a semantic
differential survey.

91
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.902
Now, it's really simple, but
damn does that sound complicated, right?

92
00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:41.793
That's the kind of thing that
impresses a client or stakeholder.

93
00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:44.657
Yes, I think we need to do
a semantic differential survey.

94
00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:47.723
So, you get brownie
points just by naming it.

95
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:54.410
So in this one, what we do,
is we basically, do this, right?

96
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.615
On a scale from formal to casual, right?

97
00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:01.082
Let's say casual is the brand keyword.

98
00:06:01.082 --> 00:06:06.444
On a scale of formal to casual,
how would you describe this design, right?

99
00:06:06.444 --> 00:06:09.697
Is it more or less?

100
00:06:09.697 --> 00:06:12.591
And there are various
versions you could do.

101
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.940
So another version is,

102
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.195
which of the following words best
describes your website, this website?

103
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:20.656
And they can select
whichever words that one.

104
00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:25.051
And the great thing is, common thing
you'll get back from stakeholders is.

105
00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.387
Well, I think the design is a bit boring.

106
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.815
All right,
let's put the word boring in, and

107
00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:33.004
see if anyone else selects that, right?

108
00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:35.004
Or it's only all a bit gray?

109
00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:38.607
All right, let's put the word gray in,
see if anyone selects that.

110
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:43.041
So, you can actually use it as a way
of responding to stakeholders and

111
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.412
feedback that you're
getting internally as well.

112
00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:49.105
Works really well, really quick to do.

113
00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:51.482
Get results back less than an hour.

114
00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:54.361
Shut up those stakeholders, right?

115
00:06:54.361 --> 00:06:54.967
Brilliant.
