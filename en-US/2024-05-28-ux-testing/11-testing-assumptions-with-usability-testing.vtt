1
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.709
Just to explain why I like to do
a little bit of upfront testing.

2
00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.714
First of all,
I like to do it to check assumptions.

3
00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:14.218
A lot of people come to you, we've
decided we want to redesign this app.

4
00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:15.215
Why?

5
00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.632
Cuz we think the app is rubbish.

6
00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:20.672
Okay, why do you think it's rubbish?

7
00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:23.897
Well, because we've looked at it and
it's rubbish.

8
00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:26.739
All right, well,
let's just check that assumption,

9
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.862
that users think it's rubbish, right?

10
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.558
So that often why I tend to
do a little bit of up front

11
00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:35.297
just to kinda validate the project.

12
00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:40.112
I also like to do at this point
because there's low cost to it, right?

13
00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:43.424
You don't need to build anything,
you're just testing what's already there.

14
00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:47.946
[LAUGH] So it makes the testing less
expensive and time-consuming to do,

15
00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.882
which is always a great thing.

16
00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.758
And then also, it can be quite a good
opportunity to do a bit of a SWOT

17
00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:57.222
analysis, a chance to identify strengths,
weaknesses,

18
00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:00.566
opportunities and
threats with what's there already.

19
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.831
So it's quite a good
opportunity to do some testing,

20
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.961
if you can crowbar it in and
get permission to do it.

21
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.393
If you do testing at this stage,
typically, I'm looking for

22
00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:11.718
the following things.

23
00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.017
Do they get it?

24
00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:19.033
Do people get what this thing is,
this app is, this website is, whatever?

25
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:20.829
Can they use it?

26
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.422
Fairly basic,
can they find their way around it?

27
00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:28.286
Can they find a particular
piece of information they want?

28
00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:31.854
Does it answer the questions
that they have?

29
00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.002
What frustrates them about it?

30
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.278
What do they like about it?

31
00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:41.009
That's all I'm trying to
find out at the beginning.

32
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.097
And if I do do that upfront testing,

33
00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:46.170
oftentimes I'll do it
through usability testing.

34
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.201
So this is typically where
I will test probably

35
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:55.461
three to six people, if I can swing it.

36
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:56.214
Three is a minimum,

37
00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:58.617
if you're gonna do less than
three it's probably not worth it.

38
00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:04.291
But if you can't do six, then fine, but
as we said, you get 75% of the problems

39
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:09.324
at three people and you get something
like 95% of the problems at six.

40
00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.338
So if you can do six, great.

41
00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:13.477
There's two ways you can do it.

42
00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:18.464
You can do facilitated testing, and that's
my preference at this stage, if you can,

43
00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:22.036
where basically you're guiding
users through the process.

44
00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:26.009
Asking them questions along the way,
what do you think of it, and

45
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.345
getting them to complete a series of
tasks while they're doing that and

46
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:32.748
speak out loud about that experience.

47
00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:36.538
And facilitated testing is
great to get to know users and

48
00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:38.884
understand the issues they have.

49
00:02:38.884 --> 00:02:42.338
Often kind of combine a kind
of user interview with

50
00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:46.873
the usability testing at the same time,
and do it as one session.

51
00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:50.508
And it's a great way of kinda
getting a feel for the project.

52
00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:56.107
If you can't do that because you haven't
got the time, right, because obviously,

53
00:02:56.107 --> 00:03:01.573
you've got to sit there and talk to these
people for 40 minutes a pop, probably.

54
00:03:01.573 --> 00:03:04.014
And then,
you might not have time to do that.

55
00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:08.610
So the other option is facilitated
testing, where users complete tasks

56
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.972
independently while being encouraged to
think out loud about what they're doing.

57
00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:19.128
And I'm gonna come on a lot more
about how to do these tests later.

58
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:22.332
The unfacilitated testing allows
you to test for more people,

59
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:26.260
because you don't have to sit through
every session, which can be nice, but

60
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.143
the insights aren't quite so deep.

61
00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:32.577
So upfront I don't tend to favor it so
much, un-facilitated testing

62
00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:37.474
tends to work better later when you've
got prototypes and things like that.

63
00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:40.948
But you do what you can.

64
00:03:40.948 --> 00:03:45.965
I won't say it again, but
you know what I would say.

65
00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:50.667
Alongside usability testing, I'll also
do a quick bit of monitoring, looking

66
00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:55.172
at the existing data that exists around
the site, if I can find time for that.

67
00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:58.309
So typically, I'll jump into analytics.

68
00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:02.734
And as I said before, I look at why users
are abandoning the digital services,

69
00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:07.627
the big thing I wanna know, then I'll jump
across into Hotjar and Microsoft Clarity,

70
00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:09.187
that I mentioned earlier.

71
00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:13.580
Which have got heat maps that can
show me where people are clicking,

72
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.831
how far they've scrolled,
all that good stuff.

73
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:19.962
That can often be really enlightening,
cuz you can go, well,

74
00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:23.982
people are already scrolling a third of
the page, no wonder they're struggling

75
00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:28.022
to find things or, why are people clicking
on this thing that's not clickable?

76
00:04:28.022 --> 00:04:31.605
That kind of stuff comes
out with heat maps.

77
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:35.941
And then if I'm feeling ambitious and
I've got a little bit more time,

78
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.192
I watch some sessions back, right?

79
00:04:38.192 --> 00:04:41.010
So you can actually watch
real users interacting,

80
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.917
as we were talking about earlier.

81
00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:48.068
And I will look particularly at
users that have struggled for

82
00:04:48.068 --> 00:04:50.492
some reason, rage clicks.

83
00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:55.134
Those that have abandoned the site early,
those that have clicked on

84
00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:59.455
things that are unclickable,
those that have caused an error or

85
00:04:59.455 --> 00:05:03.959
whatever else, and you sit watch
some of them, see what they did.

86
00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.437
There's gonna be a lot more
on this kind of live testing,

87
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:11.422
where you're testing something
that already exists later, but

88
00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:14.917
that's pretty much where I wanted to,
leave it for now.

89
00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:19.417
So that's what I tend to do upfront
on projects, a little bit testing,

90
00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.594
little bit getting to know users.

91
00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:25.243
Yeah, go for it
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I like these, there's

92
00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:31.022
a couple of things that I've really picked
up on, some tips, journeys, in particular.

93
00:05:31.022 --> 00:05:34.098
But I do wanna mention that [COUGH]
anytime I go into a project,

94
00:05:34.098 --> 00:05:36.950
I figure out the stakeholders,
as a mobile developer.

95
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.609
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I figure out what device they're using.

96
00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:40.295
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Are they Android, are they iOS?

97
00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.196
What version are they using?

98
00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:46.391
And kinda like, what colors do they like?

99
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:51.661
But I use that so that I know if I can get
them attracted to a certain feature or

100
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:56.852
what flows they're having problems
with with the current application,

101
00:05:56.852 --> 00:06:00.387
I can attract them to come
back into the meetings.

102
00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:02.643
Cuz I'll say, X is having these problems.

103
00:06:02.643 --> 00:06:06.614
Look at the flow, here's what's happening,
and we're trying to solve this.

104
00:06:06.614 --> 00:06:07.222
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

105
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:12.164
&gt;&gt; Knowing the stakeholders' devices has
helped me a lot to get them encouraged.

106
00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:14.336
&gt;&gt; I'm with you now,
you're actually saying,

107
00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:16.240
yeah, what the stakeholder is seeing.

108
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.187
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I get it.

109
00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:18.897
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:18.897 --> 00:06:19.957
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean-

111
00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:20.734
&gt;&gt; Knowing your audience.

112
00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:21.288
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

113
00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:23.090
&gt;&gt; Also knowing your stakeholder's-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.623
&gt;&gt; Device.

115
00:06:23.623 --> 00:06:27.442
And if they're not using a device,
for example, in a website,

116
00:06:27.442 --> 00:06:31.632
some people have preferences over
Safari versus Chrome or whatever.

117
00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:34.949
So trying to figure that out first,
because sooner or later down the road,

118
00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.064
they're gonna test it.

119
00:06:36.064 --> 00:06:36.718
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

120
00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:41.639
&gt;&gt; And they're gonna say, this is
a problem, and obviously, we miss it,

121
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.212
because we're so busy with the other
stats, but that part helps a lot.

122
00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.348
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I totally see where you're coming from.

123
00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:51.405
I mean,
obviously it could be a dangerous road,

124
00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:54.063
cuz you don't wanna just design it for
your stakeholders, but

125
00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:57.393
you're not suggesting that,
you're just suggesting it's worth knowing.

126
00:06:57.393 --> 00:06:58.941
Yeah, I totally agree.

127
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:03.813
Knowing your stakeholders,
knowing what makes them tick.

128
00:07:03.813 --> 00:07:08.719
The other thing I often, what is there,
every person within a company

129
00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.807
typically has a thing, a pet project,
a pet thing that they care about.

130
00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:18.145
They might care about revenue or they
might care about efficiency or whatever.

131
00:07:18.145 --> 00:07:22.452
And I just frame everything I ever
say to them within that context.

132
00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:27.498
If we do usability testing,
it will make us much more efficient.

133
00:07:27.498 --> 00:07:31.341
You're pandering to your audience, yeah,
we've got questions either online or-

134
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.153
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it's just-

135
00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:33.920
&gt;&gt; It's you again, is it?

136
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.564
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.

137
00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:38.238
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Just overall, I'd say that with,

138
00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:42.129
in Frontendmasters in general
maybe this is unique to us.

139
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.594
But I think whoever talks to
the customer at the most,

140
00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:50.137
whether it's customer service,
whether it's usability testing,

141
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:55.539
whether it's, any interaction with
the customer, customer interviews, etc.

142
00:07:55.539 --> 00:08:00.215
I feel like it has generally,
the biggest influence when it comes to

143
00:08:00.215 --> 00:08:03.506
meetings about what we're
gonna work on next.

144
00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:07.937
Or when there is a disagreement of
what we should build or whatever,

145
00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:12.757
it's like, if somebody frames it from,
well, the customer said this,

146
00:08:12.757 --> 00:08:16.751
they always win, [LAUGH] no matter
who in the company says it.

147
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:19.484
It's like, yeah,
if that's what the customer is saying,

148
00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:20.728
that's what we need to do.

149
00:08:20.728 --> 00:08:23.625
Rather than, I feel this or
I think this or whatever.

150
00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:28.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you'd think that would be
blindingly obvious, but it's not the norm.

151
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.009
It really isn't.

152
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.249
Most organizations, it's often the person

153
00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:37.945
furthest from the customer that
is making most of the decisions.

154
00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:42.282
The person that is the most
senior in the room.

155
00:08:42.282 --> 00:08:45.738
And the senior person is almost
always the person that has

156
00:08:45.738 --> 00:08:47.838
least contact with the customer.

157
00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:51.878
It's crazy, but it is the way it
is in most organizations, not so

158
00:08:51.878 --> 00:08:53.133
much with smaller.

159
00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:59.144
The smaller the organization, often,
the closer the founder is to the customer.

160
00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:02.493
But the bigger the organization,

161
00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:07.469
the less it's driven by
user-centric thinking.

162
00:09:07.469 --> 00:09:11.446
And you have to kind of really
enforce that in the culture.

163
00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:13.785
So take, for example, the UK government.

164
00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:19.010
The UK government,
when they set up their digital service,

165
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.236
they created a policy that said,
you cannot be a stakeholder

166
00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:29.680
on a project unless you have done,
now, let me get this right.

167
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.666
Two hours of usability testing,
you've been sat in the room

168
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:38.691
with the user for
two hours in the last six weeks.

169
00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:42.481
So basically, you were ruled
out from having anything, but

170
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:46.938
they had to really fight for that,
to enforce that kind of culture, and

171
00:09:46.938 --> 00:09:50.160
it's just not that common
within organizations.

172
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.862
I wish everybody was like you guys,
cuz that's the way it should be.

173
00:09:53.862 --> 00:10:00.390
So really, with this whole upfront
user research, if you're gonna do it,

174
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:06.306
keep it really lean, hike the cost
if you can, sneak it in if you can,

175
00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:10.903
but don't overdo it,
don't do it for the sake of it.

176
00:10:10.903 --> 00:10:16.006
But do take the time to identify your
audiences, have a good understanding

177
00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:20.462
of who they are, and very much
trying to understand their needs.

178
00:10:20.462 --> 00:10:24.404
And yeah, if you've got a little bit
more time and a little bit more budget,

179
00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:28.717
then consider doing some mapping of the
customer journey and some testing as well,

180
00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:30.029
if you can squeeze it in.
