1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
So, the big one is finding
research participants.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.071
We've already talked about that
as being a big problem, and

3
00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:11.920
I just wanna give you a very quick piece
of advice, some quick advice around that.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.466
First of all,
when testing usability, right,

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:20.146
there is little point with testing
more than six people, okay?

6
00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:27.292
Because the number of problems found
decreases dramatically beyond six people.

7
00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:32.002
You can see how it tails off based on
research by the Nielsen Norman Group.

8
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.962
So even if you just
test with three people,

9
00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:40.352
you'll still catch 75% of the problems
in the application, right?

10
00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.672
So you don't need big numbers.

11
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:47.044
And also, the other thing I would say is
you can test with anybody who has got

12
00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:48.882
comparable ability.

13
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:53.050
So when you're testing with usability,
you can use pretty much anybody.

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.824
You can use anybody who doesn't work for
the company,

15
00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:59.148
that isn't aware of the product,
friends and family are great.

16
00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:02.956
The only exception is if you're
aiming at people with specific needs,

17
00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:05.746
often like the very young or
the very old, right?

18
00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:09.223
So old people start getting arthritis
to get multi-control problems,

19
00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:12.846
vision problems, those kinds of
things will affect usability.

20
00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.785
But for
anybody in between those two extremes,

21
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:20.865
you could use pretty much anybody,
that's okay with usability testing.

22
00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.093
Is it ideal?

23
00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:23.480
Is it best practice?

24
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.185
No, is it pragmatic?

25
00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.080
Is it easier?

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.335
Yes, so my advice is, when it comes
to usability, you can use anybody.

27
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:36.783
One objection you'll get is, well,

28
00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:40.433
those people aren't gonna understand
the content on the website.

29
00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:46.363
And really, the big argument that I
make here is that any content we publish

30
00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:51.413
online should be accessible to
the widest possible audience, right?

31
00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:55.413
Because you need to keep it easy
to understand for lots of reasons.

32
00:01:55.413 --> 00:01:59.035
But you say, hang on a minute,
this website is for

33
00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:03.781
pediatric nurses or, so yeah,
it's got highly specialized.

34
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:10.901
Well, yeah, obviously it's going to have
some level of complexity and that's fine.

35
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:15.379
But there are, it's good arguments to
be made to make this as accessible to

36
00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.808
the widest possible range as possible.

37
00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:20.080
For example,
what if people are new to the sector?

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.930
What if you're a newly graduated nurse,
for example?

39
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.620
Or what if English isn't
your first language?

40
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.020
Or maybe you have some kind of
cognitive disability, like dyslexia?

41
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.684
So really, making the content
accessible to everybody, and

42
00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:40.988
at the lowest level you possibly
can is better for everybody,

43
00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:45.490
because everybody can process
the information faster.

44
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.258
So this argument that you will get of,

45
00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:53.620
you have to test with our exact
audience is a little bit skewed, right?

46
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.264
It is a valid point, but
you can make an argument that actually,

47
00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:04.242
there is value of testing even if
you don't have the exact audience.

48
00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:08.012
The only exception with
this is aesthetics, right?

49
00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:11.593
Testing how people feel
about a design is harder and

50
00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:15.862
you will need to represent
your audience more closely.

51
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:21.495
Because my taste, right, as a gen x,
middle aged white, heterosexual man

52
00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:27.655
from the UK is gonna be totally different
from somebody else's aesthetic tastes,

53
00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:32.071
from a different culture,
a different background, etc.

54
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:35.011
So in those kinds of situations,

55
00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:39.189
you do need to consider a whole range
of things like culture, social groups,

56
00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.583
psychology, personal experience,
trends, social economic factors, etc.

57
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:49.270
But that's only when you're testing for
the aesthetics, right?

58
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.160
The visuals of a design, and
maybe tone of voice as well with copy.

59
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.381
And in that situation,

60
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:58.730
there are recruitment services
that do an amazing job.

61
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.129
So there are many testing
tools that people can use.

62
00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.469
Which, will do the recruitment for you for
as little as a dollar per person, right?

63
00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.620
Which really is pretty good.

64
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.228
Or there's actually
a service called Askable,

65
00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:18.628
which will recruit people for
you for about the same price,

66
00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:24.474
bit more expensive, but they can use
whatever platform you want, right?

67
00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:28.949
So if your platform of choice for
doing your user testing doesn't support

68
00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.784
recruiting people for you,
you can just use Askable instead.

69
00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:39.294
One of the questions you often get asked
is, what can't we use internal people?

70
00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:41.699
Internal testing, they call it, right?

71
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.599
Internal testing does not work, people
have got to good and understanding of

72
00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.749
the organization, they've got have
a good understanding of the project.

73
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.029
But you can use friends and family, right?

74
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:56.329
Because they're outside
of the organization, and

75
00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.693
that's normally preferable to using
employees, or user JSON people, right?

76
00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:06.086
If you use employees favor those that
work regularly with users, so cuz you

77
00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:11.033
can say to them, well, okay, so you're
an employee, but you know your audience,

78
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:16.253
you you're working with them all the time,
pretend you're one of them.

79
00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:19.672
And you can,
I guess beware bias if all else fails and

80
00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:24.415
you have to use employees, just be
aware of those, the internal testers

81
00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:29.738
are gonna have a deeper understanding
of the users and objectives.

82
00:05:29.738 --> 00:05:34.036
And the very final thing I wanna
say in this kind of introductory

83
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:38.628
segment is I recommend you be
smart about your tools, right?

84
00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:41.867
If you work for a larger organization,

85
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:48.336
you will feel a tendency to get
a grown-up user testing platform, right?

86
00:05:48.336 --> 00:05:53.698
And there are the big enterprise
platforms like usertesting.com,

87
00:05:53.698 --> 00:05:56.293
Optimizely, things like that.

88
00:05:56.293 --> 00:06:00.857
But if you've already got those,
great, they're good platforms.

89
00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:05.241
I'm not criticizing them, but if you are
trying to get into usability testing in

90
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.818
your organization, you will immediately
hit a barrier, because these will go over

91
00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:13.705
a procurement threshold, you'll have
to jump through a lot of hoops.

92
00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:17.527
They're expensive, they're time consuming,
you'll have to go out to tender.

93
00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:19.227
It'll be a nightmare, right?

94
00:06:19.227 --> 00:06:22.107
If you work for a small organization,
these are too expensive,

95
00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:24.889
you don't wanna be paying for
them anyway, right?

96
00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.706
So instead I would encourage you
to use the tools you already have.

97
00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:32.288
Chances are,
if you're a reasonably big organization,

98
00:06:32.288 --> 00:06:36.675
you're probably already running
something like Hotjar for example,

99
00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:42.173
which has got heat maps, it's got session
recording, it's got surveys built into it.

100
00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:44.603
So there's a lot you can do with
the tools you already have,

101
00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.953
you probably already got Google Analytics,
right?

102
00:06:46.953 --> 00:06:49.503
There's a lot that you can learn from
looking at Google Analytics, and

103
00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:51.853
we'll come onto those
kinds of things later.

104
00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:54.995
But then there are also loads of
really great free tools out there,

105
00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:58.643
one that you've probably not
heard of is Microsoft Clarity.

106
00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:06.670
And it's basic very similar to Hotjar,
and I'll introduce you more to it later.

107
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.300
Amazing free tool, completely free for
you to use, right?

108
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.271
And you can store that on your site and

109
00:07:12.271 --> 00:07:16.413
you can get loads of great insights
just like that, for no money whatsoever.

110
00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:20.176
And then there's also a lot
of applications out there,

111
00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:24.339
they've got free plans that are great for
getting started and

112
00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.236
trying it out and convincing people of it.

113
00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:30.801
So there's Lyssna,
which is great for quick tests,

114
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:36.048
such as first-click test and
5-second test, they've got a free account.

115
00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:40.609
Maze, which is a great all round
platform for a variety of user testing.

116
00:07:40.609 --> 00:07:44.264
Free account, UX Metrics,
perfect for card sorting,

117
00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:48.169
free testing that information
architecture based stuff.

118
00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:52.344
Free account, Lookback,
which is my preference for

119
00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:54.982
facilitated usability testing.

120
00:07:54.982 --> 00:07:59.464
It's not free, but it's not expensive,
especially if you just want it for

121
00:07:59.464 --> 00:08:03.129
one month, but
you do some usability testing.

122
00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.186
So there are loads of great tools
out there that can make an enormous

123
00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.367
difference.

124
00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:11.689
And then the one I mentioned earlier,
Pollfish, which is great for surveys.

125
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:15.839
And unless they do the recruitment for
you, don't cost you a penny, right?

126
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:22.267
So to kind of wrap up this section,
I wanted to really kind of summarize what

127
00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:27.321
I've been driving at here, which is the
getting started in usable user research

128
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:32.623
doesn't have to be really time-consuming
or really expensive, right?

129
00:08:32.623 --> 00:08:36.496
That you don't need to wait for
permission, you shouldn't go looking for

130
00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:39.393
sign off on this stuff,
just start doing it.

131
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:43.482
You get to make all kinds of decisions
about how you do your job, right?

132
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:47.785
Nobody tells you, well, maybe people
do tell you how to code or design, but

133
00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:49.682
you've got a degree of freedom.

134
00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:54.202
Well, just make a bit of usability
testing and research a part of that.

135
00:08:54.202 --> 00:09:00.192
And you can achieve a huge amount without
asking for extra budget or extra time.

136
00:09:00.192 --> 00:09:03.122
And that's what we're gonna
get into as we go forward.

137
00:09:03.122 --> 00:09:07.643
And I wanna start with, well,
let's look at upfront research and

138
00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:12.164
testing, and what we really need to
do before we begin a project and

139
00:09:12.164 --> 00:09:15.657
what we can just dump or
do in a different way later.

140
00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:21.788
Before we move on to the next section, any
questions so far about what we've covered?

141
00:09:21.788 --> 00:09:26.771
Cuz I've kind of shared a lot
of theoretical stuff and

142
00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:31.877
a lot of, it might have left
you with a lot of year buts.

143
00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:38.092
Yeah, that sounds great, Paul, but, any
concerns, any questions, anything so far?

144
00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:42.817
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I really liked
about Working at General Mills was they

145
00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:47.544
had these one-way mirrors to look at
how people would get attracted to food

146
00:09:47.544 --> 00:09:48.310
products.

147
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.169
Cuz we were measuring is the Cheerios too
high up and no one's looking at that, so

148
00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:55.253
that's why they don't buy it.

149
00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:56.517
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

150
00:09:56.517 --> 00:10:00.760
&gt;&gt; Because placement of
the products on those shelves.

151
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.295
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

152
00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:05.124
&gt;&gt; For kids, we put the sweet stuff
down [LAUGH] on the bottom, right?

153
00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:06.297
And they're like, yeah, I want that.

154
00:10:06.297 --> 00:10:07.124
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:07.124 --> 00:10:11.451
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All the cinnamon rolls were
sold really fast that way [LAUGH].

156
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:16.167
&gt;&gt; That kind of stuff is amazing, that's
very much traditional usability testing

157
00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:19.700
is what they've done for years,
with us one way mirror, and

158
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:25.220
you can see what's going on, and you can
ask questions, and those kinds of things.

159
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.150
That's fallen out of favor a little
bit in UX design because it's

160
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.647
quite time-consuming and quite expensive,

161
00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:37.697
you have to have a special setup and
all the rest of it.

162
00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:42.130
But you can actually replicate quite a lot
of that very cheaply and very quickly, so

163
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.791
there's kind of two aspects.

164
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.157
There's the aspects of
talking to people and

165
00:10:46.157 --> 00:10:48.406
finding out what their preferences were.

166
00:10:48.406 --> 00:10:54.442
And then the other aspect of it is that
watching people do stuff in a natural way,

167
00:10:54.442 --> 00:10:55.571
right?

168
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:59.011
So the watching people do stuff
in a natural way, actually,

169
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:01.348
there are a lot tools that can do that.

170
00:11:01.348 --> 00:11:04.641
So Hotjar is is one example,
where it record sessions and

171
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:07.898
you can watch those sessions
back which is amazing.

172
00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:10.883
Then I mentioned Microsoft
clarity a minute ago and

173
00:11:10.883 --> 00:11:14.038
that does exactly the same for
free, right?

174
00:11:14.038 --> 00:11:18.638
And also you can do things like filter
them, so you could say, I only wanna see I

175
00:11:18.638 --> 00:11:23.679
want to watch people that have got
really frustrated and have rage clicked.

176
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:27.615
Or I wanna watch people that have tried to
click on something that's not clickable,

177
00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:29.900
that's another big one,
which is really good.

178
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.359
So that's the kind of
observation side of things.

179
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:36.157
Now, in terms of the kind of
questioning side of things,

180
00:11:36.157 --> 00:11:40.840
you can absolutely still do what's
called facilitated T-testing.

181
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.320
You typically would do that with fewer
people because it takes longer and

182
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.194
is more more time-consuming and expensive.

183
00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:52.517
But another option if you wanna do more
people, you could do something like

184
00:11:52.517 --> 00:11:56.976
surveying, which obviously in that
case isn't a conversation as such, but

185
00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:59.190
you can get bigger numbers out there.

186
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.310
So it's all about getting
the biggest bang for your buck, and

187
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.788
it's what you wanna
learn in that situation.

188
00:12:04.788 --> 00:12:10.888
Are you trying to learn whether
somebody spots something or

189
00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:16.263
whether they are getting
frustrated by something?

190
00:12:16.263 --> 00:12:19.169
Or are you looking to know
their opinion about something?

191
00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:21.143
Cuz that will affect
whichever way you go there,

192
00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:24.047
whether you watch session recordings,
or whether you do interviews.

193
00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:27.622
So it's about getting the balance and
picking the right tool for the right job,

194
00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.983
which hopefully will come
out more as we go through it
