1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.389
Right, once you've done your testing,
however you've done it,

2
00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:08.855
working with the results is really
important, it's invaluable but

3
00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:11.858
only if you actually use the results,
right?

4
00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:13.826
Again, there's no point
in doing testing for

5
00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.652
the sake of it unless
you can do something.

6
00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:18.742
First thing I do is prioritize
the issues that come up,

7
00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:20.633
the things that I've observed.

8
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.723
I prioritize them in three ways.

9
00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:26.450
First of all,
I prioritize them on the user impact.

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.005
I start by categorizing issues based
on their severity with a focus

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.574
really on the showstoppers,
the things that, okay, I'm done.

12
00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:38.426
If this was a normal situation,
I would've given up now.

13
00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:41.425
Those that you really wanna pay
attention into those, obviously.

14
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:46.171
The second thing you need to pay
attention to is the business impact.

15
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:50.777
So some of those issues will have
a bigger impact on the profitability of

16
00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:51.790
the business.

17
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.402
They might not be showstoppers but

18
00:00:54.402 --> 00:01:00.086
if someone is really struggling to
check out, that's fairly important.

19
00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:04.701
And then finally, effort, cuz there'll
be some things that okay, they're not as

20
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:08.608
big a deal but they're so quick to fix
we might as well kind of attitude.

21
00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:13.293
So you're balancing those three
different criteria when trying to

22
00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:18.070
prioritise everything out in terms
of how you're gonna adopt them.

23
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.245
The other often overlooked benefit of
usability testing is the huge impact

24
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:28.021
that it can have on culture and
your stakeholders and how they think.

25
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.814
If you want people to care
more about usability and

26
00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:32.943
care more about the user experience,

27
00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:37.354
if you can get them to watch a usability
test session, it will transform them.

28
00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:38.464
It is incredible.

29
00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:43.712
How many of you have actually
sat in a usability test session.

30
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:46.615
See now it's quite interesting, right?

31
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:53.351
And that's no criticism by the way,
most people haven't, right?

32
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:54.876
It changes you.

33
00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:57.458
That sounds so metaphysical.

34
00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.596
Yes, it's a life changing experience.

35
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:05.140
But it really does watching somebody
struggle with the thing that

36
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.179
you have made is the most demoralizing,
heart wrenching,

37
00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.254
awful experience but it valves you,
you vow, that you will do better.

38
00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:20.074
Because you really see the pain
in the frustration of people.

39
00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:25.732
So it's a really good thing to do,
even if you just sit in on one day.

40
00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:29.180
So we wanna pass this on to other people,
right?

41
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.544
So first of all,
encourage attendance, right?

42
00:02:32.544 --> 00:02:33.895
Get other people involved,

43
00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:36.942
if you're gonna run a session
don't do it behind closed doors.

44
00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:40.552
Well, obviously you don't want a room
full of people looking down and

45
00:02:40.552 --> 00:02:44.913
watching the attendee but if you couldn't
stream it online or something like that.

46
00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:49.024
In person it's great to even if they're
sitting in another room and you're just

47
00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:53.134
streaming it through to the other room,
really good if they can all sit around and

48
00:02:53.134 --> 00:02:56.780
talk about it, people get quite
animated and it's why did she do that?

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.459
And what did she mean by that and

50
00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.568
they're all bouncing it It
creates a great atmosphere.

51
00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:04.504
So if you can get people to turn up,
that is amazing.

52
00:03:04.504 --> 00:03:07.835
You can also stream it more widely
to people in the office and

53
00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:09.241
people can just tune in.

54
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:13.074
Some organizations I know have a big
screen like this one here, and

55
00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:15.820
they just have it on in the background,
right?

56
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.687
Really low volume and
it just plays in the background and

57
00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:21.194
it's amazing how much people stop and
watch it.

58
00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:24.375
And then you can also discuss
it with their attendees, right?

59
00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.400
Then you get them discussing the results,
what came out,

60
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.388
what they think we should do about it.

61
00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:34.413
All that kind of engagement works really
well if you can get people involved,

62
00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.596
but people are often
reluctant to get involved.

63
00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:40.968
So a kind of initial step, yeah go for it.

64
00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:45.799
&gt;&gt; And
what people would you want to be there?

65
00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.866
Or even are there some groups where
you wouldn't care to have them there?

66
00:03:50.866 --> 00:03:55.027
Are you saying that any sort of developer,
any sort of

67
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:59.177
administrative assistant, a stakeholder
&gt;&gt; Everybody.

68
00:03:59.177 --> 00:03:59.745
&gt;&gt; Anybody.

69
00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:07.371
&gt;&gt; There is nobody I would not want
to watch at least one user session.

70
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:12.278
There are some people that it's worth
their time to go more regularly and

71
00:04:12.278 --> 00:04:15.422
by the way I would include
developers in that.

72
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:22.342
Because I think designers can be very
snobby about it's our job to do design,

73
00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:26.389
it's developer's job to do development and

74
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.198
they've got nothing to add to it and
I call BS on that.

75
00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:34.220
I think developers are incredibly,
they probably in fact,

76
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.894
I've got an article on my site that
argues that developers impact the user

77
00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:39.748
experience more than designers do.

78
00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:43.805
In things like performance,
in things like error messaging,

79
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:46.186
in things like security, logging.

80
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:50.683
All the complicated interface elements
of many applications are actually

81
00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:53.979
designed by developers and
not touched by designers.

82
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.924
So I think developers play a crucial
role and should be involved.

83
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:03.124
And most senior stakeholders I
think should at least see one or

84
00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:04.914
two sessions it's good.

85
00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:08.744
Stakeholders if they're making
decisions about the usability and

86
00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:11.108
functionality they should be involved.

87
00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:13.353
Anybody really anybody
that's interested or

88
00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:15.547
any if they're not interested forced them.

89
00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.880
But the other very valuable tool if you
can get people involved in they are often

90
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.610
reluctant because everybody's busy.

91
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.987
They've all got loads of meetings,
blah blah blah.

92
00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:27.183
Maybe pizza isn't their thing and
bribing them with pizza didn't do it.

93
00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:31.460
Recordings, recordings are really
worthwhile and I touched on this before,

94
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.201
but I do just wanna touch
on it very briefly again.

95
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:39.023
Highs and lows, low light videos,
good things that happened,

96
00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:43.395
all of that kind of it show
edited videos of what went well,

97
00:05:43.395 --> 00:05:49.323
what went badly distributing that around
really valuable people watch that.

98
00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:53.248
Then they're more likely to come to the
next user session that you've seen because

99
00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:54.947
it inspires them and excites them.

100
00:05:54.947 --> 00:05:59.667
Also, I just crowbar clips into
every presentation I ever give.

101
00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:04.302
We all have a little clip to
show just to force people to pay

102
00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.437
attention to this stuff.

103
00:06:06.437 --> 00:06:09.679
So the prototype stage
is an amazing stage for

104
00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:13.443
doing kind of more traditional
usability testing.

105
00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:15.808
Yeah, it does take
a little bit more effort,

106
00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:19.747
especially if you're gonna do in person or
you're gonna do facilitated.

107
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:23.845
But it's absolutely worth it and do it at
that time before you stop building stuff.

108
00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.648
Once you start building stuff,
the cost of making changes shoots up,

109
00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:31.783
and nobody's willing to act upon what
they discover in usability testing.

110
00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:36.312
But if you do at the prototype stage,
the costs are relatively low for

111
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.353
making changes at that stage.

112
00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:42.575
So just to summarize,
prototyping would probably be the best

113
00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:45.997
opportunity to do your
testing that you can have.

114
00:06:45.997 --> 00:06:51.472
Remote unfacilitated testing is often
the fastest option facilitated in person

115
00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:56.554
does provide significantly more insights
if you've got the time to do it.

116
00:06:56.554 --> 00:07:00.337
So that's basically my attitude.

117
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.929
And yeah, but most of all,

118
00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:06.642
don't bother doing any of that if you're
not gonna make good use of the results,

119
00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:11.730
either through improving the service or
engaging with stakeholders, ideally both.

120
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.690
If you can do both of those things through
it, then you double the value of doing

121
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.732
the usability testing, basically
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about the dynamic of

122
00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:20.612
observers.

123
00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:21.179
&gt;&gt; Yes.

124
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:29.843
&gt;&gt; Now I can imagine that somebody who is
acting as the person doing the testing.

125
00:07:29.843 --> 00:07:30.638
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

126
00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:35.601
&gt;&gt; That they might be unnerved with
people in the room watching, and

127
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.047
if you've got like ten people.

128
00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:39.665
&gt;&gt; No, you mustn't do that.

129
00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.568
&gt;&gt; Okay.

130
00:07:40.568 --> 00:07:41.203
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Great,

131
00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:44.676
could you clarify then when you're saying,
okay, I wanna encourage observers.

132
00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:49.232
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry I got in a mess
when I was saying that.

133
00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:52.326
So let me repeat what I was
getting at much clearer.

134
00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:55.865
So in the room, if you're doing
inperson usability testing,

135
00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:59.219
there's the participant who's
in front of the computer.

136
00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:02.593
There is a facilitator that
will sit next to them and

137
00:08:02.593 --> 00:08:05.661
be their guide if you're
doing facilitated.

138
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.237
Then everything on their screen, okay, and

139
00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:14.319
the audio is being pumped through
to another room via Lookback or

140
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:19.399
Zoom or whatever you choose to use
into an extra room where you can

141
00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:24.316
have as many people sitting and
chatting as you want, right?

142
00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:26.593
So that's the kind of replacement for

143
00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:30.090
the old fashioned single way
mirror way of doing it where.

144
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.133
So no the most I ever have
sometimes I will have

145
00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:40.723
a third person in the room,
which is a note taker.

146
00:08:40.723 --> 00:08:45.711
But even that these days I very rarely
do because it's been recorded anyway and

147
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:47.760
I can watch it back afterwards.

148
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.430
But there are occasions where I know
if it's just say me doing some testing,

149
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.011
and I know that I'm not gonna be editing
the video down it's really just for

150
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.361
my own learning.

151
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.856
Then sometimes I prefer for notes to be
taken as I go along because otherwise I

152
00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.535
have to watch all those videos back,
right?

153
00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:10.798
So that doubles the amount of
time I'm spending doing it.

154
00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:14.322
So in those occasions,
it's worth having someone taking notes.

155
00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:17.632
It's very hard to facilitate and
take notes at the same time.

156
00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:21.978
I find anyway,
perhaps that's me, all right?

157
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.308
Yeah, go for it.

158
00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:25.403
&gt;&gt; I have a more general question.

159
00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:29.209
How do you manage expectations when
you're refactoring or remaking

160
00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:33.875
an existing product to remove the initial
shock and bias of things being different?

161
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:40.804
&gt;&gt; They're right [LAUGH] that's quite a
complicated question is the honest answer.

162
00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:42.790
So there are two sides to it.

163
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.283
There is the shock to
internal stakeholders, right?

164
00:09:47.283 --> 00:09:49.556
And then there's the shock
to the end users.

165
00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:52.897
I'm perfuming you're talking
about the end users there.

166
00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:55.837
&gt;&gt; You said that this bias
can come from stakeholders or

167
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:57.045
&gt;&gt; Yes, she did see I said

168
00:09:57.045 --> 00:09:58.384
stakeholders, right?

169
00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:01.683
With stakeholders it's easier in a way,

170
00:10:01.683 --> 00:10:06.308
because you drip feed them all
the way along one of the big.

171
00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:10.849
And this goes back to this ta-da moment
thing that's kind of been traditional in

172
00:10:10.849 --> 00:10:15.212
doing design, where the designer goes
away and does magic in a room, right?

173
00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:17.339
And then they come back and go, ta-da!

174
00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:18.861
Look at my amazing design.

175
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:21.753
And everybody goes that
wasn't what I was expecting.

176
00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:24.474
But if you have been
showing them wireframes,

177
00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:29.498
if you've been showing the mood boards,
if you've been showing them design comps,

178
00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:33.687
if you've been showing them prototypes
as they're being developed,

179
00:10:33.687 --> 00:10:38.477
then they're being drip fed all the time
and they're seeing the design evolve.

180
00:10:38.477 --> 00:10:44.036
And that is far less of a shock to their
system as they see it coming about,

181
00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:49.052
especially if you're building
alongside that a communications

182
00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:52.989
about why you're doing what you're doing,
etc.

183
00:10:52.989 --> 00:10:57.489
So one of the things I recommend with
clients that are doing big redesigns.

184
00:10:57.489 --> 00:11:04.040
Again, a universities is a great example
where there's basically hundreds and

185
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.760
hundreds of people across
the organization that are all go

186
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.673
completely lose their minds when
you launch this new site and

187
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:17.159
they go it's because you're wondering.

188
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.022
So what I do with organizations
like that is actually,

189
00:11:20.022 --> 00:11:23.023
I send an email to everybody
in the organization and say.

190
00:11:23.023 --> 00:11:26.983
If you care about the website,
sign up for our mailing list and

191
00:11:26.983 --> 00:11:29.509
we'll keep you informed as things go.

192
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:32.975
And I run in parallel to the development,
an entire comms campaign,

193
00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:36.825
basically saying, this is what we're
doing, this is why we're doing it.

194
00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:41.034
Here's where we're at now and
I keep I'm informed so when it goes live,

195
00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.215
there's no shock.

196
00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:47.796
Now, when it comes to end users,
it's a little bit more complicated

197
00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:52.333
because in that situation
there will be a shock moment.

198
00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:54.508
When you first launch a new website,

199
00:11:54.508 --> 00:11:57.888
oftentimes you break people's
procedural knowledge.

200
00:11:57.888 --> 00:12:01.915
So we've learned to do something
in a particular way, right?

201
00:12:01.915 --> 00:12:07.051
And even if that has been improved upon,
the fact that it's

202
00:12:07.051 --> 00:12:11.686
broken the way that we know,
means that we get upset.

203
00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:13.239
So there are several things you can do.

204
00:12:13.239 --> 00:12:16.510
First of all, is not panic, right?

205
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.777
Normally I say, ignore anything feedback
for the first two weeks, right?

206
00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:27.610
Every time Facebook redesigns,
everybody goes epileptic for ten minutes.

207
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.393
And there are Facebook groups created
complaining about Facebook and

208
00:12:32.393 --> 00:12:33.940
every just goes nuts.

209
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.080
But you give it two weeks and everybody's
over it because two weeks is about

210
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.968
enough time feel procedural knowledge
to adapt to the new interface.

211
00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.309
And at that point, you stop caring, right?

212
00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:48.445
So that's one thing but ideally,
you wanna soften the blow to begin with.

213
00:12:48.445 --> 00:12:50.440
So there are a couple
of ways of doing that.

214
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.937
But one of my preferences is
to actually open up a beta.

215
00:12:54.937 --> 00:12:57.589
So sometimes you'll go to a website and
it says, hey,

216
00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.623
check out the new version of our website.

217
00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:04.114
And you can click on that and off you go
to the new version but there's always

218
00:13:04.114 --> 00:13:08.618
a button that says I wanna go back to
the old version and you can go roll back.

219
00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:11.159
So techniques like that can help.

220
00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:16.653
But a lot of it comes down to stakeholder
management as you rightly said and

221
00:13:16.653 --> 00:13:22.516
preparing stakeholders for users flipping
out when you first change things.

222
00:13:22.516 --> 00:13:27.631
And I always tell stakeholders look when
this goes live every one of go nuts for

223
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:29.605
two weeks and then calm down.

224
00:13:29.605 --> 00:13:33.301
And just knowing it's coming gives
stakeholders a little bit more

225
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:34.758
confidence not to panic.
