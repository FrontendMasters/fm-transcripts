1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.641
Then there's usability, right?

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.288
We need to test usability
on our mock up as well.

3
00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:10.832
And believe it or not, even with a static
mock up, you can test usability, right?

4
00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:14.960
First of all, why are we testing usability
should be kind of obvious, but in

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.813
particular, I use it as an opportunity to
address concerns from stakeholders, right?

6
00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:25.039
So often they'll look at
a design mock-up and they'll go,

7
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.240
I don't understand how
the carousel will work or

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.813
whatever their problem is, and so
we can run a test to address that concern.

9
00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:40.610
Or for catching issues early, there might
be something that we just not aware of,

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.779
and we if we can catch it even on
a design mock-up that's really cool and

11
00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.228
also it leads to better products of this.

12
00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:48.471
Who do we test with here?

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:53.843
Well, now, we're talking about usability,
we can use anybody, friends and family.

14
00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:58.761
Again, anybody with the same physical or
cognitive kind of capacities as

15
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:03.858
our target audience of Fair Game just
not anybody from within the business.

16
00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:06.953
And our options to testing
usability believe or not,

17
00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:08.824
are the 5-second test again.

18
00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:13.298
We can use that again to see
whether people remember the right

19
00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:14.973
elements on the page.

20
00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:19.409
So by showing them the design for 5
seconds we can assess whether they got it,

21
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.943
whether they understood what it was about.

22
00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:23.749
Did they see a particular element?

23
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.733
If they cuz a stakeholder
is often worried,

24
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.051
they didn't see the call to action or
whatever.

25
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:33.153
And what stood out most on the page.

26
00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:37.058
But actually the one I most like
using when it comes to usability,

27
00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:38.553
is the first click test.

28
00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:43.003
Right, now, if you remember from when
we were talking about information

29
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:47.021
architecture, I said that if a user
gets the first click correct,

30
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:51.042
they've got an 87% chance of
completing an action correctly,

31
00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.883
as opposed to a 46% chance if
they get the first click wrong.

32
00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:57.899
So, in other words,
with just a static mockup,

33
00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.926
you can ask people to say
where they would clean.

34
00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:02.793
We were talking about this some way.

35
00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:08.989
So a first click test is a brilliant way
of establishing whether people will be

36
00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.440
able to navigate even from a single
mock up like a homepage, right?

37
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.960
Really easy to do.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.686
You write your question where
would you click to do X,

39
00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:25.844
whatever the area of concern is,
you upload your mockup.

40
00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:29.288
And they basically see
the mockup like that.

41
00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:31.847
And they click anywhere
they want to on the mockup.

42
00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:34.476
So if you said, how would you log in?

43
00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:35.959
They click that log in.

44
00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.425
They would click on the log in button.

45
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.521
It wouldn't do anything cuz it's just a
mockup, but that would record as a click,

46
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:45.499
and then you'd get results back, that
looks something like that, where you can

47
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.506
see everybody's clicking on that
particular fact, isn't the login buttons?

48
00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:50.666
It's the sign up button there?

49
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.856
But anyway, [LAUGH] I'm not
clicking in the same place, good.

50
00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:56.636
We know we're doing a good job, right?

51
00:02:56.636 --> 00:03:00.170
Really simple, results back,
pretty much instantaneous.

52
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.521
Now, you can string all of
these together if you want to.

53
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:06.206
They're all on the same platform, so
you can do a first click, a semantic

54
00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:09.729
differential survey, a preference survey,
or any of them you want.

55
00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.006
Just put them all together,
send them all out in one go, job done.

56
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:19.512
Incredibly powerful, because it'll
just cut through all the debate and

57
00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:22.011
the discussion with hard facts.

58
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:27.324
If you wanna go for extra brownie points
and really impress people if the semantic

59
00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:32.812
differential survey didn't blow their
minds, what about eye tracking, right?

60
00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.380
Now you think, no way, no way.

61
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.491
Eye tracking,
now we're in big bucks territory.

62
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:41.661
You've got to have headsets,
it's got to be all fancy.

63
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:44.042
Actually not these days.

64
00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:48.942
You can use a tool called RealEye,
which is capable of doing

65
00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:53.758
eye tracking with nothing
more than your webcam, right?

66
00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:56.268
Amazing, never used it.

67
00:03:56.268 --> 00:04:01.096
[LAUGH] cuz I've never quite
justified using eye tracking.

68
00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:07.044
But there is a spin-off thing and this is.

69
00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:10.315
I call this a spell checker for
designers, right?

70
00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.880
You know how your spell checker
sometimes gets it wrong, right?

71
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.435
But it's useful enough to be worth doing.

72
00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:22.272
There is something called
eye tracking simulation,

73
00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:27.110
and it is basically software
that's taken thousands

74
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.410
of hours of eye-tracking studies and
used AI,

75
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.786
machine learning, blah, blah,
blah, to predict to an,

76
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:43.685
I think it's to a 90% accuracy where
people will look on design, right?

77
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:48.439
And so what you can do, is you can take
your mockup, you can upload it, and

78
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:53.118
it will give you a heat map like the one
you can see on the screen telling you

79
00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:55.462
where people will look on the page.

80
00:04:55.462 --> 00:05:00.978
An amazing tool for quickly putting in
front of stakeholders and going, look,

81
00:05:00.978 --> 00:05:06.162
here is evidence that people are gonna
look at the right things on the page,

82
00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:06.759
right?

83
00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.071
Now, is it perfect?

84
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:08.958
No, it's not.

85
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.797
Is it really cheap?

86
00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:15.289
Yes, it is, $19 a month,
the last time I looked, right?

87
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.541
So, one month of it, and you can check
your design, and It's really that

88
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:25.816
I don't always pay attention to it
sometimes I upload the graphic and go.

89
00:05:25.816 --> 00:05:28.456
Well I don't really like those results.

90
00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:31.629
So I don't know whether I'm gonna
choose not to believe them and

91
00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.286
I don't show them to the client.

92
00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:36.856
If obviously the results backup
everything that I've said and

93
00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:40.573
done then it gets shown to the client,
but I'm fickle like that.

94
00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.216
But yeah, It's another nice
thing to have in your arsenal.

95
00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:45.510
The tool that I'm using
is tension insights.

96
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.561
If you wanna have give it a go, and
it will predict where people look.

97
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:55.679
So this is really gold dust.

98
00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:01.239
Being able to get designed sign off is
often the trickiest part of the process.

99
00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:05.611
And having some lightweight
tests that you can quickly pass

100
00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:08.240
by people to just get them on board.

101
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.691
Especially if you are looking
at a changing brand, and

102
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:15.610
that kind of brand identity stuff.

103
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.686
This is the point where you are setting
that brand identity, and so this is

104
00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:24.108
the point where you really need to kind of
buckle down and get some data behind you
