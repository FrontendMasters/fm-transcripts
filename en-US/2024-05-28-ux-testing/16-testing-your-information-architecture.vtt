00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.238
So, you've done all of this,

2
00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:05.662
however you've chosen to do
your information architecture,

3
00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:10.262
whether you've just gone saw that let's
get chatGPT to do the whole thing, right?

4
00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:15.178
Or whether you've gone or do some top task
analysis and then what this and that and

5
00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:15.916
the other.

6
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.759
The one thing I do recommend,

7
00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.940
however you end up with your information
architect is to test it at the end, right?

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.382
You could skip everything I've said so

9
00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.903
far make up your own information
architecture and just do this, right?

10
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:33.135
This is your chance to
validate what you've done.

11
00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:37.569
However you've done it, whether you've
used ChatGPT, made it up, done it

12
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:42.765
properly, whatever, this is your chance to
make sure that it's not completely broken.

13
00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:46.324
And we do that through tree testing,
right?

14
00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:50.817
So tree testing is super, super simple.

15
00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:55.728
It allows you to test your assumptions and
also if you've done any

16
00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:00.477
of the stuff before, like card sorting or
any of the rest of it.

17
00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.694
Those things that were
in the not sure group or

18
00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:07.758
were in the low agreement score group and
you're going,

19
00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:12.264
is it gonna work, etc,
now's your chance to test it, right?

20
00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:14.651
So what we're gonna do?

21
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:15.313
All right,

22
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:19.961
let's first of all be clear about the kind
of things we want to test in tree testing.

23
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.711
So three things.

24
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.688
Content with a low agreement score
if we've done card sorting, right?

25
00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:31.699
So if the closed card sorting ended up
with some stuff that you got, it was

26
00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:37.225
a bit ambiguous of where people should put
it, that is a great thing to test for.

27
00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.259
Second one is stuff aside to
the not sure category, right?

28
00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.407
Great thing to test for but

29
00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:48.593
finally also top tasks that have
been added into a subsection.

30
00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:52.775
So if you've buried one of those
top tasks deep in the site

31
00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:57.570
there's a higher probability people
won't want to find it and so

32
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.725
we want to test for
that so what I will do is.

33
00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:06.209
I will identify which
cards I'm worried about.

34
00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.254
Because it's got a low agreement score
because it's in a subsection when it's

35
00:02:10.254 --> 00:02:11.833
a top task or it's in not sure.

36
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:16.172
I try not to come up with more than about
ten of them because otherwise it becomes

37
00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:17.176
laborious to do.

38
00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:20.713
But I come up with about ten and
then for each one,

39
00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:25.823
I'll write a question that avoids
using the word on the card, right?

40
00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:31.274
So let's say dental care, right?

41
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:35.135
I would write a question like,
you have to go to a dentist and

42
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.852
you want to know whether you are covered.

43
00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:39.767
Where would you look, right?

44
00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:43.839
So haven't used the word dental care okay?

45
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.743
But I've tried to word it very neutrally.

46
00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:50.350
Again, Chatgpt can help you
with this if you're struggling.

47
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.626
And then that is the question.

48
00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:55.609
So let me show you how you set it up and
it will become clearer.

49
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.815
So first thing you do is you go in and
you create a task, right?

50
00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:03.014
So I put that quick question in right and
matter in this part case.

51
00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:07.084
It's got an example of imagine that
you want to update your credit

52
00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.982
card details where would
you find that right?

53
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:14.768
Great example of a question then what
I do so I create a new tree test

54
00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:18.957
to do that I input the whole
of the sites hierarchy right?

55
00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:22.733
So all of those sections, subsections
the information architecture I've created.

56
00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:26.150
I put all of that in so it knows that.

57
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.009
Then I create each one of my
tasks like the, for example,

58
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.574
the one about dental care or
the credit card details.

59
00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:41.062
And then for each task I set the proper
destination of where they should

60
00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:46.846
be looking, so it knows whether it's
the right or wrong answer, right?

61
00:03:46.846 --> 00:03:50.605
And then we send that out and
we get people to look at it again.

62
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.824
That is the most valuable thing.

63
00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:56.289
If you can only do one thing with
your information architecture,

64
00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.055
that is the thing you do, right?

65
00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:02.975
Things you're worried about that
people might not be able to find

66
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.097
create series of questions,
put that out and do that.

67
00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:11.165
And then when you look at the results,
what you're looking for

68
00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:14.638
is it will give you a screen
page like you can see here.

69
00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:18.878
Where for each task is giving you
the success score the directness and

70
00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:21.080
how long it's taking them to do it.

71
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.647
So the success score is fairly obvious
that's could they complete find the piece

72
00:04:25.647 --> 00:04:30.160
of information the directness is did they
go directly to it down the hierarchy.

73
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.088
Or did they wander around
slightly lost before finding it?

74
00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:37.365
And the time is how long
it took them to do it.

75
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:44.446
So that each time you want to pay
attention to the success score, right?

76
00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:48.243
And if they failed where they ended up,
right?

77
00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:49.605
And that's a critical one.

78
00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:53.170
So you can actually I don't know
whether you probably can't see it, but

79
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.514
basically it tells you
how many people failed.

80
00:04:55.514 --> 00:04:59.751
And you can click on that and it will tell
you where they ended up when they failed.

81
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:04.690
Right now, that is really valuable
because what you can often do

82
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.993
is one will stand out
way above the others.

83
00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:11.121
I see, everybody's ended up here, right?

84
00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:14.723
And then you can make a decision
either I'm gonna swap it over and

85
00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:16.667
put this content in that section.

86
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:21.282
Or again, you use cross linking
to redirect people back to where

87
00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:25.141
they're supposed to be,
so that's really useful.

88
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:29.213
The second thing you're looking for is the
directness and the route that people took.

89
00:05:29.213 --> 00:05:32.447
You wanna make sure people aren't
wandering around too lost,

90
00:05:32.447 --> 00:05:34.645
although a little bit of lostness is fine,

91
00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:37.833
as long as they don't spend too
much of their time doing that.

92
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:41.877
And it's always good to look at the time
it took people put a complete the task on

93
00:05:41.877 --> 00:05:42.445
average.

94
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:47.785
So very quickly, what about the problem,
so that you've done a series of 10 tests,

95
00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:52.850
and there are some problem ones there that
you struggle with for whatever reason.

96
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.324
When in most cases,

97
00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:59.983
it's just a matter of cross-linking
to where they should be going, right?

98
00:05:59.983 --> 00:06:03.586
You don't need to throw out your whole
information architecture every time and

99
00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:04.616
go, it didn't work.

100
00:06:04.616 --> 00:06:05.334
I'm doomed.

101
00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:06.942
I have to start again.

102
00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:09.595
Oftentimes it just comes down to, okay, so

103
00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:14.040
if people have gone to that section by
accident, I need to have a prominent

104
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.220
link on that page that sends them
back where they're supposed to be.

105
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.508
Most of the time that will do an answer.

106
00:06:20.508 --> 00:06:23.973
So that's really all I wanna say
on information architecture.

107
00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:27.755
And you can see that there are lots of
opportunities for doing testing and

108
00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:31.909
actually having that being driven by data
rather than politics and opinions and

109
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:32.973
that kind of stuff.

110
00:06:32.973 --> 00:06:39.263
Start with your information architecture
before you do anything else.

111
00:06:39.263 --> 00:06:44.193
Any prototype any design,
anything else is such a good way to begin

112
00:06:44.193 --> 00:06:49.312
a project because it helps you focus
on and identify those top tasks.

113
00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:53.635
So planning your information architecture
before you do anything else is really,

114
00:06:53.635 --> 00:06:54.755
really beneficial.

115
00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:59.735
And those top tasks can be used to inform
your top level navigation through your

116
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:00.953
open card sorted.

117
00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.473
And then your navigation
can be validated and

118
00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:07.065
expanded through the closed card
sorting and the tree testing.
