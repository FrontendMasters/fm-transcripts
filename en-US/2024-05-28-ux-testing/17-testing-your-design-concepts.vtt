1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's move on then to
testing your design concepts.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.634
Now, if you happen to work on smaller
projects, especially if they've got,

3
00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:13.634
you're creating a new website or maybe
doing a little bit brand, identity work,

4
00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:18.440
and that kinda stuff,
you're gonna love this section, right?

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.985
If you work for a large organization
that's got design systems and

6
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:25.275
stuff like that, this is gonna
be a little bit less relevant,

7
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.728
the next section is gonna be more for you.

8
00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:32.860
But if you live in a world where
you still produce design concepts,

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.048
right, design mock-ups, then I think
this is gonna be really valuable.

10
00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:43.374
So you know those times, it hands
a little bit less now than it did.

11
00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:47.902
But you've got a client and they wanna
see what the design is gonna look like,

12
00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.479
and so
you tend to do a high fidelity mock up,

13
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.213
it's not interactive or
anything like that.

14
00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:57.418
You just mock up a page, often
the homepage, or something like that,

15
00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:02.150
that you show to the client to get them to
buy into the idea and all the rest of it.

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.246
Well, that is an amazing
opportunity to do a little bit of

17
00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:13.618
lightweight testing that is just going
to make things so much easier for

18
00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:19.566
you, right, and
cut through iteration hell, right?

19
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:25.121
When it's like, my logo bigger and
I don't like that color green,

20
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:31.987
and and fill up all the whitespace and
all the other stuff that people spew.

21
00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.827
Get rid of all that,
replace it with a bit of testing.

22
00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:39.457
And people tell me,
I swear to you if you try this,

23
00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:43.438
you will have no iterations, right?

24
00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:48.166
And nobody ever believes me when I say
this, and until you try it yourself,

25
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.117
you will not have iterations,

26
00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:55.240
unless of course the testing turns out
that there's some fundamental problem.

27
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.018
But you will get design sign off so
much easier.

28
00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:02.165
And in fact, you probably don't even
need to ask for designs sign off, right?

29
00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:06.580
Anyway, okay, so
why are we testing design concepts?

30
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.223
I think I've almost oversold it already,
but let's kind of drive the point home.

31
00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:12.083
First of all, of course,

32
00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:14.675
if you test your design concepts,
you're gonna end up with a better product.

33
00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:19.223
Testing significantly reduces the chance
of developing something that's not fit for

34
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:23.632
purpose, a brand identity, or whatever
else that's not fit for the purpose.

35
00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:26.589
Second is,
it's gonna resolve disagreements, right?

36
00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.184
Testing can ensure momentum, right?

37
00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:32.052
And that's such a critical thing,
things so

38
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.852
often grind to a halt
with design concepts.

39
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:38.608
You mock up something,
someone doesn't like it, and so

40
00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:43.318
it starts going around and
then they start suggesting things, right?

41
00:02:43.318 --> 00:02:46.910
And so
you apply the thing that they suggest, and

42
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.809
then they don't like the suggestion.

43
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.800
But instead of saying no, that was
a bad idea, they then come up with

44
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.900
another suggestion that they think
might fix the first suggestion and

45
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.123
it turns into a nightmare.

46
00:02:57.123 --> 00:02:59.046
So, it resolves all those
kinda disagreements and

47
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.740
it's gonna save you money, right?

48
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.991
You, especially if you're an external
person working with clients,

49
00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:08.703
testing can identify issues early,

50
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:13.090
it's gonna reduce your costs,
it's just great, right?

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.690
So what are we aiming
to learn at this stage?

52
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.510
Cuz you think we've not
actually got a learning,

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.038
now we've just got a page, right?

54
00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:25.455
A single page, high fidelity mock up,
I mean, for crying out loud,

55
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.678
what are we gonna learn from that?

56
00:03:27.678 --> 00:03:30.270
Well, there's three
things that we can learn.

57
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.338
First, do people like it?

58
00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:36.322
Cuz that is the big thing,
stakeholders go, don't like it.

59
00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:38.651
It doesn't wow me,
whatever that means, I mean,

60
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.632
what you're supposed to do with that.

61
00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:45.085
Those of you who are developers do
not know how lucky you are that

62
00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:48.879
nobody cares about the quality
of your code, right?

63
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.293
Cuz it's true,
nobody understands your code, but

64
00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.251
everybody thinks they know design, right?

65
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.840
And if it doesn't, nobody goes,
your code doesn't wow me,

66
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.276
I mean, what are you supposed
to do with that as a designer?

67
00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:09.814
But anyway, so we're gonna establish,
do people actually like the design?

68
00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:11.601
Secondly, do they get it?

69
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.589
Cuz that's another, I'm not sure
our messaging is clear enough, or

70
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.014
I don't think people are gonna understand.

71
00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:20.484
What do you base that on?

72
00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:22.544
Mr. stakeholder, your random opinion?

73
00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:27.105
No, I showed it to my nephew
who didn't understand it.

74
00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:30.726
Yeah, your nephew's five, of course
she doesn't understand it, but anyway,

75
00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:31.834
I'm going off on a ramp.

76
00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.754
Can you tell that this is a bit that
I'm particularly passionate about.

77
00:04:34.754 --> 00:04:38.684
And then the third thing
is can they use it, right?

78
00:04:38.684 --> 00:04:41.764
Do they know that you
can click on growth or

79
00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:45.640
whatever random word that
the interface has got in?

80
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.680
So to test this, these three things,
we're gonna divide and conquer, right?

81
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.392
One of the big problems,
when you test a high resolution concept,

82
00:04:58.392 --> 00:05:04.941
mock-up, is that stakeholders get
all muddled in their heads, right?

83
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.874
They reject a design that
is a perfectly good design,

84
00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.791
cuz they don't like the color, right?

85
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:16.286
Or they reject a really striking branding
because the messaging is not right or

86
00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:18.181
it all gets muddled.

87
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:22.759
So what we're gonna do is divide
the aesthetics from the usability.

88
00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.469
We're gonna kinda test the two separately
through some really lightweight testing.

89
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.458
And this testing can be done so,
so quickly and

90
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:38.859
will make an enormous difference to
getting past the design mock up stage.

91
00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:44.516
The first is we're gonna test
a wireframe version of the design.

92
00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:47.970
And then we're also gonna test
a style tile, or mood board, or

93
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.406
whatever you want to call it, right?

94
00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:53.356
So one is the usability, right?

95
00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:56.623
And the other one is the aesthetics,
the color, the styling,

96
00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.036
the typography, that kind of stuff, right?

97
00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:04.442
And that means that we can separate
those two issues from one another and

98
00:06:04.442 --> 00:06:07.609
it will just make everything go smoother.

99
00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:13.009
So we're gonna start off
by testing the wireframe.

100
00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.359
Now, these wireframes need to
be reasonable quality, right?

101
00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.022
We can't just do blocky wireframes
where it's got no text in, or

102
00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:21.230
anything like that.

103
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.714
It needs to be a bit more than that,
it needs to be able to show,

104
00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:29.204
you have real text in and enough to be
able to understand the interface, right?

105
00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:33.574
But it doesn't need to be perfect layout,
pixel perfect or anything like that.

106
00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.539
A grayscale, basic wireframe,

107
00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:41.054
does the job of what you think the page
that you're gonna end up mocking up is.

108
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:43.351
So that's that, and
then we've got the mood board as well.

109
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:49.317
Okay, so all of these tests that I'm gonna
propose can all be done using Lyssna,

110
00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:53.733
and so there's a free tier of this,
so you can easily do it.

111
00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:57.289
And, let me be clear,
you don't need to do all of these tests,

112
00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.231
you just do the ones that are relevant,
right?

113
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:06.353
So for example, if you know there's gonna
be a big argument about branding and

114
00:07:06.353 --> 00:07:10.078
aesthetics, then do
the aesthetics testing.

115
00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:14.016
If you know people are gonna be really
worried about whether people understand

116
00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:17.194
what's going on,
then do the comprehension test, and so on.

117
00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:20.014
So, I'm not suggesting you
do all of these every time,

118
00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:23.323
although you can do if you want to,
cuz they're so lightweight.

119
00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:27.073
But yeah, again, do what you can.
