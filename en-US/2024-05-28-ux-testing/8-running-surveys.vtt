1
00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:03.257
Most of the time I fill in those
gaps just for the survey, right?

2
00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:08.170
I'm a great believer in surveys and
I use PollFish all the time for

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.834
this because I can get
results really quickly and

4
00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.887
I can define exactly who my audience is.

5
00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:20.550
I can say I want Welsh people
who pick leeks on a Tuesday.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.249
Maybe not that specific, but
I can pick the kind of people I want, and

7
00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.542
I just take those gaps,
those things that I don't feel I know,

8
00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:34.424
turn them into questions, shove that out,
and get people to respond.

9
00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.007
If I've got the money to do that, right?

10
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.111
If I don't have the money to do that,
I mean, normally,

11
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:43.700
I like to send out survey
to like 130 people,

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.384
seems to be a number I've randomly settled
on because it's a reasonably big number.

13
00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:51.618
But, of course,
when you go into that number of people and

14
00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.651
if I have a lot of questions,
that could be costing me $300, right?

15
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:57.670
Which I don't always have, right?

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.257
So if I don't have that, either,

17
00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:05.432
I'll get the client to send an email
out to existing clients if I can,

18
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:09.645
right, to their customers,
in which case it's free.

19
00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:14.009
Or failing that,
I might just test with ten people,

20
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.681
something is better than nothing,
remember, right?

21
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.137
A couple of tips if you
ever do run a survey,

22
00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:26.661
cuz people love to pick other
people's surveys apart.

23
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:31.391
So here's a bit of advice to maybe avoid
getting your surveys picked apart.

24
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.857
Generally, keep them short,
people abandon longer surveys.

25
00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:38.901
And your stakeholders,
they hear you're running a survey,

26
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.869
everyone wants to tag a question on,
right?

27
00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.059
So just don't tell them you're running
a survey, [LAUGH] keep it quiet,

28
00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:50.798
keep it stealth, get it out the door,
don't let other people interfere with it,

29
00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.192
keep it short, right?

30
00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:53.736
Ask actionable questions.

31
00:01:53.736 --> 00:02:00.217
So ask yourself what you can do with
the answer to that question, right?

32
00:02:00.217 --> 00:02:04.930
If you can't actually act on it,
probably don't ask it, right?

33
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.003
So people love to ask questions
that they want to know.

34
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:14.757
I feel I need to know how
many times people have used

35
00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:17.592
the service before, right?

36
00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:19.063
I've just made that up.

37
00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:21.567
But what are you gonna do
with that knowledge, right?

38
00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:25.031
Let's say people have
used it never before, or

39
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:29.101
they've used it five times before or
ten times before,

40
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:33.099
how does that make a difference
to what you do, right?

41
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.829
Well, maybe it does, maybe if
you've got a lot of power users and

42
00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.338
not many new users, you wanna build
your application more for power users.

43
00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:46.865
But unless you know what difference it
would make, what action you would take

44
00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:49.644
based on it, probably,
you don't wanna ask the question.

45
00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:51.096
Do you know what I mean?

46
00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:54.187
We spend so much time waste,
so much time doing

47
00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:58.798
user research that we don't ever
do anything with, so don't do it.

48
00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:00.814
I tend to favor closed questions.

49
00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:05.742
So, reviewing all the answers
to open-ended questions

50
00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:09.342
can be horribly time consuming, right?

51
00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:11.337
So if you ask a multi-choice question,

52
00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:13.755
you can instantly see which
one comes out on top.

53
00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:17.629
If you have that same question
as an open-ended question,

54
00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.125
you've now got go through 130
results trying to pick out trends.

55
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:26.579
That said, it's becoming a little bit
easier these days with AI cuz you can just

56
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.568
take the whole list, dump it into AI and
say, find me trends, [LAUGH] and

57
00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:34.447
summarize this for me, but
it's not as good as closed to questions.

58
00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.021
So I tend to, it's just cuz it's easier.

59
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:41.855
And then like I said earlier,
check your wording, it's easy for

60
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:46.122
there to be biases or poor choices of
wording, and AI can help with that.

61
00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:48.902
You might meet some barriers
when it comes to surveying.

62
00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:52.418
So I just wanted to kind
of flag those with you.

63
00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:56.181
Because it sounds like it would be really
easy just to throw survey together and

64
00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.603
get out the door, but nothing's ever easy,
especially if you work for

65
00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:00.473
a large company.

66
00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:04.249
Data protection is the big one.

67
00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.691
And so I always recommend,
keep your surveys anonymous, right?

68
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.431
Never ask people for their email
address or their personal information.

69
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:17.114
The minute you do, you're gonna run
headlong into compliance issues if

70
00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:21.582
you're a larger organization, and
everything will go into a hole.

71
00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:24.326
So just kind of avoid that if you can.

72
00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:27.615
The other one is is survey fatigue.

73
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:33.768
So, often the big thing I come up with
cuz I like to ask users stuff a lot,

74
00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:38.999
and I get hit with this problem of,
well, we don't like

75
00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:45.077
to send emails out to everybody all
the time, it annoys them, right?

76
00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:47.227
And so what I would advise you,

77
00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:52.442
if you don't have the ability to directly
email people because you work for

78
00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:57.026
a slightly larger organization
that got rules about this stuff.

79
00:04:57.026 --> 00:05:01.417
Then what you say is,
I wanna send out one email, right,

80
00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:06.542
asking people if they would be willing
to opt in to a user research or

81
00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:11.691
a user consultancy group, or
whatever you wanna call it, right?

82
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.899
And then you get people to opt in to that.

83
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.714
Now, you then end up owning that list,
which means you can email

84
00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:23.449
them from that point on, because they've
given you permission to email them,

85
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.085
that you're not annoying the client base.

86
00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:30.260
You're only annoying the people that have
said, I'm willing to be annoyed, right?

87
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.138
And you are the one that can
send the messages out, so

88
00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.375
it saves a lot of time and
a lot of hassle.

89
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:38.976
But of course,
that only really applies if you work for

90
00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:44.159
slightly bigger customers that have
rules and regulations about this stuff.

91
00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.303
The final problem that you'll come
across is poor participation, right?

92
00:05:48.303 --> 00:05:53.012
Especially, this is more of an issue
if you work for smaller clients, right?

93
00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:56.986
So you might get away with the data
protection thing or the survey thing,

94
00:05:56.986 --> 00:05:58.952
but this will come back to bite you.

95
00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.816
So, this is why I consider
using a platform like PollFish,

96
00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:05.531
which can recruit participants for you.

97
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:09.847
So this will get you a long way surveying,
the only downside of

98
00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:14.663
surveying is you don't get to meet
people and interact with people.
