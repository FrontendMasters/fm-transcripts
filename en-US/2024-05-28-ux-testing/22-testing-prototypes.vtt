1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.770
Right?
Let's talk prototyping.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.640
So now you may or may not do prototypes.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200
If you don't do prototypes, that's fine.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.380
Not everybody does them.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.030
If you're a smaller project,
then you might skip the prototyping stage.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.644
But if you do do prototyping,
there is a lot of good opportunities for

7
00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:19.450
testing here as well.

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.369
So, why bother testing with a prototype?

9
00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.379
First of all,
a prototype is it's realistic.

10
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.089
A prototype much more closely
represents the actual user experience.

11
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.302
And so it's a great opportunity to get
realistic results about how a user will

12
00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:34.869
interact with something.

13
00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.243
Second thing, it's interactive.

14
00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:40.747
A prototype provides an opportunity to
test where a user can actually interact

15
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:42.600
with something.

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.777
And I came across this recently where
we got mockups of pages in Figma,

17
00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:53.330
but we were spending so long trying to
explain how something would behave.

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.120
That in the end I just said, well,
let's build a prototype of it.

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.185
Cuz this is just getting ridiculous,
trying to explain everything.

20
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.731
And it's also really good for
longer journeys.

21
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.959
So, for example, if you've got a kind of
a series of steps or a flow that a user

22
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.798
needs to go through, like a checkout
process or something like that,

23
00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:14.971
where it's over multiple pages is
much better for that kind of thing.

24
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.159
So prototyping has it's
definitely has its place and

25
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.695
can be a really good
place to do some testing,

26
00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:28.442
tends to be slightly bigger
projects often, but it depends.

27
00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.472
So, what are our testing options here?

28
00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:33.762
Well, one option is
facilitated usability testing.

29
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:38.988
So in this, you basically sit down with
the user either in person or remotely and

30
00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:43.746
you ask them to complete series of tasks,
select a product that you liked

31
00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:48.674
the look of and buy it, right classic
e-commerce checkout kind of thing.

32
00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.944
And as they're going through it,
they'll go quiet.

33
00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.606
They won't say anything and
you're so what are you thinking?

34
00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:58.765
Well, they're pause at a certain point and
you'll go, why are you pausing there or

35
00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:01.635
they're pull a face and
you say what was that face about and

36
00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:05.232
things like that in order to encourage
them to express what's going on.

37
00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.601
The other alternative is
unfacilitated testing,

38
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:15.422
where participants are given the task,
but there's no moderator to prompt them.

39
00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:19.637
So they're encouraged to think out loud
during the interaction and it's recorded,

40
00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:22.186
so that you can watch it back afterwards.

41
00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:28.906
So both methods are perfectly valid, but
they've got their pros and cons, right?

42
00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:32.847
So unfacilitated testing,
where you just give them a link,

43
00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:38.716
they're recorded while they do the tasks,
but you're not there watching them.

44
00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:41.635
It's easier to run, right?

45
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:45.012
You can do it with more people because
you don't have to sit in on each of

46
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:48.909
the sections, intends to encourage more
natural behavior because there's not

47
00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.138
someone leaning over their shoulder
saying, why did you do that?

48
00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:54.502
And which is a bit weird.

49
00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:57.428
And you tend to get faster results, right?

50
00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:01.780
Because you can you don't have to sit
around waiting range for people and all

51
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.006
of that kind of stuff, you just throw out
the URL and they get results back quick.

52
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:11.088
So that kind of testing is really good for
what I call,

53
00:03:11.088 --> 00:03:13.731
is it working, testing, right?

54
00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:14.966
Do people understand it?

55
00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:15.686
Can they use it?

56
00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:17.796
Can they complete the tasks, right?

57
00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.363
Great for that kind of stuff.

58
00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:25.390
While facilitated testing, when you're
sitting with them interacting with them,

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.105
it's great because it's a more
guided interaction, right?

60
00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:34.145
So you can prompt them, especially if the
prototype is a bit junky, [LAUGH] right?

61
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.467
If there's bits that don't
really work very well,

62
00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:39.863
it's quite nice to have somebody
there that goes, yeah, that's broken.

63
00:03:39.863 --> 00:03:42.924
Don't worry about about it,
go back to the previous page,

64
00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.835
that kind of thing it's useful for.

65
00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:46.990
It's more adaptable.

66
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.249
So, in other words, you can as something's
going on, if they go and do something

67
00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.385
strange, you can kind of go with them and
and ask them why they're doing that and

68
00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:59.195
what they're thinking is and
kind of adapt to whatever they're doing.

69
00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:02.261
It's easier to get clarification cuz
sometimes people will say something out

70
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.969
loud and you think, well,
what did they mean by that?

71
00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.729
So it's good for that kind of thing.

72
00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:11.547
And it's great because it's easier cuz
you're sitting there looking at them

73
00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:16.295
throughout it, you tend to pick up their
nonverbal cues better than watching

74
00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:17.969
a video back afterwards.

75
00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:19.943
I don't know why, but
it seems to be the case.

76
00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:24.751
So I consider this better for the,
why isn't this working, testing,

77
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.172
[LAUGH] right?

78
00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:28.852
So, it's a subtle difference, but

79
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:34.782
unfacilitated testing will show you
whether something is working or not.

80
00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:39.097
Facilitated testing will show
you why it's not working,

81
00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:43.686
will explain what's going on clearer,
if that makes sense.

82
00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:46.678
So that's your choice,
facilitated, unfacilitated.

83
00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.898
But then there's also remote testing,
right?

84
00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:57.646
Do I bring in the people and sit them in
a room or me go out to them physically or

85
00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:02.698
do we just do it all online via Zoom or
some other option?

86
00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:07.783
Remote testing is great cuz you tend to
get a broader reach and diversity, right?

87
00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:11.703
Because you're not stuck with
geographic locations as a problem.

88
00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:16.612
It's also more cost-effective
because you don't have travel and

89
00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:20.359
you don't have to pay for
them to come here and all the rest of it.

90
00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:23.509
More efficient for
your scheduling or scheduling.

91
00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.184
What is it you say here,
well, one or the other one.

92
00:05:27.184 --> 00:05:28.054
&gt;&gt; Scheduling.

93
00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:32.133
&gt;&gt; Scheduling, anyway.

94
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:37.052
And also it's highly scalable as well.

95
00:05:37.052 --> 00:05:40.379
You could do a lot of
different people quite easily.

96
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:45.055
The downside of remote testing
is you can have technical issues

97
00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:47.833
where somebody gets stuck
trying to use the kit and

98
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:52.084
you're not there to help them, and
you see you can have problems like that.

99
00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:54.747
You get limited control
over your test environment,

100
00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:58.969
which sometimes can be a good thing and
sometimes it can be a bad thing.

101
00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.831
So what I mean by that is sometimes
say you're doing a mobile testing, for

102
00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:06.835
example, they might have some obscure
phone that most people won't have.

103
00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.938
And so you don't have control over that,
and that's kind of sucks.

104
00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:12.129
But on the other hand is kind
of more realistic if you don't

105
00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.988
have control of them.

106
00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:17.634
I did a great usability testing once where
the woman was doing a whole usability

107
00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:20.662
testing with a toddler sitting on her lap,
right,

108
00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:23.077
which is what happens in the real world.

109
00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:25.287
So it was kind of quite
interesting in a way.

110
00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:31.185
Non-verbal cues are harder
to pick up when it's remote.

111
00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:36.468
And there are much more examples of
potential distractions like toddlers and

112
00:06:36.468 --> 00:06:39.727
cats and doorbells going and
things like that.

113
00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:42.566
So use pros and cons on it.

114
00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:48.646
Most of the time these days I do
facilitated remote usability testing.

115
00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:53.106
It's quicker, it's faster,

116
00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:57.903
I can get more people, I'm lazy.

117
00:06:57.903 --> 00:07:02.671
It just depends on the project and
it depends on the budget and

118
00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:04.272
that kind of stuff.

119
00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:09.499
Just by contrast, in-person testing,
you get richer qualitative feedback.

120
00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:13.984
So you get to meet the person and see the
person, and even what they're wearing and

121
00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:18.274
what shoes they've got on, and it all
builds up a picture of who somebody is.

122
00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:21.473
The best is if you go to their place,
their house.

123
00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:25.849
Then also there's in-person testing, you
can control the environment if they come

124
00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:30.119
to you, you can have everything set up,
although that can backfire on you as well.

125
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.715
We once did a testing, we had a big iMac
there with the mouse to the keyboard all

126
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:39.382
set up for them to do the testing, and we
were testing old people and none of them

127
00:07:39.382 --> 00:07:44.371
knew how to use a mouse because they'd
all been given laptops with trackpads.

128
00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:48.391
And so that kind of screwed the whole
day's testing cuz we weren't letting them

129
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:50.331
use their own equipment.

130
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.011
Anyway, that's another story.

131
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:57.241
You get better engagement through
in-person testing, which I love.

132
00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:01.764
You kind of can relax people and
get them on board a bit more,

133
00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:06.311
you can get immediate clarification,
but it costs more.

134
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:09.914
There are geographic limitations,
there are scheduling challenges,

135
00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:11.512
there are scalability issues.

136
00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:15.646
I would love to do in-person
usability testing more than I do,

137
00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:19.091
it just doesn't happen a lot of the time.

138
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.217
So either way,
whatever kind of testing you do,

139
00:08:22.217 --> 00:08:26.033
it's more important what you're testing,
right?

140
00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:29.546
You've got a prototype,
you wanna do some usability testing, and

141
00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:33.713
usability testing is normally the best
way to go on a prototype stage.

142
00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.543
What are you trying to look for?

143
00:08:35.543 --> 00:08:40.011
Well, you're trying to establish how
easy it is for users to navigate and

144
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:41.751
understand the prototype.

145
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.081
So it's about easy to use,
kind of obvious really, isn't it?

146
00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:49.771
I'm gonna do usability testing and
see if it's easy to use.

147
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.231
Navigation is the other big one.

148
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:55.471
Is prototype easy to navigate?

149
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.021
Are they logical and
consistently placed to people?

150
00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.236
Are they where people expect them to be?

151
00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:05.856
Then there's learnability stuff, how fast
do new users understand the prototype and

152
00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:07.367
pick it up?

153
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:11.659
Sometimes if you find yourself having
to clarify a lot of things, or

154
00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:17.477
they sit there kind of looking at it, or
you know that things are not going well.

155
00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:22.895
Then there's efficiency,
how efficiently tasks are to complete.

156
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:27.555
This is particularly important if you're
building an app that people use regularly.

157
00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:33.586
So, for example, at the moment I'm working
with an insurance company where you've

158
00:09:33.586 --> 00:09:39.245
got underwriters assessing hundreds and
hundreds of assurance claims.

159
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.177
And they're going through these
one after another, so obviously,

160
00:09:42.177 --> 00:09:44.551
it's really important that
they can do that quickly and

161
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.959
efficiently without too many clicks and
stuff.

162
00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:51.594
And they let if you haven't got it right,
I can tell you that.

163
00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:53.539
There is satisfaction.

164
00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:57.348
How likely are users to use
the prototype if it was a real product.

165
00:09:57.348 --> 00:09:59.988
You can actually ask them that.

166
00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:04.638
You can look at things like accessibility
as well with screen readers,

167
00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:09.301
keyboard navigation, different
mobile devices is another good one.

168
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:11.028
It's all kinds of different things there.

169
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.345
Content comprehensibility.

170
00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:14.375
Is that a word?

171
00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:16.075
Is word, isn't it?

172
00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.063
Is the text content easy to read and
to understand,

173
00:10:19.063 --> 00:10:23.465
that's another great opportunity
to do that with prototyping.

174
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:26.646
Then there's things like I spend a lot
of time testing conversion paths, so

175
00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.125
I do a lot of conversion
rate optimization work.

176
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:32.965
So checkout processes,
contact forms, that kind of thing.

177
00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.299
They're great.

178
00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:37.402
When you get a user interacting,
like with data entry or

179
00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:40.715
something like that,
that's when things often go wrong.

180
00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.625
So they're always a really
good point to look at.

181
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:46.369
And indeed, any interactivity,

182
00:10:46.369 --> 00:10:50.725
how error handling is often
a really interesting one.

183
00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:55.495
When people make mistakes in an interface,
how the interface adapts to that.

184
00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:57.585
So there's loads of different
things you can test.

185
00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:01.933
What you test is largely what you're
worried about, is what it boils down to.

186
00:11:01.933 --> 00:11:05.785
What are the bits of the interface
that you're worried about?

187
00:11:05.785 --> 00:11:10.643
And again, don't run usability
testing just for the sake of it.

188
00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:14.193
Run it when you've got questions and
concerns, that's the moment to do it.

189
00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:18.186
When you think, I'm a little bit unsure
about this, or someone else is unsure

190
00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:21.890
about it, that's when you wanna jump
in and do some usability testing.

191
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.398
In terms of who to test with,
again we're back to that,

192
00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:28.766
that as long as they're competent and

193
00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:33.900
have got the same kind of ability spectrum
as your end user, anybody will do.

194
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.397
So usability testing,
friends and family again,

195
00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:41.036
you can see why they get
sick of being asked.

196
00:11:41.036 --> 00:11:45.601
My friends and
family have less friends now because of

197
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.448
the result of this, but anyway.

198
00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:53.248
The other thing you might wanna think
about is if you do big projects that last

199
00:11:53.248 --> 00:11:57.976
months of developing something that's
quite complicated and quite big,

200
00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:02.494
you might wanna think about the number
of rounds of testing that you do?

201
00:12:02.494 --> 00:12:05.701
So, one of the big things,
I mentioned this book earlier,

202
00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:08.493
Steve Cruise book
Rocket Surgery Made Easy.

203
00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:13.489
One thing he proposes is, look, if you're
working on long term projects where

204
00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:18.708
you're developing a digital service over
the long term, then you might wanna have

205
00:12:18.708 --> 00:12:23.553
like a day a month or morning a month,
only needs to be a morning where you tests

206
00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:29.064
with three people and the same, the third
Thursday every month or whatever.

207
00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:32.319
You just test with three people
that Thursday every month,

208
00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:36.094
whatever the questions are,
whatever the concerns are that month,

209
00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:37.866
you get in a routine of doing it.

210
00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:41.728
And he actually suggests that you
open that up to anybody to watch and

211
00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:46.338
that you test three people in the morning,
everybody watches and then everybody

212
00:12:46.338 --> 00:12:50.835
sits down at lunch and says, well,
what are we gonna do about these problems?

213
00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:54.967
And you bribe them to come to the whole
thing with pizza at lunch, right?

214
00:12:54.967 --> 00:12:58.740
I mean you guys all turned up just for
the for the chipotle so

215
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.931
it works internally,
pizza can get you everything.

216
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:07.361
So, yeah, usability testing is great,
it's a really good tool.

217
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:13.047
The remote unfacilitated
is lighter weight.

218
00:13:13.047 --> 00:13:17.602
If I could do a little bit more than
remote unfacilitated it would be remote

219
00:13:17.602 --> 00:13:22.394
facilitated, it's the in-person
thing that's the real luxury, right?

220
00:13:23.854 --> 00:13:29.263
If you ever get one opportunity in
your life to go to someone's home and

221
00:13:29.263 --> 00:13:31.534
test with them, do it.

222
00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:33.154
It's frigging awesome.

223
00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:34.233
You'll love it, yeah.

224
00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:37.804
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're ringing a story with me.

225
00:13:37.804 --> 00:13:43.069
Before remote thing was even a thing,
[COUGH] and the first time

226
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:49.223
I wrote a fun end application was
with the Ramsay County Sheriff's.

227
00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:50.421
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Department,

228
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:53.953
I actually wrote the DUI
logging system for the squads.

229
00:13:53.953 --> 00:13:54.583
&gt;&gt; Okay.

230
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:59.031
&gt;&gt; And I would ride with the deputies,
and I did this too late.

231
00:13:59.031 --> 00:14:03.193
So I wrote the application, the front end,
but some of them were were complaining

232
00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:06.264
because they couldn't,
their fingers were so thick.

233
00:14:06.264 --> 00:14:08.836
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That they couldn't click whether it was

234
00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:11.564
a DUI stop or
was it like a warning of some sort?

235
00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:13.524
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I got that feedback late.

236
00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:16.234
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I made my drop down o a bit too skinny.

237
00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:17.084
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

238
00:14:17.084 --> 00:14:21.519
&gt;&gt; But it's having that opportunity
to work with someone is so

239
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:24.100
impactful in their environment.

240
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.907
&gt;&gt; It really is.

241
00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:27.948
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, the best one I ever had was I

242
00:14:27.948 --> 00:14:33.547
went to, again, I was working
with old people at this stage.

243
00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:34.691
And so I was visiting,

244
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.497
I went to them because a lot of them had
mobility issues and stuff like that.

245
00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:42.249
And I went to this one lady's house and
she opened the front door and

246
00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:43.929
this stream of cats came out.

247
00:14:43.929 --> 00:14:46.429
She was really a stereotypical cat lady.

248
00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:51.180
And every surface on the whole of our
house was covered with cat ornaments,

249
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.036
like nicknacks, well,
we call them nicknacks ornaments.

250
00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:59.983
And we sat down at a computer and
it was like, we're cranking up desktop

251
00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:05.408
computer that took half an hour to get,
eventually this thing got going.

252
00:15:05.408 --> 00:15:08.703
She sits down to do the usability testing,
but

253
00:15:08.703 --> 00:15:13.698
immediately a cat jumps on her lap so
she's got a cat on the whole time.

254
00:15:13.698 --> 00:15:15.590
And then the mouse, she had so

255
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.756
much clutter on her desk that she had like
this amount of space to move them out.

256
00:15:20.756 --> 00:15:24.466
So she was going like this the whole time,
picking it up and moving it.

257
00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.034
And the real killer moment was I said,
okay,

258
00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:31.166
select a product that you like from
the website and add it to your basket.

259
00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:34.076
So she picks a product and
adds it to a basket.

260
00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:39.163
And I was about to say the words,
now go to your basket and check out.

261
00:15:39.163 --> 00:15:42.880
And I thought she ain't gonna be able to
find the basket, because she had posted

262
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.956
notes all around the monitor that was
covering up where the shopping basket was.

263
00:15:46.956 --> 00:15:49.076
I mean, how you design for
that, I don't know.

264
00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:53.103
[LAUGH] But it was so enlightening to
actually go and meet these people,

265
00:15:53.103 --> 00:15:57.948
it's actually worth it, but you just can't
justify doing it all the time or at least

266
00:15:57.948 --> 00:16:02.440
not on the kind of projects I get to work
on, and I get to work with big clients.

267
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.093
So you'd think if anybody could do it, it
would be my kind of clients, but they go.
