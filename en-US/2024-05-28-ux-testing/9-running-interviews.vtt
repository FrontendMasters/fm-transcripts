1
00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.358
If you can get more than that, right,

2
00:00:03.358 --> 00:00:08.426
if you can squeeze a little bit
more time and effort out there,

3
00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:13.422
then consider running a couple
of user interviews, right?

4
00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:18.338
Three maximum you need to do
I would say unless you're

5
00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:23.474
really on I'm not talking
best practice again, but for

6
00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:30.159
people like us in this workshop,
if you get three, you're doing well.

7
00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.872
Even one, again,
something is better than nothing.

8
00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:36.082
Do a little bit more
than you've done already.

9
00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:39.719
So just a very easy user
interview is really

10
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.466
worthwhile just having a chat with people.

11
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:47.469
So you might be wondering, well,
what do you do in those interviews?

12
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.829
So bit of advice on how to run user
interviews if you ever wanna give it a go.

13
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.677
First of all identify the topics and
start questions.

14
00:00:54.677 --> 00:01:00.189
So what kind of broad things
do you wanna know going in and

15
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.251
just write up some questions
around those topics.

16
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.013
Don't worry too much about it.

17
00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:08.465
Don't agonize over it.

18
00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:12.222
You don't need to worry about the wording
so much cuz it's gonna be a conversation.

19
00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:15.315
You're gonna it's gonna be flexible,
it's gonna go off on tangents.

20
00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.405
That's all great.

21
00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:21.401
Concentrate on building rapport with
people as that's a really big one.

22
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:26.011
So begin the interview with some
like non threatening questions

23
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.718
to make the participants feel
comfortable in the conversation.

24
00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:33.228
I often offer them tea
because I'm British and

25
00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:35.941
that's what you do if
you're doing it in person.

26
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:39.455
Although increasingly you
do it remotely these days.

27
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:42.674
Then just listen more than talk.

28
00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:46.147
So encourage participants
to do most of the talking.

29
00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:51.928
Resist the urge to fill in
silences with your thoughts or

30
00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.995
leading questions but keep it casual.

31
00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:57.678
There's no magic way of doing it.

32
00:01:57.678 --> 00:02:01.549
And the thing that I would remind you
is they've never seen a user interview

33
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.049
before.

34
00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.217
So they don't know whether you're
doing it wrong or right, right?

35
00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:09.000
It's more about, especially if you've
already done a bit of a survey,

36
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.844
doing an interview is mainly about
just getting to know the old audience,

37
00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:15.634
to get feel for them and
what kind of people to be able to

38
00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.384
picture a person in your
mind when you're doing it.

39
00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:22.094
And don't be afraid to ask
some follow up questions.

40
00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:26.007
If they say something particularly
interesting or unexpected,

41
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:27.579
ask follow up questions.

42
00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.204
I ask the question why a lot?

43
00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:30.303
An annoying amount.

44
00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.420
So why did you do that?

45
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.263
Or why did that annoy you or whatever?

46
00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:40.353
I call it the belligerent
toddler approach.

47
00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:45.239
Why, why, so, yes.

48
00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.206
Then of course, once you've done the
interview, if you put on all this effort

49
00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:54.890
to do an interview it's worth kind of
making sure you use it effectively.

50
00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.051
I tend to get a load of quotes
together from the interview because

51
00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:05.893
it's great to be able to throw them
into presentations and quote users.

52
00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:10.432
Cuz one of the big things you find when
interacting with stakeholders is two types

53
00:03:10.432 --> 00:03:11.511
of stakeholders.

54
00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:14.396
The stakeholders that are driven by data,
right?

55
00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:17.153
They're the ones that want
your survey results, right?

56
00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:21.906
73% of people got annoyed at
this particular thing, right?

57
00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.255
That resonates with them.

58
00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:27.778
And then there's the other group of people
that are the more empathetic people that

59
00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:31.719
just want a really sweaty quote saying
how much somebody got annoyed with

60
00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.259
one particular thing and
that was swing them.

61
00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.672
Together it works really well if
you can get away with doing both.

62
00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:42.096
So collecting those quotes
together is really worth while.

63
00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:46.907
It's worth getting transcriptions, which
is mind blowingly easy these days with AI,

64
00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:50.872
because it means that you can search
through them and highlight stuff for

65
00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:51.991
future reference.

66
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.581
And if you got a little
bit of extra time and

67
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:59.392
I agree this does take a bit more time,
I create what I call a highlights reel,

68
00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:01.779
or sometimes I call it a horror video.

69
00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:06.554
So, the highlights reel is a kind
of collection of the key points,

70
00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:11.180
that people are making just so
that people get an overview of it.

71
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.839
Other times I create a horror reel,

72
00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.394
which is where I wanna scare stakeholders
into letting me do what I wanna do.

73
00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:20.711
And so I just feel it with all of the most
frustrating and annoying moments and

74
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.677
I send it around to stakeholders.

75
00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:27.525
Normally, only 90 seconds, something
very short and snappy just to kinda

76
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:31.789
get a reaction from them and
kinda get them caring a little bit more.

77
00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.925
You could do all of this via Zoom,
but actually,

78
00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.301
there are some other tools out there
that you might wanna consider.

79
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:42.900
You might be a Zoom person, you might
be a Google Meet person, Team person,

80
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.148
all of those you can do it.

81
00:04:44.148 --> 00:04:49.219
If you can scrounge a little bit of money
together, I do recommend look back because

82
00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.863
it's much easier for highlighting bits
it does the transcription for you.

83
00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:57.910
It makes it easy to create those low
light videos and stuff like that.

84
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.394
You only need to get it for one month,
you pay for on month of it and

85
00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:03.819
then you cancel it.

86
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.978
So that's a useful little
tool that I use quite a lot.

87
00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:10.539
And like I said a minute ago,
don't worry about doing it wrong,

88
00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.976
participants aren't gonna know.

89
00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:19.578
[LAUGH] So just kind of have a casual
chat really, terms of questions to ask.

90
00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:22.728
It's up to you but I tend to ask
a little bit of background and

91
00:05:22.728 --> 00:05:27.138
context cuz I'm trying to get to know the
person a little bit and their pain points,

92
00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:29.353
and their goals, and that kind of thing.

93
00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:34.834
I try and get an idea of how they use
the service if they've used it before and

94
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.445
any challenges they encountered.

95
00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:40.766
I talk about needs needs and
opportunity a lot,

96
00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:46.511
how satisfied they are with the service
areas that they think should be improved.

97
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.915
And then I just encourage them with some
open ended feedback at the end where they

98
00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:52.765
can say anything they wanna say.

99
00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:57.544
If they've used it before,
any thoughts on what they've just seen or

100
00:05:57.544 --> 00:06:02.080
if you've shown them the app while
you're doing a conversation.

101
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.623
Now these are interviews
rather than usability testing.

102
00:06:04.623 --> 00:06:07.718
So it's more of a chat than it is
actually testing an interface and

103
00:06:07.718 --> 00:06:09.815
we'll come on to usability testing later.
