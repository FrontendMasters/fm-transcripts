1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.520
Stage one,
identify points of friction, right?

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.206
So where are things going wrong?

3
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.875
Before you can improve the experience,

4
00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.205
you need to understand what pages
are underperforming, right?

5
00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:15.693
Where are things going badly?

6
00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:18.799
And actually, there are certain
warning signs are in your analytics,

7
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:19.999
are really easy to look up.

8
00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.630
So identifying problem pages is so easy.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.875
First of all, you're looking for

10
00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.365
exit pages where are people
abandoning the website.

11
00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:30.726
Easy, look that up.

12
00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:31.416
No problem.

13
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:37.596
Even I can do that in Google Analytics and
I hate Google Analytics, especially GA4.

14
00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:38.736
We all hate GA4.

15
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:47.143
And then the second one is bounce rates
where people are bouncing from a page.

16
00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:51.064
Those are the big boys.

17
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:55.486
So if you've seen those pages that have
got high bounce rate, high exit page,

18
00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:59.622
chances are something's going
wrong on those pages, right?

19
00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.586
There are other signs you can look for

20
00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:05.007
if you've got something like
Microsoft clarity running on it,

21
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.015
which by the way is free and easy to set
up and has a very low performance hit.

22
00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.883
I've been really impressed because
obviously the more stuff like this you add

23
00:01:12.883 --> 00:01:16.295
to a site, the more it slows things down,
but actually it runs well.

24
00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:23.261
So other signs that clarity provides I
often look at is rage clicks, right?

25
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:26.001
Where people go, stupid thing,
why is it not working?

26
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.646
And they're going like that.

27
00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:30.687
Dead clicks, where people are trying to
click on something that isn't clickable.

28
00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.981
That's always a good sign.

29
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:36.221
Excessive scrolling,
when they go like that, right?

30
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.640
That's a sign that they're
not happy with the page,

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.905
they're not looking at it properly.

32
00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.144
And then quick backs, which are very
similar to bounce rates basically,

33
00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:47.045
I have gone to a page and
then go is not yet gone back.

34
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:52.295
So there are all signs that
that page is a problem, right?

35
00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.819
So you'll end up with a list of
the pages that are problem pages and

36
00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.873
the ones with the highest exit rate and
the ones with the highest whatever.

37
00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:03.514
She picked the one with
the worst performing and

38
00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:06.892
then we have to narrow
down the exact issue.

39
00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:10.469
So what is wrong on that page, okay?

40
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.909
Really simple processes is to go through.

41
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.139
So, step one, you look at the heat maps.

42
00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.283
So whether it's in clarity as we've
got here or where the hot jars are,

43
00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:27.197
I don't care, but you look at your
heat maps to begin with, right?

44
00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.435
Are people scrolling properly?

45
00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.624
Where are they clicking on the page?

46
00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:35.262
All those kinds of things you
can all see on a heat map and

47
00:02:35.262 --> 00:02:39.693
you can look at that and
often you can go, well, only 3% of people

48
00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:44.506
are clicking on the button on this
page that we want people to click on.

49
00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:46.205
Well, okay, why are they doing that?

50
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:49.902
We're not picking, many people
are scrolling that far down the page and

51
00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:53.182
you can just look at it and
kind of get an idea of what's going on.

52
00:02:53.182 --> 00:03:00.368
Sometimes you sit there and go,
I can't see the problem here.

53
00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:05.628
So what I'll then do is I'll then
switch to session recordings.

54
00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:08.094
So I'll switch across to
the session recordings for

55
00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:11.750
people that have gone through that page,
have a look at what they're doing.

56
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.920
Are they doing anything weird?

57
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.948
Is anything feeling wrong there?

58
00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:19.394
If I really get desperate,
normally by that stage,

59
00:03:19.394 --> 00:03:22.671
you kinda got an idea of what it might be,
right?

60
00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:25.751
The heat maps show you scrolling, so
you click and all the rest of it.

61
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.228
You can only work it out.

62
00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:32.245
If you really get stuck, you could
run a usability testing on that page,

63
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:37.018
so you can actually ask people why
they're finding it confusing, or

64
00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:40.800
you could run a survey on that page,
if you click here,

65
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.928
if you're getting frustrated and
tell us why, there's ways and means.

66
00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:50.779
So once you've found out the problem,
then you're gonna come up

67
00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:55.642
with some solutions to the problem
of how you think you can fix it.

68
00:03:55.642 --> 00:04:00.327
And it's beyond the scope of this to kind
of tell you how to work that or out.

69
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:06.400
But you come up with ideas of what
you think might work on the page.

70
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.970
So they basically fall into two buckets,
right?

71
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.690
There's smaller changes, right?

72
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.327
So sometimes you look at it and go,
basically, if I just change this image or

73
00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:20.949
if I change this label or
if I change the color of the button or

74
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.855
something like that, then that will
probably fix the problem, right?

75
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:30.175
So, those kinds of small changes,
we can test whether or

76
00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:33.965
not those are gonna work with AB testing,
right?

77
00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:39.853
AB testing is,
it sounds really complicated.

78
00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:42.213
It really isn't.

79
00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:47.992
Basically, all you're doing is taking
a percentage of your incoming traffic and

80
00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:53.786
you're sending it to variations of that
page where those changes have been made.

81
00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:58.406
So majority of traffic will still go to
the original version, but you'll send

82
00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:03.166
10% off to one variation, if you've
come up with various ways of solving it,

83
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:07.029
then 10% go to another and
10% to another and so on, right?

84
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:12.376
So you can test as many versions as you
like at the same time if you so wish to.

85
00:05:12.376 --> 00:05:17.500
So when I primarily use AB
testing is when I'm doing things

86
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.848
like changing texts,
really small textual change.

87
00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:26.358
Great, no problem,
you can do that easily with an AB testing.

88
00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:30.428
When I'm changing buttons,
works really good for that, and

89
00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.865
when I'm changing images, right?

90
00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:41.063
All of that can be done very
easily with AB testing, right?

91
00:05:41.063 --> 00:05:45.632
There's two types of AB testing,
there's AB testing, and

92
00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:48.596
then there's multivariate testing.

93
00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:50.628
And this language gets confusing.

94
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:55.163
But basically, it means that AB testing
is where you're changing one thing on

95
00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:57.698
the page, so maybe just the text.

96
00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:02.130
Multivariate is you're changing multiple
things on the page, so maybe the text,

97
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.687
the button, and the image, right?

98
00:06:04.687 --> 00:06:09.625
Whatever the case, it can easily
do that kind of thing, no problem,

99
00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:15.377
making those kind of lightweight
changes on a single page, easy.

100
00:06:15.377 --> 00:06:20.327
Now, it used to be that you could
use Google Optimize to do this and

101
00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:25.187
it was great and it was free and
the world was a wonderful place and

102
00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:27.617
it was all great and wonderful.

103
00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:33.264
They closed it down for reasons that
escaped me but you know fair enough.
