00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.550
Okay, so let's talk about the
practicalities of doing usability testing,

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.709
whether you're doing it remote
usability testing in person

3
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.110
facilitated non-facilitated.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.222
There's obviously some preparation
that needs to be done.

5
00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:18.878
So I want to talk you through
some of the preparation if you've

6
00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:23.258
done usability testing you have
nobody else, yeah, you've done some.

7
00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:26.751
So a little bit maybe
yeah okay fair enough, so

8
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:31.409
it it takes a bit of practice and
you kind of find your way and and

9
00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:37.413
it's a difficult one in some ways this
is obviously facilitated unfacilitated

10
00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:43.713
it's a different ball game but you kind of
got you've got to do it your way, right?

11
00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.571
Because obviously my personality
is different to yours and

12
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:48.636
different people do it in different ways.

13
00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:53.504
But there are some practicalities you need
to consider, if you're going to do it in

14
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:58.580
person, right, which probably you're not
but for complete sake, I should probably

15
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.962
include that If you can do it in person,
you're gonna need a quiet private room.

16
00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:08.992
There's nothing worse than doing usability
testing in any kind of open planned

17
00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:14.021
office because it's very kind of makes
participants very self-conscious and

18
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.762
it's just horrible to do.

19
00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:20.145
You're gonna need an appropriate
internet-enabled device.

20
00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:24.334
I know that sounds stupid, but it's
amazing how often you don't check that

21
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.875
the internet is working before it
starts and it goes horribly wrong.

22
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:32.184
You'll need a clock or a watch so
you can keep an eye on the time and

23
00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:34.282
don't take up too much people's time.

24
00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:38.398
All obvious stuff, but it's so easy to
overlook this thing these things and

25
00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.338
you need the ability to take notes.

26
00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:44.709
On that regards, if you're going
to do in-person usability testing,

27
00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.366
and if you don't have a good screen
recording app, and I'm going to come on to

28
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.807
that in just a second, well,
I'll put it up now, screen recording app,

29
00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:58.477
then you might want a second person
in there to actually take notes.

30
00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:01.542
I mean, you could do things like
feed it through to another room and

31
00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.792
have to wait mirrors, one way mirrors,
and all that rubbish.

32
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.574
But if you don't have the luxury
of that kind of stuff,

33
00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:10.840
then just have a person sitting in
the corner you point to them and

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.222
say they're taking notes and then you can
focus on actually facilitating this test.

35
00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:19.254
But it's a lot easier if you've got a good
screen recording app look back that I

36
00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:22.859
mentioned before, but because then
you can just enjoy the session and

37
00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.112
it's all transcribed, and
you can look back at it afterwards.

38
00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:31.662
Obviously, however you do it, you've
got to plan your tasks and scenarios.

39
00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:36.222
And so basically, the three pieces
of advice I give around this kind

40
00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.782
of thing is you start by identifying
to find the task you want users to

41
00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:44.395
test based on the questions you have,
right?

42
00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:50.737
So if your question is I'm worried
about the checkout process, right?

43
00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:54.948
Then you're going to start with a task
which involves someone going through

44
00:02:54.948 --> 00:02:56.734
the checkout process, right?

45
00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:59.849
So you need to know what those are,
and what you're going.

46
00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.358
Gonna do is you're going to word those
as tasks that people can complete.

47
00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:10.241
The second thing you've got to
do is prioritize your tasks,

48
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.213
as you probably won't get through
every one of them, right?

49
00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:17.239
Oftentimes, people have
far too many tasks,

50
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.126
partly because they're afraid of running
out of content, things to do with people.

51
00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:24.392
But if you prioritize them,

52
00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:27.106
then you can have some nice to
have ones if you get to them.

53
00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.816
But if you don't, it's not the end
of the world kind of thing.

54
00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:34.361
And then the final thing that you need
to do is transform those tasks into

55
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.946
scenarios that a user has to complete.

56
00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:37.832
So it's a lot easier.

57
00:03:37.832 --> 00:03:41.469
Let me give you a real
example because your task

58
00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.332
might be make an appointment to
see a skin therapist, right?

59
00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:49.716
That's the thing you want someone to do,
but

60
00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:54.703
it works a lot better if you kind of
word it as a scenario because then

61
00:03:54.703 --> 00:04:00.600
it's easier to avoid keywords
that are in the interface, right.

62
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.451
So you're unhappy with your appearance,
your skin lately and

63
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.220
have decided to have a facial.

64
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.460
You go to a website looking to
book a time for a treatment.

65
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.000
So I've managed to avoid the word skin
therapist and the word appointment just

66
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.700
but still communicated
the essence of what's going on.

67
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.117
So that's by wording it as a scenario,
it just makes it all a bit more A,

68
00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:26.978
people can associate with it more, and
B, it allows you to reduce the amount of

69
00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:30.317
bias that you're introducing
into your questions.

70
00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:34.417
The other thing is, so
you basically take all of your tasks,

71
00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:37.827
you turn them all into scenarios like
that, prioritize them, job done.

72
00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:42.213
But it's worth preparing a bit of
a welcome if you're gonna be doing

73
00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:44.533
a facilitated session, right?

74
00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:48.883
If you can do it in person, please offer
them refreshments at the beginning.

75
00:04:48.883 --> 00:04:53.453
It's a really great way of relaxing
people, making them feel appreciated.

76
00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:58.029
If you're doing it remotely, I normally
make some self-deprecating joke or

77
00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:02.466
they're something else at the beginning
to make them laugh and relax them,

78
00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:06.622
you need to find your own thing to do
that, whatever works with you, but

79
00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:09.678
the aim is to relax people up front.

80
00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:14.481
Then I always introduce myself and
explain the session's agenda and

81
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:18.892
how long it's gonna be, and
I'll come on to that in a minute.

82
00:05:18.892 --> 00:05:21.509
And this next one is
a really important one,

83
00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.420
emphasize that you're testing the site,
not the participant.

84
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.807
So there's no wrong answers.

85
00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:32.321
People get really nervous that like
they're being tested in some way.

86
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:36.907
And yet there is a right way of doing it.

87
00:05:36.907 --> 00:05:39.621
And they'll say things like,
am doing it right?

88
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:44.735
And it's like well, yes,
[LAUGH] whatever you're doing is, right.

89
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:52.197
I also always ask them to think out loud.

90
00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:54.104
You say that they need to,

91
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:58.709
you encourage them to in particular
say what they're seeing.

92
00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:01.358
Cuz you don't know what
they're looking at, so

93
00:06:01.358 --> 00:06:03.769
I'm currently looking at the whatever.

94
00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:08.875
I asked them also to express
what they're thinking and

95
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.199
what they're trying to do.

96
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.927
And also what they what they're
gonna do next before they do it is

97
00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:19.019
often good as well.

98
00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:20.864
Six Just getting them talking out loud.

99
00:06:20.864 --> 00:06:25.711
So if ever they go quiet, ask them what
they're thinking to get them going again.

100
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:30.122
Make it clear that you're not gonna get
offended by anything negative they say.

101
00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:36.186
I again, reoccurring theme
I've with me I lie, right?

102
00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:40.558
I regularly tell people that I wasn't in
any way in four Involved in producing

103
00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:44.995
this, so you're not going to offend me
in the slightest if you don't like it,

104
00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:45.815
it is useful.

105
00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:50.663
It's a useful thing to do in that
situation because a lot of people don't

106
00:06:50.663 --> 00:06:52.023
like to offend.

107
00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:55.142
Certainly in Britain,
Americans might be different.

108
00:06:55.142 --> 00:06:58.771
I'm not making any judgments.

109
00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:01.334
Next up, ask for
permission to record them and

110
00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.358
stress that the recordings
aren't going to be used for

111
00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:09.280
any other purpose because again, people
are worried about their privacy, etc.

112
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.300
So it's worth doing that.

113
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.667
If you ever deal with any
kind of vulnerable group

114
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.872
that's particularly important.

115
00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:22.086
I did it once with,
you kind of abused women that had

116
00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:26.791
escaped difficult home situations and
stuff like that.

117
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:31.261
And they're really, as you can imagine,
very sensitive that their information

118
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:33.861
of where they are now
might in any way leak out.

119
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.344
So just bear things like that in mind.

120
00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:39.098
And let them know if any additional
stakeholders are interested.

121
00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:42.078
Coders are gonna be observing
from another room, right?

122
00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:44.178
Because that's a bit weird as well.

123
00:07:44.178 --> 00:07:48.409
It's a weird situation you got to do
what you can to make people feel relaxed

124
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:49.158
basically.

125
00:07:49.158 --> 00:07:51.630
Of course, that's all facilitated
if you're gonna be there.

126
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.750
If you're not,
then it's a bit of a different scenario.
