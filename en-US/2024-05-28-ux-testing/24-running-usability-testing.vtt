00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:07.072
Let's look at how to actually run
the facilitated usability sessions.

2
00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:11.160
Very briefly, first of all,
an outline of your schedule.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.810
This is normally what my calendar will
look like if I'm running usability

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.563
sessions.

5
00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:19.346
Each session is normally 40 minutes long.

6
00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:22.597
Any more than that and
people begin to zone out and

7
00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.065
kind of can't really concentrate.

8
00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:30.369
I normally leave about 20 minutes between
each session, partly because some sessions

9
00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.122
run a little bit long, partly because I
need time to just get my head in the game.

10
00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:39.214
There might have been something that
somebody said that wanna note down or

11
00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:40.141
whatever else.

12
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.919
And I never do more than six a day.

13
00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:47.641
It is exhausting doing usability testing.

14
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:51.340
Which is why I mainly rely on
nonfacilitated usability testing

15
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.114
these days.

16
00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.350
And then always split it
around lunch as well.

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.427
So you do three in the morning, three in
the afternoon, or two in the morning,

18
00:00:57.427 --> 00:00:59.398
two in the afternoon,
whatever you decide to do.

19
00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:03.889
If you are gonna do in person,
facilitate the testing, try and

20
00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.130
relax people ask about their expectations.

21
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.986
So before you show them anything,
ask them what they expect to see, right?

22
00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:15.374
So if you're say presenting
a mobile app for a bank, so

23
00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:19.220
what would you expect to see in
a mobile app for a bank, right?

24
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.206
Before you show them anything.

25
00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:23.361
Because that's interesting
in its own right.

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.407
Prompt people to talk a lot.

27
00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:27.194
Try not to lead people.

28
00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:32.152
Again, this is another reason why I
don't do facilitated remote testing that

29
00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:36.674
much anymore cuz I can't keep my mouth
shut and I do tend to lead people.

30
00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:40.738
So I'm not very good at
facilitated remote testing.

31
00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:44.102
And this is another thing I've really
struggled with allow people to

32
00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:45.090
struggle, right?

33
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.013
That when you see someone in excruciating
frustration at something you wanna

34
00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:51.527
jump in and help them and

35
00:01:51.527 --> 00:01:57.070
you really mustn't because you wanna see
how they struggle and where they're going.

36
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.248
Only a bit, you can prompt people if
they get completely stuck if they said,

37
00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.770
I just don't know what to do next,
rather than just say, well,

38
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.786
that's the end of the session,
then you can help get them back on track.

39
00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:10.703
Watch for nonverbal cues.

40
00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:15.827
They're really big one, [LAUGH] hammering

41
00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:21.954
the table is something that
I did experience once.

42
00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:25.406
Well, they will ask questions
as they go through, and

43
00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:30.062
normally my response is, absolutely,
that's a really good question,

44
00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:33.457
I'd love to answer it, but
can I answer it at the end?

45
00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:36.865
Because I don't wanna screw up
what we're doing now, right?

46
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.681
Or prejudiced see?

47
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.508
So now I'll make a note and
answer them at the end.

48
00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:45.003
Feel free to ask clarifying questions,
right?

49
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:50.390
So just, why did you do that, and
don't say, why did you do that?

50
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.012
But asking them to clarify what
they're trying to do and why they made

51
00:02:55.012 --> 00:03:00.043
a choice that they did or what they
meant by something, that kind of thing.

52
00:03:00.043 --> 00:03:03.402
So that's facilitated usability testing.

53
00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:05.677
What about unfacilitated?

54
00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:12.843
Well, you got some options there.

55
00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:17.842
They're really easy to set up,
this is being set up with loopback,

56
00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:23.035
you can go in and you can select your
self test option, really simple.

57
00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:27.365
You then basically go in you write
a welcome message where you say some of

58
00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:32.272
those things that you would have said if
you were welcoming people in person say,

59
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:36.050
we're not testing you would
encourage you to speak out loud.

60
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.646
Any feedback is good feedback.

61
00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:41.196
You're not gonna have offend
anybody a little bit like that,

62
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:43.251
I tend to work right in the welcome.

63
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:47.605
And then you basically go through and
write out the scenarios, right?

64
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:51.362
That you want them to do and you give
them add the URL into the prototype and

65
00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:52.667
it's as simple as that.

66
00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.631
And then you tend to
write a final message.

67
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.861
Thank you very much,
you're amazing, blah, blah, blah.

68
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.393
Once you've filled all those details in,

69
00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:07.244
and notice there as well on the left hand
side, you can say whether it's desktop,

70
00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:10.787
iOS, Android and things like that,
which is good for you.

71
00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:16.095
At the end of that, it just gives you
a URL, you send the URL out to your users,

72
00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:20.291
they jump on the URL and
then talk through the whole process.

73
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.379
And it records them
while they're doing it.

74
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.642
It transcribes them, and
then you can sit and wtch and

75
00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:30.357
pick out bits do you like and
all the rest of it.

76
00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:33.710
As you can see, that's a lot less work.

77
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.312
But it's also really good because
you get this very unbiased,

78
00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.279
unfiltered, unprompted view.

79
00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:46.773
So if you're not as confident
about doing usability testing, or

80
00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:49.303
you're a bit rubbish at it like I am,

81
00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:54.635
unfacilitated works better because
you're less likely to bias it, right?

82
00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:59.940
Pros and cons, make your pick probably
based on the time that's available to you.
