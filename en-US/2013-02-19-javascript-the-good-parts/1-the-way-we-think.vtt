2
00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.400
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So we're gonna start
with programming style and your brain.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.920
Now this is two topics which would
appear to have nothing to do with each

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.640
other, right?

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.730
Programming style is the part of
a program that a compiler ignores.

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.400
So a lot of feeling is, well,

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.570
it doesn't matter what you do in terms
of style because it's not significant.

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.293
You can do anything you want,
in one style's as good as another.

9
00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:31.830
I'm gonna try to convince
you that that is not true.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.860
Some styles are profoundly better
than others, and I'll show you why.

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.350
Your brain is that big wad of meat
in your skull that you think with.

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.090
How are these topics connected?

13
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.150
Well, turns out they are connected in
a really interesting and unexpected way.

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.740
So I'm gonna be misrepresenting
the work of Daniel Kahneman,

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.500
the noble winning psychologist.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.710
Nobel doesn't give it an award for
psychology, so they gave him the award for

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.840
economics, but he's not an economist.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.870
He showed that one of the fundamental
assumptions of economics is not true,

19
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.800
which is that any party can be expected
to pursue its own best interest.

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.680
He shows that this is not necessarily
the case if a party is a human being,

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.650
because people do not think
the way economists think we think.

22
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.000
In fact, generally,
we don't think the way we think we think.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
The more you study Kahneman,

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.146
the more surprised you are that
we ever get anything done.

25
00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:35.847
Because what we're actually doing
is really different than what we

26
00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:37.499
imagine we're doing.

27
00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:43.650
So Kahneman described a model
of gut involving two systems.

28
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.876
The are system two which is the higher
level thing it's analytical,

29
00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:56.653
it's where we do reasoning, where we
do logic, where we do mathematics.

30
00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:59.450
It's amazingly powerful but
it's really slow.

31
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.060
And because it's slow we
had to invent computers,

32
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.240
because we can't rely on this sack of meat
to generate all the numbers that we need.

33
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.160
It's just not fast enough.

34
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550
It requires a lot of effort but

35
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.650
we have thought of amazing
things using system two.

36
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.570
And system one is associated,
it's theoristic, it's very fast,

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.640
it's approximate, and you cannot turn it
off, it is always running all the time.

38
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.530
And what it does is, it will recognize
a problem that's too complicated for

39
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.320
to handle, and
it will instead solve a simpler problem.

40
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.690
Which is easier for it to solve and
supply that as the result.

41
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.660
And it's approximate, so it's often
right enough and everything goes, and

42
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.950
sometimes it's just completely wrong,
but that's how it works.

43
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.444
Now everybody is aware of this, you can
think of system two as being the head, and

44
00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.278
system one as being the guts.

45
00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:04.040
And we're always saying things my heads
telling me this, my guts telling me that.

46
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.370
So that's not new, the thing that's
new is the connection between the two.

47
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.520
It turns out that system one provides
the working assumptions to system two.

48
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.950
And system two is unaware that,
that happens.

49
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.770
And as you know, if you have any
logical system with invalid inputs,

50
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.980
you're likely to get invalid outputs.

51
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.120
And because system one is approximate,
that happens all the time,

52
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.190
and we're not aware of it.

53
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.460
So let me give you an example of this,
from visual processing.

54
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.396
Visual processing is the opposite
of computer graphics,

55
00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:44.379
it's where you take
a signal from a camera.

56
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.958
And analyse all the pixels, and
try to like identify all of the objects in

57
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.660
the scene, and how they're all
moving relative to each other.

58
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.860
This turns out to be a really important,
skill for any animal, right?

59
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.230
Because you're moving through
the environment and you need to recognize

60
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.150
what you can eat, and what's coming after
you, and ways to safety and all that.

61
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.220
And you need to solve those
problems really fast.

62
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.920
Super computers have a really
hard time doing this.

63
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.690
But we all do it all the time
without even thinking about it.

64
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.973
For us it's an easy problem,
this is like a system one kind of thing.

65
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:22.784
And it does that by not
solving the hard problem, and

66
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:25.990
instead solving easier problems.

67
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.180
And sometimes that causes
incorrect results.

68
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.230
So this is an optical illusion
designed by Edward Addison of MIT,

69
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.720
we've got a chess board or checker board
with white squares and black squares.

70
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.200
And there's a cylinder on there, and
two of the squares are labeled A and B.

71
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.480
And it turns out A and
B are exactly the same color.

72
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.630
You can take this image, and put it in
Photoshop, and put the dipper on them, and

73
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.440
they are both exactly
the same pixel value.

74
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.260
Some of you may have trouble seeing
that because one is obviously black, and

75
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.990
one is obviously white, but
they are both exactly the same.

76
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.300
So to demonstrate that, I'm dropping a
solid colored square to connect them, and

77
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.250
you can see there's no break,
they are the same color.

78
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.270
Now some of you may be seeing a gradient
there, does anybody see a gradient.

79
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.550
Your brain is lying to you,

80
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.690
you know the truth of this image
that is a solid card square.

81
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.646
There's another system in your head which
is trying to deal with inconsistency.

82
00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:29.355
And that turns out to be really important,
because if a computer system becomes

83
00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:34.170
inconsistent, there is a really good
chance it's gonna fall over, right?

84
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.100
And so we work really hard in our programs
to try to keep everything consistent.

85
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.200
But here is a place where
we are inconsistent,

86
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.640
we already says one thing, and
our algorithm say another in a wrong.

87
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.950
So we get this kind of thing, and so

88
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.100
we are inventing the gradient in order
to try to make sense out of this.

89
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.710
And we do this all the time,
not just individual system, but

90
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.110
in all of the stuff that we're doing.

91
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.992
So you listen to like political debates
in how can we be this is what's going

92
00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:06.774
on, okay?

93
00:06:06.774 --> 00:06:09.966
That we will reject
the evidence of our eyes if

94
00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:13.410
it's inconsistent with
what we're thinking.

95
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.133
And so we are really good at filtering
stuff coming from the world, and

96
00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:21.060
trying to make sense out of it, and
sometimes we're doing the opposite.

97
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.030
So turned out this was not news
to the advertising industry.

98
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.760
They had known for
long before Kahneman about how we think.

99
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.620
And that they could draft messages,
and have bypass the head and

100
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.660
go straight to the gut, and

101
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.810
convince us that we desperately
want things that we don't need.

102
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.100
They've been doing this for
years and years.

103
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.520
And you can see once you recognize it,
it's everywhere.

104
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.432
When you walk into a store,
you see lots of products for 199,

105
00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:54.190
you never see something for 201, right?

106
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.250
There's only 1% difference there,
it's not a significant difference.

107
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.920
But the gut goes, that's a great deal.

108
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.130
Whereas 201, that's a terrible deal, okay?

109
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.650
And so most of us shop with our guts,
that's how pricing's done.

110
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.260
The advertisers have always known this.

111
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.620
And nobody was better at this
than the tobacco industry.

112
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.090
Cuz you think about,
how do you sell tobacco?

113
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.630
Okay, what does tobacco do?

114
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.230
It makes you smell bad, it turns your
teeth yellow, it makes you sick, and

115
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.950
then it kills you, okay?

116
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.524
So how do you sell a product like that?

117
00:07:29.524 --> 00:07:32.184
&gt;&gt; Class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: You're not selling

118
00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:33.210
to the head, right?

119
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.490
The head is not gonna buy that,
you sell it to the gut.

120
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.230
You can present images which are confusing
but pleasant and acceptable, and

121
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.816
the gut will buy them.

122
00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:49.050
So the gut will see pictures of healthy,
happy, people, and associate that.

123
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:56.359
And so you can confuse the gut, it'll
confuse good for you with slow death.

124
00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:58.860
And the tobacco industry has
been doing that forever.

125
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.970
And they're still doing it, and
they're really effective at it.

126
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.430
So we still have people continuing
to smoke and to start smoking.

127
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.880
Despite all of our knowledge that it's
very easy to get system one to override

128
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.380
reason, and fact, and
knowledge about something.

129
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.830
And system two were actually
work against you in some cases.

130
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.910
Like you can ask a smoker,
why do you smoke?

131
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.500
And so why do you?

132
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.740
That's an analytical question.

133
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.360
So that engages system two, but the input
is smoking is obviously good for me.

134
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.260
So system two will start rationalizing and
coming up with reasons.I

135
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.250
really enjoy the flavor of burning
weeds in my mouth 20 times a day.

136
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.990
I really need to experience that, and
thinking hotter it makes me popular.

137
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.800
They can say that sitting in a restaurant
where all the healthy good smelling people

138
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.310
are trying to get away from them,
so stink doesn't get in their food.

139
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.760
You can say it makes me popular
while seeing everybody running away.

140
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.310
That sort of the way we work.
