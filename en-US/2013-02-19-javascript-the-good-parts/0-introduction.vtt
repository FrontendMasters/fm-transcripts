2
00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:45.116
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Good morning.

3
00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:46.330
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.040
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: [COUGH] So
a lot of JavaScript today.

5
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.930
We're gonna start with
programming style and your brain.

6
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.410
Programming style is a really important
thing, which is vastly misunderstood, as

7
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.181
is almost every aspect of JavaScript and
pretty much every aspect of programming.

8
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:09.084
Then we're gonna go on to an overview
of the JavaScript language and

9
00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:12.706
talk about pretty much
everything that's in it.

10
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.690
Then we're gonna focus on function.

11
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.940
Functions are the best
part of the language and

12
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.330
something that people
don't know very well.

13
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.620
Then after lunch we'rere going to
get to the best part of the day.

14
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.640
We are going to put you to work.

15
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.430
So I am going to get a series
of problems to solve

16
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.570
which will require that you
fully understand functions.

17
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.180
If it goes well, is gonna completely
change the way you think.

18
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.970
So this is gonna be great.

19
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.550
Then we're gonna talk about
Monads which is weird.

20
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.800
And then if there's time, that'll depend
on how long everything else runs,

21
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.715
we'll talk about Ajax and
the browser and that crap.

22
00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:57.360
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So that agreeable?

23
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910
Sound like a good day?

24
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I think

25
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350
it'll be easier for me because I
get to stand up and walk around.

26
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.420
You're, unfortunately,
gonna have to just sit there and take it.

27
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.600
If you have any questions, let's stop
along the way and deal with that.

28
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.670
Can everybody hear me okay?

29
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.980
So, let's begin.
