1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.670
So, we've got all of that in place.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.460
I can't set it to anything
that it shouldn't be.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.130
So, my challenge for you, and I kind of
alluded to some of the nuances here and

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.755
like Mark explained to us,
event target dot value s number, so

5
00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:19.260
we all get to try that one out for is.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.540
We know how to type a change handler,
right?

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.460
We know most of how to handle this form.

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.906
And so, we want to do is also have where
they hit update the counter to a given

9
00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:29.242
number that will also work.

10
00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:36.639
Right, so
maybe tempted to do something like this.

11
00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:39.611
We'll say, we got to store it as a
separate value because it's not like when

12
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:41.607
the input changes,
it's one of those submitted so

13
00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.620
I got to store that separate value for
a hot minute.

14
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.130
Call it draft count.

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.660
And we can start off with count.

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.629
But unless I do something in here,
TypeScript's going to make sure I don't

17
00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.110
accidentally end up in a situation
where the input field bites me.

18
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.473
So, we have that in place, and
we can do, We can do windows changes.

19
00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:10.239
Yes, we got, we can do it in line, or
we can pull it out we'll just say that we

20
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.912
want to change it to the value of
this input when it changes it.

21
00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:24.803
Cool and because it's a number,
it is angry with me.

22
00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:28.187
Right, and that's nice because I don't
want to talk to you about how many times,

23
00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.280
I've made this mistake.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.985
As I'm just in the zone because it's
like I'm already resentful that I have

25
00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:37.293
to do this rigmarole with
react of taking the value and

26
00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:42.170
I can't just bind it together like
other frameworks that will go unnamed.

27
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.013
And so, a lot of times,
I'm in the middle of some other thought,

28
00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:48.583
I'm doing this because it's a chore and
I'm supposed to, and so but it's like,

29
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:51.510
you accidentally pass a string in here and
that's great.

30
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.940
Like yes, I wish that didn't happen.

31
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.584
So Mark taught me about dot.

32
00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:02.014
&gt;&gt; No, just the post fix.

33
00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:07.530
&gt;&gt; It's one,
property it's just value capital A, What?

34
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.590
And also, I believe you because
autocomplete believes you, right?

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.360
Also we learned that that exists.

36
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.946
Do we all know about
this one that has date?

37
00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:19.760
Mark say yes.

38
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.151
Yes, I saw how people didn't know so, And

39
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:30.118
now it is a piece with me,
which is pretty great.

40
00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:34.213
Otherwise, I can keep it as a string and
then do this somewhere else as well.

41
00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:38.330
Is that just on, I was just event target
various numbers, that's pretty cool.

42
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.875
The other thing I would do is
just keep it as a string and

43
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:44.450
then coerce it to a number when I needed
to, but now I don't need to do that.

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.824
Awesome, and then so
like we have that on change and

45
00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:50.868
then really there is the on submit.

46
00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:01.422
Which is just going to take, And

47
00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:06.607
I know that everything is working as it
should because I didn't get yelled at,

48
00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:09.685
which is a general rule for
life that I follow.

49
00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:11.670
And we can do, awesome.

50
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.979
Now what if we wanted to say that,
when that input field changes,

51
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.588
let's validate that any of this works
before I get a little too overzealous.

52
00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:27.654
Let's see, if you don't,
let's say do we see the file, no.

53
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:29.480
&gt;&gt; No, I have values set to 0.

54
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.010
I might want to change it to dynamic,
to draft count.

55
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.858
&gt;&gt; Yep, there we go.

56
00:03:33.858 --> 00:03:37.717
Yeah, what I'm focusing on the type of
stuff sometimes I forget to think about

57
00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.220
the just the regular jobs, you know,
regular how things work in code.

58
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.940
Awesome, say 15.

59
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.290
And this is why you live code
with all of your friends.

60
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.340
&gt;&gt; The button doesn't
have a listen to There.

61
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.260
&gt;&gt; It's all, yeah.

62
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.400
Because this needs to go in the form
is what hap needs to happen.

63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.275
I don't want it on, you can't submit
an input field, or you can, but like,

64
00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:02.211
what I want is that to happen in the form
itself, which is the whole reason that I

65
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:06.350
made a form to begin with, was to make my
life easier for when we did this together.

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.007
Cool, now if I wanted, in this number then
update the input field I only decrement,

67
00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:18.376
we're only going down and I wired it
wrong which to be clear as someone who

68
00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:22.748
rehearses all this stuff I'm the point
where I've rehearsed it wrong so

69
00:04:22.748 --> 00:04:27.118
many times that now I do it wrong because
I think about increment reset and

70
00:04:27.118 --> 00:04:30.670
then decrement but
the buttons are in the opposite order.

71
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.375
But now I have like literally
just don't ever hear that so

72
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.500
many times that now it is what I do.

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.671
So that's great,
you learn to think about me today.

74
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:49.803
Awesome now do we need to say that when we
change the regular can we want to update

75
00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:50.845
the field as well?

76
00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:55.639
We don't I just need an excuse to use
a use effect hook just show you one

77
00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.510
little gotcha that might come up
with us effect is lots of gotchas.

78
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.185
Let me clarify one TypeScript gotcha
that might come up with you as

79
00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:10.200
affect us if effect is just basically
like, would you like a foot gun?

80
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.981
Cool, and so we'll give it a function
that says whenever count changes,

81
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.579
we also want to update the draft count.

82
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:26.785
And the only kind of real place that
TypeScript and use effect interact and

83
00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.822
this is a lot of times happens
with like a set timeout.

84
00:05:29.822 --> 00:05:34.422
As well and so I just kind of
JavaScript fanciness these days,

85
00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:38.323
which is unset,
draft count everything's great.

86
00:05:38.323 --> 00:05:41.183
Everything works good.

87
00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:46.196
The only place you will get yelled at is
if you're like, I'm going to be fancy and

88
00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:52.373
I don't like curly braces See this
actually gets because these returns

89
00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:56.239
void if you had something that returned to
the actual value here, it's like because

90
00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.843
normally if the returns it's expecting
a function returned to or undefined.

91
00:05:59.843 --> 00:06:08.151
And so, if we said, even,
Just return the count for instance, right?

92
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:12.429
You get yelled at because it has to be
undefined so just make sure if you ever

93
00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:16.845
see that you get confused is because
it's expecting either a deconstruct or

94
00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:20.020
function or undefined and
it will yell at you about it.

95
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.740
That is just the, it will happen
to you once in the next year.

96
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.350
You will get bitten by it.

97
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.461
Hopefully the sticks in your brain,
I have saved you a good 10 minutes.
