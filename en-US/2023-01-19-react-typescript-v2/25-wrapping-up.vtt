1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.791
I would say the heuristic to follow,
it's gonna be my kinda closing piece here.

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.815
Is there's deeper you can go
in terms of library code.

3
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:12.549
But on the practical scale of
things that the heuristic of what

4
00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.292
have I actually had to use
in the last little bit.

5
00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:18.231
This covers almost all of it, right?

6
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:22.049
Obviously, there are further explorations,
yes.

7
00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:23.741
And I put some links and
some reading material.

8
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:28.276
There's also, I added some stuff
around higher-order components,

9
00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:30.628
which I would say in the hook's era.

10
00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:33.755
I find myself more making hooks than
I make higher order components.

11
00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.724
Like how to pass through certain props.

12
00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.278
Some of this stuff exists,
but I gotta say,

13
00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:43.088
under the heuristic of what
are the stuff that you're gonna use?

14
00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:47.819
This is a core set that I find myself
in the large code bases that I've

15
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.230
worked on the last few years
using repeatedly, over and over.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.094
Questions?

17
00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:59.790
&gt;&gt; And
do you think it's a suitable scenario for

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.979
some cases when not to read it?

19
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.844
Let's say you have a couple of layers
of passengers, extra passengers at.

20
00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:10.766
And let's say you repass,
let's say you opted out of context,

21
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.951
can you repass much of properties?

22
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:18.288
Do you think it's also
a good idea if they're

23
00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:24.898
very closely coupled to
the prompts of the most bottom.

24
00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:28.499
Again, to say the same thing with
it we've got [INAUDIBLE] stages,

25
00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.763
do you think the prompts, because this.

26
00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:35.218
And this layer you just structure
a bit and let's say, at the top level,

27
00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:38.522
two properties plus,
whatever the lowest station.

28
00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.360
Then one property whatever,
the lowest, and

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.138
then end up with just
the most one [INAUDIBLE].

30
00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:48.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that I would do
and I think this answers the question is

31
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.297
probably start to think about,
what does composability look like, right?

32
00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:56.425
So for instance, one of the thoughts that
struck me as I was putting together that

33
00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.140
was it's not a particularly big app,
right?

34
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.364
Is let's see,
if I can do it real quick, next color.

35
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.375
I wrote that a lot, right?

36
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.546
And so it's not always the sole property,
right,

37
00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:18.940
to your point on every single object,
right?

38
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.279
One of the things that we do in this
strategy is start to think about

39
00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.260
the compostable.

40
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.405
There are a lot of things
that involve a hex color, but

41
00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:31.102
some of these,
it being a somewhat simple app.

42
00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:33.210
It involves some other things as well,
right?

43
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.560
And so what I might start to do is head
over, whether it's in global d.t or

44
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680
somewhere else like, it depends.

45
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.480
What I might start to do is like,

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.039
you know how we had props with
children that then could extend?

47
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.332
I find myself, there was a point where I
didn't know props with children existed

48
00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:50.040
and I wrote my own and
used it all the time.

49
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.804
It worked, it was great, but
a lot of times I might do is like,

50
00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:07.211
And I could say in this case, P.

51
00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.858
And now, I could theoretically
take any other set of props,

52
00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:23.293
like that might be one of
my lower level ones, right?

53
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:27.480
And like later on, I can be like,
hey, I want to add this together.

54
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.890
Now, I have it in one place.

55
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.255
It's utility type that I can like,
abstract and

56
00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:34.670
start to like compose together larger and
more advanced types.

57
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.220
And we talked a little bit
about interfaces versus types.

58
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.701
The other thing that I have done
over time is, you can do stuff.

59
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:57.926
Try thing another thing that I would need,
sure.

60
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.889
Right, and I might make,
Same basic concept and

61
00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.280
this is something I've done before
to like, honestly great fact.

62
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.643
And it's served me better
sometimes in a lot of fancy stuff.

63
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.485
And then you can say,
you can see where this is going, right?

64
00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:27.283
&gt;&gt; There's union
&gt;&gt; Yep, and

65
00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:28.987
you can begin to just compose them.

66
00:04:28.987 --> 00:04:32.260
This is normally what I ended up, yeah.

67
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.318
I have never had the diligence actually
called props with, props with, props with.

68
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:40.952
Because we did props with children
I was like, yeah, it seems good.

69
00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:42.708
A lot of times, I've just done with and

70
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.432
you can see like that one I've
had to work it out a little bit.

71
00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.623
I think I gotta admit some stuff and
play around.

72
00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.246
Also P, it's probably part of it.

73
00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:55.223
But the basic pattern, right,
not to get too into the weeds here, right,

74
00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:57.620
is that, yeah, it worked.

75
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.287
I can begin to compose these and
have the different sets of them.

76
00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:06.237
And if something is only expecting
hex color and it gets hex like,

77
00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:11.728
as long like it'll play around the types
as long as it is a set that works.

78
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:17.000
Unlike Java and C, and stuff like that you
don't have to be like in this type only.

79
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.813
If a function is expecting some with A and
B and you pass an object has A, B, and

80
00:05:20.813 --> 00:05:21.810
C and C is not used.

81
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.653
That fits the type, because it
doesn't see as irrelevant, right?

82
00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:27.792
And so you get some flexibility and

83
00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:31.344
TypeScript that you don't
get with other type systems.

84
00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:32.256
Cool, did I answer your question?

85
00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:33.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

86
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.173
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

87
00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:37.385
&gt;&gt; I think you just need to make,
like, at some point,

88
00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.163
it's trade off the mayabe
finding the role.

89
00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:41.801
&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, eexactly.

90
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:45.548
And I would encourage you to like,
think of like, consider that and

91
00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:49.780
think about that, cuz it is very tempting
to go on the Internet expedition.

92
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.166
And be like,
I should do this crazy pattern.

93
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:57.415
I've regretted it almost every time,
sometimes the next week,

94
00:05:57.415 --> 00:06:00.672
sometimes the my favorite
things are something.

95
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:05.350
2020 me,
thought that was a smart idea, right?

96
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.627
2022 me, regrets everything, right?

97
00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:12.113
And understanding that you live
with code bases for a long time and

98
00:06:12.113 --> 00:06:15.387
cleverness very frequently
comes to bite you.

99
00:06:15.387 --> 00:06:20.160
And explicitness sometimes bites you, but
at least it's just annoying bites, right?

100
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.593
Mike North has a full like just
TypeScript dedicated course where like go

101
00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:29.183
into like the internals for this,
which is that is useful in a lot of cases.

102
00:06:29.183 --> 00:06:32.438
But if we're just thinking about
the react layer you get a lot of

103
00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:35.278
the power from react to,
yeah, awesome, thank you.

104
00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:40.931
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
