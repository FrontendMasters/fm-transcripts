00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's talk about one more small
thing that makes me happy.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.800
Pop quiz for 75 points.

3
00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:12.370
They're points in super Mario,
they don't really do anything.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.595
What is the one thing that makes
me happier than anything else?

5
00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt; No anys.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.530
&gt;&gt; What's that?

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; No anys.

8
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.088
&gt;&gt; No anys, because what?

9
00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:24.179
What do anys mess up?

10
00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.670
&gt;&gt; Everything.
&gt;&gt; Everything.

11
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.257
&gt;&gt; But in particular autocomplete.

12
00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:32.540
[LAUGH] In particular,
autocomplete, right?

13
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.970
I tell everyone else in my team we're
using TypeScript for reliability and

14
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.820
type safety.

15
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750
It's totally why we use it.

16
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.960
Also, I like autocomplete.

17
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.054
It's amazing to me every
time that it works, right?

18
00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:49.530
You probably noticed
that as I was talking.

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.958
So I kinda typed an empty string
I saw those action names,

20
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.396
it's the first time that I
ever saw it in my life, right?

21
00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.010
Every time it makes me that happy.

22
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.752
So can I talk about what
doesn't make me happy,

23
00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:03.640
which is the opposite of
what makes me happy, right?

24
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.490
So let's take a look.

25
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:11.973
I have these, if you've never done this
you are my hero, and I appreciate you.

26
00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:15.990
Which is every app,
I'm like this time I'm not gonna do this.

27
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.755
And I'll have a button cuz maybe
I wanna have a primary button and

28
00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:25.640
a destructive button and
a secondary button, right?

29
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.790
Or the one that I always end up with.

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.455
Maybe I just wanna have
a form input that is

31
00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:39.290
a label wired up for the right ID, right?

32
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.515
And I don't have to put them both together
and then realize that they're both inline

33
00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:48.140
blocks and then change the styling on
the two of them, how they play together.

34
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.931
Or a buttoning component,
a submittable input feel.

35
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:57.938
When I worked at Twilio there was another
team that worked on the design system,

36
00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:03.514
I'm very glad that they worked on
the design system cuz I didn't want to.

37
00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:05.712
And yet on some small level,

38
00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:11.165
I end up having to build my own little
mini design system all the time.

39
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.400
It's just little stuff like this.

40
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.389
Like a button that I can use
that has the right styles and

41
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.005
all the things that I want, right?

42
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.215
Passed in.

43
00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.895
But here's the thing,
I'll do one you can do the other.

44
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:29.655
I think this is the one that annoys
me more so I'm gonna do this one.

45
00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:30.295
Okay.

46
00:02:32.664 --> 00:02:34.264
What do you notice about these prompts?

47
00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:41.764
How many of them are original and
once you've never seen before?

48
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.243
Technically only this one, right?

49
00:02:47.243 --> 00:02:50.190
That's just to put some label in here,
right?

50
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.705
The rest of these,
I am just passing through.

51
00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:01.697
And what would happen
the first time I needed to

52
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:06.690
autofocus one of these,
what I'd have to do?

53
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.677
I would have to add another prop.

54
00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:13.822
First time I wanna make
one of these required.

55
00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:17.532
If you don't have to do, add another prop.

56
00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:24.542
Yeah, I can keep going with this
example I think we get the point.

57
00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:31.340
In regular JavaScript,
I might choose to do something like this.

58
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.590
So label is special.

59
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.850
I think that's the only one that
was truly special, like Read Only.

60
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.795
I got yelled out about uncontrolled inputs
for the like, it's very rare that you show

61
00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:46.380
people app, where none of the state
management is hooked up, right?

62
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.080
Unless you're teaching.

63
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.071
So I was like, call it a Read Only if
there's no way to update the value.

64
00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:53.096
How about that?

65
00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:59.385
So that's bespoke cuz I was staging and
I was trying to be as like yelling at me.

66
00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:03.998
But generally speaking,
I really just wanna wire up HTML for

67
00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:06.448
it to the same ID as the input ID.

68
00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:09.151
And I would like to pass
on a custom label and

69
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:13.220
I would like to wrap it in a DIV
to treat it as one package, right?

70
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.979
I don't wanna do this all the time.

71
00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.951
So what I would end up doing
JavaScript is you just do label,

72
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.738
take the rest of the props, And

73
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:32.568
go in here, we'll keep my custom ID.

74
00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:34.530
I guess I'm gonna use the ID for

75
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.845
a second cuz I'm just in case it's
not a unique one I take this hook.

76
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:41.913
It's mostly for service ID rendering
it gives you unique identifier so

77
00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:43.709
I know that all my inputs have unique IDs.

78
00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:44.427
So keep that.

79
00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:49.470
We'll keep the read only in there
other than these two things.

80
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.950
Anything else that comes in,
Spread it out.

81
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.016
I guess I need on change in this case too.

82
00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:03.330
Cool, cool, but
you'll notice is angry with me, right?

83
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.087
One, cuz I didn't put a comma.

84
00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:06.260
And now it's angry.

85
00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:11.447
It should be somewhere else in a second.

86
00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:15.830
Well, I don't get any auto complete.

87
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.942
If I get rid of these now, ready?

88
00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:23.953
At least these.

89
00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:30.580
I can't use them so I get rid of
them here or the label I needed.

90
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.410
But you can see the red popping up.

91
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.880
It's like hey, these don't work and
stuff like that.

92
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.520
It's shows up on label but it's actually
saying, you gave it an on change.

93
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.760
I don't know anything about non change.

94
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.440
Now if this code were to compile,
if I change the file extension, it works.

95
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.944
But other fun stuff.

96
00:05:56.864 --> 00:05:58.068
No autofocus.

97
00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:03.200
No nothing, right?

98
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.011
So not only do they not compile,
this problem number one.

99
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.530
Problem number two,
I got no autocomplete, right?

100
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.460
And button is the same way.

101
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.930
I'll let you play around
with button in a second.

102
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.020
Like I want.

103
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.267
If wrapping a button,
especially like a button.

104
00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:24.913
I'm literally just returning a button.

105
00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:29.163
Pretend special button where
I'm just playing around with

106
00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:31.360
the classes a little bit.

107
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.290
Pretend you're a button, button,
who is a button that I've wrapped.

108
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.320
So what I really wanna
do is I want to create

109
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.720
a type where my custom stuff, label.

110
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.792
And then all the things
that are part of a regular,

111
00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:56.970
whatever the input field is.

112
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.001
And I think that was a yesterday question
before we saw it with component props,

113
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:04.270
without ref and component with ref and
stuff like that.

114
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.080
Which is there is a way to
access all of the props, right?

115
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.829
And so, what I can do is I
can basically say hello,

116
00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:17.918
I would like to create a type
that is my special stuff,

117
00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:22.980
plus all the types from another component.

118
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.150
And we can do that super easily.

119
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.438
And let's try it out with that
labeled input, where I started it.

120
00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:30.597
Which is okay, actually even these two.

121
00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:34.069
It was just label that I wanted.

122
00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.153
I wanted label to be string.

123
00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:43.410
And I'll change ,can be the normal one.

124
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.190
And so I'm getting yelled at all over
the place, everyone's angry with me.

125
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.756
And what I can do is I can basically say,

126
00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.220
If I don't think I'm gonna use a ref,
I'll start with this one and wait.

127
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.346
Which is to say,
take everything from an input.

128
00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:16.540
And now if I look at this,
it's grabbing it from the actual types.

129
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.869
It is literally everything from
the built in, which is an abstraction.

130
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.364
It's a set of abstractions.

131
00:08:23.364 --> 00:08:26.990
TypeScript has a lib dot DOM dot data, Ts.

132
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.889
Then there's JSX and Trinsic elements,

133
00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.120
which are like kinda JSX
wrappers on top of that.

134
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.394
Then there's all the React extra stuff,
like the React handlers, so on and

135
00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:37.500
so forth.

136
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.068
And so you can see I'm getting
some of that in place here.

137
00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:45.230
And you can also see nothing is
angry with me anymore, right?

138
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.272
Now because I'm spreading these all
on the right place, and theoretically

139
00:08:50.272 --> 00:08:56.350
you could override read only cuz actually
yeah, the prompts coming in afterwards.

140
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.950
So you could actually even override this
one too cuz it's like order of operations.

141
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.356
Cool set this one, set this one and
then this question on the order

142
00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:10.092
of operations on that but
it's not important right now.

143
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:13.163
Cool, so now if I go back to a place
where I was blowing up before.

144
00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:19.320
I get everything that
an input field can do.

145
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.897
And none of the stuff that I can't do,
right?

146
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.720
And all of that is kinda
built in with the article.

147
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.541
But as far as TypeScript is concerned,
my special labeled input,

148
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:34.044
is in fact has all the properties of an
input field cuz I was explicit about which

149
00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:36.490
ones were passing through, right?

150
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.670
And you could see how you
can take this technique.

151
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.154
You could like, okay, and a label,
but I wanna take some of these.

152
00:09:44.154 --> 00:09:46.226
There's danger with some of that.

153
00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:48.949
With all programming the fancier you get,

154
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:53.950
you start walking on the razor's edge
a little bit and just to be aware of that.

155
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.140
But generally speaking, for some of
these very simple mini design system

156
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.320
components that I end up creating,
I can definitely do that, right?

157
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.590
And it's a super powerful trick to do,
right?

158
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:13.112
&gt;&gt; Yeah, wouldn't this also require you
to pass, let's say there is a required

159
00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:18.300
property and something marking the input
as the props of some element when

160
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.510
this also force you to pass those required
properties in when you wouldn't otherwise.

161
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.676
&gt;&gt; I mean, if I'm wrapping I think
where they would be required,

162
00:10:28.676 --> 00:10:31.473
they're gonna be required one way or
the other, right?

163
00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:33.275
To answer your question, if for

164
00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:36.162
some reason I needed to get super nuanced,
right?

165
00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:40.257
And so
let's hypothetically answer the question.

166
00:10:40.257 --> 00:10:46.213
Let's say that for some reason,
the regular DOM components

167
00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:51.604
don't have any really required properties,
right?

168
00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:54.800
Cuz turns out the DOM Pre days TypeScript.

169
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.020
So it's fast and loose.

170
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.866
You've never seen the HTML page crash.

171
00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.910
Think that's a true statement?

172
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.860
JavaScript and crash HTML, the browser
will do everything to make it work.

173
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.804
But let's imagine we desperately
wanted to create one

174
00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:15.250
of these without autofocus, right?

175
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.811
At which point we pull out one of
those utility types we saw before.

176
00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:29.165
When we say omit, And

177
00:11:29.165 --> 00:11:35.110
you have to do this a lot of times
with more complicated components.

178
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.519
And then here we might say that,

179
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.690
I don't know, right?

180
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.210
[COUGH] And you could do something
along these lines, right?

181
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.686
Where you say, cool let's take a button
that's got everything but this and

182
00:11:51.686 --> 00:11:54.250
then I have thoughts on what
this one should be, right?

183
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.497
I'm yelled at because I said it
was required this time, right?

184
00:11:58.497 --> 00:12:00.130
I didn't put a question mark.

185
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.676
So now I can create one where I'm forcing
which to force autofocus on all of them

186
00:12:03.676 --> 00:12:05.680
was a weird choice on my behalf.

187
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.989
The easier with HTML it's easier to
answer the opposite of your question.

188
00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:14.890
You're like, what if some require
wanna make it optional, right?

189
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.644
In the case of HTML elements
where everything's optional,

190
00:12:17.644 --> 00:12:20.000
it's easy to make something required.

191
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.755
But by saying everything but
this, but then I have strong

192
00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:29.520
feelings about this,
actually we can make it required.

193
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.454
And if I omitted it completely,

194
00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:35.760
we have now removed the ability to
have autofocus whatsoever, right?

195
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.283
So you can compose and

196
00:12:37.283 --> 00:12:41.604
put together recipes of these
types in a super powerful way.
