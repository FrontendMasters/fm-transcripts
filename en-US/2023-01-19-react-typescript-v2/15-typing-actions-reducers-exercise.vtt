1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.897
I got it wired up with some amount

2
00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:07.380
of side road trips there to
the point where we got the RGB.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.137
Your, I'll push up this branch and

4
00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:12.430
we have one they'll kind of drop
in that's a steady state as well.

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.777
I'll push it both alive coding on
the steady state just to make sure.

6
00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:20.477
And good job is to choose your
own adventure at this point and

7
00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:23.223
we'll put it on the screen for perpetuity.

8
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:30.070
Is to, let's see.

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.990
We pass this fashion
as a prop here we are.

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.200
You can get,
you can follow me down my path.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.283
Get one or the other, either HSL or HSV
is working right and kind of just again,

12
00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:48.950
follow the path I put in the code
I'm about to share in the chat.

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.550
Or I'll have the branch up here as well.

14
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.158
Or if you wanna try to get one of
the color change swatches working,

15
00:00:56.158 --> 00:01:01.050
the idea being that when I click on
any of these colors, it should change.

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.920
Right and so that's an onclick event.

17
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.402
Should, that one just takes the hex code,
so

18
00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:05.845
you don't have to worry
about the trials and

19
00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:07.870
tribulations of my third party library.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.730
But you can click on one of these and
it should change the color as well.

21
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.940
So those are two different things.

22
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.451
You can either get one of these rows or
you can go ahead and

23
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.780
try to get click on one of
these to change the color.

24
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.980
It's the same basic idea.

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.030
It's passing dispatch down.

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.439
Through an intermediate component make
sure it's typed correctly make sure

27
00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.665
you have the action, right,
that seen all the fun autocomplete happen.

28
00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:40.073
So of the two missions
that I'm gonna solve for,

29
00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:44.210
I'm not going to do the one that
I did before, [LAUGH], right?

30
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.730
You're welcome to do that one.

31
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.087
But I am going to go do the other one,

32
00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:52.500
which is getting clicking on one
of those buttons to work, right?

33
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.740
I have two real choices.

34
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.666
I can get it working either, here or here,

35
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:04.440
considering there's two of these,
I'm gonna go this way also.

36
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.310
1989 Miami hotline, right?

37
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.324
This color is called and

38
00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.600
this branch that I switched it
to is called Aggressive Salmon.

39
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.330
I chose it cause of the name, right?

40
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.042
Cool, so kinda going through
we've got this color reducer and

41
00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.750
got this kind of all in place.

42
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.261
Let's go ahead and basically yeah, it's
a little bit of a change but also slightly

43
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.690
easier in some ways than the other one,
which is to go into application.

44
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.509
We've got dispatch already.

45
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:46.504
Do a little bit the same and like again
part of threading it through is setting

46
00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:50.966
us up for like would be cool overdrive
is the context API that great.

47
00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.634
But we'll get that set up.

48
00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:57.446
So following the red squiggly system
it's like yo that's it's not a prop

49
00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.485
on save colors like yeah
I'm gonna work down.

50
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:05.699
So here we can say, And

51
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:13.820
we'll say, I grabbed the just
kind of a base branch for

52
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.897
starting this and
this one's called collar actions.

53
00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:18.205
I do you need to pull this in,

54
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:20.837
which is better than the one
that had like a similar name?

55
00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:28.634
So we got that we can pass it through and
we'll take this.

56
00:03:30.697 --> 00:03:32.753
And you can see we get the nice
typing from everything and

57
00:03:32.753 --> 00:03:34.410
we'll get all the auto complete.

58
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.500
Everything's gonna be good.

59
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.750
So we've got this saved color.

60
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.899
And let's see on here can we do the ad
click, but we have to pass that through,

61
00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.685
we have to pass it through again.

62
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:49.580
And you could argue, could you do an on
click handler on here and pass it through.

63
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.020
I will show you how to
do that in a little bit.

64
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.880
I promise you.

65
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.333
Follow the red squigglies,
second album name.

66
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.718
Color actions.

67
00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:19.390
And then on the button,
that's the remove button.

68
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.120
We've got one more thread.

69
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.970
We could probably do it in here too.

70
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.002
I want it usable everywhere,

71
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:38.620
else it, Will dispatch.

72
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.130
And then we have the object where
we get all the autocomplete type.

73
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.710
Update hex color.

74
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.406
Now, since we're working with the hex
color I shouldn't have any of the issues

75
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:48.300
that I had before.

76
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.600
Famous last words, right?

77
00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:56.718
All right, so let's see how that went.

78
00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:04.639
So we got the on click on
the color change swatch.

79
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.060
Can I have, we did.

80
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.821
If you don't put it on
these they don't work.

81
00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:15.548
And it all works everything's good and
you can see all my complimentary and

82
00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.282
try colors change as well.

83
00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:21.736
Because it's all being created
from there 1989 Miami hotline.

84
00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:24.854
And so for funsies,
you can also wire these up.

85
00:05:24.854 --> 00:05:27.860
I'll give that a sec sorry so
Raiders the same basic idea.

86
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.887
That you can kind of pass
these through and use them.
