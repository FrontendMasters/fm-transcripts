2
00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.930
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So we do have an exercise.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.610
Exercise 1 helped to try and
drill that in to you a little bit.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.160
If you're not terribly comfortable with
that notion of wrapping something around

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.920
it, you'll notice that exercise 1 is
gonna say exactly what I just suggested,

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.440
and it's going to be very similar to that.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.940
So, let's pull up the README.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.850
I'll just orient you to exercise 1 very

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.200
quickly.
&gt;&gt; Kyle: ex1,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.246
we're gonna pull up the README and I'll
go ahead and pull up the ex1.js as well.

11
00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:40.238
So the README is gonna say,
make a pure function bar that wraps

12
00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:43.599
around the implied impure function foo.

13
00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.340
Let me zoom out just a little bit so
we can see.

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.702
There I have a foo that's doing something
very similar to what I'd just showed you

15
00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:50.345
in the slides.

16
00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:51.900
It is an impure function.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.720
It is making changes to a y and
z variable on the outside.

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.990
And each time I call foo
with a different value,

19
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm getting an actual
different end result.

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.526
And if I called foo with 20 each time,
I would still get different results.

21
00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:12.780
I wouldn't get the same results
every time with foo 20.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.730
So your task, very quickly,
is to define a bar,

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.190
a wrapper very much like the last
slide that I just showed you.

24
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.620
Define a bar or wrapper that turns
this program into a pure program.

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.020
Encapsulates all of that state.

26
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.150
I'll give you three to five minutes.

27
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.400
We'll take a break for
just a few minutes while you work on that.

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.880
And then I'll walk you
through the exercise.

29
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.130
Just as a reminder, as with all
my exercises, you'll notice that,

30
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.030
if you get stuck,
obviously you can ask questions.

31
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.750
But if you get stuck, the fixed version
of all these files is always available

32
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.270
to you in that same folder.

33
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.537
So, if you get stuck or
if you just wanna cheat,

34
00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:49.540
you can look at the fixed version of ex1.
