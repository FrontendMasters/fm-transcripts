00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; Kylel Simpson: Exercise 3.

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.250
Let's pull up Exercise 3.

4
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.384
Do a tad bit of experimentation with
our understanding of recursion.

5
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Kylel Simpson: Exercise 3.

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.290
Take mult, which is already defined,

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.710
turn it into a recursive function that can
work on as many arguments as necessary.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.650
So what is mult,
how is mult currently defined?

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.100
It only works with three parameters x,
y and z.

10
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.973
Line seven would create a problem for

11
00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:47.723
us because it's still going to return
60 instead of 360 the way we expect.

12
00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:50.459
You could do this intuitively with for
loop, and

13
00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:53.809
if that helps you turn it first
into an intuitive solution.

14
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.320
If that helps.

15
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.630
But the exercise here is to ask yourself
what is the multiplication of all

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.100
these arguments?

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.840
And by the way, it's going to

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.920
look an awful lot like that last
slide that we just looked at.
