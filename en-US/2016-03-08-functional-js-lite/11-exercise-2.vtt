2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.686
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Pull
exercise two up with me.

3
00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:11.378
Again, pull up the read me and the EX2.js.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'll go ahead and

4
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.000
close exercise one,
since we're not using that anymore.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.888
Let's look at the read me for
exercise two.

6
00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:18.625
It says define foo so
that it produces a function,

7
00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.342
we've already seen that, and
that function needs to remember only

8
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:25.030
the first two arguments
that were passed to foo.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.243
And then the function
that we've returned back,

10
00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:34.087
it needs to always add those two together.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Parse

11
00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:38.109
through that read me.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Make sure you fully

12
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.459
understand what it's asking for,

13
00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:43.506
here's the set up.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I should be able to make

14
00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:47.268
a function called x that's already
remembering the 3 and the 4, and

15
00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:54.034
every time I call x I'm gonna get 7 out.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Not

16
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:58.134
very many lines of code, but let's make
sure you have your brains wrapped around

17
00:00:58.134 --> 00:00:59.720
how we can use closure, okay?
