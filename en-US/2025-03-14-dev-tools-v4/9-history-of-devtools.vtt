WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.708
With that done,
let's get back to some slides and

2
00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:05.746
kind of talk about a very
brief History of the DevTools.

3
00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:10.200
Did anybody develop websites
before we had any DevTools at all?

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.990
Does anybody develop back,
okay, so we got one.

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.565
So when you think about the things
that actually kinda come over the wire

6
00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.591
that you might actually have access to,

7
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.345
like what we used to have was
just the raw HTML, right?

8
00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.705
So we've had View page source for

9
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:28.851
a long time since the launch
of some of these old browsers.

10
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:33.056
But they're not interactive or
colored or attributes aren't applied,

11
00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.458
CSS isn't applied,
it's just a big blob of text, right?

12
00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:37.572
And so we had this, and

13
00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:41.683
we actually did have a tool where we could
feedback information the other way before

14
00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:45.047
we had console log because that's
obviously tied to the debugger.

15
00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:48.094
We had alert statements,
which we still have today, right?

16
00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:49.933
And so alert statements were great.

17
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.685
So you would put in an alert, and then you
would refresh your page and then boom it

18
00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:57.395
would pop up this alert that's really
hard to get away and this worked, okay.

19
00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:00.813
So you can see here like my
website says current postid is 17,

20
00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:02.372
I've logged out my postid.

21
00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:06.823
The problem with alert statements is
that they don't handle anything except

22
00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:07.990
primitive values.

23
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.612
So the second you have any arrays or
objects,

24
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:13.727
you get the two string version
of the array or object.

25
00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:15.241
And so you would get object.

26
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.924
And so then what you would do in
your debugging is you'd make a for

27
00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.275
loop around the thing, right?

28
00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.284
And you would do object keys, and
you would log each object key.

29
00:01:22.284 --> 00:01:25.432
And so this is what we had for
quite a long time.

30
00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:29.319
So it got me interested in,
when I was prepping this course,

31
00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.672
the history of developer tools, how we got
from where we were to where we are today.

32
00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:38.482
And so I made this brief history
of DevTools for the web,

33
00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.032
which was kinda cool.

34
00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:44.679
So the web launched, arguably, in 93, and
it had the view source where you could see

35
00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.748
the HTML, and it had alert,
and those were what you had.

36
00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:51.264
And then we had many years until
Netscape offered console log.

37
00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:55.111
And so it actually didn't have a DevTool,
but it had a JavaScript console that you

38
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.478
could open in a new tab,
and you could see things.

39
00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:01.364
Many, many years later,
Firefox releases firebug, which was like,

40
00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:05.079
in my opinion the spiritual beginning
of all of this DevTool stuff.

41
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.232
It looked very much like Chrome DevTools
still look, it functioned similarly.

42
00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:12.999
And this is 2006, and
we really kinda stayed on this track.

43
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.418
Google followed with their
own Chrome DevTools.

44
00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:18.659
Eventually apps got bigger,
bundling started happening.

45
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.760
So source maps were created by a team
at Google at the time to help you,

46
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.611
kinda debug minified code or
transpiled code.

47
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.834
Eventually, we got new
panels like performance, and

48
00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:32.137
then Firefox came out, and
they re imagined DevTools.

49
00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:34.796
It was this big thing that
they did in 2017 where they

50
00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:37.525
started from the beginning and
built their own DevTool.

51
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:42.294
I don't know if anybody remembers, but
had this really cool three JS style layout

52
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:46.457
where you could to rotate the website and
see layers, it's very cool.

53
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.792
And then eventually Edge adopts Chromium
moving to the kinda current Chrome is

54
00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.297
essentially the standard across browsers.

55
00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:57.340
And then I posted this on LinkedIn and
people got really mad.

56
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.256
Okay, so
then I re-edited it from the anger.

57
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:03.534
And I made a more proper history of
DevTools, which is the same thing,

58
00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:06.157
with some additions that I
think are really important.

59
00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:10.782
So in that era between a basic console
log and having an actual inspector,

60
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:14.898
there are actually quite more
fundamental changes that happen.

61
00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:18.590
So I think first, before Firebug and
I didn't know this.

62
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.595
There was a person whose
last name is Venkman,

63
00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:26.529
who built five really influential
community tools around Firefox that were

64
00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:31.249
all about seeing sources or
console logging or step through debugging.

65
00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.393
And they really were the kind of
the person who kinda idealized a lot of

66
00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:38.262
the stuff,
which eventually became Firebug.

67
00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.258
Similarly, and
then there's the HTTP traffic monitoring,

68
00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:44.379
which we kind of take for
granted as part of the Chrome DevTools.

69
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.446
Those are actually standalone protocols,
right?

70
00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:49.404
And so Charles Proxy,
I don't know if anybody's used it before.

71
00:03:49.404 --> 00:03:53.131
You said you do a lot of network stuff,
came out totally not related to

72
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.831
the browser, but
it did allow you to intercept and

73
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.648
debug through all the network traffic
that happens on your computer.

74
00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:03.288
There were more cool things like DOMi me,
DOM inspector,

75
00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:06.127
which I never knew about
all before Firebug.

76
00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:09.168
Everything else stays the exact same,
but I just missed a bunch of stuff.

77
00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:12.178
So HTTP support and
a bunch of these cool experiments, and

78
00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.136
I posted this to blue sky,
feeling very proud of myself.

79
00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:18.103
And then people got even
more angry on blue sky.

80
00:04:18.103 --> 00:04:19.730
So I missed a lot more things,

81
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.649
which I just wanna cover quickly to
give people credit for what's due.

82
00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:24.752
I didn't know this,

83
00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:29.182
Microsoft actually beats Mozilla having
the first consolely script debugger tool.

84
00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:32.585
A tool I never heard about called
Microsoft Script Debugger,

85
00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:36.446
which is a whole separate windows
application that you had to load that

86
00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:39.865
would allow you to kind of console
log out things I had no idea.

87
00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:43.457
We're talking 1998, Venkman, Charles
Proxy, DOMi all that stuff is cool.

88
00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:46.881
Firefox also had a web developer toolbar,
which I actually did use, but

89
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:47.676
I forgot about.

90
00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:49.423
So instead of being an app inspector,

91
00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:52.916
is this really cool toolbar back when
web was fun, which would have all these

92
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:56.423
different buttons where you could see
all the scripts and things like that.

93
00:04:56.423 --> 00:04:59.896
YSlow independently launched
their first page analyzer,

94
00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:02.403
I don't know if anyone's used it before.

95
00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:06.149
But you put in your URL, and
it runs a bunch of tests on it and

96
00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.069
tells you know way
precursor to lighthouse.

97
00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:14.304
Webkit launched their web inspector
very early on, I didn't know that.

98
00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:18.053
Google, this company called Dynatrace
made the first like Ajax editor,

99
00:05:18.053 --> 00:05:21.867
or remember when synchronous JavaScript
like Google Maps first came out.

100
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:26.310
They made this Ajax thing where you could
see what called what, all this cool stuff.

101
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.618
Google, I forgot, had a whole page speed
analyzer before that predates lighthouse.

102
00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:34.531
Source maps the same,
performance panel cool.

103
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.014
Lighthouse came out in 2016,
a lot of this stuff is kinda similar,

104
00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:40.059
except in 2018 I did wanna point out.

105
00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:44.036
A lot of people said that these new tools,
these developer browsers, like Sizzy and

106
00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:47.397
Polypane, has started launching
in around 2018, 2019, and

107
00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.935
they definitely belong as
part of this story as well.

108
00:05:49.935 --> 00:05:54.035
So I hope now that this multipage
list will stand as a pretty

109
00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:57.559
good testament to the kind
of history of DevTool.

110
00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.610
So we went from only view source and

111
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.242
console to all the tools
that we have today.

112
00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:06.258
But I think an important thing is nobody
came off with this big genius work,

113
00:06:06.258 --> 00:06:08.320
all these things build on each other.

114
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.248
And it was a lot of Microsoft,
a lot of Mozilla, a lot of Google,

115
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:14.355
all kind of working together to
provide these really great things.

116
00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:16.391
This was Firebug, what year was it?

117
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:20.387
What did I say, Firebug is 2006.

118
00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:23.996
And this looks pretty much
what we've got now, right?

119
00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:26.956
I mean, you've got your console and
your HTML,

120
00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:30.576
then it's got the DOM on the left and
the style on the right.

121
00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:34.296
And I don't know, this is pretty cool,
2006 to now 2025, and

122
00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:37.032
they really nailed it with
the way this thing looks.

123
00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:38.232
It's very, very nice.
