00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:03.696
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So I'll go over to
the lessons, and I will click on audits,

2
00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:05.374
feel free to follow along.

3
00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:09.051
And I'm gonna go ahead and open up
the dev tools, go to lighthouse, and

4
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:12.485
I'll just choose the fresh navigation,
choose desktop app, and

5
00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:16.734
I'll choose all four categories, just so
we can get a nice look at them together.

6
00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:20.355
So I'll hit analyze here, and in the
background, it's gonna go to a bunch of

7
00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:24.056
refreshes and implement all of its
instrumentation, all that kind of stuff.

8
00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.085
And it'll take a couple
of seconds to load, but

9
00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.535
it'll ultimately generate
a really nice report for us.

10
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.826
I like these little loading
stats about performance,

11
00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:35.187
like most global users are on
kind of interesting, or,

12
00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:39.277
like Pinterest made a bunch of
success with this thing or whatever.

13
00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.687
Anyway, so nice stuff to read,

14
00:00:40.687 --> 00:00:43.578
like a video game loading screen
while you're waiting for this.

15
00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:47.100
But I do think some of this stuff is
really helpful building empathy like

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.988
when's last time you tested
your app on a 2G connection?

17
00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:51.690
A lot of people,
it's gonna be never, right?

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.734
How fast does it load?

19
00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.515
How slow is it really?

20
00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.705
All right, there were issues,
the page did not present any context.

21
00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:00.772
I don't know what's going on here,
hold on a second.

22
00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:03.990
Typical turn it off and
on again, kind of thing.

23
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.896
Okay, here we go.

24
00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:08.330
So we get this nice lighthouse audit,
and we can see on this plain static HTML

25
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.227
page where not much is going on,
we did very well for ourselves,

26
00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:14.125
which is great, but on real
applications that run JavaScript or

27
00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.991
have lots of images,
you'll probably get differing scores.

28
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.365
So I wanted to point out a few things so
it breaks down into the categories that

29
00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:23.708
we covered above performance,
accessibility, best practices and SEO.

30
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.523
And then we can kind
of dive into each one.

31
00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:29.635
And you can see like performance,
it gives you the actual numbers

32
00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:33.621
from your web core vitals metrics
like it took 0.2 seconds.

33
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:34.924
There is no blocking time.

34
00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:38.652
You can view the screenshots as
the page loads, which is very nice.

35
00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:39.949
You can view all audits.

36
00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:43.376
So you can look for just certain ones,
like time to first byte and

37
00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:45.353
you get all these recommendations.

38
00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:48.993
So basically what you will see on
a real website when you load one and

39
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:53.098
it has a score is you'll see all these
different diagnostic suggestions.

40
00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:57.173
If you were to minify your JavaScript,
you could potentially say 56 kilobytes.

41
00:01:57.173 --> 00:02:00.052
If you were to enable text
compression on the server side,

42
00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:02.242
you could save an additional 5 kilobytes.

43
00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:05.841
Your static assets don't have cash
policies, all this different stuff.

44
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:09.863
And the great thing here is that for
any rule that you're unsure about,

45
00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:14.356
you can click on it and they will always
have links to a really nice documentation

46
00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:19.008
section on their website explaining why
this flags and what you could do about it.

47
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.240
Some of these will be client side only.

48
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.622
Like, hey, your HTML needs a meta tag.

49
00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:27.307
Other ones might be server side as well,
like, hey, this asset's being sent down,

50
00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:29.775
but it doesn't have a cache head or
something like that.

51
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.318
So they won't all be fixable for
you if you're a front end engineer, but

52
00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:36.803
they are all suggestions that you
should at least kind of read through,

53
00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:40.434
understand where they're coming from and
what could be done to fix them.

54
00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:44.136
So we'll go through kind of that
performance section, which is great.

55
00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:47.759
Then we can also look at all the past
audits, like all these things that worked

56
00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.660
well and they didn't feel any to warn us
about our images are the right size, blah,

57
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.491
blah, blah, we've minified our CSS,
things like that.

58
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.629
We'll scroll down a little bit further
into accessibility, and we'll see things

59
00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.898
like, we passed our accessibility audit
for 100 but they have some suggestions.

60
00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.648
These are things that you should manually
check that they're not able to check with

61
00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:06.325
Lighthouse Audit.

62
00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:10.129
So, can controls be keyboard focusable?

63
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.476
Are interactive elements, do they
clearly state their purpose and state?

64
00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:16.925
A lot of this stuff I'll cover in my other
course, but it's good to know here that

65
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:19.714
they are not only giving you a score
on the stuff they can test, but

66
00:03:19.714 --> 00:03:23.192
they're giving you a really concise list
of stuff that they could not test here.

67
00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:24.951
So I'll go ahead and hide that.

68
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:26.558
Move into best practices.

69
00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:28.325
So again, we saw this warning earlier.

70
00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:32.772
This page doesn't have an HTML doc type,
which triggers Quirks mode.

71
00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:37.308
And so if we wanted to, we could add
that doc type HTML at the very top.

72
00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:40.332
Similarly, we don't have CSP, or
we could use these different policies,

73
00:03:40.332 --> 00:03:42.474
all these different things,
they're really nice.

74
00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:44.302
A lot of these are going
to be server side, but

75
00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:46.096
you can see that we
passed all these audits.

76
00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:47.950
We have three not applicable,

77
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.455
and then we've got some manual
ones to suggest to try out.

78
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:55.074
And then SEO, we can see that the document
doesn't have a meta description.

79
00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:58.763
If we're curious about that, again, we
can deep link to their documentation and

80
00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:01.545
see that they recommend us adding
this meta description tag,

81
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:04.555
which would be what shows up in
the search results page for Google.

82
00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:06.170
Yeah, so
we can kind of click through here.

83
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.830
This one not super exciting.

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.595
The exercise that we'll go into in a
minute here should be a lot more exciting.

85
00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:15.896
But the basic idea is that this is
a great starting place when you're doing

86
00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:17.026
performance analysis.

87
00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:20.621
You just come here, you run a Lighthouse
Audit, you see kind of your scores and

88
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:24.217
things that you care about, and you can at
least get a good idea of where to start

89
00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:27.138
off, like what things are slow,
what things need attention.

90
00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:30.050
I think with that,
we will turn it over to the exercise, and

91
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.453
we can all take some time running
these Lighthouse audits together.

92
00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:35.806
Unless anybody has any questions
before we start on that.

93
00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:37.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the lighthouse,
online or offline,

94
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.417
is it just looking at
what's been downloaded?

95
00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:44.327
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It does a full, this is
a great question for the navigation type,

96
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:48.721
right, which is this one,
it will do a full online fetch.

97
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:52.390
And what I mean by that is if you were to
say, turn your Wi-Fi off and hit this,

98
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.366
that would be the way you would simulate
your service workers and things like that.

99
00:04:56.366 --> 00:05:00.094
So it will go out and it will fetch
all these things for the snapshot.

100
00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:02.771
It doesn't need to because it won't
fetch any additional stuff, so

101
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.656
it'll work offline.

102
00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:08.020
But either way, it will attempt a full
organic refresh with navigation and

103
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.385
do what it can do with that kind of stuff.
