00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:03.091
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If somebody
were using edge dev tools,

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.969
how much different would
they be in your opinion?

3
00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:09.377
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, no, so,
yeah, that's a great question.

4
00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:13.450
So edge now is fully chromium-based,
so it'll be the exact same dev tools.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.398
They might be a few versions behind, but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So it's almost a mirror,

6
00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:19.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so-

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.067
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Same edge?

8
00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.842
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, so
it is the same like edge.

9
00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:28.923
Edge uses V8, so JavaScript tests will
pass in the same as both of them.

10
00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:30.778
It does quite a lot of different things.

11
00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:32.692
It's more than just
the UI that's different.

12
00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:35.672
Like they block things or
allow things or deprioritize,

13
00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.470
they still have a lot of things that
make them like a more unique browser.

14
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.204
But yeah, all JavaScript will execute
the same in both browsers and

15
00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:47.706
the dev tools will look
the same in both browsers.

16
00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:49.702
And then Firefox has their own unique set,
and then a Safari and

17
00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:50.540
Opera use the WebKit set.

18
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.646
So there's kind of three dev tools.

19
00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:57.141
So, yeah, like Edge and Chrome and
then although Chrome reskins.

20
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:01.270
So DuckDuckGo and Brave,
those all use the same.

21
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.080
There might be a few versions behind
cuz they might have built a while ago,

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.589
but they'll be the exact same code for
the dev tools.

23
00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:13.765
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is it possible to collate
coverage analysis across multiple pages?

24
00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.136
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No,
that's such a cool idea.

25
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:20.827
I think that should be like you could
be able to like start collation, and

26
00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:22.108
then click around, no.

27
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:26.560
I think that if you do it through
instead of the coverage tab,

28
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.972
if you do it through the Performance tab,
then you can start a recording,

29
00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:37.671
click on Each page, and that coverage
number will be accurately reflected.

30
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:42.369
But I think the actual little,
Coverage sub-tab is current coverage.

31
00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.242
Awesome.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

32
00:01:43.242 --> 00:01:45.141
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Thank you all very much.

33
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:48.508
Yeah, really appreciate all the questions.
