00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.839
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Why
master Chrome DevTools?

2
00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.830
I was thinking about this as my pitch for
why to take this course, or

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.842
why I've been so obsessed with
these tools throughout my career.

4
00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.963
And I think I've kind of broken
it down into three categories.

5
00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:16.731
One of them is the idea of
becoming a web performance expert.

6
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.675
So I think forever,
in the past and in the future,

7
00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:24.881
squeezing out more performance from your
application is always incredibly valuable.

8
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:28.394
So I think it can be something
that differentiates you on a team,

9
00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.517
being somebody who is really
invested in performance and

10
00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:33.155
can help make the app faster.

11
00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:37.770
I also think it can help differentiate
your company, if you have, say, a startup,

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.810
being a faster, better working version
of an app can be really powerful.

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.275
And we'll go into a little bit of
Google's studies on performance and

14
00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:49.224
how much kind of it can affect the bottom
line of different types of businesses.

15
00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:53.412
Maybe my favorite reason that I love the
tools is to quickly become the one on your

16
00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:56.301
team that fixes or
digs into really complicated bugs.

17
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.713
So I think we've all been there where
we've had some bug report comes in.

18
00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:03.692
And it's hard to reproduce or it can only
be reproduced in a very certain state and

19
00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:07.278
you put some logging in and it's not
really triggering the way you want.

20
00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:08.408
At a certain point,

21
00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:12.872
you'll need tooling to be able to better
understand your application itself.

22
00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.423
And I think that Chrome DevTools
offers a lot of that.

23
00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:18.875
We'll get into today with CPU and
memory profiling or

24
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:23.336
step through debugging, being able
to walk up and down call stacks.

25
00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:27.734
And really understand your application,
even being able to understand why the UI

26
00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:31.570
changes without even knowing where
in the source code that comes from.

27
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.593
So there's all sorts of cool things that
the DevTools can give you that can kind of

28
00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:39.730
make you the person on the team to reach
out and say, hey, I'll take that one,

29
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.058
I can go ahead and
look at that and fix that bug.

30
00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:46.332
And the third thing is just being able to
prototype quickly, whether that's in HTML

31
00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:50.318
and CSS with the kind of element view,
and being able to quickly build a new UI.

32
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.315
Or whether it's with the console, and

33
00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.763
being able to kind of hop quickly
grab an HTML element from the DOM and

34
00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:58.625
do some operations on it and
see in real time how it goes.

35
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:02.616
Alternatively, just in the sources tab,
being able to make quick edits to your

36
00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:06.132
JavaScript right there, can I think
really help you get a prototype of

37
00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:09.725
something really, really quick,
and I think that's very valuable.

38
00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.678
So the first point, the performance thing.

39
00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:16.546
Google over the years has sort of led
the way with a lot of these doing out in

40
00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:18.207
the open performance audits.

41
00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.855
Trying to really get to the bottom of,
does performance matter?

42
00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:23.263
And if so, how much does it matter?

43
00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:27.561
How can we quantify it and kind of
leveraging that in order to help them get

44
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.248
budget to build out
their own amazing tools.

45
00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:34.569
So for those that have seen Google
PageSpeed Insights, or Google Lighthouse,

46
00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.512
or the DevTools themselves,
Google has invested in all of these tools.

47
00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.791
And the reason why is because when they
work with their partner companies,

48
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.174
they really do find that squeezing out
performance from your application can

49
00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:47.065
make a huge difference to the bottom line.

50
00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:48.752
So for those that are not familiar,

51
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:52.802
there's this really great website,
web.dev, that's maintained by Google, but

52
00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.181
it has contributions from
all over the Internet.

53
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:58.507
And they've got all these really amazing
studies and they keep publishing them,

54
00:02:58.507 --> 00:02:59.772
they keep them up-to-date.

55
00:02:59.772 --> 00:03:01.976
So, here was one that
they did with Renault,

56
00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:04.130
this is one of their partner applications.

57
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.752
And they essentially worked
on one of their metrics,

58
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:10.026
which we'll get into in a little bit,
Largest Contentful Paint.

59
00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:14.378
And they basically released all of these
different versions of the website where

60
00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:18.604
they were working on optimizing the render
to be faster and faster and faster.

61
00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:21.746
And at the same time, they used
an analytics engine to look at conversion

62
00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.643
rate from this particular page,
that was like signing people up.

63
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:28.931
And they found this really, really
dramatic relationship, where, essentially,

64
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:32.817
the faster they could get the rendering,
which is on the x-axis to the left.

65
00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:37.124
If the Largest Contentful Paint
was 0.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds,

66
00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:40.075
then they had extremely
high conversion rates.

67
00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.513
It's like 35% plus,
which is incredible for a marketing site.

68
00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:46.988
And as they would tweak it and release
these AB tests with slower and slower,

69
00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:48.292
Largest Contentful Paint,

70
00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:52.054
the conversion rate dropped all the way
down to maybe 16% something like that.

71
00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:55.027
So this is a simple example of a form,
because it's simple to measure and

72
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:55.823
things like that.

73
00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:59.394
But you can really think about it for
your application that,

74
00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:04.086
if the difference between a kind of fast
and a really fast page could be something

75
00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:08.093
like 15% conversions on whatever
it is that you're working on.

76
00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:12.479
Similarly, they did a bunch of
aggregate analysis of retail sites and

77
00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.228
travel sites and found things like, well,

78
00:04:15.228 --> 00:04:19.632
what if we could improve the full
load by 0.1 seconds, basically.

79
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:21.774
Something that would seem kinda small.

80
00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:26.098
And then took a look at conversion
rates again, and on these retail sites,

81
00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:30.699
such a small improvement led to 8.4%
increase, with retail sales, and for

82
00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.056
travel sites, a 10.1% increase.

83
00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:37.270
And there's a link here, they speculate
on a lot of different reasons that people

84
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.192
often give up on certain shopping
journeys when things are taking too long.

85
00:04:41.192 --> 00:04:43.058
Meanwhile, if they're really, really fast,

86
00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:45.614
you're more encouraged to kind of
ride that high to the checkout.

87
00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:49.175
There's all sorts of reasons for it, but
it is really interesting making the case

88
00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:52.680
that I think we have this tendency to be
like, well, the site's fast enough, or

89
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.681
something like that.

90
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:58.595
But the reality is that speeding it up
can have dramatic effects on your company

91
00:04:58.595 --> 00:04:59.344
as a whole.

92
00:04:59.344 --> 00:05:02.894
Another thing to kind of
always keep in mind, I think,

93
00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:06.289
one of the traps of web
performance is falling into,

94
00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.861
if you're in a country where you
have access to fiber speed Internet.

95
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:16.607
And you're on a brand new MacBook Pro or
really, really powerful Windows laptop.

96
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:20.744
And so you've got this incredibly fast
connection, a great CPU, great memory, and

97
00:05:20.744 --> 00:05:22.653
the website loads really fast for you.

98
00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:23.707
And it's like, okay, that's great.

99
00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:27.361
But if you're trying to reach into
emerging markets, I think it's really

100
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.363
important to get benchmarks on how your
site performs on average network speeds,

101
00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:32.302
average devices.

102
00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:35.698
This is especially true for phones,
but it's true for laptops as well.

103
00:05:35.698 --> 00:05:38.120
So I think a lot of big
companies will do kind of,

104
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.574
I remember when I worked at Twitter,
we used to throttle the network

105
00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.385
the first Tuesday of the month or
something like that.

106
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.419
As a forcing function to gain empathy, for

107
00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.477
what it's when you're not on
this hyper-fast fiber network.

108
00:05:49.477 --> 00:05:54.376
And it led to a bunch of really cool
initiatives basically trying to

109
00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:56.046
make the site faster.

110
00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:59.493
So, a lot to kind of think about there,
but the ultimate takeaway is that,

111
00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:02.233
I think, performances,
obviously it's important, but

112
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:05.338
I think it's maybe even more
important than we give it credit for.

113
00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:08.712
It can really affect
the success of your company.

114
00:06:08.712 --> 00:06:13.401
Another thing to consider with with speed
in general, is that many years ago,

115
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:18.022
Google and now almost all search engines
have made the public decision to take

116
00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:20.455
speed into account for search ranking.

117
00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:23.276
So truly, you can kind of tick off
all of your SEO checklist, but

118
00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:25.367
if your site's slower
than your competitors,

119
00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:28.367
there's a really good chance that
they'll be ranked above yours.

120
00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:31.761
So if you're in any kind of company
that relies on this kind of

121
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:36.490
organic search traffic, speed can also be
not only important for conversions, but

122
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.105
really important for
actually getting seen in the first place.
