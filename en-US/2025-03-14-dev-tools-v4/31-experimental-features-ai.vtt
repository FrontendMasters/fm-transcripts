00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Awesome, okay, so let's
just talk about two other things that

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.854
we'll kind of just talk through together.

3
00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:08.799
So the first one I covered very briefly,
but there's so much cool stuff

4
00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.626
going on with Chrome DevTools experiments,
and I really think they're worthwhile.

5
00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:16.904
So with the DevTools open,
you can go to the setting cog, and

6
00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:21.040
then you can go to the Experiments, and
you can see this huge list of things.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.470
There's really,
really cool stuff going on in here.

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.555
Some of the very early stage
ones only have a title,

9
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.082
it's kinda on your own
to guess what it did.

10
00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.608
But as they get a little bit later stage,

11
00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:38.174
they'll often link through to
some kind of DevTools page

12
00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:42.948
where you can see specifically what
it's there for and what it's used for.

13
00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.724
So yeah, there's all sorts of stuff.

14
00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:48.501
There's these cool accessibility ones and
accessibility tree.

15
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.923
At the beginning of class, somebody
was asking about a font editor, so

16
00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:53.016
there is font editor.

17
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:56.366
So you can enable this, and
then you go to the Styles tab.

18
00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.654
And you can see now with this font editor,
you can kind of play with the fallbacks

19
00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:03.866
and the family and the sizes,
some really neat stuff here.

20
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:08.609
These are always changing, they're not
guaranteed to stay, sometimes they won't.

21
00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.020
And additionally, sometimes they can
cause crashes or strange behavior.

22
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.717
These are very experimental features, but
there's all sorts of cool stuff here.

23
00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:20.812
I honestly feel like this is pretty
worth checking out from time to time.

24
00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:25.334
That being said, if you want something
a little bit more user-friendly,

25
00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:28.563
this New in DevTools kind of
series that they have over

26
00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:32.038
on developer.chrome.com is
just such a great series.

27
00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:34.399
They always have videos and blog posts and

28
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.202
all sorts of stuff about their extensions
and their DevTools and Chrome in general.

29
00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:41.021
There's lots of really cool stuff here.

30
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.963
So yeah, so
I think experiments are really cool.

31
00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:47.133
And then the last thing that I wanted
to talk about was the AI innovations.

32
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.146
Cuz everybody already built
stuff with AI these days.

33
00:01:51.146 --> 00:01:52.617
I actually think they've
done a really good job here.

34
00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:55.609
So there's two different AI
innovations that they've added.

35
00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.239
So again, starting from the DevTools on
any page, you can go to the settings cog.

36
00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.883
You can go to AI Innovations, and then you
can turn on these two different things.

37
00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:08.463
So there's two different ones, there's
Console Insights and AI assistance.

38
00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:11.139
So I'm gonna go ahead and
just turn both of them on for now.

39
00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.505
I think when I close this, it'll tell
me maybe that I need to restart,

40
00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:16.622
maybe it won't.

41
00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:18.593
Let's see if it just works, it does, okay.

42
00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:20.178
So yeah, there's two things, basically.

43
00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:24.360
So one of them, if we go into debugging,
so we've got this error.

44
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.791
One nice new thing with this AI is this
kind of understand this error with AI

45
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:29.298
thing.

46
00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.165
I think this one is pretty decent.

47
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.419
I do think it's pretty wordy, and

48
00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.710
it's not always necessarily getting
you to where you need to be.

49
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.946
But it at least tells you this came
because this thing was empty, and

50
00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:45.754
here's maybe an idea of how to fix it or
something like that.

51
00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:51.206
It does not get the right answer here,
but it looks cool.

52
00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.571
What more can you want from AI?

53
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.925
Cool looking and almost there.

54
00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:57.551
The one that I think is a lot
cooler is this Elements panel.

55
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:01.507
So pretty much anywhere now, when you're
scrolling around on different elements and

56
00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:03.962
things like that,
you can click this little button.

57
00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:08.396
And then this will be a more
traditional ChatGPT style AI prompt.

58
00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:13.429
So what's cool about it is that
it's very contextually aware.

59
00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:20.245
So for an example, I used it earlier,
oops, I used it earlier.

60
00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:25.803
Because I was looking at one of our
exercises, and I think it was this one.

61
00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:34.547
And I had all these little list
item lists were like this, right?

62
00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:39.057
And they looked really bad, and I was
like, I think there's some API that I can

63
00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:42.289
use to get these when you're
doing text-align:center.

64
00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.424
And I was, actually,
I should see if the AI can do this,

65
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.841
cuz it's very contextually aware.

66
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.419
So I went to the list item,
I went to the AI prompt.

67
00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.177
You can see the AI prompt brings
in this list item kind of cursor,

68
00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:56.045
where you bring in the file
you want it to work on.

69
00:03:56.045 --> 00:04:01.708
So I can say,
the bullet points are super far away,

70
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.746
how can I make them closer?

71
00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:08.336
Or a more professional version of that,
anyway, and it'll kind of go out.

72
00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:10.006
So again, I thought this was quite cool,

73
00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.125
because it's like the prompt
that you're used to.

74
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:15.847
But it is so embedded in the rendering
engine and things like that,

75
00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:18.447
that it can kind of
quickly figure things out.

76
00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:23.792
And so, you can see here that it kind of
points this list-style-position inside.

77
00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:27.804
The other thing that I thought was
kind of cool, a bit dangerous, maybe,

78
00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:32.273
seeming, is that its suggestions always
come partnered with code you can execute

79
00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:34.173
in your console to make it happen.

80
00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.425
Which I thought was kind of
a wild thing to offer, but so

81
00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:42.468
you can copy this to clipboard, then go to
the console and just paste all this stuff.

82
00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:43.547
Well, it's AI, what are you gonna do?

83
00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:45.564
We still have jumps.

84
00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:49.328
Wait, setElementStyles, I guess it doesn't
have the function, that's too bad.

85
00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:51.254
Anyway, I thought that was
kind of an interesting thing.

86
00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:55.448
But you can see that it is extremely
context-aware, so it was correct,

87
00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:58.495
list-style-position, you
can set it to inside.

88
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:02.639
So that's all you really need to
do is list-style-position: inside.

89
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.489
I thought this was quite nice,
for multiple reasons.

90
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:09.601
It had such a good sense of
how things were rendering,

91
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.826
that it was just contextually aware.

92
00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:14.664
Less excited about running the code
to get it to work automatically, but

93
00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:16.769
pretty excited about how
contextually aware it was.

94
00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:19.837
So yeah, I think it's always worth
checking out between those kind of

95
00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:20.521
experiments.

96
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.426
And all the new stuff that they're
doing with AI is quite useful, great.

97
00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:30.234
And yeah, I think with that, there's a few
other places you have the AI, varying use.

98
00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:32.649
So they've added the little AI
button everywhere, basically.

99
00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.898
So you could kind of do a thing,
actually, and

100
00:05:34.898 --> 00:05:37.449
this might be cool to try
while we have a minute here.

101
00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.421
But we go back to the page jank one.

102
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:47.881
And let it do its thing, and
then eventually find the moveBalls method.

103
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.187
Let's close out this memory heap,
and we'll kind of scroll in here.

104
00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:54.353
And how do I get this?

105
00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:59.028
Ask AI, why is this so slow?

106
00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:04.487
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Hmm.

107
00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:10.619
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's kinda cool,
okay, this part's right.

108
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:14.238
Yeah, it forces this synchronous layout
thrash, okay, I'm pretty happy with this.

109
00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:18.207
So again, you can see something that's
kind of slow and kind of run AI on it.

110
00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:21.000
And at least get some
pretty good information.

111
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.387
In our actual solution,
we use CSS transforms, but

112
00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:27.349
this similarly points out correctly that
you could do batching or requestAnimation,

113
00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.861
pretty similar to the stuff
we covered in this course.

114
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:32.726
So yeah, I think that's cool,
kind of fun to play around with.
