00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.418
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Another one that's
nice is the accessible color picker, so

2
00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:08.178
this will be our first deviation from the
standard dev tools into an experiment, but

3
00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.740
I think it's worth seeing
a quick shout out.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.304
There's a very cool accessibility
course coming up very soon by me.

5
00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:17.807
But yeah, so
accessible color is really nice,

6
00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:20.559
you wanna make sure that
your contrast is able to be,

7
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:25.022
differentiated by people with a variety
of different conditions and sightedness.

8
00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:28.827
So you can go to the, let me just
make sure that we go slowly here,

9
00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:32.634
you can click on the setting cog,
you can click on experiments,

10
00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.618
we will cover a lot of
experiments going forward.

11
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:40.422
We can click on one of these cool
accessibility color contrast program one,

12
00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:44.325
and then close it says we have to reload,
we'll do a reload and

13
00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.070
now we can click on a color.

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.970
Yeah, I'm not sure why that's not
showing up on my NAV bar, but

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.280
this is a really great tool.

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.253
So what you'll see basically
is through the dev tools,

17
00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.870
you will be able to click on anywhere
that you're using font color.

18
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.304
And with that experiment enabled,
when you click on it for the font color,

19
00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:03.319
you'll see this new section here,
which is the contrast ratio.

20
00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.170
And so you can click to expand to
this here and you can see whether or

21
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.412
not the contrast ratio is compliant,

22
00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:13.563
meaning that it is good enough for
people with a varying sightedness.

23
00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:17.222
You can also see this one's a bit hard,
but you can see that there's this white

24
00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:20.348
line at the top and the implication
here the experiment adds this.

25
00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:24.315
That anything in the upper left
section of this is accessible and

26
00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:27.548
then anything outside of
it is inaccessible, and so

27
00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:32.780
basically it's like if the font color gets
too dark, then it will be inaccessible.

28
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.760
And you can see this is marked to slash
through, we move it back up to the top and

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.565
it's a check.

30
00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:41.675
The other thing I wanted to say on this is
it's not just about color, it's font size

31
00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:45.726
as well, so there are contrasts that are
acceptable at a certain large font size,

32
00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:47.680
but unacceptable at a lower font size.

33
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.153
So I think as an example,

34
00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:54.227
if we were to change the font size here to
like 100 pixels, or something like that.

35
00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:58.453
And then open this up, we would see that
the white line is now very different,

36
00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:01.836
right for 100 pixels,
we actually get quite a bit of room,

37
00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:04.984
this is all accessible, and
then this is inaccessible.

38
00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:08.289
This sort of makes sense as a concept,
you enable the experiment, and

39
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.697
then you can click on anything
that has a color, and

40
00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.961
you'll get this contrast ratio that
you can kind of have a play with.

41
00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:17.256
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone in the chat
mentioned maybe it's because it has to

42
00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:19.352
be a text element that's selected.

43
00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:21.634
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I wonder if you're right,
yeah,

44
00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:25.187
maybe it's just the fact
that you are totally right.

45
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.323
That's great, that's great from the chat,

46
00:02:27.323 --> 00:02:30.170
so I think before I was looking
at a parent element that didn't

47
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.201
actually have any text content,
I was looking at the NAV itself.

48
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:36.571
And what we actually need to find is
the element that actually has the text

49
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.994
content, and that when we open it up,
we will see the contrast ratio, and

50
00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:41.612
we will see, thank you very much.

51
00:02:41.612 --> 00:02:44.276
Chat for that, yeah, that's great.

52
00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:49.342
So this is an experiment I leave on
all the time just to make sure that

53
00:02:49.342 --> 00:02:55.679
I'm always have accessible fonts and
background colors, but a nice, great one.
