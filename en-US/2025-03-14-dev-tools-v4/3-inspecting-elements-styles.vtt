00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.729
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, so with that,

2
00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.331
let's jump into the first lesson where
we'll be playing around together.

3
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:07.109
So this is lesson 1,
What can Chrome DevTools do?

4
00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.574
And for this lesson,
I'm going to be using the course, so

5
00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.067
I have it running locally from that repo.

6
00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.410
If anybody has trouble with that,
please let me know.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.497
Otherwise, you can go to mastering
devtools.com click on lessons and

8
00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.504
then click on what can Chrome DevTools do,
and

9
00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:22.833
then you should be able to
follow along with me there.

10
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:26.688
So we'll go into lessons,
we'll go into what can Chrome DevTools do.

11
00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:30.647
One note, which is mostly here for
me, more than it's here for you,

12
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:33.788
is that Chrome extensions can,
and almost always do,

13
00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.334
mess with the performance of your website.

14
00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:39.820
They add JavaScript, they add HTML,
they have event listeners,

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.449
things like this all the time.

16
00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.592
So one thing which I always try to
remember, but is very difficult,

17
00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:49.590
is before you do any kind of serious
profiling with the DevTools,

18
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.537
do it either in incognito mode or
do it with your extensions off.

19
00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:57.201
Because I cannot tell you how many
times I've narrowed down, finally,

20
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.556
the thing that's causing
the most page junk.

21
00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:02.913
And it's some password managing plugin
that has nothing to do with the user.

22
00:01:02.913 --> 00:01:08.727
So, I will go ahead and take my own advice
now and I will open an Incognito tab.

23
00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:12.783
It's not 100% required, it's just really
something to know because you'll often see

24
00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:15.240
on the network tab,
you'll see extra files coming in.

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.724
In the performance tab,
you'll see extra call stacks,

26
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:20.896
all sorts of stuff basically coming
from some extensions that you have.

27
00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:23.858
So I'll go incognito,
I have no extensions here.

28
00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:24.988
Should be good to go.

29
00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:28.641
Okay, cool, so the first panel,
the elements panel,

30
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.707
this one hopefully,
is among the more user-friendly ones.

31
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:37.096
So essentially it will have the HTML
rendered as Dom on the left.

32
00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.633
And so you can kind of click through and
you can see,

33
00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.598
your elements and their class names or
their IDs, different things like that.

34
00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:46.210
And then on the right, it'll have
the styles that sort of attach to them.

35
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.785
So you could click on like the body,
and then you could see the body

36
00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:53.751
over here has the following styles,
it's background color and color.

37
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.852
These are all editable,
they're toggleable.

38
00:01:55.852 --> 00:01:58.453
You could turn the background color on and
off.

39
00:01:58.453 --> 00:01:59.895
That might be a bit hard to see.

40
00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:03.513
Let's see if we made it red,
and then turned it on and

41
00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:06.078
off so they are togglable like this.

42
00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:10.540
And they're also editable, so as you saw
before, I can make the background color

43
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.982
anything that I'd like it to be and
it will change in real time.

44
00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:17.555
There's a lot of information here, so
I think one of the best ways if I cover

45
00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.813
anything too quickly or skip to
please raise your hand and call out.

46
00:02:20.813 --> 00:02:25.541
Because I hope not to, but basically,
you can see kind of the styles applied.

47
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.214
You can see the file and
line number that they're coming from.

48
00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:32.325
So I could go ahead and click on this,
and it would take me over to the sources

49
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:35.541
tab and show me where in the actual
CSS this is coming from.

50
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.450
Another really interesting thing is that,
and

51
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.857
we will cover this in the next section.

52
00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:45.291
But you can also from the styles tab
over here, you can click on computed.

53
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:49.393
And I think the thing to know for
now is that when the style engine receives

54
00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:52.162
multiple things that could
apply to an element.

55
00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:55.004
It has this algorithm that it kind
of applies to figure out which one

56
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:56.087
should actually apply.

57
00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:59.518
I think the easiest example that most
people know is the important tag exists.

58
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:03.464
So if you have, all divs should be blue,
all div should be purple important,

59
00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:04.811
then important will win.

60
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.279
But there's a lot of different
things that happen here too.

61
00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.601
So if you're ever confused why a style is
appearing like if you see this as purple

62
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.585
and you were expecting
it to be something else,

63
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:14.685
you can kind of come over
here to the computed tab.

64
00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.974
We will cover this in more details
when we do the elements panel, but

65
00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:21.453
it's a tab that I quite like as well
as it shows you the kind of Box model.

66
00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:24.207
So I don't know who's heard of
the box model before and CSS, but

67
00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:27.573
it's basically like an element has its
width and height, it has padding, and

68
00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.471
then it has border, and
then it has margin.

69
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.970
So if you were to do like,
padding 50, I guess we could just,

70
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.432
let's just jump in here.

71
00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:39.104
So let's take an element here and
we will make a new selector for it.

72
00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:42.909
And so we say, okay feature details,
they have a width,

73
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.781
or they have a background of pink, right?

74
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:50.607
And they have a width of 100 pixels and
a height of 100 pixels.

75
00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:52.508
So that was the most inner one.

76
00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:56.488
And then if you say they
have padding of 20 pixels,

77
00:03:56.488 --> 00:04:01.835
that would be padding outside of
the width, but inside of the border.

78
00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.576
So then, oops, 20 pixels.

79
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:07.432
Then if you said they had like
a border of 10 pixels, solid black.

80
00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:10.890
Now you can see that you have the width of
the thing, and then you have the padding,

81
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.012
then you have the border.

82
00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:15.995
And then if we were to go ahead and
say they also have a margin of 15 pixels,

83
00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:19.363
you can now see that the margin
is outside of the border itself.

84
00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:23.225
So you see the margin is here,
the border is there.

85
00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.487
I'm hoping you can see it kind
of highlights these things.

86
00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:28.913
So we've got the margin on the outside,
then the border, then the padding,

87
00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:31.089
then the width and
height of the actual element.

88
00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.697
And similarly,

89
00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:34.526
if we went over to computed we would see
kind of everything that we typed here.

90
00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:40.414
So width and height are 100 padding of 20,
border of 10, margin of 15.

91
00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:43.306
That is hard to read, so
I'm gonna refresh there.

92
00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:45.176
Cool, so you can do quite a bit here.

93
00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:47.097
Lots of things are interactive,
for example,

94
00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:49.701
you can double-click into a property,
like a class property.

95
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.410
And you can change this
from main-nav to foo,

96
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.338
and then it loses all of
its main-nav selectors.

97
00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:59.420
So we can set main-nav back on it,
and it'll appear again.

98
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.339
At any time, you can right-click and
just edit as HTML.

99
00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.405
So you can truly add a lot of things.

100
00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:08.069
We can get this whole
navigation item as HTML, and

101
00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.358
we could add a brand new LI,
hello, something like that.

102
00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.726
And so yeah, you can kind of edit
around to your heart's content.

103
00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:17.797
You can edit individual properties,
you can edit entire tags.

104
00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:21.452
You can edit the whole HTML block itself,
all sorts of things like that.

105
00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:24.118
As we kind of already saw,
you can update styles.

106
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:27.720
There's quite a lot of cool stuff
you can do within updating styles,

107
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.273
like it's very easy to use the arrow
keys to move things up and down.

108
00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:34.714
You can find anything that's a color,
and you can click it, and

109
00:05:34.714 --> 00:05:38.922
that will open this really nice color
palette where you can kind of choose, and

110
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.112
you can see it's updating in real time.

111
00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:42.185
The color palette is quite great.

112
00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:46.067
We will get into it later, but
you can have it do all sorts of things,

113
00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:49.968
like pick out accessible colors to
make sure that contrast is good.

114
00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:52.438
You can load in themes
like from your website, or

115
00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.585
you can use Google's material UI theme,
which is down here.

116
00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.259
So if you're not a designer like me,

117
00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.509
you can limit yourself to just colors
from Google's material design.

118
00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.816
So I can, like, kind of shop around at
the blues and the orange is available, and

119
00:06:03.816 --> 00:06:05.628
things should still look pretty good here.

120
00:06:05.628 --> 00:06:07.848
You can simulate events.

121
00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:12.436
So if we go out here and we click on,
let's say one of these nav item Li's,

122
00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:17.633
we can do things like, okay, well, show
me what it looks like when it's hovered.

123
00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.019
And it shows the kind
of hovered state here.

124
00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.055
When it's focused, when it's active,
all sorts of different things.

125
00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:27.597
So I do find sometimes when I pair
program with people, they will miss this.

126
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:30.481
And they will be looking at the UI.

127
00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:32.833
And then they'll really quick hover
over the thing with a mouse and

128
00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:34.012
try to watch where it is on there.

129
00:06:34.012 --> 00:06:37.708
But all of the events can be
fully emulated through this,

130
00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.102
as well as any state.

131
00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:41.864
And so for each element,
you can click on, you can be like,

132
00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:45.086
I wanna see what this anchor looks
like when it's in a visited state.

133
00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:49.170
All of this is fully simulatable,
emulatable.

134
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.918
You can add a new class to
anything that you select.

135
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.769
So I can go here and make a new class and
it will give me this thing here.

136
00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.614
You can just very quickly
add a new selector for

137
00:06:57.614 --> 00:06:59.563
whatever the item is
that you're playing with.

138
00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:03.028
So if you wanted to mess around with some
styles on this, you can click the kind of

139
00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:06.309
plus here, you can do a bunch of
different rendering emulations, right?

140
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.789
So you can emulate what it would be
like if the user had dark mode on, or

141
00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.125
if the user had the preferred dark scheme,
or if the user had preferred light scheme.

142
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.507
So you can kind of make sure that
your website reacts accordingly.

143
00:07:17.507 --> 00:07:20.024
And there's a lot of other
stuff that we will cover across

144
00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:23.387
here with break points and event
listeners, all sorts of things like that.

145
00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:26.138
Maybe the event listeners one we'll
just cover before we move on,

146
00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:27.522
which is you can select any item.

147
00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:29.638
Select Event Listeners, and
then you can go ahead and

148
00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:32.237
see if there's anything in
particular listening on this event.

149
00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:36.138
So if we had like a selector in JavaScript
that was like on event, handle event

150
00:07:36.138 --> 00:07:39.871
listener for a click, then we would
see the click kind of showing up here.

151
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:43.305
But by default, since these are just
native anchors, we don't have any,

152
00:07:43.305 --> 00:07:44.572
event listeners on there.
