1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.326
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: We will move
over to the first exercise.

2
00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:06.052
So you can either go find it
via the masteringdevtools.com,

3
00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:08.631
Exercises, Essential Chrome DevTools,

4
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:12.873
or build the site locally from the GitHub
repo and go to the same place.

5
00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:14.262
And so let's take a quick break.

6
00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:18.624
We'll kinda break out and work on this
together, fire up the DevTools, and

7
00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:20.269
do a bunch of these changes.

8
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.505
So see if you can use the DevTools to
change the list from an ordered list to

9
00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:24.418
an unordered list.

10
00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:28.974
This password field, we can see, doesn't
let you paste, so if I try pasting,

11
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.335
it gives me this thing.

12
00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:31.070
Can you fix it?

13
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.036
So either it does allow pasting, or

14
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:37.227
you're just somehow able to set the
password to this, and then see if you can

15
00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:41.773
figure out which one of these cards
has the ID 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

16
00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:44.473
And think about how you would be
able to do it if it were an infinite

17
00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:45.127
list of cards.

18
00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:47.562
Would you be able to kind of highlight
it and figure it out yourself?

19
00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:50.562
So yeah, let's take a quick break there,
try to go through these, and

20
00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.713
then we'll do them all
together when we come back.

21
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.140
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right, so yeah,
let's go through this together.

22
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.321
Feel free to jump out if
you have any questions, and

23
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.162
then we'll move on to
the kind of next one.

24
00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:07.457
So changing the list from an ordered
list to an unordered list.

25
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:09.663
So I'll right-click and
open the inspector here.

26
00:01:09.663 --> 00:01:12.671
And then there's lots of
different ways to do this, but

27
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.977
essentially, I just find the ol tag here.

28
00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:19.781
And if you double click a tag, it puts
you into this kind of smart editing

29
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:24.583
mode where you can just edit one of
the tags and hopefully you can see that

30
00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:28.451
as I change the top one it
changes the closing tag as well.

31
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:30.729
And so I'll make it an unordered list.

32
00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.560
There it goes green.

33
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.486
The password doesn't allow users to paste.

34
00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:37.669
This is actually something I deal with
all the time, it's so frustrating.

35
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:38.770
Can you get around it?

36
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.879
And can you set your new
password to this big long string?

37
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.953
So there's again, a couple of
different ways we can solve this.

38
00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:47.076
So we can see, right off the bat
that if we try pasting in,

39
00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.045
we get this pasting is not allowed.

40
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:52.471
So I can go ahead and
inspect this element and see.

41
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.542
So there's a few different
things I think we could do.

42
00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:59.497
One of them, I left this kind of
cheeky disallow paste class, right?

43
00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:02.613
So you could remove that, and
then you should be able to paste it in.

44
00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:06.463
I think another thing that we
could do here, let's refresh here,

45
00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:09.089
is you could just mess
with the value itself.

46
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.605
So I think that you could do value equals,
and then paste this thing in.

47
00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.590
And then you're still not
allowed to paste, but

48
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.150
we've pasted in kind of the back way.

49
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.985
Yeah, so
I think we could do the same thing here.

50
00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:21.167
Either solution is totally fine.

51
00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:26.063
I guess one, it's like sort of a smaller
thing, but I'd like to point out is that

52
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:30.167
this way that if you want to add an ID and
there's no ID only classes or

53
00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:34.146
there was no value field,
you can go to edit one, like the class.

54
00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:38.372
Then you just kind of go to the beginning
of it and you could like totally put, so

55
00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:39.716
you can kind of do this and

56
00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:43.640
the editor is smart enough to then
break that into multiple properties.

57
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.468
So, yeah, we can do that.

58
00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:48.979
And then the border color of
this card with this ID, again,

59
00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.592
quite a few different
ways we could do that.

60
00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:53.139
We could do a search here, right?

61
00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.429
You could search for
this ID, kind of find it.

62
00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.593
We could also see, it is here,
we could also go like in the console,

63
00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:02.141
like we had done before.

64
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.927
And we could do like document,
get element by ID, and

65
00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:10.893
then you could kind of paste this in,
and this would find it from here,

66
00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:14.535
you could sort of go and
view in the Elements panel.

67
00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:17.496
You could view it here, and then even
if you were scrolled somewhere else,

68
00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:18.624
you could scroll into view.

69
00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:21.939
So, kind of a lot of different ways
hopefully highlighting that these things

70
00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.571
are very deeply linked together, and

71
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:26.125
you can kind of solve things in
a variety of different ways.

72
00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:30.691
But always get back to the same kind of
point, however you'd like to get there.

73
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:33.198
Did everyone find this one, okay, yeah?

74
00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:37.227
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I noticed that you had
the event listener on the allow paste.

75
00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:39.660
Could you just go into the event
listener source and change that?

76
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.761
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, that's another
totally acceptable way to do it.

77
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:43.961
Anyway, that works is great.

78
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.456
So, you could go in here.

79
00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:47.981
You could do the allow paste.

80
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.774
So is the event listener on the paste?

81
00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:53.299
We could find the source code.

82
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.451
This is a great question.

83
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:58.233
So we can find the source code that says,
okay, when it does allow paste,

84
00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:02.320
we prevent default another like very great
way of doing it would be just to kind of

85
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.535
go ahead and
just delete all of this stuff.

86
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:07.356
And now you should, I guess you'd
have to have the source code and

87
00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:08.498
do a refresh on it, yeah?

88
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.751
So if you have the source code and
you do a refresh,

89
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.391
then that'd be a totally another
great way of solving it.

90
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.797
All of these are great.

91
00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:18.126
I think it's cool because the things
work together really well.

92
00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:21.696
All this HTML, JavaScript Script CSS, and
so then when you're trying to fix or get

93
00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:25.582
around different things, there's all sorts
of different approaches that you can take.

94
00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.350
That's another totally
great way of doing it.

95
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.687
Everybody feel pretty good about that?

96
00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:29.728
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If this is too much

97
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.297
of an aside, what's a good way to
build this that can't be easily

98
00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:33.805
circumvented with developer tools?

99
00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:35.688
Is that only server-side validation APIs?

100
00:04:35.688 --> 00:04:36.460
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so

101
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.577
the paste one is particularly
tricky to actually discourage.

102
00:04:41.577 --> 00:04:45.007
I think that you could, like,
I was trying to think like,

103
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.891
I think there's some things
you could try to do.

104
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:49.688
I think it's always a losing battle,

105
00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:53.238
but I do think you could have like,
event listeners that are like on input.

106
00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:56.506
And if input was more than one character,
you could try to kick that out.

107
00:04:56.506 --> 00:05:00.584
So even if you edit it through the
DevTools, it would still spit it back out.

108
00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:03.992
But I think ultimately,
with this particular one,

109
00:05:03.992 --> 00:05:06.093
preventing paste is a bad idea.

110
00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:09.079
It discourages password managers and
complex passwords.

111
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.378
But, yeah, it's a really good question.

112
00:05:10.378 --> 00:05:14.127
I think truly also when I build software,
because I think this is a better,

113
00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:17.531
a really good philosophical question of,
can you prevent things?

114
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:18.157
Can you stop things?

115
00:05:18.157 --> 00:05:19.690
How secure can you be on the front end?

116
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.626
And the truth is that the front end
is theirs, you can't be secure,

117
00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:27.769
you can't have an API that could be
called dangerously from front end,

118
00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:30.828
because front end can just
call it any way they want.

119
00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:33.468
They could grab that URL and
they could paste it in the console.

120
00:05:33.468 --> 00:05:37.411
So your point of security needs to be back
end needs to be able to handle anything

121
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:41.595
from the front end, because you can't
really see sites they prevent right click,

122
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:45.107
or they try to prevent the DevTools,
or they try to prevent pasting.

123
00:05:45.107 --> 00:05:46.669
But there's always ways around that.

124
00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.155
So I do think philosophically, you cannot
control how the front end uses your

125
00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:55.587
endpoints in your JavaScript, and
you need to just be secure against that.
