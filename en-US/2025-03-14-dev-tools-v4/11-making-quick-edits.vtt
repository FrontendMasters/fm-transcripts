00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:02.606
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So I'll hop over
here to the Lessons page, and

2
00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:05.398
we'll take a look at
essential Chrome DevTools.

3
00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:08.967
And mostly what we'll do here is we'll
go through a bunch of kind of tips and

4
00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.134
tricks, or
quick things that you can learn.

5
00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.953
And then we'll go from here and do
an exercise where you'll have a chance to

6
00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:16.341
apply some of them yourself to
kind of try to solve a few issues.

7
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.312
So I think that if we open this up and
we go to the Elements panel.

8
00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.566
And we click on anything,
we'll see something quite familiar,

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.956
which is this kind of DOM on the left and
the CSS applied on the right.

10
00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:31.956
I think that if we were to scroll through,
we might be able to find some good

11
00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:35.761
cases of maybe we don't,
maybe it's a bit too simple.

12
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.272
But when we get into the specificity
stuff a little bit later on,

13
00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.426
I'll show you some of the kind
of strike through ones.

14
00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:44.728
Or I suppose we could do something
really easily, we could say, okay,

15
00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.891
all articles are background blue.

16
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.856
And then we could say this main content,
one is background white.

17
00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:57.581
And so then, if we were to go ahead and
click on this article, Don't show.

18
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:02.461
And then go over to Computed, we can
see that the background color is white.

19
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.269
And if we wanna know why that is, we can
click on this little arrow here, and

20
00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:08.142
we can get kinda taken over here, and

21
00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.693
says that that main content
background is white.

22
00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:14.117
This is the thing that has won out
over the specificity, whereas some

23
00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:17.733
of these other ones you can see
the background blue has been crossed out.

24
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:22.287
And the reason it's been crossed out is
because article is less specific than

25
00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:23.696
class of main content.

26
00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:25.896
Does that make sense,
just as far as specificity?

27
00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:28.125
I know it's a little bit
of a mind bendy concept.

28
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.087
But it's basically like we
have this problem with CSS,

29
00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:35.259
where we'll have multiple valid selectors
with multiple valid properties.

30
00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.172
And we need some way of figuring out which
ones to actually keep how to style your

31
00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:39.956
application.

32
00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:43.153
We need some rules that otherwise the page
would render like differently every time.

33
00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.821
So you could imagine instead,
we went with something like,

34
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:47.405
whichever one shows up first wins.

35
00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.298
That would be okay,

36
00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:51.302
except it get really confusing as
you bundle all your app together.

37
00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:55.096
Or we could say like, yeah,
whichever one has the darkest color one or

38
00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:59.295
the lightest color one, we need some
way of kind of evaluating these things.

39
00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.239
And the specificity is what
we've gone with, cool.

40
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:07.020
So all the CSS is editable, you can edit
the property, you can edit the value,

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.462
you can select or deselect things and
have them show up and go away again.

42
00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:15.933
Colors are really nice where you can click
in a little box and open this whole color

43
00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:20.096
wheel, and you can kind of have a play
with making it look however you like.

44
00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:22.874
Similarly we covered earlier,
all the elements are editable.

45
00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:24.062
So you can change a tag,

46
00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:27.040
like double clicking on the nav
will change the tag itself.

47
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.571
So you can make that like an h1 and kind
of the look of the site, refresh here.

48
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:36.548
You can update class properties, you
can update the actual value themselves,

49
00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:39.604
and you can drop down into
this Edit as HTML mode.

50
00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:42.798
And from here, you can kinda just
go ahead and edit all the raw HML,

51
00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:46.241
we could just delete all this stuff and
then the nav goes away entirely.

52
00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:47.199
I'll refresh again.

53
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.914
You can add new CSS rules in
a bunch of different ways.

54
00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:54.195
For the most part, you can just click
on this +, it'll add a new rule,

55
00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:57.118
you could put any selector you want,
so we could say like divs.

56
00:02:57.118 --> 00:03:02.063
And then we could say background blue
something like that, all divs are blue.

57
00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:06.455
You can go ahead and you can apply one and
you can make it a specific class so

58
00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.776
you can say nav or
you could say anything with main nav.

59
00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:13.415
And then you could be like this is
background red or something like that.

60
00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:16.377
You could get more specific you could
do a div with the class of main nav

61
00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:17.361
background, right?

62
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.028
So you can do all sorts of stuff here.

63
00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:20.959
You can also look at any of these and

64
00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.900
see which file they actually come
from by clicking on the Sources tab.

65
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.217
So, yeah, so we can edit HTML, edit CSS.

66
00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:31.578
One that I really like a lot, that I feel
is underrated is this scroll into view.

67
00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:35.639
So remember like earlier we showed that
you can use the Console to select HTML

68
00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.484
elements or something like that.

69
00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:41.925
And I've spent a large amount of my career
working on infinitely scrolling lists,

70
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:43.646
just gigantic lists of things.

71
00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:47.536
And sometimes it can get really hard
where you have an element selected here.

72
00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:51.129
I've got this scroll into view, but I
don't really know where it is on the page.

73
00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.712
So Chrome gives you this little hint,
you can see it gives you a little arrow,

74
00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:55.555
like a checkbox.

75
00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.485
It's like, hey, that li,
it's down that way, right?

76
00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:02.138
And if I were to go down too far and hover
over it, so it'll show you where it is.

77
00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:03.853
It'll say, okay, it's down that way, but

78
00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:05.714
it can be quite hard to actually find and
center.

79
00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:09.319
So you can right-click on
any element in the DOM, and

80
00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.897
you get all these different options.

81
00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:14.062
One that I really like
is scroll into view.

82
00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:17.600
So if you click scroll into view, it'll
actually move the viewport itself and

83
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.043
hover over the item, which can be really
nice for a lot of different things.

84
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:23.041
We've got the Console shortcuts,
which I showed earlier.

85
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:27.506
So you can click on something, you can hit
Escape to pop up this little mini Console.

86
00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.245
And then you can $0 to interact
with it directly like this,

87
00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:31.540
which I think is quite nice.

88
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.997
You can edit attributes, things like that.

89
00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:37.189
Hide and show elements, so
you can click on any elements,

90
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.271
I can click on this nav and
I can hit H and

91
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:43.078
it will hide it, and then I can hit
H again, and it'll show it again.

92
00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:47.168
This is different than deleting it,
where it'll just be marked as transparent,

93
00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:47.950
essentially.

94
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.902
You can also delete them if you want, so
you can right-click and delete element,

95
00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:52.943
I'm gonna refresh.

96
00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:55.566
You can also duplicate elements, so
you could right-click and duplicate.

97
00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:58.169
And now I know it might be hard,
but you'll have to believe me,

98
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.282
there are two navs here, even though
they have the same style properties.

99
00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:02.857
You can simulate all sorts of state.

100
00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:05.485
So we talked about this earlier,
so you can click on anything.

101
00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:09.031
You can click on this :hov and
you can simulate any type of hover,

102
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:11.429
focused, targeted, anything like that.

103
00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:14.451
You can simulate these
prefer color schemes, oops,

104
00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:16.070
which is this one over here.

105
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.431
So you can say like,
what does it look like?

106
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:18.491
If they prefer dark mode?

107
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:19.796
What does it look like if
they prefer light mode?

108
00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:21.971
What does it look like if
we're in automatic dark mode?

109
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.599
All sorts of things like that.

110
00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.063
You can view the Computed styles,
we covered this a bit earlier.

111
00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:29.869
So you can see the box model, how big
it is after all the specificity rules,

112
00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:32.606
how much padding, border,
margin, and position.

113
00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:36.535
And you can also see 100% of the
attributes applied after specificity one

114
00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.602
out, which ones are actually applied.

115
00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:41.868
And if you wanna know where the specific
rule comes from, at any point,

116
00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:45.633
you can click the arrow, it'll take you
back to the Styles tab and show that rule.

117
00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:47.074
You can set HTML break points.

118
00:05:47.074 --> 00:05:49.616
This is another one of those ones that
maybe doesn't come up that often, but

119
00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.455
it can make you seem kinda
magic when you know about it.

120
00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:56.094
So I have had projects before where I got
a table of information, an HTML table,

121
00:05:56.094 --> 00:05:57.907
all this data coming through.

122
00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.033
And sometimes the data, when it comes
through it comes through wrong and

123
00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:02.633
I don't really know this code base.

124
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:05.356
So it's really hard for me to figure
out like where that's coming from.

125
00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.345
So you can click on any element and

126
00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:10.338
you can right-click on it and
you can go Break on.

127
00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:15.254
So what this will do is it'll observe
the UI and when the UI changes it will

128
00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:20.267
tell you what JavaScript caused the UI
to change which is quite powerful.

129
00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:21.679
So, you've got three options.

130
00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.417
You can say,
I don't wanna know when this changes, but

131
00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.222
I wanna know when anything and
it's sub-tree changes.

132
00:06:27.222 --> 00:06:31.474
So, you can imagine a list of li, you
don't care about the list, but when the li

133
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:35.559
is changed, if a new li gets added or
removed, you wanna be alerted to that.

134
00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.158
You could say, all I really want to
know is when this elements attributes

135
00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:43.005
are modified, like a class, name, or
Id is changed, or some inline style.

136
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.911
Or you could say, I want you to tell me
when this node is about to be removed,

137
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.141
right, before you remove it from the DOM,
I wanna know.

138
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.091
And you can use any of these, and
when they fire, it'll actually take you to

139
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.641
a break point in the Sources tab
with the JavaScript that called it.

140
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.576
So again, this might not be
your daily driver tool, but

141
00:06:58.576 --> 00:07:02.260
it is really cool to know when you have
a bug that you can visually see but

142
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.900
you're not exactly sure
what code is causing it.

143
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.329
You can use these really cool HTML
break points to actually see what

144
00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.319
code triggered that change.

145
00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.045
Does that sort of make sense,
theoretically?

146
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:14.679
Okay, great.

147
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:15.897
You can find event listeners.

148
00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:19.413
So if you want to select any item and
you're like on-scroll,

149
00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:21.249
this is doing something weird.

150
00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.130
You can click any item you want, and
then you can go to event listeners,

151
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.452
and it will tell you every
single listener that applies.

152
00:07:26.452 --> 00:07:30.442
So you can see here,
I've got this color scheme generator for

153
00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:32.372
my source code called PRISM.

154
00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:35.304
And PRISM has one event listener,
which is on the DOM content loaded.

155
00:07:35.304 --> 00:07:38.502
This is gonna be some minified code,
but if I were to click on it,

156
00:07:38.502 --> 00:07:41.586
I could see what method gets
called on DOM ContentLoaded, and

157
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.565
it looks like it calls this [INAUDIBLE].

158
00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:46.782
Again, this is not my source code,
but it can be cool to see, for

159
00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:49.585
any element,
what event listeners are listening, and

160
00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:52.706
then you can kind of click through
to the sources and see them.

161
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.413
Changing color formats is cool.

162
00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.792
I think this used to be
even nicer than it is now.

163
00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:01.860
But again, clicking on for any color
background color, you click on that box,

164
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.326
it opens this nice thing up.

165
00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:07.426
And you can kind of very quickly
move between RGB, HSL, basically,

166
00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:09.347
any color format that you want.

167
00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:13.281
So I know certain websites will
mandate everybody uses a certain,

168
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.732
we all use HEX codes, or
we all use RGB, or whatever it is.

169
00:08:16.732 --> 00:08:19.698
You can very quickly prototype and
then come in here and

170
00:08:19.698 --> 00:08:23.448
instantly transform them between
each other, which is quite nice.

171
00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:27.724
You've got this kind of theme
information that I pointed out here.

172
00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:31.582
So this is kind of the material
design color palette.

173
00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:33.474
You can also use your CSS variables,

174
00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:36.354
any that you have declared
in your application itself.

175
00:08:36.354 --> 00:08:40.022
So you can see here on the root,
I have all these CSS variables.

176
00:08:40.022 --> 00:08:43.739
So if I wanted to be doing a bunch of
design work, I can click on a color,

177
00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:44.432
it opens up.

178
00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:47.075
I can click on these arrows here,
and I can say,

179
00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:49.662
I want you to use the theme
of my CSS variables.

180
00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:52.432
And now you can see that all my
CSS variables are right here,

181
00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:53.659
where I can easily click.

182
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:56.997
This is really nice.you
can import a custom theme.

183
00:08:56.997 --> 00:09:01.328
I usually stick with material design
cuz I'm not great with design eye.

184
00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:04.414
And so then I can kind of build my app
very quickly this way by just playing

185
00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:05.916
around with a bunch of different.

186
00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:08.813
And you can long click on these
to see all the gradients.

187
00:09:08.813 --> 00:09:10.543
And it's quite a nice set of tools.
