00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.215
&gt;&gt; Jon kuperman: And
then the last one Lighthouse,

2
00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:06.976
we will play extensively with this today,
but it is a full audit, so you can do

3
00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:11.613
Kind of the important ones are you can
simulate mobile or desktop devices?

4
00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.342
You can simulate any number
of these four categories,

5
00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:18.019
which are performance, accessibility,
best practices, and SEO, and

6
00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.356
you can have some different modes
like do a audit of this time span.

7
00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:24.748
So let's say you have a game, you start
it, do something in the game, end it.

8
00:00:24.748 --> 00:00:27.837
Or you could just do kind of like when
you get navigated to the page, or

9
00:00:27.837 --> 00:00:30.739
you could do a current snapshot
of where things are at right now.

10
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.407
So with any one of these, it'll go out,
it'll do a bunch of stuff and

11
00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:34.337
it'll load it for you.

12
00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.104
We will have a pretty
significant play with it later,

13
00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.684
so I'm not gonna spend too
much time on it now, and

14
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:44.001
then a couple of last things to just know
is you can simulate your viewport devices.

15
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.679
So you can do like a responsive app,
you can see what

16
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.556
your site looks like on an iPhone,
m'I see all sorts of things like this.

17
00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:53.352
Additionally, you can do network
throttling so you can say, okay, well,

18
00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.675
what does it look like on an iPhone?

19
00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:59.569
I see and you can do mid tier mobile, low
end mobile, so I can do low end mobile and

20
00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.928
then I can refresh the page,
and I can kind of see here,

21
00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:07.859
what my app will look like on a low end
mobile iPhone see, so that's quite cool.

22
00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.367
Not the most exciting 'cause it's
just a static HTML page, but

23
00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.876
you could imagine if it was doing
a bunch of asynchronous stuff,

24
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:14.521
that it would look quite different here.

25
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.456
Another thing is nice is this helper
arrow, so if you're trying to inspect

26
00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:21.654
a certain element, but
you're having a hard time doing it.

27
00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:24.966
When you right click on an element and
you click inspect,

28
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.983
it will do its best to open the elements
tab selected on that element.

29
00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:32.231
That's not always possible if
things are really fine grained, so

30
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:34.380
another way is going
kind of reverse order.

31
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.259
You can click on the arrow and then you
can kind of hover around until you get on

32
00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.450
the exact element that you want, click on
that and it'll bring it in here as well.

33
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.230
Cool, I always go back and forth on, if
you are a native developer, there's some

34
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.036
really great ways that you can hook up the
Chrome Dev Tools to a native Android app.

35
00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:53.841
I don't cover it in this course, but

36
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:56.413
I do link to a whole article
on how to set that up here.
