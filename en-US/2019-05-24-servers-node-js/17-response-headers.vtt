&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Two
quick things before that,

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.776
actually, sorry,
two brief things before that.

3
00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:08.191
One, the return back message
[SOUND] is also in HTTP format.

4
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.857
We use the body bit of it to
send any data, like hello,

5
00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.805
in the headers of the return back message.

6
00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:18.366
It's the same format,
get request line with the headlines.

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.340
This is the headline bit,
what you absolutely, the headline,

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.950
the request headers and the body.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.850
The headers bit on the message
you send back can also include

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.191
things like content type.

11
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:32.375
Like, hey, what we're sending
back to Michael's Mac is HTML.

12
00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:38.152
Hey, web browser Chrome, Safari on Firefox
on Michael's Mac, you're receiving here,

13
00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:43.270
not plain text, don't try and
load it as text, interpret as HTML.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.520
And so we can actually add
to this message headers and

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.735
these metadata about
the data we're sending back.

16
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.650
Say, hey, this is HTML,
please interpret it as such,

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.645
using properties like content type.

18
00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:56.900
You're gonna see this in
the pair programming.

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.961
But you've just gotta make sure this
message has all the information

20
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.770
the browser needs to be able to
load up the data in the right way.
