00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:08.575
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Welcome to Node,
the hard parts on servers and

2
00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:13.049
the most powerful
technology to have emerged

3
00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.831
in the last ten years in web Node.js.

4
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.080
My background, there we go.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.600
There it is.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.650
I run CodeSmith, a coding school based
in Los Angeles and New York, and online.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.500
I created Icecom, a library for

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.270
WebRTC back in the day,
was this software engineering gem.

9
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.000
There's my wonderful family,
my wonderful sisters.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.370
That's the CodeSmith
team from the wall back.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.500
That's our old LA office, so

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.130
these pictures are super up to date,
each of them at least three years old.

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.732
There we go.
So Node.js,

14
00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:48.693
I would say the most powerful technology
to emerge in the last ten years.

15
00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:53.666
It's going to allow us to build
applications that enable us

16
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.753
to handle millions of users at once.

17
00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.224
Some of the largest companies
in the world therefore use it.

18
00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:06.195
LinkedIn, Uber, Netflix,
IBM all of them use node.

19
00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:11.325
But not only that, Node is going to
allow us to build out applications that

20
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:16.726
are desktop apps compatible with Windows,
Mac, Linux operating systems.

21
00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:19.693
Slack, Twitch, VS code,

22
00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:26.400
Atom all use Node as part of
this package up electron.

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.450
But that's not enough.

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.020
We can also use Node to

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.680
set up hardware with embedded
systems that use Node as well.

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.680
This technology is at the forefront
of what we can do with web, but

27
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.410
perhaps best of all for
us on front end masters.

28
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.620
We can now write applications end
to end from what's known, and

29
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.310
we'll see all about this, the client side,
all the way back to the server side.

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.790
All in one language, JavaScript.
