1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.300
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Let's so
quickly now talk.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.350
Though not quickly as
it's really important.

3
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.850
How the hell do we get JavaScript
started to do all this?

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.570
In the web browser,

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.760
when I write code in the web browser,
I open an HTML file in there.

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.940
I have some JavaScript code in there.

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.520
And the browser just runs it.

8
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.220
Turns on.

9
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.440
When as soon as you open a web page in
the browser, it turns on JavaScript and

10
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.790
starts running through JavaScript code.

11
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.290
Beautiful.

12
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.060
We don't have that.

13
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.260
We don't have that here.

14
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.612
So here's how we do it.

15
00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:28.278
Let's see over here.

16
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:34.084
I'm for now gonna get rid of
Michael's Mac, if you don't mind.

17
00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:36.102
Okay over here.

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:43.386
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: This is Will's Mac.

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.787
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Well actually hold on.

20
00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:50.890
Ignore that, ignore that, ignore that.

21
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.670
We are building for Twitter's computer.

22
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.990
We're building for Twitter's computer.

23
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.420
I need to, in Twitter's computer,
turn on node to run JavaScript code.

24
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.830
Where can I write JavaScript code?

25
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.900
Anywhere, I can write it on a napkin and
copy it in.

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.564
Is that a word in America?

27
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:13.272
Yeah exactly.

28
00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.690
I can write on a napkin and copy it in.

29
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.239
I don't know what words
you have in America.

30
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.163
I don't.

31
00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:18.029
I write on a piece of paper,

32
00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:20.150
as what like what Harry Potter
was written originally on.

33
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.880
I could write on that,
a beautiful code, and copy it in.

34
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.526
Or in a text editor on Vasco whatever.

35
00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:29.010
So in VS code I guess that CBS
code this be both popular.

36
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.066
I will start writing JavaScript
code like what is it?

37
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:39.765
Server, account server,
HTTP dot and so forth.

38
00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.408
I'll then save that as a file.

39
00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:44.900
Maybe I call it server.js.

40
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.630
It doesn't matter.

41
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.785
I would it server.js, whatever I want.

42
00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:53.019
.js is a text file but by the way it's
actually got JavaScript code in it.

43
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.170
But it's just a text file.

44
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.567
Now, I now need to turn on,
this is an app.

45
00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:00.819
Note it's an app that I
turn on like a web browser.

46
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.299
Web browser's an app that has access
to computers internal features.

47
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.407
The web browser as well, right, because
it's sending out messages to the Internet

48
00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:07.996
through the computer internal features.

49
00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:09.450
Knows no different.

50
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.650
How do I open a normal app on my
computer like the web browser?

51
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.330
Double click.

52
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.830
Exactly.

53
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.940
Unfortunately, node isn't like that.

54
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.460
I can't double click node,
because developers hate double clicking.

55
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.383
They are pathologically oppose for
using that mice, their mouse.

56
00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:26.330
What it mice?

57
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.310
No, I call things.

58
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.070
These are mouse, what's a mice?

59
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.760
They are pathologically
opposing using the mouses.

60
00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:38.310
So, instead they have a different way
of interfacing with the computer's

61
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.820
features of using apps,
turning on apps and its Google terminal.

62
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.890
You've seen it before,
probably the terminal command line.

63
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.550
I'm sure many of you seen it.

64
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.940
And we can turn stuff on from it, we can
run Spotify songs on here, by our Spotify,

65
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.070
kind of cool.

66
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.030
But we can also turn on node by
writing node and pressing enter.

67
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.210
When we do so, we want to have it
start running some JavaScript code.

68
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.741
Where do we tell it to run the code from?

69
00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:06.257
Well, we could write code from here.

70
00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:08.173
It will start running.

71
00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:10.947
Turn on JavaScript,
start running JavaScript code,

72
00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.307
turn on node features
using JavaScript code.

73
00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:13.926
But we're not.

74
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:17.376
We're gonna save that code in a file and
just put the name of it here.

75
00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:19.224
Server.js.

76
00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:22.831
Node server.js, William?

77
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:23.874
&gt;&gt; William: Yes, sir?

78
00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:25.840
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Sir, honored.

79
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.310
Wait a sec, we'll go to Andrews,

80
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.010
I'm watching Andrews eyes be
distracted by the laptop, all right.

81
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.860
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No,

82
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.020
of course not don't worry at all.

83
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.920
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I was seeing if I
had node installed already.

84
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.670
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That is
an important question.

85
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.170
So you right node if it's installed,
it will start loading.

86
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.940
It will turn on node ot it will
turn on the java engine that

87
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.200
will allow you to turn on node
features by writing java script code.

88
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.260
We write all that java script code
in the file, save it as server.js or

89
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.010
whatever you want to save it as.

90
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.144
Look at this I learned how to, yeah.

91
00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:55.034
Yeah, thank you.

92
00:03:55.034 --> 00:04:00.900
[LAUGH] Never was a more sarcastic hand
Ray, Clark raised by Matt all right.

93
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.710
There it is.

94
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.790
Save it load, okay.

95
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.416
Write the code in the VS code or whatever.

96
00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:07.369
Load into node and run it.

97
00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.830
How to load and
using the terminal interface.

98
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.350
Load it in.

99
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.940
This is gonna load this
in to start running.

100
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.250
Here's the problem.

101
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.860
We need to reload our code with node,
the code of jobs.

102
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.430
If we change anything do our jobs code,
we have to turn off node.

103
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.710
Turn it back on.

104
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.980
Run through the jobs code and
settle all those features all over again.

105
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.312
Because I know you could say that
someone raises more than, hold on,

106
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.560
can you selectively turn node back on.

107
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.050
You selectively edit stuff down here
that we know is gonna have break

108
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.370
changes and live features.

109
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.870
Now you just switch of the whole server,

110
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.260
the whole of the node and
you just turned it back on again.

111
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.983
To do so, we use a slightly different
variant of node which is gonna store,

112
00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.900
is optional on the challenges.

113
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.140
We run slightly different
variant if we want to have it

114
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.470
automatically every time we change jobs or
code and save it that that code.

115
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.540
As soon as we save it, the node app
will turn off and turn back on and run

116
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.140
through the draft code all again, all over
again setting up the node features and

117
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.550
do it automatically every time we make any
changes to JavaScript by using nodemon.

118
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010
It's just a slightly different
version of node that

119
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.518
was a pack is a wrapper around node.

120
00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.777
That when it, well I just say,
I mean JavaScript change happens,

121
00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:26.395
it will turn off node, turn it back on
again, run through the JavaScript code,

122
00:05:26.395 --> 00:05:30.275
set up all the features again to make
sure your changes are applied down here.

123
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:31.435
Okay, that's using nodemon.
