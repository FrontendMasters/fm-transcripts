1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.349
Goal two, enable the user to interact.

2
00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:09.201
To tap that content, to tap publish,
to tap the like number 7 and change to 8.

3
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:11.063
Interact with the content they see and
change it.

4
00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:14.700
Presumably changing underlying data,
otherwise it'd be inconsistent.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.944
Otherwise, I could see the number
of likes goes from 7 to 8.

6
00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:22.222
But under the hood, how many likes
are there actually changing?

7
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.302
Okay, sounds fine, but
this is where the problems begin.

8
00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:28.202
Now you may or
may not have had this intuition.

9
00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:33.325
And if you don't have this instinct,
then good for you.

10
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.773
But for me, when I look at a screen,

11
00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:39.706
when I see the number 7 as
the number of likes on my tweet.

12
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.312
And I say to myself, I got to change
that to 8 by liking my own tweet.

13
00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:45.689
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Of course, okay, this is getting old,

14
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:46.437
but getting very old.

15
00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:53.684
But when I do that, we just said
there needs to be data changing.

16
00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:57.825
Otherwise what is it to say that
that number of likes has changed?

17
00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:00.739
I remember when I first tried to build
an application when I was like 21,

18
00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.874
22 following a tutorial.

19
00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.650
And this was just so, so
hard for me to track.

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.655
And maybe all of you
didn't have this instinct.

21
00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.658
But when I'm engaging with
something I see on the screen.

22
00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.795
And I tap to like the number 7,
and it changes to the number 8,

23
00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.163
like I just said,
there needs to be data changing.

24
00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:22.536
And I'm like, yeah, I can see it,
there's a number 7, and now it's 8.

25
00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.577
I can see it, it's number 7, now it's 8.

26
00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.092
And that's a trick.

27
00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:30.658
That's a trick by user interface engineers
to pretend that what I'm seeing is

28
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:32.140
what's changing.

29
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.870
Because what I'm actually
seeing there people, right?

30
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.959
That's my gone pen.

31
00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.728
What I'm actually seeing there, people is.

32
00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:44.326
Maybe I can show it here, I guess is.

33
00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:48.192
Let's be more realistic and say,
no, no, okay, there it is, 7.

34
00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:55.161
That's 30 maybe,
30 little on-off lights, right?

35
00:01:55.161 --> 00:02:01.582
And then this is another 30.

36
00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:07.495
When I click 7,
if I've gotta change the number 7 to 8,

37
00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:13.196
This collection of 30
lights that I'm seeing,

38
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:17.862
the pixels I'm seeing has no
knowledge that is as number 7.

39
00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:19.990
It has no knowledge of the number 7.

40
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.722
And I don't know maybe
you all got this already.

41
00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:26.523
But when I see the number 7 on the screen,
and I tap it and it changes to 8,

42
00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:28.396
I'm seeing my data change.

43
00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:30.577
What are you worried about?

44
00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:34.988
But actually, that would imply that
30 randomly ordered pixels, or

45
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.453
pixels in a shape,
that they don't know what they are.

46
00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.693
Can become 30 other ordered pixels.

47
00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.380
But these are two totally separate things.

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.950
I can't add one,
I can't add one to a shape of pixels.

49
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.760
Now you may be like, yeah, obviously.

50
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.176
But for me, when I see the number 7 and
I click on it and it becomes 8.

51
00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:57.359
I'm confident I'm changing the data
of the number 7 to 8 right there.

52
00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.221
I can see it,
[LAUGH] it's right on the screen.

53
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:03.670
And I'm not wrong for thinking that
because that is our nature from one year,

54
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.567
two years old.

55
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:05.719
The epistemic and

56
00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.566
the metaphysical, been practicing
saying those words, are identical.

57
00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:13.270
The epistemic is do I
know the pen is here?

58
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.864
I can see it, I tap it.

59
00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:16.950
I can see it, I know it's there.

60
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.680
I tap it, and it moves.

61
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.990
I tap it, and it moves.

62
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.460
All right,
what I see is the underlying data.

63
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.372
It is the underlying, when I see
if I have one pen and make it two,

64
00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:29.618
now I have two pens.

65
00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:30.821
I can see the two pens.

66
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:32.863
This sounds like-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

67
00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:35.815
&gt;&gt; It's like someone's raving

68
00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.826
online [LAUGH] talk.

69
00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:42.457
But I can physically see the atoms,
the underlying state of the world.

70
00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:46.305
Which is where is this pen's atoms
in the universe, are reasonably.

71
00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:50.670
Maybe we wear glasses, maybe we have,
to be honest, in a deeper sense,

72
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.824
do we really know?

73
00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:55.045
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But what I see roughly is what I get.

74
00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:56.560
We learn it from two years old.

75
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.021
What I see is what I get.

76
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.062
And the job of a user interface
engineer is to try and

77
00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:04.760
emulate that in a world in which
that is 100% not the case.

78
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.228
What I see, the pixels on the screen,
is not what I get.

79
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.010
That what I get is under the hood,
in the computer stored in memory.

80
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.642
What I see is 30 lights in a shape that
change into another shape of 30 lights.

81
00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:21.030
I know that doesn't sound like that,
well, okay fine.

82
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.159
But that means there must be
somewhere else in the computer.

83
00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.140
And again, maybe you all thought this.

84
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.075
But there must be somewhere in
the computer, there has to be data.

85
00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:35.236
There has to be somewhere stored,
I don't know, likes of 7, not just so

86
00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:40.001
that it's consistent, but literally so
that you can add one to it.

87
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.698
I can't add one to that,
I can add one to this.

88
00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:46.589
So I can run code to change.

89
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.286
In fact, there's no way the user can
change what they see, which is what we

90
00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:54.176
wanna be able to do, without changing
some underlying state of the universe.

91
00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.180
In the real world, they're the same thing.

92
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.159
The state of the universe is the pen's
physical atoms are in this location.

93
00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:06.223
And when I see is the reflection of those,
my epistemic, my knowledge is the same.

94
00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:09.834
On the computer [SOUND] could
not be further from the truth.

95
00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.252
The one that gets me on
that one was always like,

96
00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:13.956
particularly games like Mario.

97
00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:17.581
If I tap on Mario I know that
I am moving Mario to jump up.

98
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.629
Tap, Mario, and Mario jumped, no.

99
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.127
Instead, when I tap Mario,
I tap an area of pixels on the screen.

100
00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:28.861
It sends a message to somewhere where it
says height is 10 units, for example.

101
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.273
Adds 1 to it, now it's 11 units,
pings back and says,

102
00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:34.860
please paint those
pixels in this new area.

103
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.294
But I tap Mario, Mario moved, uh-uh.

104
00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:39.756
I tap Mario, it sends a message saying.

105
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.956
Please change underlying state,
underlying data, underlying content,

106
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.320
the height of Mario.

107
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.398
And then from that new information,

108
00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:49.694
display the pixels of Mario X
number of pixels further up.

109
00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:53.683
May not be one, maybe 10, maybe whatever,
but yeah, there's underlying data.

110
00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:57.079
So yeah, I add 1 to 7 and I get 8.

111
00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.391
And now I can send a message
back to display the number 8 and

112
00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:03.780
turn those into pixels.

113
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.650
Maybe you all knew that, I don't know.

114
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.775
For me, I just didn't get that.

115
00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:14.676
But that means that for
anything the user sees to change,

116
00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:17.530
there must be underlying data changing.

117
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.285
Otherwise, how is it even changed?

118
00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:24.563
Pixels don't have any knowledge of
what they are, so they can't change.

119
00:06:24.563 --> 00:06:25.961
But we've got a problem.

120
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:30.920
If that means data's got to change,
the fact that HTML is a one-time display,

121
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.263
we can never go back.

122
00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:35.876
We run through this code one time,
and we never return to it.

123
00:06:35.876 --> 00:06:38.905
So even if there were data, number 7.

124
00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:41.066
Okay, great, how do I ever change it?

125
00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:43.477
I can't, it was a one-time display.

126
00:06:43.477 --> 00:06:45.840
Okay, let me just dwell on that, right?

127
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.729
HTML, we literally go through and
grab this code one time.

128
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.110
It is taken one time,
we do not return to it.

129
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.989
I checked, we definitely don't.

130
00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:55.444
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This is a one time display.

131
00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:57.090
I cannot get back to it.

132
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.683
Which is why that question about
the error handling was like, yeah.

133
00:06:59.683 --> 00:07:01.158
Cuz it's really that basic.

134
00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:03.246
Now, to be fair, it can still have
error handling at that point, right?

135
00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:10.829
It implies that it's really, really basic,
but it's wonderfully intuitive for it.

136
00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.070
Okay, so
HTML is one time display of content.

137
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.160
Or sorry, put it more precisely,
one time addition of elements to the DOM.

138
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.870
But the DOM is a list
in C++ with real data.

139
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.680
That's real data.

140
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.864
So yeah, user can change what they see.

141
00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:26.627
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:32.347
That's real data, and you know what,
users can change that data.

143
00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:33.647
They better be able to.

144
00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:38.307
Because users can change what they
see by taking action on the page.

145
00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:42.243
Which given that this is a direct
description, in the DOM, every single

146
00:07:42.243 --> 00:07:46.390
thing on here directly mirrors what's
on the page, that might make sense.

147
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.706
So let's have something written,
what's on your mind.

148
00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:53.680
Let's say I'm writing, Hi.

149
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.948
That's all I have to write.

150
00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:57.978
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're very nice.

151
00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:02.959
Okay, that's going to
immediately add to my

152
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:07.292
C++ data structure, my list there.

153
00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:09.054
Again, people,
just think this is a JavaScript array,

154
00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:10.017
it just happens to be in C++.

155
00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:14.891
All C++ engineer is gonna
add there the string Hi.

156
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:19.358
People, I just said that what
we need to do to have users see

157
00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:23.749
change when they take action
is to store and change data.

158
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:25.340
Well, we're storing some data.

159
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.800
Well, in fact, we're changing the data.

160
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.360
That would therefore implicitly have
been initially an empty string, right?

161
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.320
And then they start writing.

162
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.920
And now there's a string,
it would be like empty string.

163
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.910
They write that at H.

164
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.820
Now there's an H here.

165
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.610
Then, right i, now there's an i
in here in this sort of element.

166
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.597
This would literally be an object.

167
00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:44.359
For example, the property,
I don't know, value and Hi.

168
00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:49.305
In C++,
they're changing the data stored problem.

169
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:49.864
Well, let's see.

170
00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:51.027
I think it says here.

171
00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:56.630
Typing the input field changes DOM data,
changes C++ data from empty string to Hi.

172
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:02.780
However, we can't run any code
ourselves on the DOM in C++.

173
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.790
If only we could.

174
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.689
People, if we could run code on
this position in C++, my God,

175
00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:09.423
life would be a lot easier and

176
00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:12.069
also more risky all at the same time,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

177
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:13.169
&gt;&gt; But a lot easier

178
00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:17.825
as well because we have a full
dynamic store of data here in C++,

179
00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:20.629
capturing all the content on the page.

180
00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:26.215
Unfortunately, we do not get to write
any code in C++ in the browser directly,

181
00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:27.789
and people ask me why.

182
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:32.932
It's I think combination, it's not
unusual for applications that enable

183
00:09:32.932 --> 00:09:38.233
you to write code, the application
that does the parsing, interpretation,

184
00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:44.036
and compiling or some sort of compilation
stage of that code, to be created in C++.

185
00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:46.576
Right, that's just
the heavy lifting language,

186
00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:50.072
which you can then have other
programming languages execute with it.

187
00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:51.256
And that's not unusual.

188
00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:55.883
But I think it is unusual for
them to be so set.

189
00:09:55.883 --> 00:10:00.670
I would put it also down to no one
expected the web browser to be building

190
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.135
out highly complex user interfaces
with thousands of elements,

191
00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:07.827
thousands of views of interactivity.

192
00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:10.728
They thought it was gonna be a bunch
of text with a few clickable links.

193
00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:11.569
That's what they thought.

194
00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:16.501
And so they never imagined that this DOM
they built in C++ being only intractable,

195
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:21.098
well, initially by HTML to add stuff to
it one time, was going to be a problem.

196
00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:25.203
To the point that you remember the first
ten years of the web browser, so

197
00:10:25.203 --> 00:10:30.910
maybe 95 to 2005, was all about trying to
let real applications be built within it.

198
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:36.710
Maybe you remember Java applets, those
things you downloaded that were all Flash.

199
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.658
These were all efforts to recognize,
you know what, in the web browser,

200
00:10:40.658 --> 00:10:43.280
this ain't a proper
development environment.

201
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.210
So let's try and develop.

202
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:53.016
And then I think it was probably Jobs
who said, Steve Jobs who said no.

203
00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:56.850
And that's where we've ever since
had a growth of frameworks,

204
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.477
frameworks that try to work
within our existing structure.

205
00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:04.828
And make it more like a traditional
application developer environment for UI.

206
00:11:04.828 --> 00:11:09.497
So we can affect our data, change it,
basically go from an empty

207
00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:13.569
string to a full string by typing,
by the using action.

208
00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:19.360
However, we cannot run any
code in C++ on that data.

209
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.439
So this is good as stuck.

210
00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:23.940
Well done, we put it in input, but
I can't then display it somewhere else.

211
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.220
I can't add an exclamation mark to it.

212
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.520
If it were a number,
I can't change the number 7 to 8.

213
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.166
I cannot run or execute any code in
C++ on that list of elements that

214
00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:37.194
I want to display and
I want to make dynamic.

215
00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:40.720
I want to make changeable the content,
can't touch it.

216
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.517
So, goal two,
enable users to see the content,

217
00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:47.100
change the content they see,
sorry, but problem.

218
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.010
Step two is impossible with our
original approach to step one.

219
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.460
HTML was a one-time display,
can't change that data, it was done.

220
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.360
DOM, yes, can display data but
can't run code on it.

221
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.150
We can't run code on it to change it.

222
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.080
We have to use what everybody together.

223
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.152
&gt;&gt; JavaScript.

224
00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:05.775
&gt;&gt; Yeah, nice, exactly.

225
00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:08.962
We have to use JavaScript to create and
save content.

226
00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:12.021
Posh name data, even posher name, state.

227
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:14.202
State you can think of as being,
well, it's just all the same.

228
00:12:14.202 --> 00:12:18.616
But it's all the information
about what's being displayed.

229
00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:23.045
If you're in Excel and you tap a cell,
right, and that opens,

230
00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:28.660
double tap a cell, start writing,
that has data associated with that action.

231
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.200
The data is cell is now focused, true.

232
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.730
Versus when you weren't tapped on it,
cell focused, false.

233
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.027
So every single thing, that's why states
probably more general term than data,

234
00:12:39.027 --> 00:12:40.490
but they're all the same.

235
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.349
Data, state, and/or content are all
the underlying things you're trying to

236
00:12:44.349 --> 00:12:46.600
represent as pixels on the page.

237
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.806
But the DOM has it, but
you can't run code to change it.

238
00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:56.178
We have to go to JavaScript to save,
create data content,

239
00:12:56.178 --> 00:13:01.649
and then have the ability
to run code to change it.

240
00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:03.680
And there ain't nowhere else we
can do it in the web browser.
