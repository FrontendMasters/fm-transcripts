WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.742
It all starts with, part one, UI the hard
parts, user interface the hard parts,

2
00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:11.620
state view, JavaScript DOM and
events two goals to UI engineering.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.500
One is writing the code to display that
content, in Tik Tok, it's a video stream.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.024
It's a little hard for number of likes,

5
00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:22.380
it's a little profile
picture of the person.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.260
It's the comment window where
you can start writing a comment.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.360
It's the, I know, the number of views.

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.756
It's once you're in the content creation
part of it, it's the ability to be able to

9
00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:42.081
see your own self in it and make edits to
what you see, that's displaying content.

10
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.824
That's state or data under the hood,

11
00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:47.320
there must be some underlying in
the computer data that is being displayed.

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.587
It's not coming from ether when you open
your phone, it's in there, in the phone,

13
00:00:50.587 --> 00:00:52.770
maybe it's off the internet,
but it's in your phone.

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.700
So, the user can see it, and
then let them interact with it.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.110
That means to tap, that means to swipe.

16
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.992
That means to start typing on their
phone and change what they're seeing.

17
00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:06.576
That becomes most difficult,
it sounds so intuitive,

18
00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:11.164
it sounds honestly like that's it,
two goals, displaying content?

19
00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:14.509
Let's just repeat again,
displaying content and

20
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.252
letting users change the content they see,
that's it?

21
00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:20.784
No wonder people underestimate this field,

22
00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:25.512
no wonder people think that it's because
we're going to see, I can display content

23
00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:29.660
on my web browser with like,
it's gonna be beautifully intuitive.

24
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.732
So, what am I complaining about?

25
00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:37.426
Well, the web browser's ad hoc history
ensures that at any degree of scale,

26
00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:42.870
where we're gonna have thousands of
pieces of content being displayed.

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.406
Any degree of scale,
we're gonna face significant challenges

28
00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:52.282
joining up the dots between
the different pieces of the web browser.

29
00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:54.629
They've been developed over 30 years now.

30
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.813
Starting with CERN back in 91,
I think it was, where by the way,

31
00:01:59.813 --> 00:02:04.386
then the web browser was meant to be
like a text document with links viewer,

32
00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:08.090
like less sophisticated
than the PDF viewer.

33
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.604
And now you wanna build
a video editor in that?

34
00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:16.746
This is like 20 different teams of
developers over 30 years, ten different

35
00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:21.980
regulatory standards bodies, they use
different run times, different APIs.

36
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.738
We're gonna have to join all of those up
together to understand even how to build

37
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.380
a minimal user interface.

38
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.971
To do that, we're gonna to have to,
yeah, join up the JavaScript, run time,

39
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.074
the DOM, which is implemented
we're gonna see in C++.

40
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.125
Combine that with our web core,
web IDL, DOM API, event API, but

41
00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:47.328
if we can do it,
it lets us build dynamic, interactive,

42
00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:52.690
full web applications that are at
the center of all modern experiences.

43
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.795
So, here we go,
almost every single piece of technology

44
00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:01.776
starts with a visual interface,
a visual user interface.

45
00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.028
Have I said this enough times yet?

46
00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:07.725
One, content displayed on the screen,
that's output from the computer.

47
00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:11.676
Two, that the user can change by
taking action, did everyone get that?

48
00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:17.843
Did everyone get, thumbs on that.

49
00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:24.911
If you need to look around to see whether
there's other people then you need to,

50
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.692
I know, no.

51
00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:29.790
Good, thumbs are up, good.

52
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.660
So, let's see some examples,
video stream from Zoom.

53
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.926
That's our lives of course nowadays,
video stream from Zoom,

54
00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.639
lights on a tweet which when I
tap on the number of likes or

55
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.200
click on the number of likes
goes from seven to eight.

56
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.460
I've made this trip so
many times but it's still true, but

57
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.557
of course on my Twitter does not
go from seven to eight, does it?

58
00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:58.302
It goes from likely zero to one,
maybe two to three, if I'm lucky,

59
00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.314
that's a call to all of you.

60
00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:03.614
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes, please Mark, go ahead.

61
00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:07.543
&gt;&gt; Does this workshop apply to
non-traditional interfaces like wearables

62
00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:10.368
and things that,
&gt;&gt; What a great question.

63
00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:15.576
I think what's fascinating is, if you
think about, I was actually considering

64
00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:20.182
we could have gone back and
started with those physical switchboards.

65
00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:22.808
Traditional user interfaces or

66
00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:28.552
even a pilot's dashboard with
again those all-physical switches.

67
00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:33.648
Any machine that has a visual
manifestation of underlying state or

68
00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:39.199
data of what's going on under the hood,
we have to maintain consistency

69
00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.090
between what we see and the truth
behind the scenes in the computer.

70
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.542
And so, really this applies to all
possible user interfaces whether

71
00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:54.929
wearables, a virtual environment, gaming,
or even physical user interfaces.

72
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.609
However, we are focused today
on that playing out in the most

73
00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:05.640
central aspect of our modern tech stack,
the web browser.

74
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.180
And also thank you guys for
getting us back on track, good.

75
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.347
So, video stream from Zoom,
lights on a tweet, you click on like,

76
00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:13.030
goes from seven to eight.

77
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.618
Comments on the chat,
you start writing a comment.

78
00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.316
Now, I can see the comment but
also is now there, right?

79
00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:19.348
We're talking,

80
00:05:19.348 --> 00:05:23.820
we hinted there that it's all about
action to something displayed and change

81
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.520
happening in what we see representing
therefore somehow change under the hood.

82
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.420
Okay, on that note, Mario's position
on the screen there's a little Mario.

83
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.120
Very tiny, yeah, and
if you tap Mario, Mario jumps up.

84
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.900
What people are some other user interfaces
and what's their interactivity?

85
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.215
Okay, who's gonna be the lucky
person who gets called on and

86
00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.524
gives me, Alexa, what's a user interface?

87
00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:56.694
And what's, any application that we
see and where we can take action and

88
00:05:56.694 --> 00:06:01.528
change what we're seeing, and
I guess therefore change something

89
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.288
under the hood about that
particular application.

90
00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:07.637
&gt;&gt; All the songs in your
playlist on Spotify.

91
00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:12.246
&gt;&gt; All the songs in your playlist and
maybe you could press play and now you're

92
00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:16.709
seeing the play button go from a play
button to pause because now the facts

93
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.709
behind the scenes are this is now playing
and you're starting to hear the music.

94
00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.293
Beautiful, Ian?

95
00:06:24.293 --> 00:06:28.655
&gt;&gt; If you have a smart lock,
can you lock or unlock your door?

96
00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:29.976
&gt;&gt; Wow, go, okay.

97
00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:32.382
&gt;&gt; In the app
&gt;&gt; What a wonderfully general,

98
00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:33.859
absolutely spot on Ian.

99
00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:38.169
I'm thinking also like honestly anything
from like a compose window in Gmail where

100
00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.061
you tap, and it pops up the window and
now you're composing your message.

101
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:43.281
Or if you're in Excel or

102
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:47.429
Google Sheets, think of the number of
places you can interact in Google Sheets,

103
00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.724
that's thousands of pieces of
content being displayed to you.

104
00:06:50.724 --> 00:06:55.391
Thousands of places in which you
can act and change what you see or

105
00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:59.028
change the underlying
state of the application.

106
00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:03.185
Underlying state of, when I say state,
I mean like state of the world,

107
00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:07.480
what's going on in that application,
for example, clicking file, and

108
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.637
I can see the little window pop down
in Google Sheets or tapping a cell and

109
00:07:11.637 --> 00:07:14.380
I can go into that cell and start writing.

110
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.448
Or I can highlight down some cells or
I can click I don't know, pivot table, and

111
00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:21.530
that's gonna pop up a little window here.

112
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.720
That's all me seeing content and
being able to change it, that is it.

113
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.186
It just happens that when there's
thousands of pieces of content on

114
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:36.866
the screen, each of which you can interact
with by double tapping, single tapping,

115
00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:40.140
swiping, dragging, mousing in, mousing.

116
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.710
It gets profoundly complex very,
very quickly.

117
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.830
All right,
did I [LAUGH] mention my two goals?

118
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.872
Two goals, one display content
from inside the computer.

119
00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.667
Two, let the user change that content.
