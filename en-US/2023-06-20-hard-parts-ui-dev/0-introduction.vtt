1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.632
In User Interface Hard Parts,
we're going to explore,

2
00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:10.564
I think the most significant part of
most of our experience of computers,

3
00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:16.016
of technology, that is through
a screen that we are able to type at,

4
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.250
to click, to swipe, to tap,
to change what we see.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.610
And we are going to today build
out an understanding of those user

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.840
interfaces from scratch.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.250
This is two simple goals to
user interface engineering.

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.900
One, display content on the screen
such that the user can see it.

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.783
And two, enable the user to go ahead and
actually change what they see.

10
00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:44.973
It turns out that's it.

11
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:48.790
We'll finish goal one
within about 20 minutes.

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.890
Unfortunately, it turns out goal
two is profoundly difficult.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.140
Enabling the user to change what they see,
turns out to be profoundly difficult.

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.494
However, we want to be able to
do that because user interfaces

15
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:05.640
are a vital part of the our
modern experience of technology.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.280
And not least because I think we're
going through a kind of a Cambrian

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120
explosion right now of technology.

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.173
Through sort of two parts, one I would
say is like the normalization of tech,

19
00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:23.640
the rise of software engineering at the
center of everything that we experienced.

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.638
It was before centered around some of
the big tech firms where Google's is

21
00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:29.449
water now.

22
00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:34.164
We're in a time where we have
the JP Morgan's of this world hiring and

23
00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:38.638
talking to the founder tech elevator
based here in the Midwest and

24
00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:44.770
absolutely phenomenal program,
that they pay 600 engineers at JP Morgan.

25
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.770
This is the world we're moving to where
tech is at the center of everything we do.

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.064
On top of that,
we have our wonderful friend ChatGPT,

27
00:01:55.064 --> 00:02:01.512
that is absolutely lining up, again,
a explosion in the amount of tech,

28
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:06.390
the amount of software that
is gonna be out there.

29
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.567
I think all of that is gonna lead to
a huge increase in the number of user

30
00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.673
interfaces we're gonna need to be
building out, that is screens,

31
00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:18.995
that allow us to interact with that
technology and change what we see and

32
00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:22.090
change the state of that technology.

33
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.444
Okay, so in UI Hard Parts,
we're gonna explore four parts,

34
00:02:26.444 --> 00:02:30.760
four hard parts of user
interface engineering.

35
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.985
One, is going to be understanding
how in the web browser this

36
00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:42.420
particularly ad hoc developed
application creation environment.

37
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.950
How we're going to even build
the most minimal user interface?

38
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.090
We're gonna require in that
to understand JavaScript,

39
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.093
how it interplays with the C++
runtime where our DOM is happening,

40
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:59.510
where our event API's are defined.

41
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.690
We're gonna have to
understand webCoRE WebIDL.

42
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.381
A whole bunch of features just to even
build out the most minimal user interface.

43
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:12.657
Then in part two, we'll realize
that at any significant scale,

44
00:03:12.657 --> 00:03:15.700
you're dealing with potentially 1000.

45
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.395
Any sales or sales had 1000s of pieces
of content displayed on the screen,

46
00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:23.612
all of which the user can
interact with and change..

47
00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:27.258
That is going to require some
restrictions on how we write our

48
00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:31.240
code just to make our lives
more predictable and easier.

49
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.596
A vast amount of what we're doing in the
hard parts of user interface is not gonna

50
00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:38.340
be intrinsically a kind of a truth.

51
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.630
Only really part one, building a minimal
user interface is gonna be a truth.

52
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.570
Beyond that it becomes moves by us.

53
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.550
Here's my first catchphrase of the day.

54
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.370
Moves not truths.

55
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.800
One, two, three.

56
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.830
&gt;&gt; Moves not truths.

57
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.485
&gt;&gt; Excellent, everything beyond
part one of hard parts is

58
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:04.900
gonna be moves not truths.

59
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.129
So efforts by us to make our
lives easier as developers and

60
00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.369
part two, we're gonna introduce
one way data binding.

61
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.097
An effort to limit how we as users
can actually end up changing

62
00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:22.269
what we see to just via
changing underlying data, and

63
00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:27.760
then a single function is gonna pull
that data through and display it.

64
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.980
Part two will then allow us in
part three to actually present

65
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.123
in JavaScript a visual representation
of what is gonna show up on the page.

66
00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.666
We're gonna start with HTML
almost before part one and

67
00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:47.000
realize what a beautiful language it is.

68
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.248
For displaying content is
phenomenally intuitive.

69
00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:57.070
Just because it's simple, doesn't mean
it's anything but phenomenally intuitive.

70
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.450
So we'll start there with HTML.

71
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.496
Once we get into JavaScript,
it's gonna be profoundly unintuitive

72
00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:08.320
as to what shows up on the page, it will
not mirror at all what's in our code.

73
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.950
In part three of hard parts,
we're gonna build out a visual or

74
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.149
a virtual DOM that does mirror
what shows up in the page.

75
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:20.726
And then finally, in part four,
we're gonna realize that all

76
00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:24.670
of these gains come at a cost,
the cost being performance.

77
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.798
And if we're gonna build out anything
that is sustainable at scale,

78
00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:33.283
we're gonna need to introduce some
sort of efficiency measures, sorry,

79
00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:35.770
one of which will be state hooks.

80
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.379
Another will be a diffing algorithm,

81
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.944
which is sort of clever code although
as will be very, not clever,

82
00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:47.998
a very basic, a diffing algorithm that
is going to ensure that we're only

83
00:05:47.998 --> 00:05:52.750
making changes to what the user sees
based on what actually changed.

84
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.802
All right, so here we go.

85
00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:57.723
In UI Hard Parts we develop
an under the hood understanding of

86
00:05:57.723 --> 00:05:59.970
building user interfaces
in the web browser.

87
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.978
There's me, there's my world,
there's my wonderful nephew,

88
00:06:05.978 --> 00:06:10.121
Theodore, the lovely Theodore,
there's my sisters, and

89
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:13.960
here I think there's some
principles of engineering.

90
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.582
These are both we look for
in candidates for code Smith, and

91
00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:21.170
what I think make just
long term great engineers.

92
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.070
So we have firstly, problem solving.

93
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.659
This is what we're really
centered on today.

94
00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.580
If you can build out from scratch.

95
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.053
The underlying mental model of
what's happening in UI engineering,

96
00:06:35.053 --> 00:06:39.978
then you can derive from that all sorts
of solutions to the new challenges that

97
00:06:39.978 --> 00:06:42.046
you face in your work day to day.

98
00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:44.260
Then we have our technical communication.

99
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.373
This is,
can I implement what your mental model,

100
00:06:49.373 --> 00:06:55.110
myself via your verbal
communication of it, perfect.

101
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.533
Non technical communication
here is the empathetic and

102
00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:02.173
supportive as every person
talks through their code here,

103
00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:05.547
the endorsement of each
other of that verbalization.

104
00:07:05.547 --> 00:07:08.637
And I think yes, in a sense,
we're building out and

105
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:11.951
under-the-hood understanding
of how UIs are built.

106
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:15.370
That's our JavaScript and
programming experience.
