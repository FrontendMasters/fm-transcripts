00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.374
All right, awesome, so
let's move on to Problem 3,

2
00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:04.294
I really did wanna get
through a lot of this.

3
00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:07.853
So are you guys, is Rust interesting?

4
00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:08.758
Is Go interesting?

5
00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:09.622
How do you feel about Go?

6
00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:11.252
We haven't talked much about Go.

7
00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.853
Go is really simple, right?

8
00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:16.232
Everything you think you should be
able to do it just does it, right?

9
00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:20.148
That's why I said Joe is gonna refer to
as the working man's language because

10
00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.920
anyone can just get up there and
just start typing Go and

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.468
be largely successful
with almost no knowledge.

12
00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.862
You may not be as idiomatic as possible,
but it will still run fairly fast.

13
00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.934
You will likely run into zero foot guns,
and you may write a little too much

14
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:37.688
boilerplate, that's about it,
so it's a pretty nice language.

15
00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:39.409
All right, so let's move on.

16
00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.724
Last question, I just wanted to do
one more, but this one's from 2020,

17
00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:44.458
cuz I think this one's a pretty fun one,

18
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:46.652
it gets us a little bit
more into something unique.

19
00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:50.526
So again, Mr. Santa, thank you,
here's a link to it.

20
00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:55.217
So you're given this as you're
following input, and you want to be

21
00:00:55.217 --> 00:01:00.071
able to take this and you are gonna
ride a toboggan, a sled down this and

22
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:04.376
see how many trees you will hit
if you go one down, three over.

23
00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:10.182
One down, three over, one down three over,
and it wraps over and over and over again.

24
00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:12.142
So it just goes on infinitely this way.

25
00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:16.042
So I mean, these problems tend to be
really hard if you don't have a good

26
00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.760
strategy going into it, but
this one I think, will be fairly easy.

27
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.718
So here's our initial input.

28
00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:24.106
So if you're on the website,
you can grab that right down copy,

29
00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.754
cuz you know we're going
to use it shortly.

30
00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:28.503
And a pound sign is a tree.

31
00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:31.081
A dot A piece of snow.

32
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.762
So here's our example input,
you don't need to get the size,

33
00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.339
we should just be able to parse this.

34
00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.214
And we need to travel three right,
one down and

35
00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:41.028
count how many trees
we hit starting at 00.

36
00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:45.888
So, and you can make the assumption
that this direction is positive y,

37
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:48.240
and this direction is positive x,
