00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:02.710
So there we go, we got it,
everything is just working.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.459
We've done it,

3
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.100
we've worked through three of the same
programs in three different languages.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.050
I'm happy, we've done it.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.790
I hope everyone had a good time.

6
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.850
I wasn't actually sure if this was
gonna be a good course or not, right?

7
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.378
This is kind of a weird idea to write
three different languages at the same

8
00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:16.380
time, will people hate it?

9
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.370
Will people love it?

10
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.768
In fact, at the time of writing this,

11
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.530
I don't even know how the course went,
right?

12
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.832
So part of the slide is,
I might have been sad at this point.

13
00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:28.094
But I hope that everyone enjoyed this
really put a lot of effort into this to

14
00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:32.242
make it so that you can kind of learn
from a lot of the pitfalls that I had.

15
00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.666
That last little planning
one with the error and

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.951
everything crumbling as we've
done it correctly all the time.

17
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:42.285
It was very tricky to make sure we could
build something that's coherent in all

18
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.401
three languages but

19
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:47.975
still present real problems of
not thinking about what happens.

20
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:48.775
And there you go.

21
00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:50.955
So, if you guys have any final questions?

22
00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:55.239
This is it, this is your chance,
this is your time.

23
00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.551
I'm not as restatious as some guy
named John Who on the Internet,

24
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:02.297
but I still try, so.

25
00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:06.102
I don't have a PhD in crabs yet, so
I'm not there, a doctorate crab MD.

26
00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.056
Well, I wanna thank everybody.

27
00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:12.771
Obviously this course wouldn't
been as good without you guys.

28
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.756
I feel the energy level is great,
especially when you have people here.

29
00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:21.291
I really appreciate that
you all stayed here.

30
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.976
Obviously, after day one, I expected there
to be no audience but instead everyone's

31
00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:30.231
back except for the one guy that's
claiming he's sick, right there, okay.

32
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:31.184
He's at home.

33
00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:34.303
But no, I'm very, very happy,
I'm glad you guys got here.

34
00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:37.495
Thank you so much for everyone on
frontendmasters.com asking those

35
00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.924
questions, there are some
really good questions.

36
00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:44.731
I really appreciated everyone on Twitch,
thank you so much for being here.

37
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.612
I will be continuing to make
absurd YouTube videos and

38
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:50.629
streaming on Twitch per usual,
so I'll see you there.

39
00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:54.902
And of course, if you liked all this
sweet terminal action that we had today,

40
00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:58.345
check out my Vim course or
my developer productivity course.

41
00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.685
Developer productivity courses is,
of course, this right here,

42
00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:06.107
how I'm switching, how do I get my laptop
up and running in different environments?

43
00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:06.931
This is great.

44
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.434
So thank you very much, bye.

45
00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:13.883
