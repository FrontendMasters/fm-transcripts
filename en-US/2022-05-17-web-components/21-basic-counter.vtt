WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.784
For the next hour or so, we're gonna kinda
go through an author web components,

2
00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:07.753
which is kind of exciting.

3
00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:10.084
We haven't really done that yet
in the web components course, but

4
00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:11.006
now we're finally here.

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.730
Now, we understand all the principles and

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.843
have had some challenges [LAUGH] along
the way, we are excited to code.

7
00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:24.420
I have three basic
examples in the guidebook.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.472
I think we maybe have time for
two if we wanna get out of here and so.

9
00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:33.450
And then the big one,
the basic counter example, right?

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.861
So just how do you do an increment button?

11
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:40.840
Maybe we can add some styles to it, make
it kind of cool, maybe we'll start there.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.216
I have the custom alert example,
where that custom alert I built in, and

13
00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:48.543
then I can close it, and
then it hides and disappears.

14
00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:51.166
We could also do that one, but
I think we'll just do the counter thing,

15
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.114
that's probably the easiest
way to get through it.

16
00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:54.905
And then kind of the big one, right?

17
00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:58.276
Let's build an app that looks for
local breweries, and

18
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.585
we can see if we visited them and
check them off as we go.

19
00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:05.756
Maybe something like that,
something pretty useful, utilitarian.

20
00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:10.076
[LAUGH] And then kind of annoying maybe
get into the more like what does an actual

21
00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.608
app whole design system,
whole everything kind of feel like?

22
00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:14.675
How do we do that?

23
00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:19.960
And maybe the easiest way to get going and
get started some.

24
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.201
So we'll kind of start with the basic
counter, and you can maybe,

25
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.722
at this point, probably yell it at me.

26
00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:31.620
[LAUGH] But so I have some cheaters here.

27
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.520
So here, we need to start with a basic.

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.591
We want my-counter, right?

29
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.880
And we want it to show up here,
let me see,

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.178
nothing's defined, okay, here we go.

31
00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:53.084
I'm just gonna call it my-counter just so
we know it for later, and

32
00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:55.424
then we're gonna type garbage in here.

33
00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:58.185
So we know when the shadow DOM shows up.

34
00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.696
[LAUGH] We did our job right, right?

35
00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:05.095
So I think the first thing we're
gonna see, let's see here,

36
00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:08.153
nothing's happening, is that correct?

37
00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:10.580
That seems like it should
render at least something.

38
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.258
Yeah, okay, cool,
I need to figure out what's going on.

39
00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:19.702
Maybe I'll just make sure that
that's also, okay, cool, all right.

40
00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:23.143
CodePen thinks I'm a hacker,
okay, great, [LAUGH] we're good.

41
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:27.263
Okay, we're back, CodePen, we're good.

42
00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:29.949
CodePen might be upset with how
many changes I've made today.

43
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.888
Great, here we go.

44
00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:37.600
All right, so the outline, right, class.

45
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.430
We do classes, but
if we wanted to be cool to our friends

46
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.847
who might wanna use this array,
we could do that.

47
00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:51.935
My-counter extends, and
do we want to do the lit one?

48
00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:57.375
Let's just do lit,
cuz I'm not really a framework's guy,

49
00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:01.010
I'm not really a just use a library guy.

50
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.975
But library solve a lot problems, and
I think we're gonna [LAUGH] in this

51
00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:09.638
circumstance for
a five to seven kilobyte penalty.

52
00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:13.958
I think it's a good trade-off just for
learning.

53
00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.830
So MyCharacter is going
to extend LitElement,

54
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.116
but of course, we need import,

55
00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:26.637
we're going to go get LitElement, right?

56
00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:30.282
Element, and
then we know we want the HTML thing, and

57
00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:33.854
we might as well just grab
the CSS while we're here.

58
00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:37.723
From lit, right, and then it's gonna say,
CodePen has this nice feature, it says,

59
00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:39.642
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:41.918
So we're gonna go get it from Skypack.

61
00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.162
Great, we have it.

62
00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:49.366
And then the last thing,
we need to do customElements,

63
00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:52.931
plural, define my-counter.

64
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.889
And it's going to point
to the MyCounter class.

65
00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.101
Easy enough, we're good here.

66
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:06.293
Okay, we're gonna have some
static properties, right?

67
00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:07.537
We have what?

68
00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:15.519
What properties would our
counter need to keep track of?

69
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.362
&gt;&gt; Count, yeah.

70
00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:18.169
&gt;&gt; Count, okay, great.

71
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.721
Yeah, it needs to keep track of a count,
right?

72
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:25.355
And so, and then I'll circle back to that,
but that's what it's gonna need,

73
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:26.891
it needs a count, right?

74
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:32.293
We know we needed the constructor,
which is not my favorite part,

75
00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:36.447
but that's just life in
class based programming.

76
00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:39.477
[LAUGH] So
we're gonna call this super, and

77
00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:44.457
then we're probably going to
initialize this count, right, to 0.

78
00:04:44.457 --> 00:04:49.030
So this will be the section
where we want to kinda set it.

79
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.369
There may be a way to set it up here,
I don't know it offhand, so

80
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:53.692
I just set it down there.

81
00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:59.469
And then because we're in Lit,
we're gonna do a render function, right?

82
00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.456
And then what does our render function do?

83
00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:04.533
Return html, right?

84
00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:09.685
And then it's gonna have the button,

85
00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:15.485
plus or minus, we'll put the -1 first.

86
00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:19.938
We'll return this count, and

87
00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:24.562
then we'll have a button that it

88
00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:29.536
makes it go up, okay, into that.

89
00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:33.390
The pieces are in there,
it's not interactive,

90
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.571
nothing happens here, but
that's actually really easy to do.

91
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.747
We have a question, yeah.

92
00:05:39.747 --> 00:05:43.253
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't wanna get off
track on framework stuff, but

93
00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:45.716
why is count an object in the properties?

94
00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:50.769
&gt;&gt; Good question,
[LAUGH] I think you can maybe just

95
00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:55.566
make it count, but
it didn't yell at me, but

96
00:05:55.566 --> 00:06:00.384
I don't know if it's
gonna do anything yet.

97
00:06:00.384 --> 00:06:05.023
One reason you do that, and
what I was gonna test here was

98
00:06:05.023 --> 00:06:09.084
trying to get into the increment and
decrement.

99
00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:13.628
And so one thing you do here to say it's

100
00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:18.464
a reactive property is this state true?

101
00:06:18.464 --> 00:06:22.063
And so you're basically saying,
this is a piece of state, so

102
00:06:22.063 --> 00:06:24.707
let's keep track of it
like a piece of state.

103
00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:26.788
So is that-
&gt;&gt; It's hard configuration,

104
00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:29.251
then this is a property on this class.

105
00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:34.353
&gt;&gt; Totally, and
then you can actually pass a type,

106
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:37.596
it doesn't do anything here.

107
00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:41.737
It doesn't actually do type checking,
although, in theory,

108
00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:43.583
we're sort of set up for it.

109
00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:46.852
And if you're using
something more type based,

110
00:06:46.852 --> 00:06:50.047
a lot of people use Lit
with TypeScript as well.

111
00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:53.403
So you could do checking there also.

112
00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:56.488
&gt;&gt; Can you pass in a value
up there then too or?

113
00:06:56.488 --> 00:06:59.298
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're getting there,
we're gonna get there.

114
00:06:59.298 --> 00:07:04.840
Yeah, so right now, so
it's an interesting thing.

115
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.903
So when it state,
it wants to be like local state, right?

116
00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:13.553
Like inside, this is kind of a weird
thing I just sort of learned, but

117
00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:17.016
count wouldn't be cool if
we could pass in a count.

118
00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:19.577
But we don't see that, right?

119
00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:27.610
It's not happening, but what's weird is
if I just take this out, it does work.

120
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:34.620
So that's sort of the properties API's,
there's local state equals true is state.

121
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.012
And then I guess state equals false,

122
00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:43.713
the default would turn it into
a property that you can adjust.

123
00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:48.483
And this has some interesting side
effects, we have not rode our buttons, but

124
00:07:48.483 --> 00:07:49.432
you know what?

125
00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:55.491
[LAUGH] One thing I kinda do is,
this is my weirdest favorite part.

126
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.231
So from the document,

127
00:07:58.231 --> 00:08:03.430
I can querySelector my-counter, okay?

128
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:10.496
And then I can say count = 10.

129
00:08:10.496 --> 00:08:15.131
Weird, I can't really do
that with a React component

130
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:20.077
to my knowledge,
[LAUGH] just like hot select it and edit.

131
00:08:20.077 --> 00:08:21.444
It's internal value, that's pretty cool.

132
00:08:21.444 --> 00:08:26.707
It's cool to me, Dave Rupert, and
just in the fact, you could change.

133
00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:30.288
If I had my podcast player and I just
wanted to like you clicked a link, and

134
00:08:30.288 --> 00:08:32.358
now it shoots up into the podcast player.

135
00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:37.116
That could be kind of cool,
I just yoink the URL,

136
00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:42.005
the file URL, and
then put it into the component.

137
00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:46.747
Kind of interesting, but let's get
the local state kind of going, right?

138
00:08:46.747 --> 00:08:50.985
So cuz I don't know how to
spell increment and decrement,

139
00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:54.253
we're just gonna do plus and minus.

140
00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:59.563
I'm smart, I swear, count++, right?

141
00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:07.988
Easy enough, and then our minus
is going to be, minus is count--.

142
00:09:07.988 --> 00:09:14.205
And then we have to go to our buttons,
right?

143
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:18.309
And this is a custom directive, right?

144
00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.932
Is that what they're called
when it's like the thing?

145
00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:25.648
Yeah, okay, I get the directive and
decorators mixed up.

146
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.461
So this, but
we need to use JavaScript in here.

147
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.319
So this._plus, so we're just gonna say,

148
00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:37.786
when you click this @click,
do this._plus, and

149
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:42.674
then on this one @click, or
this one's minus, sorry.

150
00:09:42.674 --> 00:09:46.289
That would have missed it,
that would have been a bug.

151
00:09:46.289 --> 00:09:49.645
And this one is this._plus, and

152
00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:54.170
I think this should work
even with the quotes.

153
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.619
JSX, you can get confused cuz
you wouldn't put quotes there.

154
00:09:57.619 --> 00:10:02.751
I'm getting confused, but what's neat
about this is we're able to kind

155
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:08.158
of pretty quickly create a counter,
allow it to be externally initialized.

156
00:10:08.158 --> 00:10:12.168
So if it's your cart or
something like that,

157
00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:16.704
it can be initialized like
that from the exterior,

158
00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:20.516
and then we can do this plus or
minus thing.

159
00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:24.386
But this weird state true, now,

160
00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:29.224
it's just a only a local state variable,

161
00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:32.971
it's not broadcast anywhere.

162
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.671
So any questions,
you wanna do some styles?

163
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:38.855
We can make our buttons green,

164
00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:43.149
cuz I feel like we've struggled
with [LAUGH] buttons all day.

165
00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:49.576
Styles =, and then they said this works.

166
00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:56.683
[LAUGH] Let's try it, button ( background:
green ), hopefully that does it.

167
00:10:56.683 --> 00:10:59.939
Hey, that did work that time,

168
00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:06.039
it's Christmas miracle, yes, sir
&gt;&gt; In the properties, the count, and

169
00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:11.000
then having an object and state and all
that, is that specific to Lit or is that?

170
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.349
&gt;&gt; That's specific to Lit,

171
00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:19.676
the way it kind of works in Vanilla Realm,

172
00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:24.395
and this is just kind of pseudocode,

173
00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:28.824
static get observedAttributes.

174
00:11:28.824 --> 00:11:33.809
So you basically create,
and I think this returns

175
00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:37.972
an array of count or something like that.

176
00:11:37.972 --> 00:11:39.381
And so basically,

177
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:45.113
you're registering an attribute that
you want to eventually keep track of.

178
00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:50.480
And then that's an attribute changed,
when that attribute changes,

179
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.516
you get notified of
the attribute changed callback.

180
00:11:54.516 --> 00:12:00.731
So again, sort of that issue where
a props and attributes are different.

181
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:04.151
It's all sort of showing up now that
we're starting to author web components.

182
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:07.814
And that's just sort of one maybe
sticky point you need to be aware of,

183
00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:09.627
is just how props and attributes.

184
00:12:09.627 --> 00:12:13.409
They feel like the same thing, but
they're kinda different to HTML, so, yes.

185
00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:18.341
&gt;&gt; Are there limitations on the property
names, you can use whatever you want or?

186
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:21.249
&gt;&gt; You can use whatever you want for
properties.

187
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.260
You can use whatever you want, it may get,

188
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.867
what if it's source [LAUGH] like an image
in the actual existing property.

189
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:37.246
That might be problematic, but

190
00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:42.503
I could also see situations
where you'd change or

191
00:12:42.503 --> 00:12:48.387
you'd want ARIA or
things like that reflected in here,

192
00:12:48.387 --> 00:12:52.783
check attributes, and stuff like that.

193
00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:54.756
So that's a good question.

194
00:12:54.756 --> 00:12:57.777
I don't know how far you can break it or

195
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:03.737
if it yells about something existing,
I mean, we could switch this to or.

196
00:13:03.737 --> 00:13:08.697
Yeah, I don't think it cares,

197
00:13:08.697 --> 00:13:14.402
because it's your custom element.

198
00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:17.895
It thinks it's a div,
the browser thinks this is a div or span.

199
00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:21.562
It says, okay, cool, that's the div or
something goes there, and

200
00:13:21.562 --> 00:13:23.975
then you tell it what
attributes it accepts.

201
00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:30.905
So there may be just weird
situations I'm not thinking of,

202
00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:35.893
but there's also in HTML, we have the data

203
00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:41.175
hyphen attributes, data-foo=myvalue.

204
00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:48.068
This stuff all kind of is maybe as dumb as
HTML seems, that's intelligently designed.

205
00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:51.734
Because data stuff has a hyphen, and

206
00:13:51.734 --> 00:13:56.473
then the elements stuff
does not have a hyphen.

207
00:13:56.473 --> 00:14:01.948
So kind of these user authored
things probably need a hyphen,

208
00:14:01.948 --> 00:14:08.809
but the element authored things should
have a normal, unhyphenated thing.

209
00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:12.011
No hard rules here, but
this just interesting, so.

210
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.072
&gt;&gt; Other patterns that
people generally follow?

211
00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:18.476
&gt;&gt; No, I mean,
I think it's just usually just

212
00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:22.535
whatever makes sense
succinctly as possible, so.

213
00:14:22.535 --> 00:14:27.765
Cuz this is your insurance
policy that no one is there.

214
00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:30.393
And I don't really talk about it, but

215
00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:35.658
there is a chance, like what if two
my-counters show up on the page?

216
00:14:35.658 --> 00:14:38.207
No, [LAUGH] what do we do?

217
00:14:38.207 --> 00:14:42.929
There's proposals and stuff like that for
namespacing custom elements.

218
00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:47.543
So if I import this package of components,

219
00:14:47.543 --> 00:14:52.166
I wanted to go into this namespace bucket.

220
00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:57.323
I don't know the status on that,
so I don't cover it, but

221
00:14:57.323 --> 00:15:03.450
there's kind of this idea of namespace
says or sets for components.
