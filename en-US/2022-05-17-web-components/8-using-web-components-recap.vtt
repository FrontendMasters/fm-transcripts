WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.820
So Web Components, right?

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.690
It's easy as HTML.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.470
Great reusability, right?

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.810
We can just copy some tags and
paste them into another site.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.030
We can get better experiences, right?

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.546
Well, I can't build a 3D experience but
I can with Web Components,

7
00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:27.360
I don't want to build that slider thing,
but I can with Web Components.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.489
Progressively enhanced, I think we showed
a couple of times where if the JavaScript

9
00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.090
for whatever reason fails,
and I'm not a JavaScript.

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.542
People turn off JavaScript although
like 1% of people turn off JavaScript.

11
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.917
I have one friend that turns off
JavaScript, his name is James.

12
00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:51.727
So, [LAUGH] James turns off JavaScript,
but most people don't turn off JavaScript.

13
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:56.770
JavaScript does a great
job turning itself off.

14
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.850
So if one problem happens, boom,
it just says, I'm just not gonna work.

15
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.840
So and that's okay.

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.520
So progressive enhancement.

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.770
It's not always a requirement for
me but it can save your bacon.

18
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.359
It can let a form submit
if you do it right.

19
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.903
No build tools were harmed in the,

20
00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:23.501
[LAUGH] production of
this section of the talk.

21
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.371
We didn't open the CLI,

22
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:32.256
we just copy pasted HTML
from third party sources.

23
00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:36.672
So you can of course, get into build
tools, bring things locally, but

24
00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:38.840
we kinda did none of that.

25
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.273
And it's encapsulated.

26
00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:45.940
The styles in my 3D world didn't
bleed out to the rest of the page.

27
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.180
I don't think they did.

28
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.821
But the styles I'm writing or
the sort of like the button styles and

29
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:53.511
stuff like that for the two up,

30
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:58.680
they didn't bleed out into the rest of
the page, it's all encapsulated together.

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.692
So that way you have a little bit
security to know if you change something,

32
00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:05.750
the barstool and
the other bars ain't gonna fall over.

33
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.108
Okay, on that note, we'll do some Q&amp;A, or

34
00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:14.480
take just like a two minute break,
let's go here.

35
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.949
&gt;&gt; So you had mentioned about
that CSS not bleeding out but

36
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:22.337
you also mentioned overriding
styles within these Web Components.

37
00:02:22.337 --> 00:02:26.578
So can you speak to how that works out
if you did wanna write something that in

38
00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:27.600
a Web Component?

39
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.381
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there are a few ways and
we'll talk about it and

40
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:39.797
then like next big section
like right after lunch, but

41
00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:46.993
the kind of core ways to provide
styling are, you control the light DOM.

42
00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:51.192
So anything that you send in there,
I don't know,

43
00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:54.220
I could have done like hue rotation,

44
00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.200
CSS on those images I passed into
the two-up cuz I control that stuff.

45
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.370
I wrote that light down.

46
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.591
There's also this thing called inheritable
styles, I can talk about that later,

47
00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:11.140
but it's some styles do sort of
filter through but some don't.

48
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.670
And so some Web Components like two-up
offer these like CSS variables,

49
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.723
cuz that's one of the things
that do go through.

50
00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:23.155
And so variables are kinda one way
component authors offer styling in

51
00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:24.310
customization.

52
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.640
Does that help?

53
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.404
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like anecdotally or in your
experience on the topic of build tools do

54
00:03:32.404 --> 00:03:38.031
you see and encounter people, I'm guessing
transpiring down to you, so it doesn't

55
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:43.290
happen much because the browser age that
is needed for Components themselves.

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.049
But in minification typically just like,
hey, I use headers to Jessup.

57
00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.375
What do you see people using for
kind of at scale apps or

58
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.980
sites that use Web Components?

59
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So there's a little bit of data out there,

60
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.983
that minification is great, but

61
00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:13.460
Brotli compression is maybe just fine.

62
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.238
And then there can be the side
effect of minification

63
00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:23.703
where you uglify script A and script B and

64
00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:28.692
they're both trying to call function C,
and

65
00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:32.255
boom, [LAUGH] a problem occurs.

66
00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:33.709
Is that what the browser says?

67
00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.445
[LAUGH] It messes up.

68
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:42.200
And so I think at scale people
are doing the bundling and minifying,

69
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.705
but in Web Component land and
this takes a bit of reprogramming,

70
00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:49.640
that's all a production level concern.

71
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.000
So it's not the development environment,
that's a production problem.

72
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.520
Like the bundling minification asset, sort
of splitting, tree shaking, all of that.

73
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.960
That's a production thing.

74
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.824
And in what's nice, good and
bad about that, it's bring your own, so

75
00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:12.864
we don't like that, [LAUGH].

76
00:05:12.864 --> 00:05:16.767
As developers, for me personally,
I might have to code that,

77
00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.300
[LAUGH] that's not what I wanted.

78
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.989
But what is also good about it is you

79
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:29.170
aren't locked into like webpack 4.

80
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.537
The project I work on, we are locked into
a webpack until a big sea change of other

81
00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:42.300
cascading changes happens to enable like
switching to ESBL or something like that.
