1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.167
My talk is called HTML with Superpowers.

2
00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:07.849
It's gonna be kind of an intro
to intermediate sort of

3
00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.043
area of web components.

4
00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:14.828
And I'm Dave Rupert, and that's kinda
what you need to know right now.

5
00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:17.530
A little bit about me,
just links if you need them.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.870
I work at a company called Paravel,
we're based in Austin, Texas.

7
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.850
I've been working on an app for
about the last six months called Luro.

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.010
And I have a blog, it has an RSS feed.

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.484
I have a podcast with Chris Coyier,
formerly of CSS-Tricks,

10
00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:31.803
called Shop Talk Show.

11
00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:34.901
We have a YouTube over at
youtube.com/shoptalkshow.

12
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.790
I run my mouth on Twitter.

13
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.627
I put bad code up on GitHub and CodePen.

14
00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:41.799
Please mute your headphones or

15
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:45.680
wear headphones if you go
to my CodePen profile.

16
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.582
And I'm involved in a group called Open
UI, where I'm doing web components and

17
00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.590
I'm in the web components community group.

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.411
Which is just a W3C group,
anyone can join,

19
00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:01.151
I'm just a member,
I'm really not anything special.

20
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.345
I'm just a participant.

21
00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:07.009
So and then kind of the housekeeping for
this course.

22
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.145
I have course links,

23
00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:12.065
there's a whole guidebook up at
htmlwithsuperpowers.netlify.app.

24
00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:16.375
These slides here are at
slideswithsuperpowers.netlify.app.

25
00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:20.180
And then I have some web component links.

26
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.460
The first one is to the web
components community group site.

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.330
Then the web components community group
GitHub, which has a lot of repos and

28
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.570
kind of upcoming specs that
the community is kind of advocating for.

29
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.086
And then Open Web Components is .org,

30
00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:44.899
openwc.org is a really great resource for
just learning web components.

31
00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.787
They have a lot of materials and tools.

32
00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:50.318
lit.dev is,
lit is a web component library and

33
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:55.890
they also have tutorials and all kinds
of things educational stuff there.

34
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.839
And then, of course, Mozilla MDN has a web
components section worth checking out.

35
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:05.528
So let's tell you who this course is for.

36
00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:09.677
It's for developers who
are evaluating web components.

37
00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:12.967
If you're kind of in a position where
you have to choose technology or

38
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.975
you're just interested in trying
to figure out what they are,

39
00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:19.288
do they fit into what you're doing,
do they fit into your workflow?

40
00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:20.309
This is for you.

41
00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.920
Developers forced to use web components.

42
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.305
I think there's some in this room.

43
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.349
[LAUGH] And you're just kind of got
thrown into a job and they told you,

44
00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.952
you have to use this.

45
00:02:29.952 --> 00:02:31.432
No, this is for you.

46
00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:36.330
People interested in web components,
maybe you just heard about them, or

47
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.153
you have a passing interest and
you're not particularly motivated, but

48
00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:42.960
you're just interested.

49
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.424
People interested in components systems.

50
00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:50.443
Design systems are a big deal right now,
this is a way to build one.

51
00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:54.012
And so if you like component
systems you might like this.

52
00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:57.799
People interested in component systems but
don't really like Java Script frameworks.

53
00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.146
This would also be kind
of in your alley here.

54
00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:04.760
And anyone who makes websites,
really, because it's part of the web.
