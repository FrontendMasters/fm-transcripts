WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:05.170
So one common question is we went
through the way to install or

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.591
do styles through a link restyle sheet.

3
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:13.846
That it's hard to explain, but
it feels a little ugly, right?

4
00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:20.464
And you can't really explain it, even
writing a style tag in the web component,

5
00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:26.617
that feels a little ugly don't know why,
but it just doesn't feel right.

6
00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:29.716
It's totally fine, it's valid HTML, but

7
00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:33.672
then we looked at importing style sheets,
the new way.

8
00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:38.148
And we finally figured it out
it took a little [LAUGH] behind

9
00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:42.170
the scenes camera work,
but we figured it out.

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.701
And I'm gonna kinda walk you through how
it works as from the lit context, but

11
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:50.745
just what's going on with this thing
called adopted style sheets and

12
00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:55.503
I put the crying emoji because it caused
me pain and suffering to figure this out.

13
00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:59.881
But it's relatively new, so it's new to me
and happy mistakes, we're figuring it out.

14
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.937
So, import sheet,
we're importing a style sheet.

15
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:08.856
This is a constructed style sheet, we're
importing constructed style sheet from

16
00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:12.242
our style sheet, our code pen,
this code pen actually.

17
00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:17.447
But this style sheet right here is
being presented as a style sheet and

18
00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:20.415
we're asserting its type equals CSS.

19
00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:25.171
You can have other types,
type equals HTML type equals JSON,

20
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.483
JSON works in the browser
today HTML does not quite yet.

21
00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:35.421
But then when we go down, see how we have
no styles in our in our custom alert?

22
00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:38.433
Well, we can delete that
we're not using it.

23
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.944
But then in our connected callback,
the way lit wants you to do this.

24
00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:47.905
You call super connected callback,
call the parent connected callback,

25
00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:52.393
just make sure it runs how you expect,
but then this render route and

26
00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:55.560
that's lit way to call a shadow route,
right?

27
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.178
That's where the content renders.

28
00:01:57.178 --> 00:02:03.259
This render route adopted
style sheets equals brackets,

29
00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.843
they're just regular brackets,
brackets sheet and

30
00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:16.060
so that puts it into the adopts
the style sheet into the shadow root.

31
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.551
This won't work from here, but you can
use this without web components too,

32
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:25.352
it's a way you can use it
without web components, and

33
00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:28.900
you can adopt them into
the document itself.

34
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.780
Nothing's gonna happen here but if we had,
that might be confusing because

35
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.953
it like would apply to the code pen and
stuff as well.

36
00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:43.397
But you can adopt style
sheets in native HTML now.

37
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:46.888
That said this feature is
not in every browser yet

38
00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:50.463
at the time of this talk and
so it may be a full year or

39
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:54.480
something before you're
seeing this everywhere you go
