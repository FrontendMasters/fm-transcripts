WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.310
Why would these guys,
these companies, use Web Components?

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.834
Is anyone notice anything about
these companies, a commonality?

3
00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.885
It's question and answer time.

4
00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:21.919
Stumped, consistent brand.

5
00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.510
That's good, that's good, they do,

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.873
they need a consistent brand
across multiple properties, right?

7
00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:32.100
And not working on one app.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.010
They kinda have a lot of things.

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.380
For me,
it's like these are all big, right?

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.270
They're all very big companies.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.400
And their design systems have
to go more places, right?

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.810
They don't just have the React app.

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.010
They don't just have the View app.

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.130
They don't just have the Svelte app or
the Angular app.

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.830
They have the old Rails app, right?

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.020
They have the crusty old Java
app that just barely works.

17
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.680
Who knows how it works, but
it still works, but it still needs a UI.

18
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.250
They have the WordPress site.

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.846
Have you tried to put
React inside of WordPress?

20
00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.450
It's not the supraspinous thing.

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.820
You can do it technically and
decouple the head and stuff.

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.841
But not the easiest thing to stuff a React
build process inside of WordPress,

23
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.820
or the Laravel site.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.539
Laravel is a really great PHP framework.

25
00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.588
It works very well,
do I have just to have components?

26
00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:33.706
Do I really have to decouple whole
front-end just to have components

27
00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:34.280
in my UI?

28
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.791
Web Components sort of just gives
you the ability to not be whole hog

29
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:43.203
invested into a single framework,
if that makes sense.

30
00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:47.913
And even if you're to
replatform [LAUGH] something,

31
00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:54.451
someday one team on your site really
wants to use View, for some reason.

32
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.349
And so you have to basically reimplement
all those components into another

33
00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.210
framework.

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.812
I heard somebody recently call it
the [LAUGH] million dollar button or

35
00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.355
something like that.

36
00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:11.114
Just you spend all this money to
rebuild something in another framework,

37
00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:14.503
and then you have to have
tests that match and stuff.

38
00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:22.440
Web Components might be a way to skirt
some of this stuff and truly is it this?

39
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.658
Okay, I'll talk about it later,
but different frameworks,

40
00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:34.361
JavaScript frameworks, have different
levels of support for Web Components.

41
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:39.401
So you may find that your Web Components
work inside your View app.

42
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.492
They work inside your
Svelte app just fine, and

43
00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:47.210
you can use them without
re-platforming your whole Svelte app.

44
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.117
So maybe a way to increase your
distribution without breaking your neck

45
00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:53.270
in the process.

46
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.650
All right, let's recap, and
then we'll take a break.

47
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.350
Web Components are little bundles of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

48
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.770
They're your Lego.

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.790
They're your component.

50
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.400
Web Components are a set of web standards.

51
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.804
There's the four web standards
template Custom Elements,

52
00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:15.700
I'm blanking, Shadow DOM,
and import ES modules.

53
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.130
Web Components are growing in usage.

54
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.807
And big companies are using Web Components
on big apps like Photoshop and Wordle.

55
00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:28.127
That's the biggest sell I have for
you right now.

56
00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:31.254
So on that note, are there any questions?

57
00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:33.826
We can do a quick round of
questions if anyone has them, and

58
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.210
then otherwise take a break.

59
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.872
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:40.316
&gt;&gt; You were talking about how Web
Components can be used across frameworks.

61
00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:45.005
And I've heard that React, in particular,
they're kind of difficult to use with, and

62
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:46.263
I primarily use React.

63
00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:50.133
So I was wondering if you could speak to
those difficulties if you know about them?

64
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:55.485
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, and so there's a site,

65
00:03:55.485 --> 00:04:00.148
there's a custom elements,

66
00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:04.984
gosh, this does not bode well for

67
00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:08.825
the live coding session.

68
00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:11.190
[LAUGH] So Custom Elements Everywhere.

69
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.120
This basically ranks or runs a set
of test suites against frameworks.

70
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.510
And React is the notable outlier.

71
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.039
This number has actually gotten
a lot better in the last year.

72
00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:29.840
But it deals very specifically with how
React treats everything as a prop, right?

73
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.210
Like attributes and everything's a prop.

74
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.703
You can just ...props, and
they all just splay out into props.

75
00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:41.353
HTML, props and
attributes are very different things.

76
00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:44.563
Like your ARIA selected attribute,

77
00:04:44.563 --> 00:04:49.429
[LAUGH] in the canonical HTML sense or
your image source,

78
00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:55.390
is different than whatever,
what would be a property on an image.

79
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.040
I guess,
some custom image thing you would want.

80
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.340
I don't even know how many clicks or
something.

81
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.180
The size xy or something like that.

82
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.550
That would be like a,
I guess like a prop on an image, right?

83
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.915
So React treats everything like a prop.

84
00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:18.820
In HTML, props and
attributes are different.

85
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.840
But, sneak preview,
there is an experimental branch of React.

86
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.686
And we think React is saying,
maybe in React 19,

87
00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:32.640
that it's gonna support Web Components.

88
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.686
And I think it's a slightly different
syntax on how you use props,

89
00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:41.841
but I think if you have to support it,
you totally can.

90
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:49.388
And I've heard it's pretty good,
so people who have tried it out.

91
00:05:49.388 --> 00:05:57.610
And then there's one other
thing I could point you to,

92
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.165
lit.dev has a labs section, okay?

93
00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:08.767
And they have a wrapper for React.

94
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:13.210
So you basically just
import your React element,

95
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.913
put it in this createComponent wrapper,

96
00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:21.790
instead of just returning JSX or
whatever you do.

97
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.380
And then you maybe have to supply,
here's what the custom element is.

98
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.674
Here's this and here's the initial state.

99
00:06:27.674 --> 00:06:31.660
It's a little more involved than
just the custom element defined.

100
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.836
But yeah, so there's this wrapper.

101
00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:37.686
So if you have a system
in React right now, and

102
00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:41.812
you wanted to move to Lit, or
just offer a Web Component version,

103
00:06:41.812 --> 00:06:46.404
you might be able to consume your
existing React components using this.

104
00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:50.944
You just make a, I don't know,
a sidecar to your React system,

105
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.480
[LAUGH] that offers Web Components.

106
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.710
So might be an option,
something you could build out.

107
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.900
Your mileage may vary, if you're
doing wild stuff, it might not work.

108
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.670
But in theory,
the React API is very strict.

109
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.850
It's just a few things.

110
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.620
So hopefully it should work.

111
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.876
So yeah, so that's kind of it.

112
00:07:13.876 --> 00:07:18.036
So maybe React 19 is kind of the TLDR, so.

113
00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:20.627
&gt;&gt; We kind of touched on
browser compatibility.

114
00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:24.507
Have you noticed any differences between
desktop and mobile browsers support?

115
00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:30.400
&gt;&gt; The big thing is probably Chrome on
Android is always gonna have the latest,

116
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.329
greatest.

117
00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:36.389
So I think the limitation would
probably be, again, mobile Safari,

118
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.420
particularly in the US where mobile Safari
is a lot higher than the global average.

119
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.537
So if there's a feature you're
depending on, it just, no, we know.

120
00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:54.551
But you'll see kinda through
the next section there's a lot

121
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:59.305
of progressive enhancement,
to bring back an old idea.

122
00:07:59.305 --> 00:08:02.711
[LAUGH] There's a lot of
progressive enhancement

123
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:07.373
possibilities with web components,
and it may not be a huge deal.

124
00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:12.715
So that's kind of maybe you
can dodge a few bullets,

125
00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:17.826
if for some reason,
a browser doesn't support.

126
00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:21.276
But there's, I think,
yeah, mobile Safari and

127
00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:26.220
then on Samsung Galaxy, I think,
also locks their version of Chrome.

128
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.190
The Samsung browser is
locked a few versions back.

129
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.839
So you may, if you hear something's out,
and then all of a sudden,

130
00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.830
it doesn't work in Samsung phones.

131
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.370
That's kind of why so.

132
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.663
&gt;&gt; One person's asking if Web Components
increase the file size significantly, but

133
00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.974
you kind of talked about that being
the entire point is that it's

134
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.920
built in the browser instead
of [INAUDIBLE] overhead?

135
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna reduce
your file size quite a bit.

136
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.784
And I'll talk later, but

137
00:08:54.784 --> 00:09:00.040
where React is a 30 kilobyte, just React.

138
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.124
React with React Dom,
which kinda need for,

139
00:09:03.124 --> 00:09:07.080
[LAUGH] it ends up being
about 100 kilobytes.

140
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.830
Lit is, I think, 7 kilobytes.

141
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.060
And it offers a very similar API.

142
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.079
So you may just shave off
90% of your wait times,

143
00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:24.880
load times, just by switching,
potentially.

144
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.444
I will also throw a caveat out there that,

145
00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:31.564
you can write bad code in
any language you want, so.

146
00:09:31.564 --> 00:09:37.634
[LAUGH] So people can write bad code and
it can take a lot longer.

147
00:09:37.634 --> 00:09:41.119
But, yeah,
we'll kind of explore different ways.

148
00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:44.321
But it's not just file size
there's other reasons you might

149
00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:46.850
actually want to use React,
and so, but yeah.
