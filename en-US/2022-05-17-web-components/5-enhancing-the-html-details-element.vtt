Another one came from Zach Leatherman
who works on 11ty, details-utils.

2
00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:12.885
If you've ever used details element,
who's used the details element?

3
00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:13.628
It's relatively new.

4
00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:16.940
Okay, yeah, so
if you've ever used details element,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.110
it's maybe the coolest new
interactive element in HTML.

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.226
It's like a free drop-down disclosure.

7
00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:28.228
You could do it on a forum like you
want to get birthday reminders,

8
00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.740
and you click it and you drop down,
show them the birthday form or whatever.

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.568
It's very cool.

10
00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:39.221
But there's a few problems, or
just it lacks some features, or

11
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:44.210
maybe it's more apt to say I
want to use this everywhere.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.220
I wanna use this in
navigations drop-down menus.

13
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.084
I wanna use it everywhere,
but there's a few features.

14
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:56.917
Adrian Roselli, yeah,
this post sort of shook my brain,

15
00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:01.690
but Adrian Roselli is
a accessibility expert.

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.425
And he had this post called
Details/Summary Are Not [insert

17
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:07.797
control here].

18
00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:12.541
And in the post, he says,
they are not an accordion.

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.992
And I was like, wait, what?

20
00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:17.740
[LAUGH] Why is it not an accordion?

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.572
And I wrote a whole blog post on that.

22
00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:21.052
It's not a tab set.

23
00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:23.547
And I'm like, well, I may not guess it.

24
00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:25.009
It's not menu navigation.

25
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.515
Wait a minute, what?

26
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:27.878
And he goes on.

27
00:01:27.878 --> 00:01:33.994
He kinda points out, hey, it's kinda just
a bad pattern just from accessibility.

28
00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:39.430
But purely, they lack the ability
to hit Esc on close, right?

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.432
So if you have a details element and
I hit Esc, nothing happens.

30
00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:49.103
But if we go to our details-utils,

31
00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:54.563
I can wrap it in the details-utils here.

32
00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:59.061
And then I can add some behaviors
like close to click outside, right?

33
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.055
So if I click outside,
I have to get my browser real big.

34
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.223
Let me go embiggen this again.

35
00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:09.767
So if I do this and I click outside,
do I have to go bigger?

36
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:14.465
No, let's zoom out, there,
I'm bigger, I'm big enough.

37
00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.372
[LAUGH] I finally made it.

38
00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:22.598
So you can close to click
outside if it's over 48.

39
00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:28.047
And then another feature has close on Esc.

40
00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:33.499
So if I open my demo and
I hit Esc, it closes.

41
00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.843
Tada, I now, according to Adrian's post,

42
00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:43.270
am safe to use it as a dropdown menu in my
main navigation or something like that.

43
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.820
That's pretty cool.

44
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.440
Zero lines of JavaScript for me.

45
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.135
Zach wrote some, but
it's probably very minimal JavaScript.

46
00:02:52.135 --> 00:02:56.876
Animation, I don't know if you've ever
tried to animate the details element, but

47
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.679
it's not fun cuz you have
to measure the height and

48
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.441
then do an animation between a known
height and an unknown height.

49
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:07.611
The default details kinda looks like,
all right, let's see if I can save this.

50
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:12.125
And the default details kinda
looks like this, on, off, on, off.

51
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:15.075
Not very cool,
doesn't pass to your designer sensibility.

52
00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:18.742
So you put animate on there,
and guess what?

53
00:03:18.742 --> 00:03:23.665
Now, we are cool, and
our boss will give us a raise

54
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:28.602
because we are wowing with surprise and
delight.

55
00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:33.920
All by just wrapping a details element in
sort of the utility element outside of it.
