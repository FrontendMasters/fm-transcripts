WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.393
We have a question?

2
00:00:01.393 --> 00:00:04.708
&gt;&gt; If the button has a specific
class name and we define styles for

3
00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:08.749
the class outside of the web component,
those styles still don't apply.

4
00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:15.083
&gt;&gt; Excellent segue into
[SOUND] my next slide.

5
00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.161
Okay, so
we couldn't start deep style, right?

6
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:19.750
So what about classes?

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.930
That's the next thing, right, classes.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.708
Classes work everywhere, right?

9
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:29.668
That's what I thought [LAUGH] until this.

10
00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:36.003
So pink is background, so in
the Shadow DOM, this is background pink.

11
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.334
Classes should work, right?

12
00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:44.858
If it does not work, Frustrating,
right, because, again,

13
00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:50.633
breaks the expectation, I wrote pink up
top, it should work down in the component.

14
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.552
To be honest,
this may have massive implications for

15
00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:58.656
utility class sites like tailwind and
stuff like that.

16
00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:04.494
But there is a way, there's actually
a few ways, there's old ways and

17
00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:08.596
modern ways to get those styles,
those classes.

18
00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:15.320
But basically cuz it's the same rule,
I didn't author it so I don't control it.

19
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.948
And you could also think
of this as class collision.

20
00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:23.882
If I'm using Google's
material web button and

21
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:29.555
I style whatever material
web button from the parent,

22
00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:33.273
Google doesn't want it to change.

23
00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:37.030
They want it to still look like
material web button or whatever.

24
00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:43.056
Okay, but there is a way if you're
authoring, you can trick it.

25
00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:45.043
Do you want to learn that way?

26
00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:50.445
It's fun to learn, but
it'll make you feel gross.

27
00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:55.589
So link rel="stylesheet", okay?

28
00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:59.975
And then src, and then we're
actually just gonna you link that,

29
00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:01.826
this is a CodePen feature.

30
00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:06.700
But you can go to any CodePen and
type the extension off the end of it.

31
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.640
And it'll like,
I'll just give you the CSS part.

32
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.108
So we're going to basically double
link the style sheet, right?

33
00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:17.213
We're linking to a style sheet
from within the component.

34
00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:21.222
And, let's see here,
hold on, now save it and

35
00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:27.550
refresh it cuz that was working this
morning, let me see what's going on.

36
00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.754
Link rel ="stylesheet", correct?

37
00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:39.665
You all should have caught that,
come on Frontend Masters.

38
00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:43.648
[SOUND] So, all right, so

39
00:02:43.648 --> 00:02:51.247
you can inject style sheets
by the old link tag.

40
00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:55.743
Yeah, it doesn't feel great, [LAUGH] but
this would be a way to do it.

41
00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.671
There's actually more
modern ways to do it.

42
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:01.100
But that starts getting into the,

43
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.145
Not supported in everything realm and
so I'd be happy to talk about it.

44
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:10.610
But there's a feature
called adoptedStyleSheets.

45
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.740
And it's very cool, I'm very excited
about it, but it's not ubiquitous,

46
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.430
I don't think quite yet.

47
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.394
Yes, another question?

48
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.405
&gt;&gt; Can we add the part
attribute on the element and

49
00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:25.704
target it from the outside
using a pseudo selector part?

50
00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:31.648
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we totally can and
that's jumping ahead like two slides.

51
00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:34.094
So I'll get there in two slides,
is that okay?

52
00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:40.849
But we can totally use part to grab stuff.

53
00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.914
Okay, so
global classes we learned doesn't really

54
00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:50.304
work unless we go the weird way [LAUGH],
yeah?

55
00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:54.042
&gt;&gt; On the kind of same track,
if the mode is open and so

56
00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:57.796
that the component is
accessible by JavaScript.

57
00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:00.442
Is it possible and
probably not recommended but

58
00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:03.751
to set attributes via JavaScript
just like imperatively,

59
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:08.290
is that something that works as well or
does the Shadow DOM protect against?

60
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.086
&gt;&gt; You can, yeah,
if it has a shadow root you can append

61
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:17.015
a style block inside the element as well.

62
00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:21.104
So there are ways,
it's just nothing's cool,

63
00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:24.907
[LAUGH] until you get
to adoptedStyleSheets.

64
00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:29.840
And, again, if you're using stuff off
the shelf, you maybe don't control that.

65
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.855
If it's closed,
you can't get in but if it's open,

66
00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:37.080
you might be able to get in and
futz with it.

67
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.090
So that's just an example.

68
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.240
So I guess I could show that but
that's maybe a deep dive but, yeah.

69
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.595
One thing that does kind of work is
this idea of inheritable styles.

70
00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:58.485
And I didn't know what these were,
I had to look it up on MDN.

71
00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:04.023
Quite literally, it's anything that
can have the value inherit in CSS.

72
00:05:04.023 --> 00:05:09.296
But you might think of it as something
that might cascade down into an iframe.

73
00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:14.022
If you set the color or the font size or

74
00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:20.133
something or the, I guess,
what font family.

75
00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:23.036
Yeah, if you sent colors and fonts and

76
00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:28.676
stuff you would sorta expect an iframe
to have some of the same behaviors.

77
00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:36.960
It's a loose thing, but I think it's
sort of, these styles can go everywhere.

78
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.830
It's sort of a, these are blessed
solutions, blessed styles.

79
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.235
But I think you'd want it for
any sort of importing or frames,

80
00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:47.132
probably this is old
technology related to frames.

81
00:05:47.132 --> 00:05:48.997
So we have some like Light DOM texts and

82
00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:52.508
a Light DOM button with our button
duplicator duplicates the buttons.

83
00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:55.257
And then we have font
family have fantasy and

84
00:05:55.257 --> 00:05:57.796
we're trying to get the button to do it.

85
00:05:57.796 --> 00:06:05.402
But I'll explain that, so it's just
going to duplicate it right and then.

86
00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:10.778
So you'll notice the Light DOM
button actually obeys the font but

87
00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.426
the Shadow DOM button does not.

88
00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:17.904
This is another weird bit,
more specifically maybe with buttons and

89
00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:22.766
replaced elements and how they it's
like the system UIs Lbuttons show up in

90
00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.097
the Shadow DOM and stuff like that.

91
00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:26.980
So you don't have as much control.

92
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.882
But I would have expected
that to sort of work but

93
00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:33.305
it does not in the Shadow realm,
and so that's too bad.

94
00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:36.096
[LAUGH] Frustrating to say the least.

95
00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:42.788
But like it's good to know at least some
things kind of cascade down through.

96
00:06:42.788 --> 00:06:46.622
So this does work but this can be, again,

97
00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:50.457
if positive or negative, you're like,

98
00:06:50.457 --> 00:06:55.622
why is the text read on my inputs,
I don't understand.

99
00:06:55.622 --> 00:06:58.140
Well, it's cuz something bled into it.

100
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.460
So as good as our egg solution is,
some stuff still goes through.
