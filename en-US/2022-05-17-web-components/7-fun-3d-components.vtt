1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.275
Maybe you want to go a bit older, right?

2
00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:04.238
You don't want this new stuff,
you want the old stuff.

3
00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:09.710
Well, my friend Alex has you covered,
Alex has this thing called

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.483
geo elements which is reimplementing
deprecated web 1.0 tags and

5
00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:20.477
[LAUGH] custom elements,
the blink tag and the marquee tag.

6
00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:23.078
But he's doing it in
like an accessible way,

7
00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:26.850
which is these things didn't
have the greatest accessibility.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.650
But if you want to prefers reduce motion,
if you want to reduce them.

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.111
Better, right, now we're not getting
motion sick I probably should have given

10
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:39.430
a warning before that.

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.270
But, yeah, so you can turn off the blink
tag, if you prefer reduced motion.

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.050
It's hideous, Alex makes terrible things,

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.120
but, Your mileage may vary.

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.557
It's all in a G background.

15
00:00:56.557 --> 00:01:03.618
[LAUGH] The old BG tag or where you
could like BG color and stuff like that.

16
00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:07.868
And we have a font tag, and
we have a marquee tag, and a blink tag.

17
00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.940
It does everything you want,
from a Geo City's aesthetic.

18
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.342
So if you're building
geo city sites still,

19
00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:19.050
Alex has you covered.

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.330
Ugh, none of these work in the metaverse,
I know.

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.407
We've been doing two dimensional websites.

22
00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.360
How boring?

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.870
Let's go into the far future,
we saw the past.

24
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.979
A frame is a library from I guess
the old Mozilla Firefox reality team,

25
00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.189
did a lot of work on this Chrome team,

26
00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.493
like the Chrome Daydream VR team
did a bunch of work on it too.

27
00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:53.674
But you're able to build 3D scenes

28
00:01:53.674 --> 00:01:58.120
in the web browser Kind of cool.

29
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.690
I'm just using my WASD keys to walk
around my 3D world I invented here.

30
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.510
And the API is pretty cool.

31
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.500
Let's begin this because we can.

32
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.319
We want HTML, so
you know CSS, no JavaScript.

33
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.978
No CSS, no JAVA, we just have HTML.

34
00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:21.960
And the API is pretty cool.

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.820
We have a script tag, we go to a frame,
and we create a-scene, right?

36
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.941
And inside a-scene is a-sphere, this guy,

37
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:39.768
it has a position in 3D space X,
Y, and Z that's confusing,

38
00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:45.283
but it has a radius of
1.25 meters basically,

39
00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:48.856
because in VR the Size matters.

40
00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.113
[LAUGH] I guess you can't
say it's 18 pixels,

41
00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:56.770
you reference things in use or
meters and we give it a color, right?

42
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.643
And then there's also a box which
has position has a bit of a rotation

43
00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:06.772
with height and depth, and how we
have a cylinder, and we have a plane,

44
00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:11.930
not an aeroplane but a two dimensional
surface, a plane on the bottom.

45
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.985
And then we have a sky,
which is just a giant sphere,

46
00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:21.986
I think it's 90 meters or more?

47
00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:26.450
It's a giant sky, a giant sphere
that's colored on the inside.

48
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.800
So, and a scene gives us the camera and
everything like that.

49
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.432
And we can kinda even control the camera
height if you're not one point,

50
00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:38.770
I think the default is 1.6 meters tall.

51
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.517
So if you're not 1.6 meters, I know
every American here is just paralyzed

52
00:03:43.517 --> 00:03:47.825
with not understanding [LAUGH] meters,
but if you're not in America,

53
00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.960
you'll understand it just fine.

54
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.080
But the neat thing is,
I'm gonna click this VR.

55
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.849
And if I was in a VR headset warm,

56
00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.373
I'm in the metaverse like
I entered the metaverse.

57
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:05.319
But here because my computer in this
PowerPoint does not support VR,

58
00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.583
we just get a full screen 3D
scene that we can walk around and

59
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:14.552
see kind of we can even go in the sphere,
that's weird but clipping.

60
00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:18.769
So that's it,
that's a kind of an interesting thing,

61
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.730
you can kind of build 3D experiences,

62
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.495
I Dave Rupert do not know how to code
WebGL, I do not even know how 3JS works.

63
00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:33.026
This it gives me a declarative API
to use 3JS without any of the,

64
00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:37.850
I guess, troubles or worries and
so I can build things.

65
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.160
I've built tons of things,
this is kind of my list of shame here.

66
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.104
Well, there's my [LAUGH] there's
my profile, wasn't expecting that.

67
00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:50.067
We'll go to collections, and
then I think I have yeah,

68
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.190
I was trying this like 30 days of Web VR.

69
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.510
And I was like,
could I just be on Mars and

70
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.711
yeah I could I took this
like 3D photo from a rover,

71
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:05.381
it doesn't look good but it looks
pretty good on a Google Cardboard,

72
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.376
is all right,
I was I made these guys talk.

73
00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.610
This is probably my favorite one.

74
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.307
This one is a whale that you can talk to.

75
00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.140
It's like a little life coach.

76
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.169
I just thought that would be
cool to wake up every morning,

77
00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.332
talk to my whale friend and
he dispenses agile advice to me.

78
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.046
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just beautiful,

79
00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:39.720
blends with the speech synthesis API.

80
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.540
Just amazing.

81
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.400
Really what's possible.

82
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.840
[LAUGH] I can't make cool things,
but you can and

83
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.892
I think I'm really excited for
what you're able to do.

84
00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:55.164
Building your own 3D worlds in
the metaverse so all right and

85
00:05:55.164 --> 00:05:58.261
then if you use it too
much the API expires and

86
00:05:58.261 --> 00:06:04.150
it starts reading out like cores errors,
so [LAUGH] it's great, the future is now.
