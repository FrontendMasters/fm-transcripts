00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.293
I hope everyone had fun
making your flagship maiden

2
00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:09.440
voyage building web components.

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.589
I hope is great, I hope somebody has some,

4
00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.230
if anyone has cool ones you
want to share in the chat.

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.100
But I can walk you through what I did,
because I used one I'd never used before.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.610
So if that sounds good to y'all,
I'll just do that real quick and

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.956
kind of no we can talk people in
the room maybe here saw it but

8
00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:34.070
I can talk about some of the challenges
I had figuring out what's going on.

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.298
But ,where's my awesome standalones,
right?

10
00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:43.838
So, I went to my own repo and
I found an old pull request for

11
00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:47.540
scroll shadow and that sounded cool.

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.150
So I clicked it.

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.362
And what scroll shadow is this
when you scroll up something and

14
00:00:54.362 --> 00:00:59.141
you want to show a shadow, or
you scroll down, you want to show a shadow

15
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:04.150
on the button and be like, hey,
this one keeps going down below.

16
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.335
I think people use it a lot in
nav overflow patterns, hey,

17
00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:10.460
there's something to the right here,
keep scrolling.

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130
So it is a tool that
kind of adds that effect.

19
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.460
And there's a cool demo here, and
their demo is arguably better than mine.

20
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.239
But you can maybe see a little
shadow peeking through here.

21
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.290
Little shadow peeking through here.

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.046
And then when you scroll
a little shadow shows up here.

23
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:35.940
It's probably too subtle.

24
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.219
So I kind of made it a little bit bigger.

25
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.290
Yeah, look at that.

26
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.660
It'd be purple shadow down here.

27
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.644
Beautiful ambiance that I'm creating and
then it's up the top and

28
00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:50.710
then it disappears at the bottom.

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.934
I'll tell you what, this is cool and

30
00:01:54.934 --> 00:02:01.450
I'll maybe use it [LAUGH]
I don't want to code this.

31
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.590
To be frank,
I know it's probably maybe trivial, but

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.620
you have some resize observing,
you have some scroll

33
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.310
observing, you kind of fade in and
out that shadow.

34
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.760
I don't want to do that.

35
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.025
So I'm just probably going to use this if
I ever need that to create that effect

36
00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:22.930
here in the future and

37
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.570
I'm actually like thinking about 10
places I could use it right now.

38
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.659
So looking at this,
I had to use the unpackage URL.

39
00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.295
It was not working with the sky pack
thing trick I told you and that's,

40
00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.999
okay, I think there was just
like a compilation error.

41
00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:46.374
And I eventually check the console
to make sure I wasn't me but

42
00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:52.027
it was the sky pack, was failing, so but
the unpackage seems to work just fine.

43
00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:54.840
And then I have scroll shadow, and

44
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.700
then they were using kind of
a main element to do the sizing.

45
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.920
I had to figure that out,
kind of poach from the demo.

46
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.700
And then I added my own Bill Murray's.

47
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.130
And then in the CSS land, I added some
image max width and then the body,

48
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.014
that's just centering, I guess I could
probably just do like place items center.

49
00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:23.760
But, yeah, so, and then it has a max
height on that it says height 100v.

50
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.160
So everything inside there
is not going to bleed out.

51
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.050
But then the demo is only 70vh.

52
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.080
So it's only 70% of the height.

53
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.120
And it's like 400 pics wide and
then this was kind of interesting.

54
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.190
So this was the scroll shadow.

55
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400
I probably that's like the default sizing.

56
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.520
So changing that's not
going to do anything.

57
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.680
But what I get here is some of that
styling API we kind of hinted at.

58
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.880
And I can just change the CSS variables.

59
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.750
The size of it, I could change it to 200.

60
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.284
I think I changed it from
14 to whatever this is.

61
00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:10.060
Is it going to rebuild for me?

62
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.970
I think it's probably way too huge now.

63
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.330
Yes, way humongous.

64
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.360
That's okay.

65
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.770
We like the ambiance.

66
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.327
But yeah, so,
you can change all the variables and

67
00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:23.485
change the color from like
a black to more like purply vibe.

68
00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:28.303
So, that was fun it was really,
I did it in less than ten minutes and

69
00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:33.812
I got an effect that will last a lifetime
because am probably going to use this

70
00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:39.860
over and over, and over, and now that I
know how to do it with zero lines of code.

71
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.005
So all right did anyone else do and
they want to share or?

72
00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:48.188
&gt;&gt; I was pretty pleased it's
literally just an index.html but

73
00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.080
as not a Microsoft fanboy.

74
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.070
I went to the Red Hat one and grabbed
the one of their little health indicators.

75
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.102
And I wasn't sure whether you could
just run like set attribute on one

76
00:04:57.102 --> 00:04:58.678
of the various custom attributes.

77
00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:02.382
But it turns out you can so
I just have a little health index and

78
00:05:02.382 --> 00:05:06.669
I just set up an interval to rotate
between which one is highlighted and

79
00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.540
you can do that, so
&gt;&gt; Cool so you're setting the value or

80
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.483
you're changing the graph or whatever.

81
00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:15.428
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Based on a set interval.

82
00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:18.195
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
It was like two minutes of looking at

83
00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:22.742
the library like pulling it down
from I think unpackaged they had.

84
00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:24.319
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where you go.

85
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.285
&gt;&gt; Awesome pattern Fi is a really
pretty good little set of components.

86
00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:35.012
So, it's enterprise
grade vibes [LAUGH] It's

87
00:05:35.012 --> 00:05:39.678
good all of them are like enterprise
&gt;&gt; I

88
00:05:39.678 --> 00:05:43.837
was going to point out one thing that
somebody had mentioned in the chat.

89
00:05:43.837 --> 00:05:48.675
And it was actually an issue I ran into
with the previous exercise of building

90
00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:51.030
just using a web component, right?

91
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.914
So when I first tried it,
I had the type equals module missing and

92
00:05:57.914 --> 00:06:03.103
nothing was happening, and
I was just frustrated I was feeling like

93
00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:08.220
I didn't actually know web development and
that's always true.

94
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.149
That's a standard, but
I'd forgotten this one attribute and

95
00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:20.400
that sort of caused the JavaScript because
it's expecting a type equals module.

96
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.210
It's expecting that module behavior.

97
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.138
So, because the JavaScript exports
to module is expecting my script tag

98
00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:30.160
to also have the type equals module.

99
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.048
Somebody else in the chat ran into
that problem and I think they said,

100
00:06:34.048 --> 00:06:38.606
once they figured that out it worked like
a charm and that's what we like to hear,

101
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.570
web components work like a charm.
