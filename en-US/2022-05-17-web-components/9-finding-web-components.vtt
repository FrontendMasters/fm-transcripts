WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:03.729
We'll go into Finding Web Components,
right?

2
00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.274
So this is, I think, like,

3
00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:12.767
I don't know if this is
unique to web components,

4
00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:17.003
but I think in any framework or
any anything,

5
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:23.709
like sourcing quality goods,
quality packages it can be a challenge.

6
00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:31.551
For me, I try to find what
the cool kids are using in,

7
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.190
I don't know, in web components.

8
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.495
What are the cool kids that
Salesforce using is probably

9
00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:43.078
different than what I
want to use personally.

10
00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:47.509
No sleight to the the great devs
working on lightning web components.

11
00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:52.437
So, I think there's just sort of
a difference between maybe what,

12
00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:55.635
there's not really a big Zeitgeist about,

13
00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:59.882
hey use this this components
cool use this hey to use this.

14
00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:04.400
So I've actually kinda taken on,
that's what I'm frustrated about.

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.124
So I've taken it on myself to
kinda collect some of these.

16
00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.163
So I have a GitHub repo
called Awesome Standalones.

17
00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:15.679
And Standalones is a term I made up,
no one else says it.

18
00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.612
But it's basically these components sort
of like two app that you can just yank

19
00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:24.573
off the shelf and use without any
build tools without any of it,

20
00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:28.559
it has a unpackaged link and
some HTML, then you can get going.

21
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:33.300
And I can dig through some of these,
how many times have you needed to just

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.821
a button that copy something
to a clipboard, right?

23
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.981
You want to just copy that and
copied done.

24
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.830
Awesome, I don't wanna code that,
that's great, clipboard APIs fine,

25
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.874
but this one's cool,
this one is from Google.

26
00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.616
It's called input-knob,

27
00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:56.649
it's actually in use in your dev tools,
I believe.

28
00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.678
If you want to change the hue,
you get a little rotating icon,

29
00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.599
but look what we're dealing with.

30
00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.881
Whoa, that's cool,

31
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:12.729
very manual way to move a slider.

32
00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.482
And you should probably provide
accessible fallback but or

33
00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:19.266
maybe it, yeah, just go straight to it.

34
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:24.736
But wouldn't it be cool if you could arrow
that slider, but this is kinda cool.

35
00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:27.577
I don't know if you make
little synthesizers online or

36
00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:28.758
something like that.

37
00:02:28.758 --> 00:02:33.446
And you want to turn up the money
bar on your website or something,

38
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:34.976
that's-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

39
00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.444
&gt;&gt; Yeah, money up, just turn money up.

40
00:02:37.444 --> 00:02:41.556
Just [LAUGH] tell your boss to
keep spinning that until money.

41
00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:45.995
[LAUGH] Boy, like YouTube,

42
00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:49.730
it just keeps getting better.

43
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.570
I don't know if you know, but the YouTube

44
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.688
embed as much as Google loves performance,

45
00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:05.099
the YouTube embed is not great,
it does this.

46
00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.386
That's a flame chart, it basically
calls a bunch of JavaScript a lot.

47
00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:18.146
So Paul Irish who works at Chrome
made this light YouTube embed,

48
00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:23.029
which gives you a YouTube
looking embed with,

49
00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:29.304
I don't know, I guess that time
is more than the other one.

50
00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:33.687
But it loads in two milliseconds or
something.

51
00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:38.998
It made a drastic, like this is it that's
it, it looks like the YouTube, and

52
00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:44.172
then when you click that it'll go
fetch the YouTube, the actual YouTube.

53
00:03:44.172 --> 00:03:49.657
But that live YouTube we rolled
it out on ShopTalkshow.com,

54
00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:55.571
on our video page we've been doing videos,
we rolled it out here.

55
00:03:55.571 --> 00:04:00.767
Our page speed went from like 18 to 90 or
something like that.

56
00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:04.469
I watched it, Chris was like,
I was running like performance metrics,

57
00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.757
just because I'm dumb.

58
00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:12.796
And Chris Coyer pushed out the change and
I was like, I have like a run right here.

59
00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:18.016
I can go compare, popped it up
like instant boost, literally in,

60
00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:23.625
I don't know, zero lines of code,
because we already had the iframe.

61
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:29.340
He just changed it from iframe
source to YouTube Lite or

62
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.682
whether Lite YouTube in
zero lines of code change,

63
00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:39.171
and drastically improved our page speed.

64
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:45.233
Web components, back to the question about
performance, sometimes free performance.

65
00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:52.390
[LAUGH] Here's one I really like,
model viewer it's from Google.

66
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.855
And you may be actually encountered this
like on, you search for dinosaurs or

67
00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:00.441
something like that,
have you ever done this with your kids?

68
00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:05.231
Search for dinosaurs, and then you'll
get like a 3D model of a dinosaur.

69
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:10.066
And then there's a little AR button, and
you can put the dinosaur in the room or

70
00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.641
tiger, Tyrannosaurus Rex or whatever.

71
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:14.989
And you can put the tiger in the room and

72
00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:19.112
then your kids can kinda interact
with it and see how big a Tiger is.

73
00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:23.853
I didn't think I'd ever use this [LAUGH]
feature, but then lo and behold, one day,

74
00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:26.658
my six year old's asking me,
how big is a tiger?

75
00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:30.543
And I just was, well,
I know how to show you.

76
00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:33.583
So this is a model viewer and
the syntax is this,

77
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.692
sorry about this contrast here,
but the syntax is pretty easy.

78
00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:41.597
You have an Alt attribute,
just like an image.

79
00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:46.699
You have a source attribute,
just like an image.

80
00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.133
Except it points to a 3D model GLB, GLTF.

81
00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:56.836
There's a few different types of
models that supports in a 3D model is

82
00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:58.922
really just a folder of files.

83
00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:04.104
There's the wire mesh, and
then PNG assets that go over it.

84
00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:07.031
And this one's maybe from NASA.

85
00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:11.101
It's like the actual render
of Neil Armstrong suit.

86
00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:17.016
And then AR mode, WebEx RC, these are all
very specific environment image poster so

87
00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:22.289
when it loaded it showed something but
it didn't just show a blank screen.

88
00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.215
Camera controls, enable pan, that's what
I'm doing here, I'm moving it around.

89
00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:31.901
Yeah so what I like about this is again,

90
00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:36.161
I do not know how to code 3D stuff but

91
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:40.858
with Web Components, I look like I do.

92
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:45.619
And I can build that IKEA
furniture thing where you put IKEA

93
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.517
furniture in your house
using Web Components.

94
00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:51.519
I didn't have to go to
Computer Science School.

95
00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:56.457
It's great, so there may be your
mileage may vary, it may get trickier.

96
00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:59.845
Pinch Zoom, here's another one,
Chrome Labs.

97
00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:04.096
I'll let you kinda click through more
after this unless I see one more.

98
00:07:04.096 --> 00:07:08.956
But Pinch Zoom man, you ever wanted
to just add pinch zoom to a website,

99
00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:14.141
not the funniest thing because the whole
like browser tries [LAUGH] the zoom,

100
00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:19.673
and then you get locked into the image,
and then it's just not fun, pinch zoom.

101
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:23.159
And you might say, man, Pinch Zoom in 2up.

102
00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.619
Those seem similar and
they're both from Chrome, right?

103
00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:29.467
Have you ever used Squoosh app?

104
00:07:29.467 --> 00:07:35.041
Squoosh app is a pretty cool
like a way to image process and

105
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:38.874
it's using kind of the wasum stuff to,

106
00:07:38.874 --> 00:07:44.931
you can minify your images,
browser PNG, you can resize it.

107
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:49.097
I use this all the time cuz I
don't like using Photoshop but

108
00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:51.572
you can even get a Web P out of here.

109
00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:52.821
AVIF is the new one and

110
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.438
it has like the smallest file
size you see the file size there.

111
00:07:56.438 --> 00:08:03.983
But Pinch Zoom 2up, View Source, elements,

112
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:08.788
let's go dig, we're digging.

113
00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:12.891
File drop, uh-oh,
a way to just drop a file on a page,

114
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.046
that looks like we use that.

115
00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:17.036
Snack bar, that sounds delicious.

116
00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:22.650
But let's just get 2up, Pinch Zoom.

117
00:08:24.574 --> 00:08:26.357
Pretty cool?

118
00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:32.088
You start to see how, this is just HTML,
we're just stapling components together,

119
00:08:32.088 --> 00:08:37.741
nesting and layering them and we're like
adding these behaviors to build this image

120
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:43.261
minification app that then connects to
image minification binaries on the side.

121
00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:45.798
I'm not going to say it's easy, I mean,

122
00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:48.781
these are like Google
[LAUGH] people making this.

123
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:52.047
So it's very advanced, but pretty cool.

124
00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:54.424
And then there's like tabs, task list.

125
00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:58.286
I'll do this one, this is from GitHub,
you've heard of GitHub.

126
00:08:58.286 --> 00:09:01.208
You know how they have
like a little task list?

127
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:04.190
Yeah, that's like literally this.

128
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.832
So you can just do tasks and
slide them around.

129
00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:11.385
So web component,
GitHub uses a lot of web components here.

130
00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:16.290
Same kinda all over the place, a dark mode
toggle, K text display who likes math.

131
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.074
If you like math, [LAUGH] that's your one.

132
00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:26.662
HTML includes, wow, a way to bring
the most ultimate feature back to the web.

133
00:09:26.662 --> 00:09:30.204
It's like a PHP include, but with HTML.

134
00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:33.579
Awesome, I love it, pwa-install,

135
00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:38.013
I promised myself I
wouldn't go overboard here.

136
00:09:38.013 --> 00:09:42.975
If you have a PWA I don't know if
anyone has anyone here have a PWA.

137
00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:46.796
No, okay, well, another course then,
we'll do another course.

138
00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:51.783
[LAUGH] PWA are a great way to
like basically add a native ffill

139
00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:56.073
to your website,
it's two pieces of technology,

140
00:09:56.073 --> 00:10:01.087
a Service Worker,
which is basically a way to manage cash.

141
00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:04.476
You just say, hey, browser,
I'm gonna store some stuff,

142
00:10:04.476 --> 00:10:07.945
I'm gonna manage some cash on my own and
intercept requests.

143
00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:12.697
And then you have a manifest, which is
like all your app icons, stuff like that.

144
00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:16.451
Just use this icon for this,
or the short name is this.

145
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:18.773
When you launch it from
the homescreen do this.

146
00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:23.884
And what happens is in Chrome and
other browsers if you use a website

147
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:29.831
enough on mobile Chrome specifically,
instead of saying download our app.

148
00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:34.039
It'll say like, hey, you use this,
it has some heuristics and they'll say,

149
00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:37.562
you use this enough, would you like
to install it to your home screen?

150
00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:40.851
You click Yes, you get an icon on
the home screen and you launch it and

151
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:42.083
it launches like an app.

152
00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.187
It can even remove the browser Chrome.

153
00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:47.176
So yes, we have a question.

154
00:10:47.176 --> 00:10:51.501
&gt;&gt; We do have a course on
PWAs by Maximiliano Ferman.

155
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:54.055
&gt;&gt; Excellent first, yes,

156
00:10:54.055 --> 00:11:00.145
he's probably the guy you want
to talk to [LAUGH] about PWAs.

157
00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:05.255
So yeah, so anyway,
it's basically a native feel, and

158
00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:12.712
to the extent Microsoft for their store,
you can ship a PWA in the Microsoft Store.

159
00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:14.709
So if you're a small,

160
00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:20.069
scrappy young web team with not
a bunch of engineers to code,

161
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:25.025
your dedicated Windows app
PWA is a great tool for that.

162
00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:28.200
And so the people at Microsoft
who run PWA builder account.

163
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.002
They have this installed prompt, and you
can get this like it'll pop up on desktop

164
00:11:33.002 --> 00:11:35.519
when the four install prompt event fires.

165
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:38.974
You can intercept that and
get these this beautiful, no,

166
00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:42.450
app store like hey,
do you wanna install this application?

167
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.857
Kinda cool, again, your mileage may vary,
but I think you'd impress your bosses.

168
00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:51.554
So anyway, awesome standalones,
you can check it out, pretty cool.

169
00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:56.802
And then on the other end of the spectrum,
not the one-offs, there are whole

170
00:11:56.802 --> 00:12:02.725
design systems built with web components,
lightning web components by Salesforce.

171
00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:05.832
If you're building Salesforce apps and
stuff like the,

172
00:12:05.832 --> 00:12:08.494
integrations, you probably
come across this.

173
00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:13.513
Lion by ING bank,
sounds a little weird to use

174
00:12:13.513 --> 00:12:18.666
like banking software's design system, but

175
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:25.289
this is actually really coded
to be extended and modified.

176
00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:29.279
So it's a really good base if
you wanna kinda build your

177
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:33.106
own I guess banking grade
enterprise grade system.

178
00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.603
So you're gonna have a lot
of accessibility and

179
00:12:35.603 --> 00:12:40.172
stuff like that built in, just through the
requirements of banks and stuff like that.

180
00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:43.937
PatternFly elements from RedHat again,
very good, very robust.

181
00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:48.930
Fast is the new one from Microsoft,
it's kinda doing their FLUID UI.

182
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.890
Is that taken in FLUID UI and
web components?

183
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.857
Spectrum Web Components by
Adobe Spectrum is their design system.

184
00:12:55.857 --> 00:12:58.981
And web spectrum web components is
the web component version of that.

185
00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:04.889
I think this is what is kind of
powering the new Photoshop UI.

186
00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:11.759
Ionic Framework by Ionic,
it's a really great tool for

187
00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:15.712
prototyping or even shipping.

188
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:19.177
Mobile apps, you basically say,

189
00:13:19.177 --> 00:13:24.083
I want tabs bar, iOS tabs,
like I want a tab bar.

190
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:27.989
Great, it's gonna give you the mobile
tab bar with five icons, right there.

191
00:13:27.989 --> 00:13:33.918
Really awesome, I've used that in the past
for companies I can tell those stories.

192
00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:38.455
Shoelace's another one by Corey LaViska.

193
00:13:38.455 --> 00:13:42.864
What's interesting about this and this
is foreshadowing the JavaScript section.

194
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:48.488
Recently Cory, he started writing
this out in JavaScript and

195
00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:51.634
in his own, Vanilla JavaScript.

196
00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:56.027
And then you find an abstraction so you
kind of like pull some code out, reuse it

197
00:13:56.027 --> 00:14:00.441
and lo and behold after a while you kinda
have a little mini framework, right?

198
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:01.473
We've all done that.

199
00:14:01.473 --> 00:14:06.889
And he said, I looked at this mini
framework, and I've said I would get

200
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:12.415
more gains by switching over to lit
because lit has kind of done all this.

201
00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:13.780
And so lit is another, so

202
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.015
he converted that whole library of
components over to lit, spill on lit now.

203
00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:23.012
And he's seeing some gains just
from a usability standpoint.

204
00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:27.858
It's faster, smaller,
better, more robust code.

205
00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:33.440
So yeah, so that might be one reason
where frameworks are like a good choice.

206
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.960
But yeah, so built with what come on,
so you can browse these and

207
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.408
see if there's anything
is interesting there.

208
00:14:41.408 --> 00:14:46.140
The fast by Microsoft stuff,
maybe I'm a Microsoft fanboy, they have a,

209
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.795
it's very interesting just from like,
I didn't expect them to buy in but

210
00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.048
they bought into web components and

211
00:14:53.048 --> 00:14:56.980
they're kinda doing some cool
innovative stuff there, so.
