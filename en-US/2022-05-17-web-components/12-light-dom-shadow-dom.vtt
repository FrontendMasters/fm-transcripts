WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.103
So we've talked about HTML.

2
00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:05.948
Now, we're gonna get into CSS,
and if I'm honest,

3
00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:10.318
this is one of the most frustrating
parts of web components.

4
00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:15.426
So I like to get the bad stuff out of the
way first or early on, because I do think

5
00:00:15.426 --> 00:00:20.614
if you've I find out about this later
in your experience with web components,

6
00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:24.883
it can leave a sour taste,
where you feel like they're broken.

7
00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:29.101
But what it really is, and
I don't mean not to be condescending, but

8
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.710
what it really is, is it's new and
you did not know that, and that is fine.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.799
We are going to learn and
figure out what makes this different.

10
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.476
And what is different about this
is it involves something called

11
00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.388
piercing the Shadow DOM.

12
00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:51.482
And this is simultaneously the dumbest and
coolest phrase we have in web development.

13
00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:56.597
So we have to just roll with it,
[LAUGH] we have to embrace it.

14
00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:59.760
We're going to learn how
to pierce the Shadow DOM.

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.793
And if you remember kind of earlier,
we had that component, right?

16
00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:08.846
Our custom alert,
we put in some text or Light DOM,

17
00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:13.658
and then the web component,
the encapsulation creates that

18
00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:18.582
shadow boundary around
the components HTML that it injects.

19
00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:24.043
That boundary, it is a boundary,
things can go through and

20
00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:29.942
things cannot go through,
just like we wanna protect that egg,

21
00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:33.780
we want that egg to not leak out or
leak in.

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.150
So I'm gonna do the thing
where you just write styles,

23
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.652
you chuck styles at the wall and
see what sticks, okay?

24
00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:45.827
This is the tried and

25
00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:50.544
true development practice of just trying
stuff until it works or doesn't work.

26
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.876
So we're gonna start
styling from the outside.

27
00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:59.714
So we're outside the egg and we're gonna
try to style stuff inside the egg, okay?

28
00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:02.329
Let's just see what happens.

29
00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.611
tl;dr, if you didn't write it,
you can't style it, okay?

30
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:11.618
This is just the rule of thumb, if you
didn't write it, you can't stop style it.

31
00:02:11.618 --> 00:02:13.991
So styling Light DOM, right?

32
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:17.321
So can we style the Light DOM we wrote?

33
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:23.561
In here in my example element, I have
a button, and it is my Light DOM button,

34
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:29.225
and the example element is going to
inject a Shadow DOM button as well.

35
00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:33.620
So you'll see I'm saying all buttons,
background pink, please,

36
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.107
right, turn the button pink, and
that is our test to see if it worked.

37
00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:40.884
And then you can see here
this is a bunch of code,

38
00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:42.898
but this is our Shadow DOM button,

39
00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:47.221
and then our light DOM button should
show up in that slot above it, right?

40
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:51.550
And the result is, drumroll please,

41
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.347
sound effects team, thank you.

42
00:02:55.347 --> 00:02:59.451
And ta-da, so we can style the light DOM,

43
00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:04.812
that's our HTML, that's our CSS,
we can style that.

44
00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:08.910
I wrote it, I can style it,
fair enough, right?

45
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.177
But would we go about styling
that Shadow DOM button?

46
00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:17.471
I think it's if we wanna style
it from the outside, right?

47
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.769
So I think it's really,
the next intuitive thing my brain

48
00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.508
does as a CSS person is,
I just say I'll just be very specific.

49
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:33.360
I'm gonna say example-element,
button background, pink.

50
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.160
I'm laser focused, I'm going to
target that button-element inside

51
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.721
the Shadow DOM as best we can, right?

52
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.613
So buttons, background on pink.

53
00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:46.118
I should probably make that orange or
something, but whatever,

54
00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:50.404
we want to turn this example-element
button pink, right, same JavaScript.

55
00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:56.335
And the result is, [SOUND] It didn't work.

56
00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:02.013
That's because we didn't write it, right,
we didn't write the Shadow DOM button.

57
00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:06.653
This is confusing, and
actually that's the big

58
00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:10.623
frustrated graphic from earlier for me.

59
00:04:10.623 --> 00:04:18.245
I am not used to this, as a CSS person,
I'm used to full control, right?

60
00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.571
I can style anything on the page
with the right selector.

61
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:25.856
I can laser focus and change and
manipulate anything I want,

62
00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.963
the style of anything I want.

63
00:04:27.963 --> 00:04:31.715
I should have that ability,
but suddenly I don't.

64
00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.920
So it's almost like an emotional problem.

65
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.910
It feels like a loss of control, like no,
I was in control of the page and

66
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.887
now I'm not.

67
00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:44.343
This is broken, the problem is this thing,
the problem is not me.

68
00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:46.341
It's the kids that are wrong, it's not me.

69
00:04:46.341 --> 00:04:48.248
But yeah, we have a question.

70
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:52.511
&gt;&gt; So why is that, is it because
of the way the Shadow DOM works?

71
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.249
It just won't let you, it doesn't care
that you've put CSS on the element.

72
00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.319
&gt;&gt; Right, correct,
the way the Shadow DOM and

73
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.279
boundary is sort of, I guess specked out,

74
00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:10.895
is that if there's encapsulation style,
encapsulation.

75
00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:15.688
I think there's technical reasons,

76
00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:20.928
because if you were able to deep style it,

77
00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:24.834
should that only go one level?

78
00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:30.506
What if you had buttons within buttons,
or whatever, elements within elements?

79
00:05:30.506 --> 00:05:31.950
How far down that tree should that go?

80
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.821
So I think you have logic problems for,

81
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:38.220
does that just apply forever,
Oo does it not?

82
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.033
But me as a developer, I would like
a tool, and there's actually in

83
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:47.762
the Web Components Community group,
I think there's an idea of,

84
00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:52.001
you remember how we had open and
closed Shadow DOM, right?

85
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.543
Open means we can access
the Shadow DOM from the outside, and

86
00:05:56.543 --> 00:05:58.689
closed meaning you can't.

87
00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:05.560
I think there's this idea growing of open
styleable child Dom in the original spec,

88
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.805
and I'd be actually really amazed
if it still worked in Chrome.

89
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:17.341
[LAUGH] but there was this roll off,
there we go.

90
00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:21.582
There's this deep selector,
which was kind of like,

91
00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:25.742
go deep into this component and
style this selector.

92
00:06:25.742 --> 00:06:30.269
They didn't make the final version,
I don't think obviously here.

93
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:34.679
But there was just a kinda
talk original concept, but

94
00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:39.193
I think it got shot down from
an isolation standpoint.

95
00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:44.953
So the idea is I think just,
and you could see this too.

96
00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:51.943
You have a website, and a really cool ad
campaign.js is also put on your website.

97
00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:56.248
And they are just going for
it on their style, and

98
00:06:56.248 --> 00:07:01.712
all of a sudden, your buttons
turn pink on your whole web app.

99
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:07.394
That could be a problem too, like so
I think the idea too is nothing.

100
00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:09.825
The styles in the web
component don't shoot out, but

101
00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:11.346
then the styles don't shoot in.

102
00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:14.662
So it's just a hypothetical
argument there.

103
00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:17.343
But I think we're figuring out what,
again,

104
00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:22.089
it's just sort of experimenting with
the limitations, but it was talked about,

105
00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:26.036
it's being talked about, but
it's not something you can do, so.

106
00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.884
So does that help everybody?

107
00:07:28.884 --> 00:07:29.898
Any more questions?

108
00:07:29.898 --> 00:07:30.620
We got two more.

109
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.927
This is the hard part, so I keep asking.

110
00:07:32.927 --> 00:07:38.445
&gt;&gt; Could you go back a few slides,
just wanted to distinguish the regular,

111
00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:41.598
the light DOM, and the, so here
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

112
00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.591
&gt;&gt; If you have that Shadow DOM boundary,
that's dynamically inserted in there,

113
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:47.508
right, and that's the difference?

114
00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:48.119
&gt;&gt; Yeah, correct.

115
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:48.679
&gt;&gt; Okay.

116
00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:55.790
&gt;&gt; And so you can actually,
like if we go, let me go to the CodePen.

117
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.981
We'll go here and
we can do some web inspecting.

118
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.753
Are you ready?

119
00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:06.900
[SOUND] it looks actually
a lot like my drawing.

120
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.147
We have our example element, and
then here's our Light DOM button, right?

121
00:08:12.147 --> 00:08:14.304
And then we have the shadow root, and

122
00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:19.260
that's the shadow boundary that when you
say attack shadow, it's creating this.

123
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.875
And inside there, I put that slot
element and then our Shadow DOM button,

124
00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:27.385
and the slot element is
revealing the Light DOM button.

125
00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:30.568
It's confusing, again, cuz it's new, but

126
00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:35.477
you can actually click on here and
figure out what it's talking about.

127
00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:37.912
So that's kinda helpful too.

128
00:08:37.912 --> 00:08:39.953
So yes, question.

129
00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:44.882
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering if a Shadow DOM
is been both open and styleable,

130
00:08:44.882 --> 00:08:49.217
what would the benefits be over
just not using a Shadow DOM?

131
00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:53.402
&gt;&gt; Okay,
if the Shadow DOM was open styleable,

132
00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:58.922
what would be the benefit of
using it over just not using it?

133
00:08:58.922 --> 00:09:04.322
Yeah, very little, [LAUGH] you would still

134
00:09:04.322 --> 00:09:10.024
have a degree of script-like containment,

135
00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:15.886
and you could still have
your custom element.

136
00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:19.868
You could still have Shadow Dom,
and so the API interface,

137
00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:23.543
what the people you work with
author is very succinct.

138
00:09:23.543 --> 00:09:27.954
And you can put that in your
server render template.

139
00:09:27.954 --> 00:09:33.986
But yeah, there might not be like, no for
me, there's still gigantic benefits.

140
00:09:33.986 --> 00:09:40.017
Because when I want to
distribute the design system,

141
00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:44.976
I wanna use our tabs and
our accordance, and

142
00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:50.470
then give them sort of a cool
way to [LAUGH] I guess,

143
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:57.191
author that in an intuitive way and
sort of limit mistakes.

144
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:02.259
You and your company might have
a tight integration with your CMS,

145
00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:03.889
where you're like,

146
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:09.241
we only offered these three variants
of the cool button or something.

147
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:13.892
And so cool button only
comes in three flavors and

148
00:10:13.892 --> 00:10:19.347
they have to choose one in the CMS or
something like that.

149
00:10:19.347 --> 00:10:23.831
So that's maybe a situation where
you'd wanna use web components still.

150
00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:27.409
But yeah though,
it sort of blurs the line.

151
00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:30.889
So I think there's if like,
you offer open styleable,

152
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:33.419
they'll use a bit of their islandness.

153
00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:36.342
But I think from an authoring perspective,

154
00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:40.766
there's just times where you're like,
I just wanna style this,

155
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:45.430
let me make the buttons pink,
becaus I could leave work that day, so.
