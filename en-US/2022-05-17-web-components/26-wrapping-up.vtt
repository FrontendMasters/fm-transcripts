00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.199
If you have more questions, that's fine.

2
00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.350
You can reach out or whatever,
we can figure that out.

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.566
[LAUGH] But wrapping up, I just wanted
to kinda make just a couple points.

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:14.477
Web components build
into the web platform.

5
00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:17.450
Your custom elements,
we saw it through the reusability, right?

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.550
You can just give somebody
a custom element.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.097
They didn't have to install a new tooling.

8
00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:25.482
You're not building into Zach's framework.

9
00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:27.740
You're not building into
Google's framework.

10
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.117
You're building into the web.

11
00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:32.980
We can just share web
things with each other.

12
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.172
Kind of like what we're
doing with spicy sections,

13
00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:40.669
your web components can provide
blueprints for richer native elements,

14
00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:44.456
whether that's tabs, accordion,
select menu, list box.

15
00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:49.789
Your web components are a little bit
closer to how the browser would operate,

16
00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.371
right?

17
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:52.044
And it's native web tech.

18
00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:56.744
We don't have to put React in the browser
just to get your idea in the browser.

19
00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:57.940
These are native web tech.

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.947
And I've even seen through open UI,

21
00:01:00.947 --> 00:01:07.064
I've seen elements that are coming out and
they are using the part syntax.

22
00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:10.152
So that under the hood, they're kind
of basically just a web component.

23
00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:13.687
I don't think they are, but
they're using that part syntax

24
00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:17.289
to let you target specific pieces
of the UI of the date picker or

25
00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.360
the popup, the select menu or
something like that.

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.777
So that's all very interesting.

27
00:01:21.777 --> 00:01:27.029
This stuff is kinda now informing
how actual HTML might work,

28
00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.562
not just Shadow Realm stuff.

29
00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:33.587
So these blueprints,
if you make them and it's tested and

30
00:01:33.587 --> 00:01:38.774
there's test suites and there's demand for
it, they can maybe be built.

31
00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:43.077
And I think if we had tabs elements, if we
had accordion elements, if we had all this

32
00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:46.585
stuff that made it easier to build
a website without just installing

33
00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:50.789
everything, you didn't have to be a
computer scientist just to make a website.

34
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.960
I think that would make a big
difference for the web.

35
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.780
It'd be more inclusive,
allow more people to participate.

36
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.521
Allow anyone [LAUGH] moms, grandmas,

37
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:02.540
everyone to kind of build
the website of their dreams.

38
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.060
And I think that's really important.

39
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.020
And I think the goal is still
to have a web for everyone.

40
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.900
So with that,
let's build a web for everyone.

41
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.630
So thank you, and
I hope you make cool stuff.

42
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.475
Thank you.

43
00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:21.506
