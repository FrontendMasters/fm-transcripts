1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.818
CD.

2
00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:03.680
All right, let's clear CD.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.110
We'll go into our brewery app and
then we're gonna open it in VS code.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.890
And I trust those authors.

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.190
Okay, so, looking at VS code,
we have some of the same stuff.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.272
We have a Storybook, server,
we have some VS code,

7
00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:28.793
extensions, lit plugin, pretty standard.

8
00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:31.355
And that's my thing, I made that.

9
00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.228
And then we have a logo,

10
00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:38.110
and then let's do npm start,
which is what it wanted us to do.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.770
Okay, and over here,
we have a application.

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.371
So, this is the open WC sort of exampl,
whatever's,

13
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:56.080
how the frameworks like to put their
logo on the thing you just made?

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.240
So it does that.

15
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.319
So, brewery app is going to be
our component it looks like.

16
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.158
And brewery app with a hyphen
is basically just it's going

17
00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:13.230
to ingest the app and define the app.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.064
Let's just say, goodbye.

19
00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:19.181
[LAUGH] We'll get that later.

20
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:27.222
If we have lit here, we're just gonna
use brewery app and what's it mad at me?

21
00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:29.030
Let element is defined by naming us.

22
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.549
Okay, cool.

23
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:38.117
So, our next thing that we're gonna do is
basically set up our app wrapper, right?

24
00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:43.901
So class, brewery app,
extend, lit element.

25
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:48.690
And I can power code some of this stuff.

26
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.159
But in our thing, we need our construct.

27
00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.960
Actually in my example,
I don't think I even need a constructor,

28
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.116
that's beautiful, weird.

29
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.810
[LAUGH] I guess cuz were auto doing it.

30
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.755
So let's see here.

31
00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:09.250
We're going to have some properties,
right?

32
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.157
Stat get properties and we're gonna have,

33
00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:19.204
what would our brewery
app mean to have in it?

34
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.476
&gt;&gt; Breweries.

35
00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:22.880
&gt;&gt; Probably, breweries.

36
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.931
Yes, [LAUGH] breweries, right?

37
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:30.991
And then that's gonna be,
we'll just give it a type that we expect,

38
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:34.200
that's probably an array of stuff, right?

39
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.220
Okay, and then our connected callback,
which I think we'll use later.

40
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.806
We're going to go super.connectedcallback.

41
00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.602
And we're getting some
autocomplete happening.

42
00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:50.902
That's kinda nice,
it's working how we expected.

43
00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:58.420
And when hit our Render function HTML or
return HTML.

44
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.001
And then we're going to,

45
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.046
breweries and

46
00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:13.396
then we'll have like, h 2.

47
00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:19.110
And then maybe it's like,
let's see, oay, yeah, here we go.

48
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.760
I was confused what I
wrote down breweries app.

49
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.050
That's the name of our brewery.

50
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.546
We're gonna call it,
KewlBrew [LAUGH] KewlBrews.

51
00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:35.174
And brewery is one of those words if you

52
00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:40.100
say it enough you kinda stop hearing it?

53
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.714
And then we're gonna do,
[LAUGH] whatever this .breweries.length.

54
00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:48.579
We're just gonna say,
how many breweries we found, right?

55
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.416
And I think that's i,
that's all we need to kinda get going.

56
00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.789
We'll eventually wanna loop
through the breweries,

57
00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.465
I guess we could make make our loop for
breweries right now.

58
00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.679
Typing bad.

59
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.665
And then li..

60
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:15.791
So this is kinda where
the sort of reacting

61
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:21.507
nature JSSC nature breweries.map, right?

62
00:04:21.507 --> 00:04:23.707
We all like to map.

63
00:04:23.707 --> 00:04:29.332
Brewery and then we go through and
we do that.

64
00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:29.934
I missed this.

65
00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:31.460
Okay, we're good.

66
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.455
So, we have all that and
then we probably map through, right?

67
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:44.020
But we also need to return some HTML.

68
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.320
I forgot my HTML tag template.

69
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.027
So, we're gonna return HTML from inside,
for

70
00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:55.016
every brewery we're gonna loop through.

71
00:04:55.016 --> 00:05:02.400
This debris eagle eyes,
[LAUGH] eagle eyed observers.

72
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.218
Breweries defined but never use,
so we're gonna do that.

73
00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:09.998
We're gonna go brewery.name and

74
00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:13.466
just like echo that out.

75
00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:18.402
Block statement is surrounding, hold on,
I'm going to say goodbye to that.

76
00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:23.960
And surrounding the body but Hello.

77
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.074
I'm confused with that is mad about,
but let's see here.

78
00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:32.170
Can it fix itself?

79
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.359
Fix, sure dude,
if that's what you want to do.

80
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:43.508
[LAUGH] That's why you are so
upset about, I'm happy for you.

81
00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:48.541
Cool, let's see if this even
renders now in our application.

82
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:55.782
So it's not, so I must have actually
needed to have something here.

83
00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:59.363
So I don't think I need this.

84
00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:05.282
Who but our index.html is trying to
render our brewery app from our brew,

85
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:07.013
source brewery app.

86
00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:10.970
Got it, and this is us, and brewery app.

87
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.630
We didn't define our custom element.

88
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.072
Define brewery app, Brewery app.

89
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.996
So,
&gt;&gt; The method you just ran the define that

90
00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:29.580
could also be a decorator at the top?

91
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.811
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's kind of like

92
00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:38.391
in lit at the end of decorators.

93
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:42.792
There may just be an feature, but yeah, so

94
00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:48.799
here you can go define some syntax,
they have you define.

95
00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:49.943
Is it in parentheses?

96
00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:55.550
I think it's not, but you say brewery app.

97
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.997
It might be doing it here.

98
00:06:56.997 --> 00:06:59.294
No, it wasn't.

99
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:03.179
But the decorator syntax inside for
lit is,

100
00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:06.750
I think you have to import that package.

101
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.378
But it's really nice,
it actually is pretty convenient.

102
00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:15.013
And even properties
just turns into app and

103
00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:21.463
you do that instead of this
object that I got all stumped on.

104
00:07:21.463 --> 00:07:23.539
So,
&gt;&gt; But

105
00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:29.705
that define decorator that is provided
by lit that's not a browser, right?

106
00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:34.362
&gt;&gt; That is part of lit but,
you know what, the good question.

107
00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:36.010
Let's see here.

108
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.053
Make it less man.

109
00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:46.053
Let's look at lit,
cuz in all their examples,

110
00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:50.090
they kinda show these custom elements.

111
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.288
They show these group styles.

112
00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:56.118
Maybe if you're looking at
the TypeScript thing, they have that.

113
00:07:56.118 --> 00:08:00.408
And we can actually switch this
to TypeScript if we wanted to.

114
00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:04.809
But they have to, let's go into,

115
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.588
Decorators.

116
00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:12.476
Here we go.

117
00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:14.980
Okay, so we import custom element.

118
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.968
And then, okay, add custom elements,
sorry, I was way off.

119
00:08:18.968 --> 00:08:23.919
[LAUGH] So yeah, and then I can do

120
00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:31.165
@customelements('brewery-app').

121
00:08:31.165 --> 00:08:34.762
Which might be a nicer, cleaner way for

122
00:08:34.762 --> 00:08:39.239
you to define custom elements,
in the browser.

123
00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:40.988
Or just you put it all at the top of file,

124
00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.490
you don't have to go back
down to the bottom of file.

125
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.221
Yes.

126
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:48.722
&gt;&gt; Do these decorators and lit also
add a build step similar to the ones?

127
00:08:48.722 --> 00:08:52.588
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think cuz it's not like
a fully supported feature right now.

128
00:08:52.588 --> 00:08:55.440
So it would be something you'd
have to kinda compile through.

129
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.176
I think maybe Chrome does, but yeah,
I think you're still gonna walk do it.

130
00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:05.133
I would maybe probably just
do it all through Typescrip,

131
00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:07.441
[LAUGH] and then call it a TS file and

132
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:12.155
then know that that's just gonna
get kinda fixed as it transpires.

133
00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:15.360
But yeah, but
those decorators are pretty cool.

134
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.739
Just I don't use them cuz I'm more,
I'm trying not to use too much new stuff.

135
00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:26.926
[LAUGH] Realm, but
those decorators are pretty sweet for

136
00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:32.300
just short handing a bunch
of kinda tedious steps.

137
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.339
So we're running here,
but we're not rendering.

138
00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.340
So let's see what's mad about.

139
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.853
Cannot read property of length.

140
00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:39.859
Okay, cool.

141
00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:44.489
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I guess, no,

142
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:48.229
this .breweries.length or 0.

143
00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:50.210
[LAUGH] Is that what it wants?

144
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.758
No, here, maybe we'll do that.

145
00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:06.844
So that's just JavaScript there,
so it really hates that.

146
00:10:06.844 --> 00:10:10.412
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Like that?

147
00:10:10.412 --> 00:10:13.706
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, boy it hates that.

148
00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:14.675
Wait, map.

149
00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:17.438
Okay, I can't do the map
either cuz it really hates it.

150
00:10:17.438 --> 00:10:20.658
So maybe I'll do, yeah, may I'll say,

151
00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:28.215
right there super,
right or we'll go super.

152
00:10:28.215 --> 00:10:35.357
But we can just stop breweries
equals empty array, right?

153
00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:39.196
So hey, okay, we got something.

154
00:10:39.196 --> 00:10:40.291
Cool Bruce.
