WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.578
Styling from the inside, okay.

2
00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:07.954
Let's say we have control we
can author the web component

3
00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:14.685
these are Rs CSS variables and
we talked about this a little bit before.

4
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.389
CSS Custom properties,

5
00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:20.780
that's their official name are in
a type of inheritable style.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.620
They cascade down through elements.

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.240
And so we can set our BG variable and
our dash dash text variable, and

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.640
we can alter the web component, the inside
of the web component from the outside.

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.481
So, are alert,
we're setting that on the outside and

10
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.757
then inside, it's actually looking for
some variables.

11
00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:50.061
It says if you define that variable,
I will render that variable.

12
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:51.675
I know how to do that.

13
00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:55.011
So, this all depends on the plugin,

14
00:00:55.011 --> 00:01:00.820
you know that shadow scroll plugin I used,
that had them two up,

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.010
that has some variables that you can
use to style inside the accent color.

16
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.753
This is a real good way for

17
00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:14.816
you as a component author to appears
designers [LAUGH] but to offer a little

18
00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:19.881
bit of customization that might get
some mileage out of your component.

19
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:24.952
That's colors, that's padding that's like
specific sizes or something like that.

20
00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:28.526
If you can variable eyes those parameters,

21
00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:34.428
you can basically you don't have to
make 10 copies of the same button.

22
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:38.457
Just to appease everyone
in the organization.

23
00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:40.027
Does that sounds pretty good?

24
00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:43.740
Offer a little customizability
goes a long way.

25
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.220
Okay, pre-defined themes is another
thing that web components do.

26
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.391
I think of like the Gmail comfy cozy,
switcher UI,

27
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:58.146
you can offer these sort of
things in your web components.

28
00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:01.632
This customer I have like a, a warning or

29
00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:05.646
a danger warning is yellow,,
red is danger.

30
00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:10.950
Offering these like controls
is super helpful for, again,

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.472
sort of like pre-defined styles and
themes, sizing colors.

32
00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:21.352
Maybe you don't want your designers
inventing their own, or whoever,

33
00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:24.872
developers, inventing
their own padding system,

34
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:28.084
maybe you give them one of two or
three choices.

35
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:32.894
And where I see this working out well too
is kind of if you have a CMS integration

36
00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:34.451
or something like that.

37
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:39.869
And they can just specify how much
padding they want on the alert or the.

38
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.671
The how big it needs to be or
something like that or a theme.

39
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.433
This is the special event one or
something like that.

40
00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.024
So yes, we have a question.

41
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.381
&gt;&gt; Theme is not a reserved keyword in
the spec, it's just a best practice.

42
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a best practice.

43
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.719
This could be sighs, this could
be whatever you want to call it.

44
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.506
So that attribute is
something you program.

45
00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:05.030
I can show you I think in here.

46
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.595
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,
I defined it in my properties.

47
00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:12.220
So I'm making a custom property.

48
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.142
I also have one for icon, so you can
choose what icon shows up here just in

49
00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:19.850
case if you don't want a warning icon,

50
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.879
you just want a little message icon,
a note or something you can do that.

51
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.592
This could hook under
your whole icon system,

52
00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:31.505
those icons could be web components,
however you want to do it so.

53
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:36.739
All right, all good so far, and
then this was the part name shadow parts.

54
00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.937
This is how you get that button.

55
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:43.097
Okay, so I'll walk through it.

56
00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.716
So I just have this.

57
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:50.236
I have the CSS, but
there's a way in your web component,

58
00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.575
and I'll kind of get down to here.

59
00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:55.922
Going all the way down.

60
00:03:55.922 --> 00:04:01.011
And I added this part equals button and
just that like one

61
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:06.424
little line of code makes a huge
difference because you're

62
00:04:06.424 --> 00:04:11.314
basically saying,
this is a part that you can style.

63
00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:19.617
And then in your CSS use reference
the pseudo-element part button,

64
00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:25.640
so hey custom alert give
me the part named button.

65
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.667
And the result is I can style that
button and submit a form Apparently so.

66
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:39.727
Yeah, so anyway, so
you can style that button right

67
00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:45.020
there in the browser or
right there from your CSS file.

68
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.430
If that part has been offered.

69
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.340
So this is kind of one of the newer
bits to shadow do and stuff like that.

70
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.159
So I don't see it that often being
offered but I think it's a really great

71
00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.066
way to be like, not just like we have
themes, not just we have variables.

72
00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:06.586
But if you really wanna mess
with this part, go ahead.

73
00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:10.147
And I've seen like really
radical things like for

74
00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:13.893
like SVG is like you could
just supply your own path.

75
00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:20.150
Or something like that it's
kind of cool options tthere.

76
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.740
I think this is a really good solution.

77
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.969
But again, your mileage may vary.

78
00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.739
I don't know your system and
your problems you're trying to solve.

79
00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:32.139
&gt;&gt; Does it continue down the tree like so
if that button had a child,

80
00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.391
would you be able to style that
if you could access the parent?

81
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:41.581
&gt;&gt; We could try I think
you're saying a child part in

82
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:46.788
a totally different component, maybe or-
&gt;&gt; Well,

83
00:05:46.788 --> 00:05:50.304
if you selected the button
by its name of button.

84
00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:53.447
But then if that button had a paragraph
tag in it or something or a span,

85
00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:57.160
could you reach that span then since
you already have control the parent?

86
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.317
&gt;&gt; Like a child, okay,
like tried selecting inside the button,

87
00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.885
we can try that here let's go.

88
00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:08.960
[LAUGH] Let's get dangerous, we can
put a span inside of a button, right?

89
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.274
Span, and right, and
I think the answer is gonna be no, but

90
00:06:17.274 --> 00:06:24.153
so are you thinking like button span or do
you want put it on the outside or I was.

91
00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:26.894
&gt;&gt; My intuition is on the outside but
either or I suppose because.

92
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:31.556
&gt;&gt; It does not look like that works, and

93
00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:34.697
that's kind of the thing
with web components,

94
00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:39.990
is they sort of only let you in and
then say that's as far as you can get.

95
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.927
So you got in the door, but it's very
specific about what you can style, so.

96
00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:49.785
&gt;&gt; Have you tried it on the inside and
two doors?

97
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:50.285
&gt;&gt; Here?

98
00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:58.743
I would expect it to be the same, but
maybe we need a different style for it.

99
00:06:58.743 --> 00:07:05.407
But, yeah it doesn't like go through and
we can't like so

100
00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:10.176
yeah so it's too bad that'd be cool yes.

101
00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:14.007
&gt;&gt; So could you just put just styles
in that block that's right there?

102
00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:18.054
&gt;&gt; Could I put in which block?

103
00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:22.324
&gt;&gt; Just put another style to see if
it affects the span with the current

104
00:07:22.324 --> 00:07:23.095
selector.

105
00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:30.046
&gt;&gt; It's so like you mean like
a whole other blocker or

106
00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:33.237
like add another stone,

107
00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:38.164
okay yeah let's let's do that
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] I think like coz,

108
00:07:38.164 --> 00:07:40.971
this is actually looking for
the park name that, so

109
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:44.188
I think it probably have to go
on the outside, what I mean?

110
00:07:44.188 --> 00:07:50.449
So orange important,

111
00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.748
like that?

112
00:07:53.748 --> 00:07:56.328
Or maybe I'm not understanding where.

113
00:07:56.328 --> 00:07:58.165
&gt;&gt; Without the less than span.

114
00:07:58.165 --> 00:07:59.700
&gt;&gt; Okay?

115
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:06.081
&gt;&gt; The span inside the brackets
is nothing which that's, right?

116
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:07.976
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're putting span in here.

117
00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:11.283
Okay, yeah I mean yeah
okay we can try that yeah.

118
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.532
No so yeah it's frustrating,
and that's like again the foot

119
00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:23.670
gun it's the loss of control,
it's the, I'm good at CSS,

120
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.295
I don't know how to grant that like I'm
built my life on like drinking things out.

121
00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:33.085
But all of a sudden,
like doesn't work exactly but

122
00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:38.120
name show parts are a way to at least
offer up our piece of the puzzle.

123
00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:44.836
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what people are saying in
the chat is that you just have to make

124
00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:47.983
multiple parts to expose more
pieces of your elements.

125
00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:53.527
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so I can show I have that

126
00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:58.290
podcast player when I have.

127
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.906
Yeah, here we go.

128
00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:03.166
This is my late version,
it's kinda hidden.

129
00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.990
I guess one thing I was looking at for
like a podcast player, right?

130
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.623
You wanna like move buttons
around wherever you want.

131
00:09:09.623 --> 00:09:12.831
I think it's on the shop talk version,
so that's my fault.

132
00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:15.678
But you want to move things around
you want to style things a little bit

133
00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:16.226
different.

134
00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:19.714
Maybe I just want to delete a button
entirely or something like that.

135
00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:24.412
And so, I named gave all of the parts
names and you're able to move and

136
00:09:24.412 --> 00:09:29.480
delete and every single button
in the little podcast player UI.

137
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.890
It's pretty cool.

138
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.473
It works pretty effectively.

139
00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:38.850
And even there's, you could in theory just
kind of change it quite dramatically.

140
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.770
So, yeah.
