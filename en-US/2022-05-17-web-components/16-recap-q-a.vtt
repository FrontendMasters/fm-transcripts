00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.120
Let's recap.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.580
External styling,
you could style light on.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.278
You wrote it, you style it.

4
00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:09.513
Style deep styling Shadow DOM,
doesn't work.

5
00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:14.817
Global classes, doesn't work
unless you go the ugly route and

6
00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:21.333
put these style sheets inside your web,
it's fine, it's fine, it works.

7
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.465
It's web technology all it does is
make a request and it brings back CSS.

8
00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:29.266
And if your CSS has already cached,
the hit is zero.

9
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:35.095
So if you've already requested the
tailwind CSS file in the web component,

10
00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:36.471
it would be zero.

11
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:41.991
And then global classes, okay yeah,
so we can make that work.

12
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:42.786
Inheritable styles?

13
00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:44.635
Yes, they pass through CSS variables.

14
00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:45.824
Yes, that's a great way.

15
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:46.630
Predefined themes.

16
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.224
Yes, that's a great way to style.

17
00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:49.450
Named Shadow Parts.

18
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.578
Yes, that's a great way.

19
00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:55.985
And then CSS pseudo-elements, host,
host context, slotted define.

20
00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.224
These are also kind of cool
tools you can use to style

21
00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:03.391
your web components from the inside.

22
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.544
Or even the outside I guess in the case
of defined and stuff like that.

23
00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:10.535
So cool, interesting.

24
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:14.045
I'm curious to see how y'all will use it,
but

25
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:19.459
it's just a new stuff we have to learn and
now it's our job to know, so.

26
00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:20.196
&gt;&gt; Here's a question.

27
00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:26.940
Could you use an attribute selector
to select a part by custom property?

28
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.152
&gt;&gt; An attribute selector,

29
00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:38.610
like, let me find my part one.

30
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.547
Like custom alert.

31
00:01:42.547 --> 00:01:46.941
Like part, button or something.

32
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:51.663
Or like.
&gt;&gt; No, if it was a theme, for instance,

33
00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:59.142
a specific theme, or it was a part
like they used like the alert,

34
00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:03.618
the morn and then the part button.

35
00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:07.183
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay yeah.

36
00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:08.968
Yeah, okay.

37
00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:14.189
Theme yeah, you can totally chain

38
00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.059
this stuff, this should work.

39
00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.437
I wrote it, I hope it does.

40
00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:26.109
So let's just change it to,

41
00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:33.138
This should work, I didn't do this right.

42
00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:36.751
Live coding equals warn.

43
00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:47.486
Let's see, come on coop in,
Let me refresh my code pen.

44
00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:51.340
Weird, it doesn't seem to work a day, I
probably messed something up, let me see.

45
00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:59.833
What are you?

46
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:03.384
Roll icon warning and
we'll just do icon warning.

47
00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:08.323
There we go.

48
00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:12.424
Yeah so
you can make this side the left side

49
00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:16.299
of the selector as complex as you want.

50
00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.899
So what can be kind of
cool is you could kind

51
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:27.510
of change the color of whatever you want.

52
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.350
If you have multiple alerts or

53
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.367
something like that ,you could kind of
style them differently if you needed to.

54
00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:39.357
So on a single page or
throughout the entire system, so.

55
00:03:39.357 --> 00:03:40.658
You had a question.

56
00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:43.124
&gt;&gt; Yeah based on your
experience using web parts,

57
00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:46.528
would you say the majority of
people do implement the Shadow DOM?

58
00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:51.505
Kind of that's the default that most
people use when they're creating web

59
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:52.455
components?

60
00:03:52.455 --> 00:03:54.978
&gt;&gt; They code stuff in there?

61
00:03:54.978 --> 00:04:00.631
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the style tags in your

62
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:06.004
web components are pretty normal.

63
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:10.925
Where it's moving to, and
this is kind of the future state and

64
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:14.817
maybe this is just a great
place to talk about it.

65
00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.190
This is not fun, right?

66
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.802
This is not good.

67
00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:20.028
We don't like this.

68
00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:25.426
What would be a good, let me go to
a complex example and then all.

69
00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:27.715
Let me fork it, right?

70
00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:30.631
For forking pen, here we go, okay?

71
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:35.415
So I'm gonna just delete all this,
we don't care.

72
00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:38.278
All right, so
this would be our default custom alert.

73
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.894
So where it's kind of
heading is this idea where,

74
00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.487
what if I could take all this stuff?

75
00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:46.346
This is so much stuff.

76
00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.327
We hate this stuff, right?

77
00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:52.454
And what if I could put it in
a CSS file somewhere, right?

78
00:04:52.454 --> 00:04:59.175
And this won't work cuz it doesn't
know about the stylesheet yet.

79
00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:03.629
But the cool thing is,

80
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.021
you can import sheet from,

81
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:14.189
this is a new CSS feature.

82
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.648
I can import a style sheet
from a style sheet as,

83
00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:28.069
I think it's as styles,
as style I think is what it is.

84
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.949
And then, okay?

85
00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.652
Unexpected identifier,
maybe it wants this, let's see, okay.

86
00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:42.351
&gt;&gt; Sheet as style or sheet style from.

87
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:45.617
&gt;&gt; Import sheet as, as style.

88
00:05:45.617 --> 00:05:46.117
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

89
00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:54.166
&gt;&gt; Let me see.

90
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:57.179
I thought I knew how to do this,
I have a blog post on it.

91
00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:00.756
Let me go to my blog,
everyone likes their own blog.

92
00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:04.851
Everyone references their own blog, right?

93
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:10.615
So I did this whole thing
where I made CSS modules.

94
00:06:10.615 --> 00:06:15.079
You're probably familiar with
something like emotion or

95
00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:19.726
CSS modules or style components or
something that generates

96
00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:24.205
a robot class on your elements and
IDs and stuff like that.

97
00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:28.382
Shadow DOM is interesting because
you don't need that Robot class,

98
00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:32.713
that Robot class is just for
scoping the style to that element, right?

99
00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:34.166
So you don't need it.

100
00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:37.997
That's what Shadow DOM
solve that same problem.

101
00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:43.251
But there is this idea of,
what if you wanted

102
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:47.660
these CSS Robot classes as type CSS?

103
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.939
We blew it, okay, wow, okay.

104
00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.082
So that's what it is.

105
00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:57.096
So we can import these styles as style,
and

106
00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:03.238
then we can actually tell our
document to adopt that style sheet.

107
00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:08.092
And that is all done in JavaScript,
it's called CSS module scripts to not

108
00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:11.551
be confused with CSS module,
it is very confusing.

109
00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:16.380
But you basically import this and
you create an adopted style sheet.

110
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.286
This produces a constructed
style sheet and

111
00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:22.277
then you adopt
the constructed style sheet.

112
00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:24.393
I know, it just rolls off the tongue.

113
00:07:24.393 --> 00:07:29.055
So let me go steal that from myself.

114
00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:30.593
But I went through and

115
00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:35.735
I was just kinda maybe I could make
these like Robot classes up and do it.

116
00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:40.087
Cuz I actually kinda like it sometimes or
if I'm not using web components if I

117
00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:42.953
wanted to use Robot classes
without build tools.

118
00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:45.775
And I did it, so that was kind of fun.

119
00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:51.858
But let's go back to the place
where we were importing stuff.

120
00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:53.571
Where's our, here.

121
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:57.350
Okay, assert type equals CSS.

122
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.751
Gosh I was way off, okay?

123
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:03.308
So nothing's dying,
everyone's happy, okay?

124
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:08.082
And so, we can document DOP did style

125
00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:12.088
sheets equals sheet, right?

126
00:08:12.088 --> 00:08:17.940
We're basically pushing the sheet
into the adopted style sheets.

127
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.362
And you will see here,
I think I can do this.

128
00:08:22.362 --> 00:08:26.632
Let's do it in the regular console.

129
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:29.384
It didn't do anything yet.

130
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.478
It was very mad at me, let's see here.

131
00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:36.933
But you can do a document
adopted stylesheets, right?

132
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:43.132
Let me go into the code pin actual and
now I'll try that.

133
00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:49.406
No, it's a proxy, it's an array
of zero and so nothing happened.

134
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.430
That's unexpected.

135
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.344
Well, let me see if this works.

136
00:08:55.344 --> 00:09:01.057
So what you can do in your element,

137
00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:07.760
in your constructor you can do this dot.

138
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.875
Let's see this is a lit element.

139
00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:14.054
Okay, this dot shadowroute or
whatever hopefully you have,

140
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:17.050
I think you get that for free inlet.

141
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.703
You have to create it in
a vanilla web component.

142
00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:29.552
This dash shadowRoot.adopted style sheets.

143
00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:36.219
So you can basically, no.

144
00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:40.565
Okay, so
it doesn't have a shadow root yet, weird.

145
00:09:43.994 --> 00:09:44.954
I'm gonna have to look into this.

146
00:09:44.954 --> 00:09:51.078
This is maybe a bad place
to refine code here,

147
00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:57.523
but there is a way to
basically you link the style

148
00:09:57.523 --> 00:10:03.179
sheets into the web component from here.

149
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:07.337
I'm just missing what exactly it is.

150
00:10:07.337 --> 00:10:11.447
So, let me work on that in a break and
we'll figure out what happens and

151
00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:13.971
then we'll reset like nothing happened.

152
00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:15.546
No one's gonna know.

153
00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:21.340
[LAUGH] But so this would be
the kind of modern way to do it.

154
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.866
Again, it's not supported in every
browser though and so that's like,

155
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:29.455
you're stuck with link tags
until that it gets resolved.

156
00:10:29.455 --> 00:10:35.482
So but it's pretty cool tech when it
works, not how I'm doing it right now.

157
00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:42.365
So,okay, questions or try renderRoot
is what somebody is saying in the chat.

158
00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:44.252
Thank you.

159
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:52.422
this.renderRoot, this would
be beautiful if it worked.

160
00:10:52.422 --> 00:10:56.980
I think what's happening though
is my browser is not ingesting

161
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.050
the style sheet correctly.

162
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.442
&gt;&gt; Is any of this styling issues,

163
00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:08.180
can you get around any of
these by using the libraries

164
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.627
that make web components easier later?

165
00:11:12.627 --> 00:11:13.809
I forget the other ones but.

166
00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:14.618
&gt;&gt; Yes.

167
00:11:14.618 --> 00:11:15.813
&gt;&gt; This at all or no.

168
00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:19.829
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they super help with it.

169
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:24.339
We'll get into it but that's actually a
really great place cuz we can l get out of

170
00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:26.102
this disaster I'm creating.

171
00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.932
[LAUGH] Because it's pretty easy, so

172
00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:33.233
I'm gonna delete all this
stuff I was attempting here.

173
00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:35.015
And what lit offers is,

174
00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:39.928
I think I showed you this HTML tag
template or you probably saw it.

175
00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:41.835
It looks a little bit like JSX.

176
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:46.501
It's a little weird, but it's basically
a template literal, the backticks.

177
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:48.936
And you can write
JavaScript inside of there.

178
00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:53.913
But we have HTML here, but
lit offers CSS as well.

179
00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:59.596
So lit has a static, I think it's styles.

180
00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:06.077
And then we can return CSS backtick,
backtick.

181
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:13.289
And now we can just relink
our CSS back into here.

182
00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:18.270
And let's see if that works.

183
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.914
I'm expecting that to work and
I don't know that,

184
00:12:23.914 --> 00:12:27.595
I wonder if it's not static get.

185
00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:28.950
That's what I'm thinking, right?

186
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.598
There goes, hey, it's static get.

187
00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:39.193
So lit has this styles method and
then it also can return.

188
00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:41.058
And then the CSS template literal,

189
00:12:41.058 --> 00:12:44.179
which turns that into a style
tag kind of behind the scenes.

190
00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:48.361
But the way you're authoring,
it is a little more like a motion or

191
00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:49.814
something like that.

192
00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:53.236
So kind of in a standard
React component kind of way.

193
00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:56.059
&gt;&gt; Maybe superfluous, but is it possible?

194
00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:00.930
Have you seen people either importing the
template, literal string or other ways so

195
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.224
that developers can get the nice
syntax highlighting and

196
00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:07.253
pretty printing and
formatting in some other file?

197
00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:07.894
Is there?

198
00:13:07.894 --> 00:13:09.961
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Any practice from that?

199
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:17.383
&gt;&gt; Right, so there are Webpack
vacations I think that you can do.

200
00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:22.067
But you know how we are trying,
we're attempting so

201
00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:29.209
successfully to do import sheet, [LAUGH]
from some stylesheet, some CSS Cert.

202
00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:35.360
And then type CSS I think
is what we're doing.

203
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.025
So that's CSS modules.

204
00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:42.347
There is a way to do.

205
00:13:42.347 --> 00:13:48.177
You can import JSON from some
JSON file and assert type JSON.

206
00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:50.100
So that can be handy.

207
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.295
And these are native ways.

208
00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:55.212
You can do this Webpack and
whatever, figure that out.

209
00:13:55.212 --> 00:14:00.595
But these would be native ways,
but you could there's

210
00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:06.925
also talk about importing some
template from some HTML as HTML.

211
00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:09.153
I don't think this is out
in any browsers yet, but

212
00:14:09.153 --> 00:14:11.712
it's I think actively being discussed and
specked out.

213
00:14:11.712 --> 00:14:13.647
So I think it's real close.

214
00:14:13.647 --> 00:14:18.561
This whole assert type equals is
sort of just to allow us to inject

215
00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:20.391
whatever we want, so.

216
00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:22.092
So that's on its way.

217
00:14:22.092 --> 00:14:26.849
It is not here yet that I know of,
but that is kind of the future.

218
00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:31.621
So your web component may
look more like just importing

219
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:36.708
some things in and
get really succinct as it goes forward.
