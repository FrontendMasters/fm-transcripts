00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.808
Again styling is cool, but

2
00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:06.612
there's actually new CSS you have to
worry about inside the Shadow DOM.

3
00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:10.131
So Shadow DOM, only CSS,
as if this wasn't tricky enough,

4
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:13.240
there's now a new step you
have to learn for your job.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.145
So host, right,
host is basically a way to select,

6
00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:23.980
from inside the web component, you select

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.233
the parent host,
the parent custom element.

8
00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.694
Does that sound right?

9
00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:34.598
So the Shadow DOM goes inside
the custom element, but

10
00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:37.122
you want to style custom-alert.

11
00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:42.472
So how you do that,
I have a div here with a p,

12
00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:47.390
but I want to also add
a p inside the host,

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.476
and I'm gonna do the slot thing.

14
00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:55.466
And then I can style this one, the host p,

15
00:00:55.466 --> 00:01:00.377
I can reference things
inside the shadow element.

16
00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:04.492
I could style the whole host as well.

17
00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:08.070
But this is stuff you have to do in here.

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.388
I could do, I have to open this.

19
00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:13.718
I can style the whole host.

20
00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.944
I may need to make a display block,

21
00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:21.406
cuz it's just kinda weird about that,
right?

22
00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.805
And so now,
I can style the whole element itself.

23
00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:33.140
So this is helpful if you
just need a little more.

24
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.535
If you want the whole element to
be different colored background or

25
00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:45.389
something like that, this is a good way to
just kind of let's style the host itself.

26
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.886
And then there's actually a cool thing.

27
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:56.523
Not only can you do that, but
you can style based on the host context.

28
00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:58.909
What element is the hosting?

29
00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.852
I'm gonna change it.

30
00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:06.649
So this one, our example element
is just a regular example element.

31
00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.291
And then we have an example
element in a card.

32
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.859
And we told our thing,
if you're in a card,

33
00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:18.454
if you're in the host context of a card,
turn your background pink,

34
00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:21.933
and then add I'm in a card,
and it does it.

35
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.750
So that's kind of a superpower too.

36
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.560
If you think about like, I think of
cards all the time, I don't know.

37
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.726
If something's in a card,
I maybe want the padding or

38
00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:38.912
something to behave a little
differently or something like that,

39
00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:44.489
I don't wanna write these one-off
overrides or something like that.

40
00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.638
I'm thinking buttons or something.

41
00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:50.127
But again, this is sort of newish tech.

42
00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:54.266
But I think there's places where you can
use this and sort of contextualize your

43
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:58.674
element based on where it appears, cuz we
don't know where our components appear.

44
00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:01.580
But now, we can kinda say, well,

45
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.999
if it appears in this situation,
now do something.

46
00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:12.481
So a little different, a little new,
it's like a parent selector almost or

47
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:17.663
something, or the ampersand in SAS or
something like that.

48
00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:20.915
Slotted, okay,
this is actually a pseudo-element,

49
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:22.789
that's why there's two dots.

50
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:27.231
This is basically just says
anything that gets slotted in.

51
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:31.440
And it will target slotted content,
but again,

52
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.304
it has that same limitation like part,
it only does one level deep.

53
00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:41.980
So I have this example element,
I'm pink, but I'm also gonna

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.844
slot in a div with a paragraph and
it's gonna say, I'm not pink.

55
00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:50.982
And then my SAS or
CSS inside the web component is

56
00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:55.341
all slotted paragraphs,
turn background pink.

57
00:03:55.341 --> 00:04:00.927
And as you see, the nested paragraph
tag does not get styles applied.

58
00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:06.584
That's because it's too deep,
it can only select one level deep.

59
00:04:06.584 --> 00:04:12.842
And then our Shadow DOM paragraphs
,our host paragraphs are orange.

60
00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:17.938
So one thing you can do, this is something

61
00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:22.750
I've totally done, slotted(*).

62
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.687
So anything slotted at the root element,
just turn it pink,

63
00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:28.933
that's one way to work around it.

64
00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:35.184
But again, you can't do complex
selectors in here, unfortunately.

65
00:04:35.184 --> 00:04:37.211
So I wish it worked like that.

66
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:42.369
And I think there's even been
conversations about maybe

67
00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:47.312
enabling that,
compounds selectors in slotted, but

68
00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:51.407
that's not something that exists yet, so.

69
00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:56.407
Slotted, and then there's kinda one more
new special CSS feature called defined.

70
00:04:56.407 --> 00:05:00.019
You'll see the slow element and
it took a while, right, to come in.

71
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:03.456
I'll redo the animation here.

72
00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:07.344
It's gonna take a little,
I set it to fire two seconds late.

73
00:05:07.344 --> 00:05:14.563
You can say, if the slow element is not
defined in your CSS, lower the opacity.

74
00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:18.684
And actually,
you could do that for any element,

75
00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:23.605
because every element in HTML
comes defined out of the box.

76
00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:29.037
And if you just had like,
not :not:defined in your SAS or CSS,

77
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:34.779
it would just hide any custom element
that has not been defined yet.

78
00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.646
But you can also do a slow,
[LAUGH] and then when it is defined,

79
00:05:39.646 --> 00:05:42.996
you can trigger the opacity or whatever.

80
00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:48.130
This is cool and
lets you control fallback experiences.

81
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.981
You could think of a situation
where maybe you want to,

82
00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:55.847
if it's not defined,
make the height 500 pixels.

83
00:05:55.847 --> 00:06:00.937
Cuz I know an element, an image or
something's gonna show up in here,

84
00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:04.323
that might help in your
performance metrics.

85
00:06:04.323 --> 00:06:08.601
But it also can just be
a situation where you wanna make

86
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.500
those skeleton screens or
something like that,

87
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.032
you could kind of fake this stuff in
pretty easily in your Shadow DOM.

88
00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:22.379
So you can have some fake content
that then kind of whatever,

89
00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.408
pulses [LAUGH] and fades or something,
and then, boom, upgrades when

90
00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:32.710
it's been defined in the custom element,
is happening, so is engaged.

91
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.145
So kind of interesting,
I think that details utils,

92
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:43.292
I think Zack used it to do the like,

93
00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:48.300
he'll hide it and open it and measure it.

94
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.615
And that's how you measures it before it's
been defined or something like that, so

95
00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:53.780
kind of interesting.

96
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.120
And then when it's defined,
then he applies the animation stuff.
