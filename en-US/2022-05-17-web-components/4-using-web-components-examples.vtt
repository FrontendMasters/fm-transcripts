WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.245
Okay, we're gonna start talking
about using web components, and

2
00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.840
styling them, and writing them.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.776
And this course is probably gonna
be a little bit different than

4
00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.414
every other Frontend Masters
course you've ever taken,

5
00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:19.230
where you open up the command line and
just start blasting away a code.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.958
We're actually gonna start at
a bit of a different level.

7
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.950
We're gonna start with
the less chaotic stuff first,

8
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.085
start with just how do
you use them in HTML?

9
00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.210
And what does that look like?

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.690
What does that feel like?

11
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.120
How do you find existing web components,
so you don't have to write your own?

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.300
Stuff like that, start at a pretty,
I guess, high level.

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.730
But then move to the next layer
of how do you style them?

14
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.587
So that's phase two,
cuz there's a few foot guns in there.

15
00:00:50.587 --> 00:00:54.387
So if you start on the JavaScript end,
I find when you start using them and

16
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.644
you're thinking I'm doing really good.

17
00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:00.164
And then you get to the styling part and
you're I am not happy right now.

18
00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:04.090
[LAUGH] So just cuz there is
difference is the shadow DOM's fault.

19
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.790
But then you go the last level for

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.993
me is sort of the kinda
chaotic JavaScript realm.

21
00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:14.696
And then we'll spend quite
a bit of our afternoon there,

22
00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:18.160
just kinda planning out the course here.

23
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.360
So that's where it's gonna be.

24
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.608
And we're gonna start with HTML and
kinda finding components here.

25
00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:28.100
And I'll be really real with you.

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.961
I've been a little bit frustrated with
the state of modern web development,

27
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.318
if I'm not telling.

28
00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:39.364
You wanna build a webpage, but
you have to install all of God's Earth

29
00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:44.680
into your computer, gigabytes of Node
modules just to build a webpage.

30
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.480
For me that creates a feeling
of I don't wanna be

31
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.310
this nostalgic human, but maybe I am.

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.450
Well, back in my day,
I used to dial up into a website.

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.779
That's all true, but, [LAUGH] for me,
it's just sort of this ease of use.

34
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.228
I feel like I have to be a computer
scientist just to build a web page first.

35
00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:16.513
And so, well, we can still be that and
do that, [LAUGH] with web components.

36
00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:19.850
I kinda wanna start at a different angle.

37
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.033
What if we could make
interactive websites and

38
00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:30.806
all that cool stuff without
installing that bunch of JavaScript?

39
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:35.608
This is The Guardian,

40
00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:39.911
it's a newspaper.

41
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:43.853
Have you seen these things where
it's sort of the photo slider,

42
00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:46.347
where it sort of shows before and after?

43
00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:50.143
This is after the 2011 tsunami in Japan.

44
00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:54.611
Usually they're used for disasters, or
wars, or very tragic things, but for

45
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.012
me they end up being this really evocative
form of storytelling, like, wow,

46
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.762
there was a boat on that house.

47
00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:03.431
[LAUGH] I've never seen that.

48
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.930
That's how high the water got.

49
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.410
[LAUGH] If the boat is on the house,
the water got higher than the house.

50
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.032
These are just really evocative
ways to tell stories for me.

51
00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:17.554
And so it's very interesting to me
when I see these before and afters.

52
00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:24.196
And I'll dig into every pixel,
and kinda see what's all changed.

53
00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:30.597
While I find them super cool,
I never want to code one, literally never.

54
00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:32.576
[LAUGH] You want to code one?

55
00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:35.615
You're talking touch events,
pointer events,

56
00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.820
absolute positioning images that
could be whatever size possible.

57
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.830
It's gotta be responsive.

58
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.934
It's gotta work.

59
00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:43.520
I could code this.

60
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.273
It might take me a week, two weeks,

61
00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:47.678
I don't know to fully
tested on all the devices.

62
00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:48.696
And then I roll it out.

63
00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:52.850
And then I'm getting bugs fixes,
bug reports for the next ten weeks, and

64
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.861
stuff like that.

65
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:59.783
So I don't want to ruin my
life by coding this on my own.

66
00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:04.739
Even though I feel like I could,
I'd rather use somebody else's brain here,

67
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.426
and I can.

68
00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:10.214
So two-up, it's a repo

69
00:04:10.214 --> 00:04:14.321
from Google Chrome.

70
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.661
Google Chrome kinda made this, and

71
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.485
I'll show you later in what
context they kinda made this.

72
00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:24.571
But it basically,
it creates that whole effect of

73
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.572
the boat on the house in
about five lines of code.

74
00:04:28.572 --> 00:04:34.790
And if we kinda zip in here, you have a
two-up element, that's the custom element.

75
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.620
And inside we have a div with an image.

76
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.434
That's your before image.

77
00:04:37.434 --> 00:04:40.209
A div with an image,
that's your after image.

78
00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:44.506
And then a path to the script,
and this is I think coming from,

79
00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.750
where did I put it from?

80
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.780
Unpackage, I just yanked
it off of unpackage.

81
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.088
Now, you probably don't
want to add your bank,

82
00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:56.800
you can't just serve files from unpackage.

83
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.653
That's fine, you can install it to your
computer, if you wanna do that, but

84
00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:03.620
what a great way to just
kinda prototype something.

85
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.855
I didn't have to install
all of God's Earth,

86
00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.160
I didn't even touch the command line.

87
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.155
And I kinda have this little interactive
experience just from doing nothing,

88
00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:16.330
except writing about five lines of HTML,
and stealing images from The Guardian,

89
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.670
I apologize.

90
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.390
It's for educational purposes.

91
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.500
And then you can style it too.

92
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.192
We can talk about that, but
they offer a way to kinda style it,

93
00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:31.690
and customize it too and
the result is pretty convincing.

94
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.945
And yeah, so
this is literally one of my favorite,

95
00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:39.745
I think we're using it
on our portfolio site.

96
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:44.068
My designer coworkers were able
to get this up and running,

97
00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:48.570
which is nice, because I don't
have to do much to support it.

98
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.742
[LAUGH] So pretty good and
if the JavaScript failed,

99
00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:56.280
let's say this unpackage goes down,
no, guess what happens?

100
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.750
It's an image on top of an image.

101
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.740
That seems pretty good.

102
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.720
[LAUGH] No one's gonna complain.

103
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.889
IE 11 doesn't support web components
image on top of an image.

104
00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.984
Ship it, complete, done, right?

105
00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:14.050
That's all you need to know.

106
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.270
I feel it's pretty good
fallback plan as well.

107
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.030
Here's just one dumb one
I made the other week.

108
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.720
Know how you can see these HTML tables,
well,

109
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.066
maybe I should say this every database
software is, I'll read in a CSV.

110
00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:36.721
Yeah, right, I'll read a CSV.

111
00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:39.485
But in HTML were, no,

112
00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:45.162
you have to write table TD,
TD, TD, TD, TD.

113
00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:46.905
You have to write this
really gnarly syntax.

114
00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:50.887
And to get data out, yeah,
you have to copy each one and

115
00:06:50.887 --> 00:06:53.670
paste it into an actual spreadsheet.

116
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.990
It's not super fun.

117
00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.440
So I just made a little thing and
I'm just gonna go to the debug view.

118
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.187
But I made a thing that I can do this and
I can whatever numbers,

119
00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:08.123
I don't know what's a spreadsheet?

120
00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:12.468
[LAUGH] But I can do this, or
maybe I should just do textedit, or

121
00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:15.742
what's the one that said, it doesn't mark?

122
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:17.630
And then I'm just gonna do a new document.

123
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.380
Here we go.

124
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.804
What's the command ship T to
you to get the actual thing?

125
00:07:21.804 --> 00:07:23.330
But I can just copy that.

126
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.041
And then look, I have a CSV right there.

127
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:31.931
And all I'm doing is just wrapping
a table with my functionality,

128
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:35.726
and the JavaScript kinda doesn't exist.

129
00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.703
But then I was,
let's take it a step farther and

130
00:07:38.703 --> 00:07:43.400
maybe you could just download the CSV,
and then I get to open it in numbers.

131
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.672
Yeah, look at that, pretty cool.

132
00:07:47.672 --> 00:07:52.721
I don't know, it's a toy, but
it's just something you could do.

133
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:55.502
And now,
I can just put that on every table I want,

134
00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:59.559
and I don't have to manually build
stuff out over, and over, and over.

135
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:05.004
Your mileage may vary, but I'm just kinda
showing you, you can basically supply this

136
00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:10.015
functionality and then provide an easier
way for somebody to add superpowers.

137
00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:14.143
They didn't have to like query selector
with JQuery or querySelectorAll and

138
00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:16.200
bind something to something.

139
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.650
You just wrap an element, and
you get some superpowers.

140
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.140
So pretty cool.

141
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.794
And then I guess we could go to if you
wanted to look at some of the code,

142
00:08:26.794 --> 00:08:30.511
but, yeah, copy-table, around a table.

143
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.330
And I'm not accepting bug reports.

144
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.360
I know you want a seven column
vertical and nested tables.

145
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.890
I'm not supporting that quite yet in this
CodePen, but it's just kinda interesting.

146
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:52.470
So yeah, even where I coded at I'm just
linking lit off of unpackage, that's fine.

147
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.880
And then I have some styles to get
the thing, copy the clipboard.

148
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.698
I'm just doing that and
then I'm spitting out some

149
00:09:01.698 --> 00:09:06.742
SVGs buttons, and
stuff like that, pretty simple,

150
00:09:06.742 --> 00:09:10.684
a component that adds some superpowers.

151
00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:18.132
Here's what I'm passionate about I have
big opinions about podcast players.

152
00:09:18.132 --> 00:09:20.323
I host podcast.

153
00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:26.400
Your podcast player needs to
have the speed changer, right?

154
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.559
1x, 2x, any 2x fans in the crowd?

155
00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.740
Yeah, no.

156
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.240
Okay, well, good,
thought we're just only normals.

157
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.590
You have to have a speed changer.

158
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.730
And then the other critical thing for a
podcast player is that 32 seconds rewind.

159
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.830
I heard something interesting.

160
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.000
I would to rewind it 30 seconds and

161
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.870
hear a little bit more,
hear that one phrase again.

162
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.573
And so I made here, I'll kinda go,
let me go embiggen this.

163
00:09:57.573 --> 00:10:02.548
So I made a web component, it looks ugly,

164
00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:05.570
but that's on purpose.

165
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.081
But, [LAUGH] you basically pass it
a native audio element with the controls

166
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:11.200
attribute.

167
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.813
And you wrap it in podcast player.

168
00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:16.624
And let's look at it, let's say again,
in the JavaScript fails.

169
00:10:16.624 --> 00:10:18.228
That's the native audio element.

170
00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:22.064
I'm not inspired.

171
00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:25.651
I'm not moved to hit Play.

172
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:29.653
It does have some features now,
like Playback speed that's pretty new one.

173
00:10:29.653 --> 00:10:35.909
It's not doing well inside that I frame
there, but it is something that exists.

174
00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:40.234
So if I can put it in my podcast player,
and

175
00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:44.928
then I can play, pause,
I can jump forward,

176
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:49.142
I can jump back, I can change the speed.

177
00:10:49.142 --> 00:10:50.924
And then it'll keep getting faster.

178
00:10:50.924 --> 00:10:53.660
You probably can't hear that audio, but

179
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.177
it's gonna speed up, and
just like you'd expect for

180
00:10:57.177 --> 00:11:01.810
a podcast player to do is to mute in
case my kids are trying to talk to me.

181
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.053
And then this rangefinder,

182
00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:09.170
just to find where you're going
in the podcast is pretty cool.

183
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:15.644
And then there's even some secret stuff
in here that we've kinda baked into,

184
00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:21.626
maybe not this version, but I have
a version of this over on the podcast,

185
00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:24.790
The Shop Talk Show, podcast player.

186
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.800
And this is it fully styled,
we brought some of our own styling to it.

187
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.438
Yeah, you can just steal web components
and add stuff to them, it's pretty easy.

188
00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:40.022
[LAUGH] Didn't take much and
now it's just working.

189
00:11:40.022 --> 00:11:44.048
And then we have this neat feature here,
you can actually time jump in and

190
00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:47.348
jump to a point in the podcast,
further into the podcasts,

191
00:11:47.348 --> 00:11:49.610
just like you can with a YouTube player.

192
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.170
It gives you a timestamp up here.

193
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.161
That's all based on the pod love spec,

194
00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:58.727
thanks to them who helped
me implement all that.

195
00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:03.850
Yeah, so it's kind of you're
adding superpowers to this.

196
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.253
This is ugly, but

197
00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:10.502
you're adding superpowers to this
first some with minimal code.

198
00:12:10.502 --> 00:12:15.840
And again, I kinda I'm a fan
of how this sort of plays out.
