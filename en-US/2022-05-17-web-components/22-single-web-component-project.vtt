WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.117
Brewery App.

2
00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:07.125
If you traveled to a new town sometimes

3
00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.508
it's nice to go local brewery and

4
00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:17.313
mkdir called demos and I'm gonna cd demos.

5
00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:19.353
Great, nothing in here.

6
00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.963
Okay, let me make that bigger.

7
00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:24.499
There you go.

8
00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:30.935
So we we're gonna use our
first command line tool.

9
00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:35.788
I should point out this whole day,
we have not used a single build tool.

10
00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:38.712
We have been yanking
packages off of cc ends.

11
00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:41.236
We could have done it
in our local computer.

12
00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:45.321
We have not used a single build tool that
we've been authoring web components.

13
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:50.023
And we can build kinda sophisticated
stuff without even touching any

14
00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:52.059
type of tooling whatsoever.

15
00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.836
All the tooling stuff
kinda happens at this end,

16
00:00:55.836 --> 00:01:01.088
this end of the writing, authoring and
even the production stuff is

17
00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:06.175
that whole next level of bundling and
splitting and everything.

18
00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.975
So, when we're here, there's actually,

19
00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:15.277
I think the question came up
maybe inside conversations here.

20
00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:20.876
But just, is there like a create
react app for web components?

21
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:26.046
Something that just kinda does
[LAUGH] shows me how things work and

22
00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:32.662
there is, there's actually a few project
scaffolds like VTAZ1 is pretty good.

23
00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:38.104
But one thing when I was showed
was from this open WC group,

24
00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:41.115
that it's really pretty good.

25
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.708
And I'll just show how it works here.

26
00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.158
I'm not really trying to
build a dependency on a tool.

27
00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:49.833
That's not the goal here, but
I think this provides a really good

28
00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:54.432
sort of leap frog to a few steps
into maybe a more mature project.

29
00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:59.184
And give us inspiration how we might
need to structure our project to achieve

30
00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.455
a production goal.

31
00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:05.685
But npm init open-wc, and
this gonna give you kind of that

32
00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:11.903
little yomen style interview,
[LAUGH] what are you trying to do here?

33
00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:16.746
So we're gonna scaffold a new project and
I'm actually going to pause here or

34
00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:20.633
say you should pause you get
an application or web component.

35
00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.951
We're gonna do application.

36
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:26.410
But I'm gonna show you the web
component stuff, just so

37
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.332
we can vibe out what that does.

38
00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:33.000
And then, I'll switch back here and I'll
redo it and spit out an application, okay?

39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.360
So what's cool is now it asks you,
what do you want to add?

40
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.480
Do you wanna add Linton?

41
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.529
Heck yeah, I do.

42
00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.861
Do you wanna add testing?

43
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.070
You bet, I do.
Do I want a whole entire storybook?

44
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.434
Sure, why not, it's free.

45
00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.253
[LAUGH] Would you like to use TypeScript?

46
00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:52.368
No, [LAUGH] what is the name
of your web component?

47
00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:55.599
I have been calling
a custom alert all day.

48
00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.537
And then it gives you a kind of a scaffold
of what it's going to spit out and you can

49
00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:05.510
kind of see we get a storybook, we get
some VS code extension recommendations.

50
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.296
We get a in that when you open VS code,
it's gonna say hey, do you want to install

51
00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:14.310
the probably lit plugin is basically
what it's going to install.

52
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.042
Or if you're using prettier or don't
have prettier or something else to say,

53
00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:23.791
do you want prettier, do you want just
any kind of test runner format or stuff.

54
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:26.684
And this is gonna create
a web component for us, and

55
00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:29.926
it's gonna create a story
which is what storybook uses.

56
00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:33.572
An this is gonna create a test,
custom alert test, and

57
00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:37.714
that's actually the part I wanna
show you cuz it blew my mind.

58
00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:42.515
And then a custom-alert.js,
I think that's just the the app

59
00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:46.601
quote-unquote, that's gonna call this,
right?

60
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:51.764
And then an index probably calls
the customer that calls that what.

61
00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:55.137
And then a dev server and
a test runner, yes?

62
00:03:55.137 --> 00:04:00.071
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to do this if you wanna
do a few components or start a library?

63
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:03.579
Could you go through the same thing or
is this really for just,

64
00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.802
I wanna offer this one

65
00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:05.516
&gt;&gt; This-
&gt;&gt; Or whatever

66
00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.071
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one is like one, and I was

67
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:13.451
kind of like I wish it could do multiple
and maybe I'll like work on PR in that.

68
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.396
And they have this upgrade concept and

69
00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:24.806
I found that didn't really work at
the time I was kinda exploring this.

70
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.053
But you could spit out two projects and
then manual merge or

71
00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:31.241
something like that it wouldn't
be the end of the world.

72
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:36.636
Because in theory we're making Legos,
they're all isolated, encapsulated,

73
00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:41.422
reusable so we can maybe copy-paste
that stuff in pretty efficiently.

74
00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:44.640
So okay, we're gonna write to disk and

75
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.685
then we're going to install with NPM and
it may take some time to install,

76
00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:55.478
but through the power of technology,
it'll go quickly.

77
00:04:55.478 --> 00:05:00.596
But yeah, my experience with,
I wish this could just like okay,

78
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:06.646
new component, okay, new component,
okay, cuz that would be how I use it,

79
00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:10.394
just rapid fire component generation,
okay?

80
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:14.453
Al lright, so
then I'm going to follow what it says.

81
00:05:14.453 --> 00:05:20.203
Custom-alert, and then I'm going
to actually open it in code.

82
00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:24.439
Yes, I trust the authors.

83
00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.200
All right here we go.

84
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.902
[LAUGH] Always trust strangers.
All right, here we go,

85
00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:30.307
we'll make that a little bigger.

86
00:05:30.307 --> 00:05:34.660
And then npm run dev,
I think is what it said or

87
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.568
what did it tell me to do, npm run start.

88
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.379
There we go, npm start.

89
00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.000
Okay, so now I have a demo, right?

90
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.151
Fired up over here.

91
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:52.576
Okay, cool, Hello World Nr.5

92
00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:56.650
increment number 10.

93
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.146
Okay, cool,
it has a built us a custom element.

94
00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:04.759
And if you look in here, custom alert.

95
00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.923
So this is sort of just our element,

96
00:06:07.923 --> 00:06:13.621
I could copy paste all the code we
wrote today and plop it in here.

97
00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:15.992
This is totally something I could do.

98
00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.806
It's basically the component
we just wrote.

99
00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:22.060
But what I wanted to show you in the test,
right?

100
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.567
Actually comes with some cool tests.

101
00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:29.926
That's a problem for me,
when I create something I'm not like,

102
00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:34.223
yeah, I'm just itching to
set up the tests on that.

103
00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:36.753
So it's fun to have
something like pre-mades.

104
00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:42.440
And kind of, even if they're there, I can
I change the component and then break it.

105
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.440
And then when the browser turns red,
I get upset, so

106
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.655
emotionally disturbed, so I try to fix it.

107
00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:58.413
But one cool test that it runs is
it passes the accessibility audit.

108
00:06:58.413 --> 00:07:02.615
So it will actually mount your
fixture of your HTML component,

109
00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:06.357
and then it'll expect the shadow
DOM to be accessible.

110
00:07:06.357 --> 00:07:11.968
So if you do anything, if you just have
this test, awesome, and this is a feature,

111
00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:16.800
I think of chi, and so it's built on
this thing called web test runner.

112
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.213
I can show you
the package.json real quick.

113
00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:26.656
But, yeah, so web dev server, web dev
server storybook, web test runner and

114
00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:31.744
web test runner is just I think
a wrapper around play, right?

115
00:07:31.744 --> 00:07:34.855
And then I think it uses Chi Syntax or

116
00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:39.844
runs Chi tests and stuff like that and
maybe Jasmine too.

117
00:07:39.844 --> 00:07:44.114
Now, I'm just making up tea names and
[LAUGH] feeling insecure.

118
00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:49.225
But Mocha Chi, but it will,
anyway, I thought that was cool,

119
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:54.145
cuz I don't do enough accessibility
testing in my life, and

120
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:56.665
here it is right out of the box.

121
00:07:56.665 --> 00:08:00.471
And anyway, this is just for
your inspiration.

122
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:01.480
You can like look at it,

123
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.159
there's another cool thing in
here custom element manifest.

124
00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:07.580
That's what this custom-element.json is.

125
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.159
It's a small thing, but
it's kind of like a registry for

126
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:13.888
your custom element that you then can use
to build story books and stuff like that.

127
00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:17.087
It's all cool, but
it's probably in the advanced talk.

128
00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:22.748
And so let's clear this and then we're
gonna go back to our demos directory,

129
00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:26.243
and then we're going to build our app,
right?

130
00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:31.850
And then again, this is just sort
of like to leapfrog us into a few,

131
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.311
no, I messed up.

132
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.817
Okay, we're gonna to leapfrog into this.

133
00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:37.964
We're gonna do a new project.

134
00:08:37.964 --> 00:08:40.386
We're gonna do a whole application,
we're gonna do linting.

135
00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:44.458
We're gonna do testing, we're gonna do
demoing, we're gonna do building, and

136
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.684
that's kind of the feature we want, right?

137
00:08:46.684 --> 00:08:51.050
We wanna see what this looks
like if we're going to and

138
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.680
I'm gonna call it brewery app.

139
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.889
We wanna see what this
looks like in production.

140
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:59.043
I'm gonna call it brewery app and
then it's gonna make me a brewery app and

141
00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:01.599
then it's gonna say do
you wanna write this?

142
00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:04.179
Yes, and I'm gonna npm install.

143
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:06.943
And it's gonna go out and

144
00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:11.822
fetch the Internet to
put it on my computer.
