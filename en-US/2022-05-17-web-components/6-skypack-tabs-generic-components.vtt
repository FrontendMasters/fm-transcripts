00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.742
Pretty cool, I'm using Skypack,
I don't know if you've used Skypack.

2
00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:11.305
But you can just go to Skypack and
look for skypack.dev.

3
00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:15.809
You can look for whatever package
you want, somebody named a package,

4
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.664
I don't know, like,
&gt;&gt; Gulp-babel is the one I had to look up.

5
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:23.648
&gt;&gt; Gulp-babel?

6
00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:24.372
&gt;&gt; Yep.

7
00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:28.895
&gt;&gt; Okay, bingo, babel, yeah.

8
00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:33.626
So you can get gulp-babel here and
you could just import it into your

9
00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:39.027
JavaScript as a module right here, and
it tries to modulefy whatever it can.

10
00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:43.111
I think that's sort of a tough science
with all this legacy-required code.

11
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:48.210
But if you're writing a Node app,
you could kind of require it from the CDN.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.490
Again, your banking software
probably can't just import it

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.555
from [LAUGH] an untrusted CDN.

14
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:59.277
But I tell you what, it's really great for
prototyping out an idea

15
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:04.185
very quickly to see if it's something
you wanna even get started on.

16
00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:07.863
So, a pretty awesome way to do it.

17
00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:10.508
So, details-utils.

18
00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:14.647
I kinda just found it, or
came out I think this year, so,

19
00:01:14.647 --> 00:01:18.984
pretty cool and I plan on using
it kinda more going forward.

20
00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:21.973
I know what you're saying,
we just added some accessibility features.

21
00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:25.881
Wouldn't it be great to have
a bundle of premade accessible

22
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:30.335
components that I could style on my
own without having to install all

23
00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.790
of god's earth just to make
some tabs on my website?

24
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.016
Yeah, that would be cool,
that's the goal, that's the utopia,

25
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.947
we just have things,
[LAUGH] I just wanna have things.

26
00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:51.220
Generic-components by Pascal Schilp is
a really cool library I came across,

27
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.031
and it's maybe one of my favorite
kind of collection of Web Components.

28
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:01.386
This isn't really a design system,

29
00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:06.727
it's just a collection, a few components.

30
00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:12.976
And it has kind of the standards,
the hits, it has accordion, it looks ugly.

31
00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:18.712
But you can bring your own style to it,
if you're doing whatever,

32
00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:25.386
tailwind or whatever, and the code here,
that's maybe super hard to read.

33
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:32.481
Let's go over to my example cuz we
can read this code, for my tabs.

34
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.093
The code here is pretty awesome,
generic-tabs,

35
00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.447
we'll give a label to the group.

36
00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:42.489
That sort of depends on your situation,
but

37
00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.061
we have a button and
we're gonna slot that into the tab slot,

38
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:52.333
that's named tabs, right, or named slots.

39
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:57.189
Again, I don't use this feature that much
but in tabs, you have buttons and panels,

40
00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.156
right, you have tabs and panels.

41
00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:05.330
And so he has two slots,
an about and a contact.

42
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.803
And then you have a panel and
then you have another panel,

43
00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:14.918
and you can slot stuff
into the right slot.

44
00:03:14.918 --> 00:03:19.803
And then you get features like,
you get a tabs control with

45
00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:24.600
just writing HTML basically,
writing normalish HTML.

46
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.512
I even committed like a patch to this,

47
00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:37.778
what if you didn't want buttons?

48
00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:40.478
Because, let's say that JavaScript
fails or whatever again,

49
00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:42.329
we're talking progressive enhancement.

50
00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.705
Or let's say I wanted to
turn off tabs at some point.

51
00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:47.931
What if you wanted
progressive enhancement?

52
00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:53.879
Well, you could just have normal content,
[SOUND] and

53
00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.499
then it just [SOUND] rolls up
into some kind of tab structure.

54
00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.439
Interesting to think about, and

55
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.065
that's kind of an idea me and
a group of people,

56
00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:14.439
called the Tab Vendors, whatever.

57
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.438
The Tab Vendors were a part of Open UI,

58
00:04:19.438 --> 00:04:23.824
open-ui, were part of Open UI.

59
00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:27.859
And Open UI is a group of,
let's call them component enthusiast,

60
00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:29.742
it's just a community group.

61
00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:34.813
We can't actually propose anything for
legal reasons,

62
00:04:34.813 --> 00:04:40.094
but we're a group of component
enthusiast from browsers,

63
00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:45.058
from spec authors,
from ARIA accessibility experts,

64
00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:49.829
CSS spec writers, and
normal podcast hosts like me.

65
00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.264
We all come together, and
we talk about components.

66
00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:56.994
And we're kind of using this
this big component matrix,

67
00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:00.890
we surveyed something like
18 different design system.

68
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.353
And try to find the most common
components across design systems.

69
00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:08.849
Well, if you look at,
number five is tabs, right?

70
00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.217
So tabs is one of the fifth most
common element behind button and

71
00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:21.482
menu and tooltip and a checkbox,
fifth most common control.

72
00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:23.350
So we've been experimenting,

73
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.300
over here in spicy-sections,
we're going to spicy-sections.

74
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.526
And we sort of realized,
if you have tabs and

75
00:05:32.526 --> 00:05:40.024
you have that well structured content,
this is just the idea.

76
00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:44.357
This isn't something coming out tomorrow,
but if you have that well structured

77
00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:47.875
content, you can make tabs, but
you know what else you can make?

78
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:53.184
An accordion, you can make a vertical
tabs, you could make an accordion where

79
00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:58.184
only one panel shows at a time or
they can all open close, stuff like that.

80
00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:02.810
Maybe, I don't know, maybe even
a carousel, does that have a tabs?

81
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.387
Well, we're looking into it,
we're trying to figure this out and

82
00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.779
just see what is going on.

83
00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:14.684
Just see if there's a way to a express
control that fits with everything.

84
00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:17.924
And so here's sort of the canonical demo,

85
00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:23.236
we'll start in the mobile viewport,
you have an accordion, right?

86
00:06:23.236 --> 00:06:29.113
And then in the medium viewport,
you're gonna get normal content.

87
00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:32.991
Just like that weird tablet viewport
where you don't know what to

88
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.609
do where an accordion
is too much collapse.

89
00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:40.522
And you don't have enough room for
tabs or, it's a weird place for

90
00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:44.661
websites, it's like the teenage years for
websites.

91
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:52.020
And then you go to all the way out and
then it turns into a tabs control.

92
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.539
And so this is just an idea
we've been experimenting with.

93
00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.553
There's a few other demos
that I could show you.

94
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:04.542
But it's just kind of an idea we're
experimenting with in kinda seeing if this

95
00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:09.092
is maybe a pathway forward for
tabs like element native in the browser.

96
00:07:09.092 --> 00:07:11.995
So, kinda cool, don't know,

97
00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:17.485
it may rebrand to panel set soon,
so keep an eye out for that.

98
00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:19.842
Not sure if that's the official name, but

99
00:07:19.842 --> 00:07:24.174
that's just sort of something we've kind
of been riffing on in terms of this.

100
00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:26.275
Yes, we have a question.

101
00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:31.892
&gt;&gt; On Shop Talk, you and
Chris mentioned doing a circular menu,

102
00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:34.583
was that tabs as well?

103
00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.484
&gt;&gt; Like a radio?

104
00:07:36.484 --> 00:07:37.838
Yeah, that would be tabs.

105
00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:44.350
I mean, if you think about video
games,often have these radial menus,

106
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.593
you go into the menu and you,
go to grenades or something.

107
00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:52.656
[LAUGH] I don't know, or
say this voice line or something,

108
00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:54.667
there's these kind of radial menus.

109
00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:58.550
And then you'd choose an option and
then it drills you down or

110
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.755
shows you content from within that option,
are those just tabs?

111
00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:09.150
The old Xbox 360 UI that had these like
vertical blades, [LAUGH] is that tabs?

112
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.755
It might be tabs, and so
I think as we've kind of

113
00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:17.797
investigated tabs, it's a long story.

114
00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:23.439
But there may be a point where you
graduate from the standard tabs,

115
00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:26.978
and you have to make your own custom tabs.

116
00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:31.950
I think my favorite one was where
one of the tabs was a phone number.

117
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.582
And you could click it and call somebody's
grandma or something like that.

118
00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:38.089
I think it was like in Salesforce or
something, so

119
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.893
you could call somebody from a tab.

120
00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:45.078
That's probably not making it into
the HTML, [LAUGH] finals back,

121
00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:50.180
but it's interesting to think about
what is a tab and what is not.

122
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.795
And then even we've gotten some feedback,

123
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:59.080
maybe there's tabs for a whole page,
for a whole application.

124
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.012
And maybe there's tabs for inside the
content, maybe those need to be different

125
00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:07.796
tabs from an accessibility in
aural announcing standpoint.

126
00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:12.262
So, lots to think about,
again the stuff's slow, doesn't move fast,

127
00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:13.928
but it's fun to play with.

128
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:19.031
And actually the spicy-sections
has been a really great tool for

129
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:23.407
discussing web standards or
potential web standards.

130
00:09:23.407 --> 00:09:28.179
Just because it's a prototype,
and everyone's probably

131
00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:32.761
had that experience at work
where you just show the code or

132
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:37.924
show it living in code and
suddenly people's opinions change.

133
00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:42.061
Some people don't react until you see
it and then they're like, wait, wait,

134
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:43.185
we have to stop this.

135
00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:48.991
Or they're like, wait, this is good, this
is bad, let's do this, let's tweak this.

136
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:51.700
And so,
it's been a really good talking point, and

137
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.788
that was all kinda started
through generic-components.

138
00:09:54.788 --> 00:10:01.321
Which I should mention, they're all coded
to this WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices,

139
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:04.145
sort of, I guess, tutorial guide.

140
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:09.218
You wouldn't know this but
[LAUGH] this page on the Internet is

141
00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:14.987
basically the the holy grail for
telling you how to code something and

142
00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:19.662
what the expectations are of that unit or
a menu button,

143
00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:23.861
radio group, what it is,
what it isn't, tabs.

144
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:26.742
This page should be at
the front of the Internet,

145
00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:30.414
[LAUGH] the front of the guidebook
you get when you get a new job.

146
00:10:30.414 --> 00:10:35.071
But yeah, so
that's a very handy little library.

147
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.207
Again, your mileage may vary,
maybe you want this, maybe you don't, but

148
00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:39.490
this is just a starting point.
