1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395
We are on to React capabilities.

2
00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:07.169
I was struggling with section names,
so I just made that up and

3
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.360
having to come up with a better one.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.117
So capabilities, which is different
than Core React Concepts.

5
00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:14.731
Naming is hard, [LAUGH].

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.821
Anyway, we're talking about React Router.

7
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:24.058
React Router keeps me coming back here and
teaching my class, so

8
00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:25.870
thank you to React Router.

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.111
They have a habit of drastically
changing between versions.

10
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:35.001
So if I have one warning about
React Router, it's that there's a really

11
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.969
good shot that version 7 is gonna
require a big rewrite, and version 8,

12
00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.240
and version 9, cuz I've done it three or
four times already.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.689
That's meant as in mild
maybe suggestion to them to

14
00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:53.455
not have to change it
dramatically every single time.

15
00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:57.397
But again, it keeps me coming back and
teaching this course, so

16
00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.080
by all means keep doing it.

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.809
That's mostly in jest,
it is true that they've changed a bunch.

18
00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.312
But the thing that I applaud them for
doing versus other libraries,

19
00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.707
when they figure out something
that's better, they just do it.

20
00:01:10.707 --> 00:01:14.771
They change everything and they make
everyone come along for the ride.

21
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.580
Lots of other frameworks,
notoriously someone like Ember,

22
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.903
they just keep all the cruft around
forever, which is better probably

23
00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:26.954
somewhere in the middle if we're
being honest, but here we are.

24
00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:31.544
One thing that they have done really well
is they provide detailed upgrade guides in

25
00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:36.136
where possible, they try and provide some
backwards compatibility or shimming or

26
00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.201
things like that.

27
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.127
So give them lots of credit for that.

28
00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:42.747
So in previous versions of this class,

29
00:01:42.747 --> 00:01:44.817
I've taught previous
versions of React Router.

30
00:01:44.817 --> 00:01:51.586
So if you need that, by all means go do
that, this is React Router version 6.

31
00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:55.874
I have taught Reach Router before,
which is written by Ryan Florence,

32
00:01:55.874 --> 00:02:00.316
which is half of the React Router team,
so I have also taught that before.

33
00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:02.847
React Router is made by the same
people that make Remix, right?

34
00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:07.605
Remix is like a up and coming,
very hot framework for

35
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:12.049
server side rendering and
generation of React.

36
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.593
It's kind of a competitor to things
like Gatsby and Next JS, it's very cool.

37
00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:22.473
There's a course from Kent C Dodds's
on Frontend Masters about Remix,

38
00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:25.918
so if that's your jam,
check out Kent's course.

39
00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:30.981
But today, we're just talking about
React Router, which is part of Remix.

40
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:32.941
It's like the top part of Remix,

41
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.582
there's lower level of Remix
that we're not talking about.

42
00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:39.485
Okay, it's by far the most
popular client side Router.

43
00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:43.959
There's a couple other ones
that are more minimalistic, and

44
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.498
honestly, less featureful
than React Router.

45
00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:49.352
But to be totally frank with you,
React Router is so

46
00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:50.872
much more popular than everything else.

47
00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:54.086
It would be irresponsible for
me to talk about anything else.

48
00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:56.994
So, why do we need a Router?

49
00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.408
This is going to be a single page
application that has two routes,

50
00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:03.573
the search page and the details page,
as you might imagine,

51
00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:05.016
there could be 30 pages.

52
00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:08.432
We're just gonna do two today, but
you could totally have a lot of pages.

53
00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:10.074
So let's go make a details page,

54
00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:13.018
I'm just gonna copy this
directly cuz it's really short.

55
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.740
New page, Details.JSX, paste, save.

56
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.997
This is going to be our new
page called Details, and

57
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:30.170
we wanna make this App have two pages.

58
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.560
So we're gonna need an external
library React Router dom specifically.

59
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.976
So I'm gonna say, npm install,

60
00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:44.339
no capital D because this is a production

61
00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:51.928
dependency, react-router-dash-dom@6.4.1

62
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:01.534
Okay, I'm gonna run my server again.

63
00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:09.804
Great, so
now I have React Router dom available,

64
00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:14.173
and I want you to go to your App.jsx file.

65
00:04:14.173 --> 00:04:18.731
Up here at the top,
I want you to import {BrowserRouter},

66
00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.082
Routes and Route.

67
00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:27.499
So Routes plural and Route singular.

68
00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:39.321
Okay, delete SearchParams there,

69
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.602
we're gonna wrap this whole
thing in BrowserRouter.

70
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.994
And whatever you wrap it in BrowserRouter
is where BrowserRouter is going to be

71
00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.263
available for use.

72
00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:00.348
It's conceivable that you could have
different Routers in different parts

73
00:05:00.348 --> 00:05:00.884
of the page.

74
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:04.117
Let's say you have
a contextual side nav that

75
00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:07.361
navigated independently of your main page.

76
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:11.806
It would make sense that you
would have two different

77
00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:15.253
BrowserRouters kind of handling that.

78
00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:16.585
I've never done it, but
it's in theory possible.

79
00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:24.088
Okay, inside of this, we're going to have,
I got to get rid of the div here.

80
00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:27.294
Interesting, okay, well, dump the div.

81
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:35.129
We're gonna have this Routes component,
and

82
00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.639
then we're gonna have
two Routes inside of it.

83
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.391
Route path="/details/:id",

84
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:52.605
and element =, Details.

85
00:05:56.807 --> 00:06:02.867
And then you're gonna have a Route,
and then I have to close that.

86
00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:08.030
Route path="/" and element

87
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:15.269
= SearchParams, Like that.

88
00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.453
What did I mess up here?

89
00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:24.948
I need that, okay.

90
00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:29.955
And then import details at the top.

91
00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:34.255
Import Details from "./Details".

92
00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:38.536
Okay, now we're good.

93
00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:42.929
So just to make sure that
I'm not out of my mind here.

94
00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:47.589
Go back to your page, where's my Adopt Me?

95
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:48.655
Now for refresher,

96
00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:52.241
if you remember we made this a link
which looks like I messed that up.

97
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:56.180
Why did I mess it up?

98
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.887
You know why?

99
00:06:56.887 --> 00:06:59.540
I bet you in Results,
we didn't pass it in, did we?

100
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.547
No, so here in Results,

101
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:07.287
make sure you say, id=[pet.id).

102
00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:13.254
So my issue that I was
seeing here is that I

103
00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:17.896
was noticing that the id
was undefined in the Route.

104
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:21.750
So you have to pass that in
the Results page, the pet id,

105
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.094
then that's gonna be used here for
the href to go to the Details page, right?

106
00:07:28.817 --> 00:07:30.385
So now, if I click on Luna,

107
00:07:30.385 --> 00:07:33.678
will take me to the Details
page where it says hi, right?

108
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:40.602
Then I can go back and it still works.

109
00:07:40.602 --> 00:07:45.571
So a few things here, I'm just gonna
give you some disclaimers about

110
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:49.010
what's changed recently
about React Router.

111
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:54.235
First of all, if you remember we
used to have a switch component,

112
00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:58.515
which would only render at most,
one Route at a time.

113
00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:03.107
And it's when an order of which
one was the most important one,

114
00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:06.670
blah, blah, blah, that's all gone, right?

115
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.518
And now has this scoring mechanism,
it only renders one Route at a time.

116
00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:16.664
So it used to be that, if I went to
the / page, because technically both of

117
00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:21.729
these would match the /, it would
render both of those at the same time.

118
00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:23.411
That's weird, right?

119
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:26.388
Well, you wouldn't expect that
they fixed a bunch of that stuff.

120
00:08:26.388 --> 00:08:30.528
And then the other thing that they
used to do, which they don't do now,

121
00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:35.025
it used to have like, Details would be
a child inside of the Route component.

122
00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:39.320
They don't do that anymore,
you now use this element prop.

123
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.410
If none of that means anything to you,
then great, just learn this.

124
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.641
I'm just telling you what happened
between React version 5 and version 6.

125
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.606
The path here, so we have this :id,
what is that there for?

126
00:08:55.606 --> 00:08:57.783
That means that this is a variable.

127
00:08:57.783 --> 00:09:02.610
So if I click here on Bunnahabhain, notice
that there's two here, this is the id.

128
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.440
So the id is the variable that
you're coming out of your path.

129
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.462
So now I can access this id
inside of my Details page.

130
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.703
So that's what that is for.

131
00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.560
I think that's mostly it.

132
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.580
We're using the BrowserRouter,
there are a couple other kind of Routers.

133
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.055
There is HashRouter, so HashRouter,

134
00:09:22.055 --> 00:09:26.180
I think we can probably just see
really quick if that's helpful.

135
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.070
Well, yeah, HashRouter.

136
00:09:34.247 --> 00:09:37.339
Have you ever seen routing though,

137
00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:42.815
instead of having details like this,
it'll have the # here.

138
00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:47.360
So it's like it's happening
on the end of the # there.

139
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.841
That's what HashRouter is for.

140
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.045
In general if you can avoid it
doing it that way, please do,

141
00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:56.160
you're gonna end up with way better SEO
and a bunch of other stuff like that.

142
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.310
The only reason that you would
ever want to do it that way is,

143
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.657
let's say you're on Django, and your
Django server is sort of very inflexible,

144
00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:05.555
what kind of routes that it can add?

145
00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:09.448
Where you can't go and add BrowserRoutes
for every single variation of that and

146
00:10:09.448 --> 00:10:11.713
your server wouldn't be
able to handle that,

147
00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:14.230
in which case HashRouter
would save the day there.

148
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.185
Because then you can define one route,
it's like, all right, here's my single

149
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:21.471
page application, everything
goes to this route, that's fine.

150
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:22.990
If you can avoid that, please avoid it.

151
00:10:26.464 --> 00:10:30.199
We'll see static router later, that's for

152
00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:36.107
server side rendering of React apps and
Node, so we'll do that later.

153
00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:38.787
This link is working for
our Details page, right?

154
00:10:38.787 --> 00:10:43.351
So if I click on Bunnahabhain,
it takes me to the correct link.

155
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:48.368
However, a better way of
doing this instead of doing,

156
00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.993
let's go back to Pet.jsx.

157
00:10:50.993 --> 00:10:55.386
Instead of doing an a here,

158
00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:59.970
it's better if we do const or

159
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:07.048
import link from react-router-dom, y.

160
00:11:07.048 --> 00:11:10.740
Whenever I click this, it's actually
gonna do a full refresh of the page.

161
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.750
Not great,
it'd be better if the server side, sorry,

162
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.768
the BrowserRouter could just handle it.

163
00:11:16.768 --> 00:11:19.337
Whereas React Router could
capture the event and

164
00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:22.792
then route without forcing the user
to totally refresh the page.

165
00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:25.088
It's just gonna be slower,
it's gonna take longer.

166
00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:29.650
React has to read bootstrap that can
be expensive on a low end device.

167
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.547
So if I do Link instead of a,
it'll still be

168
00:11:34.547 --> 00:11:40.140
a link tag,
I can still give it a class name.

169
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.820
Instead of giving it an href,
you give it a 2 like that.

170
00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:48.287
And now it's not gonna
be a full page refresh,

171
00:11:48.287 --> 00:11:52.211
it captures it all on the client side,
works way better.

172
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.127
A plus, everything works.

173
00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:02.779
The other big shout out I'm gonna
give to React Router why I think it's

174
00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:07.138
superior to other routers,
it's very accessibility focused.

175
00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:10.209
They take great care in getting
the accessibility right,

176
00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.780
which is something I deeply appreciate
about it because routing and

177
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.300
accessibility are hard
when they go together.
