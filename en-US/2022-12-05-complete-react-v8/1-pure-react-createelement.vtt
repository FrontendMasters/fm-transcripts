WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.855
So click on pure React here and we're
just gonna start by writing just React.

2
00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:11.288
There's gonna be no bill tool between us,
it's just going to be script tags and

3
00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:14.870
HTML, that's really all
we're gonna do up front.

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.341
So I'm just gonna create
this on my desktop.

5
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:20.594
I'm gonna create a new folder,

6
00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.776
I'm gonna call it Adopt Me which
is the name of the project.

7
00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.571
We're gonna be writing a pet adoption app,
it's adorable.

8
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:33.110
Drag down the VS code and you can see
here I just have my Adopt Me folder here.

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.685
And then I'm gonna create a file and
set that called source which is where

10
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:42.417
our SRC which is where I'm gonna put
all of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

11
00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:47.137
Create a file inside of the source
directory call that index.HTML.

12
00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:52.193
And then inside of the index.HTML
we're going to put some basic HTML.

13
00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:55.637
So in VS code here we can
use a thing called Emmet,

14
00:00:55.637 --> 00:01:00.091
this is available in Sublime and
TextMate and as well.

15
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:07.551
But if you put HTML5 and then you hit tab
you'll get this bare bones set of HTML.

16
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:11.168
You can get rid of this I
equals edge equivalents cuz

17
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:14.291
that doesn't really do anything anymore.

18
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:19.977
And then instead of calling this
document I'm gonna call it Adopt Me and

19
00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:23.502
this is version eight of the course, okay?

20
00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:29.442
Here in the body we're gonna put
a div with the ID equal to root and

21
00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:34.286
I'm gonna put something in
here like not rendered.

22
00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:38.133
Because if we see this not rendered
we know that our React App for

23
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.757
whatever reason didn't render, right?

24
00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:42.987
And we'll replace this text here, okay?

25
00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:47.153
And then here we're gonna put two script
tags, I'm just gonna copy this from my

26
00:01:47.153 --> 00:01:50.839
notes here because it's long enough
that I always get the URLs wrong.

27
00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:55.730
So I'm gonna copy paste this to that.

28
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.860
So reactd18.2und, the universal module so

29
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.014
this is gonna make react universally
available, as a global variable.

30
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.471
This is not how we're gonna
finish your app, this is just so

31
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:09.662
we can get started, right?

32
00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:13.190
We're gonna grab React and React DOM.

33
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.814
React is the API part of the library and

34
00:02:15.814 --> 00:02:19.997
React DOM is the actual what's
going to render it to the DOM.

35
00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:23.075
The reason why they split this out
is because there's React Native,

36
00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.198
there's React 360.

37
00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:27.246
There's a bunch of different renderers for
React and

38
00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.752
React is like the developer
surface area and

39
00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:34.306
then React DOM is what's actually doing
the part that talks to the DOM, right?

40
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:38.512
So the React DOM is actually
the much larger part of the library.

41
00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:40.854
React itself is much smaller and

42
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:45.894
this is shared amongst React Native and
all these other ones, okay?

43
00:02:45.894 --> 00:02:50.820
And then after these two script tags
I want you to put a script tag here.

44
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.406
And we are gonna write
JavaScript directly here.

45
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.320
Okay, so I want you to come
back over to your browser.

46
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.518
We're just gonna Command+O or

47
00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:12.563
Ctrl+O or file open, right?

48
00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:18.045
Open file and I put this on my desktop.

49
00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:24.076
Adopt Me, source, index, and HTML.

50
00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:25.766
And so you gonna see here.

51
00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:33.598
All right, I did this and
I didn't save that.

52
00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:34.746
Okay, now, save it, refresh it.

53
00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:36.860
You can see here it says not rendered.

54
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.260
You can look here in my network tab and
I have, let see if I can make that

55
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.848
a little bit bigger, index and
then you can see react.development and

56
00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:52.155
react.DOM development
are both coming in just fine.

57
00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:58.206
And then here in my console you can
see that I have React available and

58
00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:01.829
I have ReactDOM available right there.

59
00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.294
This is always my favorite
thing right here.

60
00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:09.121
Secret internals do not use or
you will be fired.

61
00:04:10.886 --> 00:04:12.947
It's been there for years now.

62
00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:16.750
And obviously react was
written by Facebook, right?

63
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.634
And so they put some internal things in
there so they can track certain things or

64
00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.192
test different things.

65
00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:26.940
And there's always a big temptation
to mess around with the internals and

66
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.052
apparently they're just very, very
upfront to the other Facebook employees,

67
00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:33.964
don't mess with this or
it's gonna break soon, right?

68
00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:38.082
I've been told it's a joke, you won't
be fired but your stuff will break.

69
00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:41.170
And then you can see our
beautiful not rendered there.

70
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.578
So pretty standard HTML5 document, writing
a root div, we have two script tags and

71
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:50.098
the last script tag is where
we're gonna put our code.

72
00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:53.445
We're gonna put a little bit of code in
there and then eventually we're just gonna

73
00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:56.276
move it into another file and
let's go grab our styles really quick.

74
00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:57.875
So not a CSS course,

75
00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:03.914
there's lots of great CSS resources
on Frontend Masters, this ain't it.

76
00:05:03.914 --> 00:05:09.196
So I want you to just go click,
I have a link here in this blue box where

77
00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:14.573
it says click here, click that and
as command A, command C, copy and

78
00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:20.559
paste everything in this file into
another file in here called style.CSS.

79
00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.560
Paste, save,
I do not assert that this is good CSS or

80
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.929
that anything you should copy or even
look at, please just close the file and

81
00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:30.545
pretend that it's not
there anymore [LAUGH].

82
00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:32.080
Now, I mean it's fine.

83
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.864
But yeah, it's not a CSS course.

84
00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:38.822
If you follow all of my class names and

85
00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:43.223
stuff like that you will get
all of your style for free.

86
00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:46.505
Again, we don't wanna write CSS
in the course of this class.

87
00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:51.477
So up here in your head please

88
00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:56.871
put a link to ./style.CSS.

89
00:05:56.871 --> 00:06:00.213
And this I meant to put
inside the source directory.

90
00:06:00.213 --> 00:06:01.592
Yeah, there you go.

91
00:06:01.592 --> 00:06:05.303
So index, HTML, and style CSS are both
inside of the source directory.

92
00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:11.171
So now if we refresh the page you can see
we have our beautiful little background.

93
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:19.691
Yeah, there is some custom art for
this website done by Alice Barton.

94
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:23.331
It's great including our
nice little background.

95
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:23.970
Yeah, and

96
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.459
if you really feel like it I think
there's several available styles here.

97
00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.086
So you have wallpaper B here.

98
00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:32.766
I think if you switch just to wallpaper A,

99
00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:37.913
you can see it's a nice more muted tone or
wallpaper C I think is black and white.

100
00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:42.076
Yeah, so whatever one you feel like.

101
00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:43.042
I might stick with C.

102
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:45.883
No, let's do B because that's actually
the one that's defaulting in there but

103
00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:47.280
you can change it to whatever you want.

104
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.508
So in your script tag let us go write,
what is this like?

105
00:06:53.508 --> 00:06:58.372
Ten lines of code and
we'll have rendered our first React App.

106
00:06:58.372 --> 00:07:02.038
So first thing we're gonna make,
we're gonna make a variable called App.

107
00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:05.270
It's important that it's capitalized,
capital A.

108
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.916
You're always going to
capitalize your components.

109
00:07:09.916 --> 00:07:12.698
I'm gonna make a function here.

110
00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:20.648
And we're going to return
React.createElement.

111
00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:25.372
It's gonna be a div and
then inside of that,

112
00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:28.308
here you can either put no or

113
00:07:28.308 --> 00:07:33.812
you can put empty objects
that's kind of up to you.

114
00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:39.861
I'm gonna put empty object and
then we're gonna do React.createElement.

115
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:45.072
Again, so the same calls that we did
up here but we're gonna put an h1.

116
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:51.215
Again, another empty object and then I'm
gonna put some text here of Adopt Me or

117
00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:52.374
something like that.

118
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.842
Okay, so
now we have this function that returns

119
00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:06.140
the results of whatever
React.createElements does.

120
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.794
So first couple things here.

121
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:15.597
The first thing that we're putting here
is what kind of elements we're putting in

122
00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:16.513
here, right?

123
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:18.245
So this is going to be a div.

124
00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:22.459
As you might imagine if I put a p here,
it's gonna be a p element,

125
00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.970
if I put a X-custom element, right?

126
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.651
If we're doing web components,

127
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.010
it's going to put literally
whatever you put here, right?

128
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.880
I can put something not real and
it's gonna try and do that, right?

129
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.879
In theory I guess you could do this
render XML if you really want it to,

130
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:39.619
please don't.

131
00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.427
But in theory it would work, right?

132
00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:44.180
So we're gonna have a div.

133
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:50.271
And as you can see here we're
doing an h1 down there, right?

134
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:51.517
So that's this.

135
00:08:51.517 --> 00:08:56.031
The null or the empty object here this
is going to be whatever attributes

136
00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:58.297
that you're handing down to this.

137
00:08:58.297 --> 00:09:05.124
So if I wanted to have an ID here of
my ID or something like that, right?

138
00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:08.798
This is gonna be whatever
you put on the HTML element.

139
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:14.139
So you could have a style tag,
you could have a class name, right?

140
00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.730
All those things are valid here.

141
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.592
We're not putting anything so you have
to give it something there, right?

142
00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:23.515
We're giving an empty object but
that could have been no,

143
00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:26.328
both of those essentially
mean the same thing to react.

144
00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:31.967
And then the third thing that you
give it here is the children, right?

145
00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:36.358
So whatever it's going to go inside,
HTML is nested, right?

146
00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:40.441
You have a head tag and
inside of that there's a title tag, right?

147
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:43.418
So whatever you put in here is going to
be whatever goes inside of that issue.

148
00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:47.883
So we're gonna have a div
inside of that div is an h1 and

149
00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:51.486
inside of that h1 is
just raw text Adopt Me.

150
00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:58.592
So that's all createElement does, it's
just printing brand new HTML tags for you.

151
00:09:58.592 --> 00:10:00.807
I mentioned ligatures
earlier in the course.

152
00:10:00.807 --> 00:10:03.875
Some of you might be looking at like,
that's not real.

153
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.256
There's no such thing as
an arrow tag like that, right?

154
00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:10.988
It really is just an equals and
an angle bracket put together and

155
00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:14.930
then my font combines them
into a fat looking arrow.

156
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.822
That is what a ligature does.

157
00:10:16.822 --> 00:10:19.635
There's a bunch of them in here if you
have any questions about what they are be

158
00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:20.381
sure to let me know.

159
00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:24.843
There's double equals,
triple equals, less than or

160
00:10:24.843 --> 00:10:29.409
equal to, greater than or
equal to, things like that.

161
00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:35.670
Though the most part it just helps
you have less cognitive noise.

162
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.500
I think that's the theory in
reality to me it's the same, right?

163
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.242
I just think it's pretty which I like
pretty things so I keep doing it.

164
00:10:46.638 --> 00:10:50.470
Okay, so app is always capitalized.

165
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.748
You always capitalize your components
that's actually not just a good idea it's

166
00:10:54.748 --> 00:10:55.870
actually required.

167
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.640
We'll get into that while we get into
JSX but for now just believe me,

168
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.602
you do need to capitalize app here.

169
00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:07.594
Okay, so now I have a function but
I'm not using it yet.

170
00:11:07.594 --> 00:11:08.573
It's not doing anything, right?

171
00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:12.283
Basically I've created this rubber stamp,
right?

172
00:11:12.283 --> 00:11:15.311
And I have this lovely rubber stamp
that's ready to stamp things but

173
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:16.965
I haven't actually stamped it yet.

174
00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:18.610
All I've done is I've given
you the rubber stamp.

175
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.697
It's like, I have a rubber stamp and
you're like,

176
00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:21.987
what do I do with a rubber stamp?

177
00:11:21.987 --> 00:11:24.328
I need to go use it, right?

178
00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:30.361
I've created a new type of class if you're
familiar with Java or even classes or

179
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:35.101
things like that but I haven't
actually instantiated it anywhere.

180
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:37.918
So let's go stamp something, right?

181
00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:40.445
Let's go make something, okay?

182
00:11:40.445 --> 00:11:46.072
So I'm gonna have const container
equals document.getElementbyId and

183
00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:49.345
we're gonna go grab root up here, right?

184
00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:50.085
This one up here.

185
00:11:53.564 --> 00:11:55.599
Doesn't have to be called root,
you can call it whatever you want.

186
00:11:55.599 --> 00:11:59.364
I think there's just kind of most
people tend to call it root.

187
00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:03.477
Const root equals

188
00:12:03.477 --> 00:12:09.512
ReactDOM.createroot.

189
00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:14.459
And then we're going to
give it the container.

190
00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:20.170
Yes, you can directly put this in
here as well that's totally fine.

191
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.700
It's nice to keep a handle
on container and on root but

192
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.230
that's really up to you
how you choose to do that.

193
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:38.652
And then we're gonna say
root.render(React.createElement) app.

194
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:47.823
All right, so just to make sure that I'm
not saving to you now we should go over it

195
00:12:47.823 --> 00:12:49.380
and what do we expect to see?

196
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.751
We expect to see a div and inside of that
div we're gonna expect to see an h1 and

197
00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:57.395
instead of h1 it would say adopt me but

198
00:12:57.395 --> 00:13:02.048
I think it actually replaces with
an image cuz of the CSS, it does.

199
00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:06.733
But if you inspect the image here
you can see it actually is an h1 and

200
00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:11.432
I just mess with the background
image here which I have as Adopt Me.

201
00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:12.983
Let's talk about createElement.

202
00:13:12.983 --> 00:13:17.103
Notice that we use createElement
again here but we're not giving it

203
00:13:17.103 --> 00:13:21.663
a string like we did here or here but
we're actually giving it a component.

204
00:13:21.663 --> 00:13:23.956
This is kind of like the trick of react.

205
00:13:23.956 --> 00:13:28.137
If you give it text, it's just going to
render that directly as the tag name.

206
00:13:28.137 --> 00:13:33.112
Again, if I did not a div and
I refresh here and I inspect here,

207
00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:37.064
you can see it actually outputs here,
not a div.

208
00:13:37.064 --> 00:13:40.925
So whatever you put in that text there
it's just gonna like, all right,

209
00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:43.916
that's the kind of tag you
wanted I'm just gonna do it.

210
00:13:43.916 --> 00:13:45.958
It doesn't ask you any questions there.

211
00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:51.061
But if you give it a component like this,
like a function that creates more

212
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:54.080
elements, it'll actually go and
render that out, right?

213
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.160
So we're kind of getting at what
the magic of react is, right?

214
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.535
I create components that
are made up of other components,

215
00:14:01.535 --> 00:14:05.280
that are made up of other components, that
are made up of other components, right?

216
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.129
So it's just these, you get these reusable
rubber stamps that then stamp other rubber

217
00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:10.560
stamps which sounds awesome.

218
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.942
Now that I think about it
I have a startup idea.

219
00:14:12.942 --> 00:14:17.311
I'm just kidding, that sounds like a dumb
idea but that's the idea here is we now

220
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:20.922
have these really cool, useful,
reusable components, right?

221
00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:25.226
You can make a really fancy input and then
you can make a fancy form that is made

222
00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:30.017
up of fancy inputs and then you can have a
page that's made up of fancy forms, right?

223
00:14:30.017 --> 00:14:34.168
You can see that it's just expands bigger
and bigger and you get these better bigger

224
00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:38.160
macro components that are made
up of micro components, right?

225
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.830
That's the idea.

226
00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:44.810
You might wonder like, what happened
to the other two things here?

227
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.750
Well, these other two things are optional.

228
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.580
The attributes and the children.

229
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.675
This has no children, it has no attributes
so I don't have to put anything but

230
00:14:55.675 --> 00:14:58.100
you absolutely can give
it an empty object.

231
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.101
And I don't know, null here or
something like that.

232
00:15:03.846 --> 00:15:06.728
You can it just you don't need to, right?

233
00:15:06.728 --> 00:15:08.609
So if I refresh this,

234
00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:14.052
has no attributes being passed into it and
it has no children.

235
00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:18.697
You don't really need to know most of
this stuff is like the arity of how this

236
00:15:18.697 --> 00:15:20.780
createElement function works.

237
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.943
I'm gonna venture to say that most
react developers do not know that

238
00:15:24.943 --> 00:15:27.878
React.createElement is
a thing that exists.

239
00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:32.408
You actually are probably never going
to call it again directly as if 10

240
00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:36.789
minutes in the future because I'm
gonna show you how to work with JSX,

241
00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:39.633
JSK calls to react.createElement for you.

242
00:15:41.504 --> 00:15:44.510
But I just wanted to show you
how all this stuff works.

243
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.030
There's nothing mystical
about what's going on here.

244
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.560
I'm gonna show you JSX, it's gonna do
this for you but this is all it's doing.

245
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.595
All JSX does is it gets translated
into JavaScript that looks like this.

246
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:00.727
So why do I show you this?

247
00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:02.659
If you're never gonna do it
again why do I show you this?

248
00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.147
One, I wanna show you that
it's not a black box,

249
00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:08.022
it's actually very simple
of what it's doing for you.

250
00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:12.290
And two, whenever you're looking at
your stack traces and you see a bunch of

251
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.977
createElement calls, I want you to know
what happened and why it's there, okay?

252
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:20.135
It's one of those things like, if you
know what your tools are doing for you,

253
00:16:20.135 --> 00:16:21.357
you embrace the complexity.

254
00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:25.447
So you're gonna start using JSX like,
this is so much easier but

255
00:16:25.447 --> 00:16:27.064
you know why it's there.

256
00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:28.463
You know what it's doing for you.

257
00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:30.007
It's not intimidating.
