00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.122
Welcome to the Complete Intro to React.

2
00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:07.043
This is the eighth revision of
the Complete Intro to React.

3
00:00:07.043 --> 00:00:10.509
We do our best here at Frontend Masters
to keep everything nice and fresh and

4
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.067
up to date.

5
00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:15.489
So you definitely do not have to have
taken version seven, six, five, four,

6
00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.763
three, two, or one.

7
00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:17.428
Maybe one.

8
00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:18.753
I'm just kidding, don't take one.

9
00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:20.561
God, how long ago was that?

10
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.440
That was years and years and years ago.

11
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.245
So now you can start here on
version eight, that's totally fine.

12
00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.674
If you wanna hop over to
React-v8.holt.courses,

13
00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:35.569
that will take you to this website.

14
00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.604
You can also always just put
in React.holt.courses, but

15
00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.491
that will take you to the latest one.

16
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.976
So if you're watching this course
later and version nine has come out,

17
00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.729
this will take you to version nine.

18
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:53.632
Whereas version eight will always
take you to this website here.

19
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.888
So let's dive into it a little bit.

20
00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:02.613
Let me explain to you first of all how
this course website works a little bit.

21
00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:04.833
So if you go here and I click on this,

22
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:09.802
you can see I clicked on under the welcome
section and the introduction lesson.

23
00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.358
It'll say that up here on the top right.

24
00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:15.652
So if you're watching this later and you
don't know what part of the site I'm on,

25
00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:19.275
you can always look in the top right and
it will tell you where you are.

26
00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:21.020
And then you can always click on
this Watch on Frontend Masters.

27
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.906
This will take you to the videos on
Frontend Masters so you can follow along.

28
00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:30.828
This course website itself is open
source and free and online forever.

29
00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:34.452
Very grateful to Frontend Masters for
letting me open source these materials.

30
00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:36.259
Not everyone has the opportunity
to watch this videos,

31
00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.458
but this is very shareable, right?

32
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.306
So feel free to share this with
your colleagues and teammates and

33
00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:41.155
things like that.

34
00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:45.351
So let's talk about the methodology of
this class, why I teach it this way.

35
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.481
Obviously, I've taught this eight
times now, actually nine times.

36
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.318
I had to redo it once cuz API problems.

37
00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:54.018
But we don't wanna talk
about that right now.

38
00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:56.188
I don't wanna talk about that right now.

39
00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:58.081
Hopefully that doesn't happen today.

40
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.719
It won't, we'll be fine.

41
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.992
I started writing React I think in 2014.

42
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:09.962
I actually have a link to the tweet
that I tweeted once upon a time about

43
00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.604
when Reddit launched their very
first React code, which I did.

44
00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:17.960
It was before React was cool.

45
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.631
How people talked about how they
liked bands before you did,

46
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:20.465
I liked React before you did.

47
00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:25.257
It's fine, it's fine, I'm cool.

48
00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:28.485
That's probably the lamest
flex I've ever done.

49
00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:31.268
And I probably had lamer flexes,
but that's a pretty lame flex or

50
00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:32.087
dumb flex rather.

51
00:02:32.087 --> 00:02:37.595
Yeah, so when I started teaching these
courses, I felt like it was like, draw

52
00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:43.113
the owl, right, where there's a circle and
then the rest of the owl, right?

53
00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:45.685
It felt very much like that and
I didn't like that.

54
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:47.485
So I wanted to go through and

55
00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:51.099
actually explain to step by
step everything in React.

56
00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.094
I'm a big proponent, as someone who's
worked in DevTools for a very long time,

57
00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.459
of understanding the tool
that you're using.

58
00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.201
Because when a tool introduces complexity,
you start to resent the tool unless you

59
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.505
understand what the tool is doing for
you, right?

60
00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:06.477
If you understand the complexity
that your tool is solving for you,

61
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:09.357
then you love your tools as opposed
to hating your tools, right?

62
00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:12.759
So we're gonna be writing literally
in a script tag React, right,

63
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.921
with no build tools or anything like that.

64
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.428
And then we'll just build
on tools after that.

65
00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:21.049
We will not use Create React app,
which is an awesome tool for

66
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.544
someone to get started.

67
00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:24.698
But it's a lot of complexity
to introduce all at once.

68
00:03:24.698 --> 00:03:27.210
People are like I hate Create React app.

69
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.970
Until you understand what
Create React app does for you,

70
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.935
in which case you love Create React app.

71
00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:33.094
So that's basically it.

72
00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:37.877
We're going to build our own Create React
app basically throughout this.

73
00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:42.197
And then we're gonna end up
building this pet adoption app

74
00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:44.937
throughout the entire course here.

75
00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:46.189
So hopefully, this course is for you.

76
00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.133
It's for
anyone that wants to know React better.

77
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:53.006
This course assumes a base
level amount of JavaScript.

78
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:55.276
This is not a JavaScript course.

79
00:03:55.276 --> 00:04:00.002
There's JavaScript courses on
Frontend Masters, a few of which I teach.

80
00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:02.955
In fact, yeah, you can go to the bootcamp.

81
00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:07.856
And this is a good way to get started
as well if that's really where you need

82
00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:08.893
to start here.

83
00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:11.571
You can take this after that.

84
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:15.304
This class shares much of
the structures of v5, v6, and v7.

85
00:04:15.304 --> 00:04:17.450
I had a major revision around there, and

86
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.981
I was really happy with
that flow of the course.

87
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:24.832
So this is really an update to v7.

88
00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:28.064
There's some new things in
here like React Query and

89
00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:31.007
React Toolkit and
some other things like that.

90
00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:35.930
But for the most part, that the general
flow is very similar to v7.

91
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.537
Some setup notes here.

92
00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:41.332
This course has been tested
both on macOS and Windows, and

93
00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:43.970
I'm positive it works as well on Linux.

94
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.578
I'm gonna recommend the eight gigs of RAM.

95
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.256
That will make everything
run real smoothly.

96
00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.596
If you have four gigs,
this will still work.

97
00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:55.099
It's just you're probably
gonna go a little bit slower.

98
00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.190
Make sure you have Node JS installed.

99
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.391
We will be using Node almost immediately.

100
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:02.573
I did test this on 14, but I'm gonna say,

101
00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:05.941
I prefer that you're on 16 for
this course.

102
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.685
And if you're watching the videos later,
probably 18.

103
00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:14.501
But this has been tested on 14,
everything in here should work on 14.

104
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:19.663
I would guess this would probably work
on 12, but don't do that, please.

105
00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:24.670
I think 12 is actually as of right
now deprecated, so just don't do it.

106
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.834
You do not have to use VS Code,

107
00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:31.952
though I will be showing you some
VS Code tips and tricks along the way.

108
00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:36.614
I used to work on VS Code, so
it's just kind of ingrained in me now.

109
00:05:36.614 --> 00:05:39.636
People will always asked
me what my setup is here.

110
00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:43.617
So I have Mono Lisa for my font, or
Mono Lisa, which is not a free code, but

111
00:05:43.617 --> 00:05:45.243
I do have ligatures enabled.

112
00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:51.458
You'll see sometimes my glyphs
are combined with each other.

113
00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:52.457
We can have a double equals.

114
00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:53.546
It's like a really long equals,
things like that.

115
00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:55.025
That's called a ligature.

116
00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.630
I left some notes in here and
how to enable that.

117
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.718
If you want that on a free font,
I'm gonna suggest Cascadia Code,

118
00:06:01.718 --> 00:06:04.640
which is the free font
that Microsoft puts out.

119
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.625
I use Dark+,
just the normal VS Code theme.

120
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:09.597
I haven't found one that I like better.

121
00:06:09.597 --> 00:06:12.773
Though sometimes I do use
Sarah Drasner's Night Owl.

122
00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:17.283
No, I actually I use just
the built in macOS terminal now,

123
00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:19.319
cuz it seems to be faster.

124
00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.828
So, and then I use vscode-icons.

125
00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:28.041
So if you see all the cool icons I have
in my VS Code, it's from vscode-icons.

126
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:32.535
I think that's really all that's
interesting about my setup.

127
00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:33.715
If you have questions about it,
let me know.

128
00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:34.232
I just try and

129
00:06:34.232 --> 00:06:37.396
preempt that because it's always the first
dozen questions I get asked about.

130
00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.422
What's this, what's that,
where did you get this?

131
00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:43.318
So, I try and
answer that before people have it.

132
00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:45.868
Where to file issues,
this site itself is open source.

133
00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:51.076
So I think if you just click here,
this will take you to the issues.

134
00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:53.563
So all the lessons are just in here.

135
00:06:53.563 --> 00:06:56.371
So if you see spelling errors or

136
00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:01.339
even worse like actual errors
in stuff I'm teaching,

137
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.774
please just open an issue,
open a poll request.

138
00:07:05.774 --> 00:07:07.606
It's open source software,
so feel free to share that.

139
00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:10.980
And the reason why I asked you to put
the stuff on GitHub as opposed to

140
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.848
just messaging me is, if you had this
issue, somebody else has this issue.

141
00:07:14.848 --> 00:07:17.382
So if it's on GitHub,
that means Google can crawl it, and

142
00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:18.727
then people can Google it, and

143
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:22.220
they can find the answer to your question
that someone else is gonna have later.

144
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.214
Okay, so who am I?

145
00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:25.845
My name is Brian.

146
00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:26.866
Hi, hi Brian.

147
00:07:26.866 --> 00:07:28.693
I'm a product manager at Stripe.

148
00:07:28.693 --> 00:07:35.750
I've been an engineer for a decade.

149
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.452
So I'm not just a business school
grad that decided to teach courses.

150
00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:43.522
This is stuff I've done
a long time in my career.

151
00:07:43.522 --> 00:07:47.290
And then eventually I decided I wanted
to build the tools that help developers.

152
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.135
So which was I became a product manager so
I can kind of work on those things.

153
00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:53.385
I still write a lot of code
in the course of my day job.

154
00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:57.582
At the moment, I manage all the dev
developer tools for Stripe.

155
00:07:57.582 --> 00:08:01.800
So I own the VS Code extension, the CLI,
all the Stripe server side STK.

156
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.081
So if you're writing stripe and
Node JS together,

157
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.537
that's the STKs that I get to work on.

158
00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.180
Before that, I worked on VS Code itself.

159
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.391
I worked on Azure,
I was the JavaScript lead for Azure.

160
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:18.803
And then I spent a decade as
an engineer like Netflix,

161
00:08:18.803 --> 00:08:22.440
Reddit, LinkedIn, some other startups.

162
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.122
So I've written a lot of React.

163
00:08:25.122 --> 00:08:28.440
Yeah, so this tweet here,
see if it'll come up.

164
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.363
So this is me, Brian.

165
00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:33.646
And you can see I wrote this from
Salt Lake in July 20th, 2014.

166
00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:38.367
This is when I launched
my very first React code.

167
00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:41.632
It actually made it to the React
blog because back then they didn't

168
00:08:41.632 --> 00:08:44.449
have very many people that
had it in production, right?

169
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:49.594
It was basically us and Khan Academy and
Facebook, maybe a couple of others.

170
00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:51.440
So it was a deal.

171
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.136
And I kinda just fell in love
with it after that in the sense

172
00:08:56.136 --> 00:09:00.083
of it allowed me to write code
that was very explicit, right?

173
00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:04.042
I could see the flow of data going through
my app, and that was really appealing.

174
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:08.057
Because I could then hand this app over to
someone else, and they'd be like, okay,

175
00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:09.572
I see where everything is going.

176
00:09:09.572 --> 00:09:14.056
And I was coming from a world of
Angular JS, version one of Angular JS,

177
00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:17.180
where everything was very black magic,
right?

178
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.867
And it just it came from
all sorts of directions.

179
00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:24.830
It was very hard to follow where your
data and mutations came from, right?

180
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.097
So I kind of just stuck with it.

181
00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:31.140
I think now there's a lot of
great frameworks out there.

182
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.766
I still teach React, I still use React,
and I still love it.

183
00:09:33.766 --> 00:09:36.051
But there's great things out there.

184
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:39.431
SolidJS is awesome,
new Angular is awesome, Vue, Svelte.

185
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:43.081
I think they all definitely
have their merits as well.

186
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:46.663
So if you wanna get into an argue
about frameworks with me,

187
00:09:46.663 --> 00:09:48.573
I'm not gonna argue with you.

188
00:09:48.573 --> 00:09:50.300
I was like, that is also very cool.

189
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.123
So, Yeah, so,
I mean I've been using this for

190
00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:56.904
nearly a decade, which is basically
eternity in web development terms, right?

191
00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:59.743
So I write a lot of stuff for
Frontend Masters.

192
00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:03.812
I think this is like, I can't even
remember how many times I've been here.

193
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:08.547
It's probably close to my 30th time
here teaching at Frontend Masters.

194
00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:09.784
I don't even know.

195
00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:10.871
I can't count that high.

196
00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:13.413
I live in Seattle.

197
00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:20.578
My favorite things to do, I like to
travel, I mean, when I can now, right?

198
00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.783
I have a kid now, he's 10 months old,
and he's very cute.

199
00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:25.090
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

200
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.458
In my free time,
sometimes I get on a Peloton.

201
00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:32.550
I play Dota very poorly.

202
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.801
And I drink either scotches and
IPAs and coffee.

203
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.226
That's me, I mean.

204
00:10:37.226 --> 00:10:39.270
Feel free to catch up
with me on social media.

205
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.250
I left my links on here.

206
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.012
I'm the worst at responding to DMs.

207
00:10:43.012 --> 00:10:46.704
So if you send me a DM, there's a 90%
chance I won't respond because there's

208
00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:50.260
just too many and I get overwhelmed,
then I close the window.

209
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.079
That's just true.

210
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:53.943
And just one vanity request here.

211
00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:56.320
If you could start the repo,
that would make my day.

212
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.810
So you just click this little guy up here.

213
00:11:02.189 --> 00:11:05.020
Okay, and then I think there
are two repos for this website.

214
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.160
So there's a website you're currently on,

215
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.173
which is this one I showed you up here
which says, Complete Intro to React v8.

216
00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:15.582
There is a second repo,
which is the example project.

217
00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:20.609
So if you click on this one which is
citr-v8-project, this is all the various

218
00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:25.500
different click stops that we're gonna
go through with all the milestones.

219
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.964
So you can see here we're gonna
do No Frills React and JS tools,

220
00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:31.489
and stuff like that.

221
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.222
If you fall behind or if you're confused
about something that's breaking that you

222
00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:40.236
don't expect to break,
you can just hop back in here and

223
00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:43.015
you can look at the last
milestone that we reached.

224
00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:47.242
And in each one of these is like
a complete version of the class up to that

225
00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:48.800
point, right?

226
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.761
So you can use a diff tool to
see what's different, right?

227
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:56.589
So for example,
I use this one called Kaleidoscope, and

228
00:11:56.589 --> 00:11:58.840
you can pull up the project here.

229
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.726
I have it here.

230
00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:07.887
So if I wanna see the difference
between v5 or step 5 here,

231
00:12:07.887 --> 00:12:14.405
and I can drive 6 here, this will
actually show me all the different here.

232
00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:17.601
So I can see this file is new,
I can click on this one, and

233
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:22.091
then it'll show me all the differences
between the various different files.

234
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:25.620
I'm using one kaleidoscope,
I think it's like 80 bucks.

235
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.801
So it's unfortunately not cheap.

236
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:31.301
But I think Source Tree and
some other programs will do this for you.

237
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:34.968
I think you can convince
git difftool to do this for

238
00:12:34.968 --> 00:12:38.035
you if you really want to try hard enough.

239
00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:41.675
So that's why I do this in
this kind of fashion so

240
00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:45.659
you can compare what's changing over time.

241
00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:49.464
And so all the ones that have numbers
here at the front, these are all for

242
00:12:49.464 --> 00:12:51.490
the Complete Intro to React.

243
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.216
All these ones without numbers here down
at the bottom, these are gonna be for

244
00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:58.329
Intermediate React,
which is the second course in the series.

245
00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:01.810
Does that make sense for
everybody how that's kind of arranged?

246
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.422
We're gonna be starting
from totally from scratch.

247
00:13:04.422 --> 00:13:07.351
So I'll invite you to
just go clone this repo.

248
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:09.537
But if you follow along with the class,

249
00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:13.857
you shouldn't necessarily have to use
this, but it's there if you want it.

250
00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:19.835
And just to show you,
At the bottom here of every single lesson,

251
00:13:19.835 --> 00:13:24.180
or not every single, some of the lessons,
you'll see this checkered flag.

252
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.846
That's an indication to you that we've
reached one of the milestones, right?

253
00:13:28.846 --> 00:13:30.110
And it's always at the bottom.

254
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.429
It'll always tell you the name of it, and

255
00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:36.415
it'll always link you directly to
where that folder is in the project.

256
00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.311
I have this website up here.

257
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:39.818
You can see here I have two computers.

258
00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:42.080
Literally this computer,
I just have this up.

259
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.523
So this is basically all
of my course notes, right?

260
00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:46.675
So I am always just going through here and

261
00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:49.690
making sure I'm hitting
all of my talking points.

262
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.489
You can basically teach yourself
this workshop by just reading

263
00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:54.876
my website cuz it's literally
what I'm doing here.

264
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:59.110
What is new from v7 in this course?

265
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.326
This course goes from v7 used Parcel,
this will use Vite,

266
00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:06.947
which is a different build system.

267
00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.836
The React community has kinda
moved in another direction.

268
00:14:09.836 --> 00:14:13.004
I try and teach things that I believe in,
and I also try and

269
00:14:13.004 --> 00:14:16.176
teach things that I think
are gonna be most useful to you.

270
00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:19.630
That's kind of the the Venn
diagram of stuff in the course.

271
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.509
Personally, I still use Parcel.

272
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:23.160
I love Parcel.

273
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.817
It's the best developer experience
tool for build systems.

274
00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:30.220
V7 uses it, v6, v5.

275
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.262
I've used Parcel for a long time.

276
00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:34.034
But the React community has moved on.

277
00:14:34.034 --> 00:14:34.559
They've moved to Vite.

278
00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:35.570
Vite is still awesome.

279
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.889
Vite is from the same people that do Vue.

280
00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:40.640
Great tool, basically is good.

281
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.030
So, that changed.

282
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:48.180
I've just updated some things
to work a little bit better.

283
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.828
I'm trying to remember exactly.

284
00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:52.525
We talked about React Query.

285
00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:56.455
That's probably the biggest
addition to v8 that was done in v7,

286
00:14:56.455 --> 00:15:00.963
which is just a new tool for doing
fetching and requests and stuff like that.

287
00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:04.762
Basically, everybody uses it now,
and it's a great tool.

288
00:15:04.762 --> 00:15:06.640
So I use it.
So I think I believe in it.

289
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.276
We'll talk more about uncontrolled
forms than we did in v7.

290
00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:18.310
I'm trying to think if I cut anything out.

291
00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:23.056
I'm sure I did.

292
00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:30.923
And then just in general, this is the
version 18 of React as opposed to version

293
00:15:30.923 --> 00:15:33.550
seven, this course taught version 17.

294
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.345
That was the biggest impetus for
me to coming back,

295
00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:38.888
was just to cover all
the new React 18 stuff.

296
00:15:38.888 --> 00:15:42.803
The more advanced features of React 18
we actually covered in Intermediate.

297
00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:46.310
So a lot of that doesn't permeate
too much into the complete intro.

298
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.120
But there are a couple things that
will come directly from version 18.
