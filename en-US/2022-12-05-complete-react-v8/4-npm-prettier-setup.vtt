WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.866
So first of all,
we've reached our first checkpoint,

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:09.732
if you've fallen behind or
just wanna start from a clean

3
00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:14.824
slate here you can start
from 01-no-frills-react.

4
00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.975
That is the state of
the project up until now.

5
00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:24.745
From here, we're gonna stop
writing React.CreateElement,

6
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:29.727
you will not write this again for the
duration of the rest of the class here.

7
00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:32.532
We're gonna move into JSX now.

8
00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:38.370
The reason why we're gonna do that is
because no one ever writes React this way,

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.125
everyone uses JSX now.

10
00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.428
I imagine most of you probably
have seen JSX before, but

11
00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:45.615
JSX really just renders out to this.

12
00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:49.624
Again, you can look at the rendered
output of your build tool and

13
00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:51.193
it looks just like this.

14
00:00:54.916 --> 00:01:01.793
All right, so, First thing I
need you to open your terminal.

15
00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:06.608
This is not a binary,
that's Ctrl back tick is

16
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:11.551
how you open and
close your terminal in VS code.

17
00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:19.035
You can see here I'm in my adopt-me app,
and we're gonna start using npm.

18
00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:23.319
So we're gonna say npm init, this will
start like a brand new npm project,

19
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.195
the reason why we're gonna do this
is because we need to keep track of

20
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:28.362
our dependencies.

21
00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:33.423
You can say this it'll ask you a bunch of
questions, I don't wanna answer questions,

22
00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:36.631
if you put dash y it just
generates everything for you.

23
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:41.788
And I get here a nice package.json.

24
00:01:41.788 --> 00:01:45.519
Package.json is where I'm gonna start
keeping all of my dependencies.

25
00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:50.960
Again, this is very common for
every front end,

26
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.683
or back end project in node.js.

27
00:01:54.683 --> 00:02:00.552
So, the next thing I wanna do here for
you is let's put in Prettier.

28
00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:07.355
This is as much for me, cuz I am incapable
of writing code now without Prettier.

29
00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.661
Prettier is a tool that just
auto formats your code.

30
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.225
You can see here I was pretty
lackadaisical about where I put

31
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:16.652
semicolons and where I didn't,
like for example here.

32
00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:21.026
At the end of this React.createElement
technically semicolon should have gone

33
00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:24.255
there, I wasn't thinking about it nor
did I care about it.

34
00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.704
Cuz normally whenever I just save my file,
all of them get magically inserted,

35
00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:29.980
I'm just gonna show you how
to do that very quickly.

36
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.047
Prettier is a tool that auto
formats your code for you.

37
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:38.260
And it's why I don't care
about semicolons, tab spaces,

38
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.664
anything like that, is because
this tool at the end of time I hit

39
00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:45.840
Save it removes all the code formatting
that I've done and it puts in its own,

40
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.172
which means I never
have to think about it.

41
00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:51.940
I had this background thread in my
brain that was always thinking about,

42
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.315
is this indented enough?

43
00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:54.339
Should I put a comma here?

44
00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.357
Should I not put a comma here?

45
00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:56.381
Should I put a semicolon here?

46
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:57.738
Should I not?

47
00:02:57.738 --> 00:03:00.826
That that thread of my brain has
now totally shut down always and

48
00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:03.460
forever because I just let
Prettier handle it for me.

49
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:11.678
So, here in your terminal I
want you to say npm install and

50
00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:15.002
we're gonna install Prettier.

51
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.047
What version did we add here?

52
00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.922
It usually doesn't matter.

53
00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:27.786
--save-dev, prettier, and
save-dev, so this is gonna go

54
00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:32.751
in the developer dependencies,
which is where that comes from.

55
00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:38.691
You can put save-dev like this, or you
can just put -D, it means the same thing.

56
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:43.570
You also don't have to do install like
that, you can also just do npm i which

57
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.536
is what I do, so you'll see me do npm and
i -D, that's in install save dev.

58
00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.446
That's just the shorthand for that.

59
00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:57.273
So we're gonna install prettier@2.7.1.

60
00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:03.967
Now you might be asking me, why am I
installing a specific version of this?

61
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:08.561
All the dependencies in this course
are fixed on certain numbers because

62
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.886
I can only control right
now what tools you install.

63
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.424
So if I just tell you to do this,

64
00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:16.102
it'll install whatever
the latest version of this.

65
00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:19.445
But 6 months later,
a year later when someone's taking

66
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:23.636
this course it might break with all
the configurations that I have now.

67
00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:27.676
So if you're following along with this,
what I'm going to invite you to do is

68
00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:31.717
follow along with the same versions that
I am using because I can guarantee you

69
00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:34.721
everything right now fits together and
works together.

70
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.228
And if it's a year later when
you're watching this course,

71
00:04:38.228 --> 00:04:40.238
I can't guarantee that anymore.

72
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.113
You're welcome to try and
upgrade update things.

73
00:04:43.113 --> 00:04:47.095
But things are probably gonna break and
you're gonna spend some time debugging

74
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:51.092
that which is not what I want you to do,
I want you to learn React, the concepts.

75
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:57.857
The concepts are unchanging the individual
syntax might change a little over time.

76
00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:01.228
So 2.7.1.

77
00:05:01.228 --> 00:05:03.620
Does that make sense of why I'm
fixing all the dependencies here?

78
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.731
Okay, cool.

79
00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:11.477
So you'll notice if you go
in here in package.json,

80
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.980
it still has this little caret here,

81
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.740
that basically means that it'll install
the latest patch version of this, right?

82
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.378
So if you say npm install this
again later, it's gonna install,

83
00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:28.020
if 7.2 came out,
it would install that for you.

84
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.055
If you'll notice when you
look at my package.json,

85
00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:38.680
Here in my GitHub
btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v8.

86
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.506
Actually, let's the other one.

87
00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:49.412
Here you'll notice that I've taken

88
00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:56.435
all of those carets out for
precisely that reason.

89
00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:58.232
So it installs exactly that version.

90
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.164
Normally you should leave that in though.

91
00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:07.579
And for now it actually doesn't matter
because as long as you have the correct

92
00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:09.718
version, it doesn't matter
to me which one you use.

93
00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:12.401
Okay, so here we are,
we have prettier installed now.

94
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:15.648
Now let's go use prettier.

95
00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:20.008
Well the first thing we need to do is
we need to make a configuration object.

96
00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:25.351
So here just at the base
level of your project,

97
00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:31.116
create a new file,
call it .prettierrc, okay?

98
00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:34.266
Here's where you would configure prettier,
and I don't care.

99
00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:37.361
So I'm going to give it an empty object
which basically says use whatever

100
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.231
your defaults are.

101
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.545
I really don't care what they are.

102
00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:46.802
But if you wanted to do tabs versus spaces
or you wanted to have four indent or

103
00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:50.798
two indent spaces, this is all
the stuff where you'd handle that or

104
00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.782
single quotes or double quotes.

105
00:06:52.782 --> 00:06:54.884
You could configure that here.

106
00:06:54.884 --> 00:06:59.259
The only reason that we put in a file
there at all is now we can tell our VS

107
00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.404
code is like if you see a prettier
configuration, use prettier automatically.

108
00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:11.658
Which you can do here, you can open your
settings, so Shift + Command + P and

109
00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:17.538
you can say Settings, stuff like that or
you can just hit Command or Control.

110
00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:20.628
Command on Mac, Control on Windows comma.

111
00:07:20.628 --> 00:07:26.704
This will open your settings and you want
to turn on Format on Save, this one here.

112
00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:34.700
Okay, and the other one that you
want to turn on is prettier,

113
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.792
getting ahead of myself here.

114
00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.778
So you do turn on Format on Save and

115
00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:45.119
then you wanna install
an extension here called Prettier.

116
00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.425
This one here, Prettier Code formatter.

117
00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:51.174
It'll be the one that
has a tons of downloads.

118
00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:54.103
There's like three or four of them,
but the one that has tons and

119
00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:56.067
tons of downloads is
the one that you want.

120
00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:58.813
So install that.

121
00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:04.180
Once you've installed that, go back
to your settings look for prettier.

122
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.388
And the one that you
wanna turn on here is,

123
00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:15.527
Make sure it's enabled, which one is it?

124
00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:22.056
Yeah, prettier here what require config,
check that one.

125
00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:30.950
Now, if you have two projects, one that
is using Prettier and one that is not,

126
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.114
it's gonna make sure that there's
a config file in the project,

127
00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.946
if there is it'll use that.

128
00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:40.256
If you're on a different project
that does not have a config,

129
00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:41.729
Prettier is not gonna run.

130
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:46.292
Which is good,
because you don't wanna format files that

131
00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:50.024
you're not necessarily supposed to, right.

132
00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:54.505
Okay, so, we now have that,
why is this super useful.

133
00:08:54.505 --> 00:09:00.420
Now if I do something like this,
does this offend you?

134
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.255
It should.

135
00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:05.847
But now if I save it,
it just fixes it, right?

136
00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:09.095
You really can't mess it up now.

137
00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:11.382
You can put things on the same line.

138
00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:14.332
If I save it, it's just gonna put it
right back to where it's supposed to go.

139
00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:19.744
Right.

140
00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:22.543
So now every time I save
my file that happens.

141
00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:26.087
So if you see my code jumping around like
that it's probably clims saving stuff.

142
00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:32.586
Okay, so that's Prettier,
any questions about Prettier?

143
00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:38.700
So go here to your package.json.

144
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.430
I use VS code and
most people I know use VS code.

145
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.140
Yeah, go ahead.

146
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.950
Do we have to set this up every
time we start a new project?

147
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.357
You don't have to do
all the VS code stuff.

148
00:09:53.357 --> 00:09:56.501
You do that once, it works forever.

149
00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:58.449
Putting a prettier rc file, yeah.

150
00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:01.599
For whatever project that you need to use
Prettier on you'll put a prettier rc, but

151
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:03.240
everything else, no.

152
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.370
So I use VS code.

153
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.230
Lots of people that I know use VS code but
not everybody uses VS code.

154
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:14.700
Prim Gen doesn't use VS code famously.

155
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.659
So, what I like to do is I like to
leave the commands here in the scripts

156
00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:23.851
of my package.json so
that someone that comes by later has

157
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:27.375
the ability to use the tool
the same way that I am.

158
00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:31.040
So we're gonna write
a thing called format here.

159
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.830
And I'm just gonna do prettier

160
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.846
--write and \ " that, src,

161
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:50.448
Asteriskasterisk/asterisk, and
then you can put js and jsx.

162
00:10:50.448 --> 00:10:53.532
And you can also put ts and
tsx there if you want to,

163
00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:57.959
if you're gonna do TypeScript, but
for now we'll just have js, jsx.

164
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:06.880
Okay, prettier, which is the CLI command.

165
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.742
You don't have to install it, it'll
actually just find it directly in your

166
00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:12.260
node modules for you, so
that's fine as long as it's installed.

167
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.070
-- write means that write it back to
the file, so overwrite everything.

168
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.330
This is escaping a back tick or
a double quote here.

169
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.276
The reason why you wanna quote this is so
that Prettier is literally past the whole

170
00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:32.216
string of the path, otherwise
like bash will expand it for you.

171
00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:37.052
And then you're just saying everything
inside of the source directory,

172
00:11:37.052 --> 00:11:41.498
that's arbitrarily deep, as long as
it has a file extension of js or

173
00:11:41.498 --> 00:11:43.376
jsx please format it for me.

174
00:11:46.552 --> 00:11:52.468
So now if I say npm run format
like this from my directory,

175
00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:56.303
it's gonna run that command for me.

176
00:11:56.303 --> 00:11:59.105
And you can see here it
ran it on src/App.js.

177
00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:00.631
It's grayed out,
which means nothing changed.

178
00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:10.740
But if at app.js, which,
let's just format on Save.

179
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.608
We're just gonna, Turn that off for

180
00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:22.050
just one hot second, and then I'm
going to move this and I'm gonna save.

181
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.080
And now if I run npm run format, you'll
see here one it fixed up here, right?

182
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.980
Cool, and then this is not grayed out,
which means it actually ran successfully.

183
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.130
So now if I'm working with someone
like the Primo Gen, right?

184
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.783
He can run this,

185
00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:37.520
he can just say he doesn't have to
go figure out Prettier on his own.

186
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.670
I'm sure he has cuz he knows Vin
better than anyone anything else.

187
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.417
But he could just run my command for me,
and we had this like common language to

188
00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:51.448
speak, which is why I like putting
this all in my package.json.

189
00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:57.149
And it just makes explicit like this is
a Prettier project I expected to run on

190
00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:58.775
these things, so on and so forth.

191
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:01.760
Okay, questions about that?

192
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.673
If it's working well we run the script but

193
00:13:03.673 --> 00:13:06.965
not working when we save the file
what might be a troubleshooting step?

194
00:13:06.965 --> 00:13:15.072
I need to turn this back on
DF Format on Save checked.

195
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.041
Could wait till after if needed.

196
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:23.750
I mean, the thing you can look at here is
if you can click on Problems that might

197
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.790
tell you something.

198
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:32.340
So the one thing is like,
if you have invalid syntax in here,

199
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:38.950
like if I just put semicolons there,
Prettier won't know what to do with that.

200
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.616
So if you have invalid syntax,
which would show up in Problems,

201
00:13:47.789 --> 00:13:51.420
And then lastly,
you can click on OUTPUT here, and

202
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.298
you can look at the Prettier extension.

203
00:13:54.298 --> 00:14:00.808
It'll give you a debug logout
of stuff that it can't run on.

204
00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:05.463
If that's empty that means you don't
have Prettier installed properly.

205
00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:10.251
So that's Prettier, now it's installed and

206
00:14:10.251 --> 00:14:15.539
working, and
we can just ignore it going forward.
