00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:02.630
So we have reached 06 custom hooks.

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.324
If you need to hop there,
that's where we are.

3
00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.877
But otherwise,
this is looking pretty cool, right?

4
00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:11.286
You can change this and it just updates.

5
00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:14.316
I don't know, for me that was just
like a magic moment like, okay,

6
00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:15.659
react can do some cool stuff.

7
00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.509
I just kind of described the data
dependencies and things just happen.

8
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.105
Cool, yeah, so
we actually already did this.

9
00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:29.648
[LAUGH] That's funny, so
in the search params.

10
00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:38.105
So we just did this form on Submit, right?

11
00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.958
So on Submit we say prevent default,

12
00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:46.577
Which prevents the form from
actually literally submitting.

13
00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:49.712
And then we just call requestPets.

14
00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:54.691
So you can see here we have onChange and
onSubmit, there's onmouseover

15
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:59.276
there's onmouse up, on key up,
on key down, on pointer events.

16
00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:05.794
I left a link to the doc so you can go see
all the event reaction things you can do.

17
00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:10.144
One of the things I was gonna say,
not that it's super matters, but

18
00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:15.104
this e here, which we're definitely
treating just like a normal DOM event,

19
00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:17.802
technically is a React synthetic event.

20
00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:22.026
Generally doesn't matter, it has all the
exact same APIs as a normal DOM event, but

21
00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:23.886
sometimes it actually does matter.

22
00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:28.533
That's not literally a dom event,
it's a fake dom event.

23
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.666
Usually TypeScript because
TypeScript will get picky

24
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.445
about what kind of event it is.

25
00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:37.702
So, file that somewhere under your brain
of maybe useful in TypeScript stuff.

26
00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:40.567
That's a pretty big pile in my brain.

27
00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.730
&gt;&gt; Is that what they call the virtual dom?

28
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.287
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's part of it.

29
00:01:46.287 --> 00:01:50.698
I mean, as Bears addressing,
react is a big virtual Dom but

30
00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:53.447
notice I haven't said virtual Dom.

31
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.365
I mean,
we're hours into this course, right?

32
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.405
And I've not said virtual Dom,
why have I not said it?

33
00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:02.163
Cuz it is absolutely the least important
part about how react does anything, right?

34
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:06.151
It's an implementation detail that
you never have to know or care about.

35
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:11.022
But the general way that react works
is it has the real DOM, which is slow.

36
00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:15.065
And you have a fake DOM,
which is fast, the virtual DOM.

37
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:19.309
What react does is it makes a big fake DOM
and then it figures out everything that's

38
00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.399
the minimal change set that it
needs to do to update the DOM.

39
00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.742
And then it reaches over and
does all the slow stuff, but

40
00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:29.171
it minimizes how much of that
interaction has to happen.

41
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.639
That is the virtual DOM.

42
00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:36.141
It's how react works underneath the hood,
generally you never have to care.

43
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.262
But it does a bunch of stuff
to keep track of that.

44
00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:41.718
So, you can just never worry
about the virtual DOM.

45
00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:45.685
It was a big buzzword when react came out,

46
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:49.916
everyone was talking about the virtual DOM
and now everything has some variety of it.
