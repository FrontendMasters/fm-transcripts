1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.073
We wanna do the same thing here for
breed, const breed,

2
00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:11.401
setBreed = useState, and
again empty string here.

3
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:17.689
Basically it's gonna be
the same as this animal.

4
00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.021
So you can even copy and paste that, but

5
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:29.384
we're just gonna say breed,
breed, breed, breed, setBreed.

6
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.113
And then we don't have an array of breeds,
yet.

7
00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:40.963
So we're actually gonna go get
that list of breeds from the APIs.

8
00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:47.210
So for now,
just make a const breeds = [] for now.

9
00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:55.200
And then we're gonna say, instead of
animals, we're gonna just say breeds here.

10
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.592
And then breed for all these, so, breed,

11
00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.893
breed, breed, breed, okay?

12
00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:08.244
So now I think if you go back over here
you should see, Location, that's working.

13
00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:11.208
Animal, I have all these options for
animals.

14
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.258
That's what the empty option
is here at the top, right?

15
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:16.276
We put an empty option at
the top of every one of these.

16
00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:21.157
And this one is the option for
someone to not select any animal, right?

17
00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:24.614
They could select cat, and it's like,
no, actually I wanna select nothing,

18
00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.365
I'm gonna search for everything,
that's what that's for.

19
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:31.493
And then here, the breed should
be empty at the moment, okay?

20
00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:33.750
One more thing that we're
gonna add to breed here.

21
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.070
We wanna disable it, right?

22
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.787
If there's no breed to search for
at the moment,

23
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.385
we haven't grabbed it from the API,
yet, we wanna disable it.

24
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:48.234
So, what we can do here is we can say,
disabled=

25
00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:55.415
breeds.length === 0.

26
00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.641
So now breeds has no length,
which at the moment it doesn't, right?

27
00:02:01.113 --> 00:02:03.315
And so now look, it's nice and grayed out.

28
00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:06.746
It'll only be available for
someone to click,

29
00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:09.761
once this breeds has any length, right?

30
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:11.624
Which, again, we'll grab from the API.

31
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:18.663
And, again, this is just three
equal signs put together.

32
00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:21.124
That's just my font combining them.

33
00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:26.272
So, again, if I come in here and
I put, poodle in here.

34
00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:28.415
Now it has length,
it's not disabled anymore.

35
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.302
But now that it's empty, disabled.

36
00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:40.418
For example, if I put a poodle in here,
let's say I search for

37
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:45.848
dog, and then I select Poodle,
and also I select cat.

38
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:48.215
I mean,
Poodle cat sound kind of interesting, but

39
00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:49.765
they're also not real, right?

40
00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:51.816
So we probably don't want that.

41
00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.930
So how do we handle that?

42
00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:57.475
Well, same thing here.

43
00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:02.522
Whenever you set the animal to be
something different on change, right?

44
00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:08.278
You can say setBreed,
to be an empty string, right?

45
00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:13.435
And now, every time that I set
this to be something else,

46
00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.267
It clears out the breed, right?

47
00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:24.156
So they must have updated
this jsx accessibility.

48
00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:28.864
You used to have to put on blur here,
as well.

49
00:03:28.864 --> 00:03:32.258
Because, I guess, sometimes the change
event wouldn't fire correctly if you're

50
00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:34.717
tabbing through things as opposed
to just clicking on them.

51
00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:37.145
It's not erring on me, so
I'm not gonna put it on there.

52
00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:40.465
But if you'll see in my notes,
I have on blur in there,

53
00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:43.297
as well,
to handle the accessibility error.

54
00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:47.953
But if it's not giving me an error,
then I'm not gonna put it in there.

55
00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:49.861
Yeah, no, it should work, but

56
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:53.693
it'd be nice to not have to repeat
yourself to have both of them.

57
00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:59.580
Well, in the next lesson we'll talk
about requesting from the API,

58
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.417
which will be great.

59
00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:08.886
But for now, you can go, there's
a milestone here which is O for hooks.

60
00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:13.567
If you need to catch up,
go ahead and grab that from

61
00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:18.482
the project repo, and
then we'll go on to effects.
