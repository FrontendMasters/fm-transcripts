00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:03.286
Real quick,
let's go make pet look a little bit nicer.

2
00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:09.487
Pet.jsx, all right, so
just delete all of this

3
00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:19.476
Let's replace props up here with name,

4
00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:25.038
animal, breed, images, location, ID.

5
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.021
We're gonna have a hero image.

6
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:34.306
So, let hero=http://

7
00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:38.967
pets-images.dev-apis.

8
00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.347
To the

9
00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:58.456
dev-apis.com/pets/none.jpg.

10
00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:04.281
And then if images.length,

11
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:08.476
then hero is images 0

12
00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:22.743
Okay, and then down here in
delete all of this markup,

13
00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:27.366
a href =, we're gonna make a details

14
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:32.436
page here in a little bit so details/id.

15
00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:35.143
ClassName=pet.

16
00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:45.184
Div className=image-container.

17
00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:52.705
And then this is gonna be an image,
sec = (hero) alt is assigned name.

18
00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.560
They're gonna have div className=info.

19
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.727
h1 of the name.

20
00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:10.873
And h2, we're just gonna give it like
a little like info thing here so,

21
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.822
There's a bunch of ways to do this.

22
00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:21.776
You could totally do
this with like animal.

23
00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:29.790
Breed.

24
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:38.077
Location or you can do it with a template
string like I have in my notes both of

25
00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:39.410
them work just fine.

26
00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:46.308
Yeah, VS Code will always
warn you when you do dashes.

27
00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:47.999
Do you know what dashes is?

28
00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.421
It's like a longer dash.

29
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:51.794
That's what this yellow outline is.

30
00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:56.305
If I just put like a minus sign there,
then it's fine.

31
00:02:56.305 --> 00:03:00.075
For us to have it there if I'm doing text,
you're supposed to do an dash and

32
00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:01.762
not a minus if it's text, right?

33
00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:06.258
Not that it really matters.

34
00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:12.954
Okay, so now we should be able
to pop back over here and

35
00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:17.394
you should get like an actual
fairly nice looking page.

36
00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:21.857
So, that's Luna,
that's my dog and then Bunna and

37
00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:25.313
all of belong to front of masters staff.

38
00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:29.881
And then Sudo and
Beam belong to Sarah Dresner.

39
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:31.980
And then the rest are just
random stock images.

40
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.066
&gt;&gt; So, Sudo get me a beer actually works.

41
00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.361
&gt;&gt; It does.

42
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:41.938
And Beam is named after the Erlang VM.

43
00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:45.220
Yeah, Sarah has nerdy dogs.

44
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.841
They are sweethearts though,
I really do like Sarah's dogs.

45
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.953
Luna however, it's a tiny jerk.

46
00:03:54.953 --> 00:03:59.184
This was just stylistic, I mean,
the only thing here that might be

47
00:03:59.184 --> 00:04:03.961
interesting to you is like we're doing
like a default image here, right?

48
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.698
Think if I refresh this, then it just has
like a little placeholder image, right?

49
00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:10.473
So, if one of these animals came back
without an image that you'd have,

50
00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:11.755
like a nice little placeholder.

51
00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:14.020
That's the point of that.

52
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.793
We don't have a good loading
experience right now.

53
00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:21.136
Basically, it's just like right now our
API is fast enough that it doesn't matter.

54
00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:26.675
But imagine if we had 10 million web
users on the website for some reason.

55
00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:29.872
This would slow to a crawl and they'd
have like some really bad experience.

56
00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:36.269
Or even if we're like here, let's just
put it on like slow 3G for a second.

57
00:04:41.737 --> 00:04:43.937
This is kind of painful, right?

58
00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:48.746
Not rendered, no pets found.

59
00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:51.855
And then eventually it shows up, right?

60
00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:52.751
Not great,

61
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:58.581
it'd be much better if we had some sort
of loading kind of hydration going on.

62
00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.613
We'll get there.

63
00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:03.749
But for now, we're still working through
just getting the information there at all.

64
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:04.358
Yeah.

65
00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:06.419
&gt;&gt; Does Sudo have admin privileges?

66
00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.453
&gt;&gt; No.

67
00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:11.369
And we've informed
the admin of your request.

68
00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:13.742
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

69
00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:15.675
&gt;&gt; That's a dumb unix joke for you.

70
00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:21.409
Which by the way, if you wanna get that
joke, there's a course on front and

71
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.909
masters from yours truly about Linux and
the CLI.

72
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.980
And I do make that joke in there.

73
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.425
We are up to 07 component composition.

74
00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:35.965
The lesson that I wanted you to take away
from here is where components are getting

75
00:05:35.965 --> 00:05:38.367
really big and
start doing a lot of things,

76
00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:40.929
just break it down into
smaller components.

77
00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:45.434
Even if you're not reusing
those components, totally fine.

78
00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:50.233
For example, we're not gonna do it in this
class, but this could be like a good like

79
00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.336
stretch goal for
you once you're beyond this class.

80
00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:57.569
It'd be a good idea to move this
form into its own component.

81
00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.480
And so that search params would be div and
then it'd be like form and

82
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.140
then results, and then all it
did was Marshall stayed around.

83
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.833
It would be a much cleaner
implementation of this.

84
00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:16.448
There's kind of the background thread that
I want running in your brain when you're

85
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:20.352
writing react is like, can I break
this down into more succinct parts?

86
00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:23.668
Now, you can go totally
the opposite direction and

87
00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:26.764
have way too many components,
also a bad idea.

88
00:06:26.764 --> 00:06:31.324
One, when you start getting like thousands
of components that are like building onto

89
00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.172
each other, it gets really slow.

90
00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:38.040
So, that actually is a real performance
concern and it gets nonsensical of like,

91
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.204
okay tiny thing makes slightly, less tiny
thing that makes slightly less tiny thing.

92
00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:45.249
You can get lost in the interaction.

93
00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:50.501
So, please just balance it, and that
just comes from doing it and experience.

94
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:55.681
But if all of your components like
10 lines, you're doing too much

95
00:06:55.681 --> 00:07:01.055
decomposition build your things back
up into bigger more macro parts.
