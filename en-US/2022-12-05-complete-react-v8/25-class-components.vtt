1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.891
So head back over we just did,

2
00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.698
Here, Uncontrolled forms.

3
00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.320
We are now down here to
ten uncontrolled forms and

4
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.101
we're gonna do class components, yeah,
we're gonna do class components.

5
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:28.994
So if you go into our Adopt Me and you
click on one of these pets, It'd be nice

6
00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:34.419
if there was some way to visualize all the
photos for all the individual pets, right?

7
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:37.519
So we're gonna do that really quick and
I'm gonna show you the older way of

8
00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.830
doing components which
are called class components.

9
00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:46.300
I used to teach a lot more class
components and as time has gone by,

10
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.293
I teach class components less than
less and now it's kind of a footnote.

11
00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:53.278
It used to be very front and center.

12
00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:57.036
If you go teach or if you go take
the first version of my class,

13
00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:02.006
it's all class components because
functional components didn't exist yet.

14
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:08.311
So please create a file
called Carousel.jsx.

15
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.977
Carousel is one of those words that if I
look at it too long, it somaticizes, and

16
00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.148
I can no longer spell it.

17
00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:15.775
Because it's like that doesn't
look like a word anymore, right?

18
00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:19.520
So import Component,

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.043
capital C component from react.

20
00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:31.854
We're gonna make a thing
called class carousel from,

21
00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.564
sorry, extends component.

22
00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:45.727
Okay, this is gonna have a state Of
the active photo that's on the page.

23
00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:50.176
If I have ten photos by default,
the first one will be the active one,

24
00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.953
the hero one, if you will.

25
00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:54.992
Will give us some default props.

26
00:01:54.992 --> 00:02:02.817
So if you don't give it anything, Images,

27
00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:15.462
http://pets-images.dev-apis.com,

28
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.082
/pets/none.jpg Okay,

29
00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:29.582
and then we're gonna give
it a render function here.

30
00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.609
A render function is basically
like the function body of

31
00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.787
the components we've been writing so far.

32
00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:42.378
Huge key here, no hooks,
class components and hooks do not mix.

33
00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:47.052
You either have hooks or
you have class components inevitable.

34
00:02:47.052 --> 00:02:52.984
So const (active) = this.state.

35
00:02:54.683 --> 00:03:03.397
Const ( images) = this.props.

36
00:03:03.397 --> 00:03:09.910
So, whereas before I had use state to
get state, you're gonna keep it on this,

37
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.910
which is mutable state and
the class component.

38
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.837
And this.props as you might imagine
is what is passed in from the parent

39
00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:18.561
component.

40
00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:24.139
Okay, and then here,
we're going to return our markup.

41
00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:33.394
Div className='carousel'.

42
00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:42.169
Img src=(images(active).

43
00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.369
Alt = animal hero.

44
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:53.763
Whatever you wanna call that.

45
00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:56.410
div className =,

46
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.292
carousel-smaller cuz I
was good at CSS classes.

47
00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.963
Then we're gonna do an images.map,

48
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:16.946
photo, index.

49
00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:25.725
And this is gonna return an image.

50
00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:29.125
Key = photo cuz those
will always be unique.

51
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.003
src= photo.

52
00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.900
Name=, So,

53
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.697
if the index is triple equal
to the one that is active,

54
00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:47.428
then it has an active class, otherwise,

55
00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:51.488
it has no class,
just like meme has no class.

56
00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:57.348
Okay, alt= animal thumbnail.

57
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.525
Okay?

58
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.197
Then down at the bottom make sure
you export default carousel.

59
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.496
Let's get this rendering first and
then I'll come back and

60
00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:18.863
explain everything that
just happened here.

61
00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:23.502
So go to the details page, please.

62
00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:29.208
I want you to import
carousel from carousel and,

63
00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:35.719
First component inside div.details.

64
00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.435
So this one right here, we're gonna say

65
00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:45.070
carousel with images= pet.images.

66
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.543
So this is what we made.

67
00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:52.901
We had the hero image here, right?

68
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.335
And then these are the little
thumbnails here.

69
00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:59.543
You can see that this first one Is a
little grayed out because it's the active

70
00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:00.476
image, right?

71
00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:03.040
The rest of these don't have that.

72
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.711
And in a second, we'll make it so
you can click on the other ones and

73
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:08.161
you can rotate with the hero images but
we're not there yet.

74
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:12.591
Let's hop back over to Carousel and
have a chat about class components.

75
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.911
The one absolute must, I guess
there's probably two absolute must.

76
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:21.183
It's gotta be extend or react.component,
which is what this does.

77
00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:25.586
The second thing is every class
component has a render function.

78
00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:28.331
Unexceptionally must
know two ways about it.

79
00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:30.295
It must have a render function.

80
00:06:30.295 --> 00:06:32.919
You don't have to return markup or
anything like that, but

81
00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:33.920
you do have to have it.

82
00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:38.757
I guess you have to return
something either, but

83
00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:40.744
it can return null if
you really wanted it to.

84
00:06:40.744 --> 00:06:43.656
Wouldn't make any sense,
but it's possible.

85
00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:49.071
Okay, it has this.props which
if you look at details,

86
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:53.230
this.props is how we get images, right?

87
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.483
Whereas with the render functions we
got it from being passed in as a props,

88
00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:59.113
it's like the parameters.

89
00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:05.603
Here in a class component and
carousel.jsx it comes from this.props.

90
00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:08.855
So in other words,
context in the sense of like this,

91
00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:11.977
this becomes very important
in class components.

92
00:07:11.977 --> 00:07:15.836
I used to have to go very in
the depth when I'm teaching react of

93
00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.532
what react context is and what JavaScript
context and things like that is.

94
00:07:20.532 --> 00:07:23.821
I don't necessarily have
to do that anymore.

95
00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:27.366
This.props, just like props that come
in from a function is immutable.

96
00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:32.236
I cannot say this.props.images
equals blah doesn't work.

97
00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:33.613
If you wanna have default props,

98
00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.834
you have to understand what
static default props is.

99
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:40.802
This is like, hey, if you don't
pass anything into the carousel,

100
00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:44.038
which let's just see what that looks like.

101
00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:50.642
If I delete this, then I get
this adopt me placeholder image,

102
00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:54.833
right, which came from this, right?

103
00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:59.009
That's what the default prompts are for.

104
00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.201
What's nice about that is now I can
just assume that I always have images,

105
00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:04.018
whether or not the user provides it to me.

106
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.757
Okay, so that's great.

107
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:14.350
There's no hooks, so
how do we keep track of state.

108
00:08:15.892 --> 00:08:18.872
State, I guess I kind of gave
myself away there, right?

109
00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:20.219
You keep track of it with state.

110
00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:22.963
So state is mutable, right?

111
00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:26.872
So I can change state using
a function called this.set state.

112
00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:31.447
We'll see set state here in just a second
cuz we're gonna add some interactivity but

113
00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:35.773
just know that state is how you keep track
of like internal state to a component.

114
00:08:35.773 --> 00:08:39.317
Basically, the same thing that
you would use use state for.

115
00:08:39.317 --> 00:08:43.265
That's what state is for here.

116
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:46.891
And something I haven't shown you yet, but

117
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:50.623
there are things called
life cycle methods.

118
00:08:50.623 --> 00:08:55.147
So a lifecycle method is we used use
effects to make a request by saying

119
00:08:55.147 --> 00:08:57.567
something like use effect, right?

120
00:08:57.567 --> 00:09:01.709
And we gave it an empty array which said
only run this once at the beginning.

121
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:05.637
If you want something like that for

122
00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:12.007
a class component you would say,
componentDidMount.

123
00:09:12.007 --> 00:09:16.464
This function will get run once at
the beginning of every time that

124
00:09:16.464 --> 00:09:20.039
it mounts onto the DOM and
then never gets run again.

125
00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:22.559
If you wanna run it every
time something updates,

126
00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:24.665
there's componentDidUpdate, right?

127
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:29.245
This will get run every single
time that's state gets updated.

128
00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:33.890
If you wanna run something after
the component has unmounted,

129
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:42.083
you can say componentDid, Willunmount.

130
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:43.810
There it is.

131
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.101
There should component update,
componentDidCatch.

132
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.033
We'll do that one here in just a second.

133
00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:49.654
There's a bunch of lifecycle methods here.

134
00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:57.009
So use effect basically
combined all those lifecycle

135
00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:01.306
methods down into this use effect method.

136
00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:06.066
With class components, it's broken out
into various different functions that

137
00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:08.454
describe the lifecycle of a component.

138
00:10:08.454 --> 00:10:09.542
I actually really like this.

139
00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:15.126
I miss writing react this way, but
no one writes it like this anymore.

140
00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:16.231
It is occasionally useful.

141
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:17.507
They said it's not deprecated.

142
00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:18.901
You can use this forever.

143
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:22.129
It's why I wanted to show you
how to write code like this.

144
00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:26.065
Some people still like it,
like you can write code like this, but

145
00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:30.593
I would say generally the react world
has moved to using hooks most of time.

146
00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:35.885
&gt;&gt; How common is it to see a project
where some components are class-based and

147
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.485
some are using hooks?

148
00:10:37.485 --> 00:10:41.019
&gt;&gt; Very common, it certainly
depends on how old the project is.

149
00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:43.916
If the project is six or seven years old,

150
00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:48.701
extremely common because back then
there was no way to write that.

151
00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:51.215
I would say these days if you're
doing a greenfield project,

152
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:53.840
I would say most people just
always write function components.

153
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.826
There's a couple things that still
function components can't do,

154
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:04.894
like we'll do errors,
which you can't do any other way.

155
00:11:04.894 --> 00:11:09.271
But otherwise, certainly,
you'll see some here and there.

156
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:11.385
For me, if you're working with me,

157
00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:16.031
I'm fine with you using both of these
whenever you've wanna curse students like

158
00:11:16.031 --> 00:11:19.463
this is going to handle this
much better than the other one.

159
00:11:19.463 --> 00:11:23.170
I don't know maybe you have something
where you have a really complicated

160
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.379
component, didmount and putting that all
in effect, doesn't make sense to you.

161
00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:28.494
Makes a ton of sense to me.

162
00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:31.317
I'm very into that you
think that's a good idea.

163
00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:35.401
I think there are probably other companies
where they would tell you just, well,

164
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:36.418
just use an effect.

165
00:11:36.418 --> 00:11:37.687
Let's taste at that point.

166
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.284
Do you have a question, Dustin?

167
00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.687
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you'd just
kinda answered it, but it was,

168
00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:48.655
when should you use a class component
over a functional component?

169
00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.706
&gt;&gt; Taste at this point.

170
00:11:50.706 --> 00:11:54.604
There's no distinct advantage here.

171
00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:58.985
There's some super fine tuning you
can do with performance with a class

172
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:02.425
component that is maybe more
difficult to accomplish.

173
00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:07.133
Cuz there's a thing called
componentshouldupdate,

174
00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:11.336
shouldcomponentupdate, this function here.

175
00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:18.376
Where you can get really fine grain of
like rerender, don't rerender, right?

176
00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:23.260
And if that's important to you when
I'm kind of curious what you're

177
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.483
doing cuz that would be very specialized,
but plausible.

178
00:12:27.483 --> 00:12:32.451
There's no way to as well fine-tune
this in a class component,

179
00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:35.122
sorry, in a function component.

180
00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:39.220
So that's one to keep in mind.
