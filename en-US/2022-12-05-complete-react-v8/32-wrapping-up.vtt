00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.591
This concludes our
complete intro to React.

2
00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:09.081
You now know probably 85% of
everything that React can do.

3
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:13.568
And I'm gonna say you know 99.99%
of what is useful about React.

4
00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:20.715
Everything that I didn't talk about in
React so far is really very edge case.

5
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:25.687
And frequently they are very much for
Facebook's use case and not your use case.

6
00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:29.607
I guess it's something to keep in
mind with React just in general,

7
00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:33.812
React is made by Facebook,
it's made by Facebook for facebook.com.

8
00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:37.142
Most of us don't have Facebook problems,
right?

9
00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:40.776
Even when I worked at Netflix,
Giant Application, lots of App State,

10
00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.150
we still didn't have Facebook's problems.

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.790
Facebook has very peculiar and
interesting problems and

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.533
React solve some of these very elegantly.

13
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.093
So for some of us,
some of these transitions and

14
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.870
stuff that I didn't talk about,
it's gonna be very useful for them.

15
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.012
But for stuff like transitions I've
never personally had to put them in

16
00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:01.541
an application, right?

17
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.903
So, we do talk about that stuff
in the intermediate React v5.

18
00:01:05.903 --> 00:01:09.365
So if you've finished watching
this course and you're here,

19
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.598
I invite you to watch intermediate v5.

20
00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:15.132
There's lots of goodness and
interesting things in there, so

21
00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.874
that when you do need to
use those kinds of tools.

22
00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:20.483
We talked about it and
you'll know exactly what you need.

23
00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:24.910
I'm just gonna give you some suggestions
of where to go now with your learning.

24
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.126
The first one is obviously
take the intermediate course,

25
00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:30.299
I wrote that as a companion to this one.

26
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.693
We actually take this application and
we further build on top of it.

27
00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:37.375
We put things like TypeScript in there,
we put Redux.

28
00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:41.654
I talked about transitions, I talked about
some of the hooks that we didn't use,

29
00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:43.028
lots of goodness things.

30
00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:46.739
Talked about testing, tailwind,
other things like that.

31
00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.159
One of the things that we didn't do
here is there's more results, right?

32
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.096
So if you look at the results
here in your network tab,

33
00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:58.959
you can see that this is
actually giving a response.

34
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.395
It gives you zero through nine, but
you can see that there's 63 results here.

35
00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:06.384
So one of the things you could do here
is go through and paginate results.

36
00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:09.857
So another thing you could do is you could
use a real API, previous versions of

37
00:02:09.857 --> 00:02:12.866
course actually used to teach with
the actual real Petfinder API.

38
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.973
There's actually people that adopted
Pets because of this course,

39
00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:18.900
which I'm pretty happy about.

40
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.085
But they kind of asked me to stop [LAUGH]
because there was a lot of people

41
00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:26.419
generating keys for this and
it's heavy on their API.

42
00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:32.219
But you can go in here and you can hook up
our application to the real Petfinder API,

43
00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.444
and you can see real Pets which
I think is pretty rewarding.

44
00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:39.554
Totally free, they're very happy about it.

45
00:02:39.554 --> 00:02:44.220
They even have a JavaScript STK
here that shouldn't go in use.

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.695
So go ahead and give that a shot,
I think that's really cool.

47
00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:55.598
This is more like an example, responses
they have a lot of stuff in here.

48
00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:58.126
They have names, they have lots of images.

49
00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:01.951
They have like links to actually go and
really adopt the Pet.

50
00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:06.980
Something you can do now as you can deploy
your code, I left some places where you

51
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.955
can deploy that Netlify oversell as your
static web apps Firebase or Amplify.

52
00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:16.434
All very [INAUDIBLE] places fly,
render just a bunch of them.

53
00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:21.353
We didn't do themes, so
maybe go make a dark mode, right?

54
00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:25.473
And you could use context to make a dark
mode, that'd be another good reason.

55
00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:29.968
Add a nav bar, I mean this is
pretty bare bones navigation.

56
00:03:29.968 --> 00:03:34.322
That'd be another good way to
kinda just flex your React skills.

57
00:03:34.322 --> 00:03:39.076
We used VT, but you might try something
like parcel, or snow pack, or

58
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:43.842
maybe use ES build directly,
as opposed to V is using ES build for you.

59
00:03:43.842 --> 00:03:46.860
Or something else If you do, let me know.

60
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.750
Share me either a link to a code Pen or
a GitHub report,

61
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.880
I would love to see what you're doing.

62
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.247
Feel free to tweet at me.

63
00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:56.008
Thanks everyone, thanks for
sticking with me.

64
00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.475
And hopefully, you enjoyed the course.

65
00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:04.031
