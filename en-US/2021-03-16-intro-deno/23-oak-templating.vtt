00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.172
&gt;&gt; One of the key benefits of
web servers is that we can

2
00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:10.420
dynamically compose templates
on the fly and we do.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.234
We use that for
things like querying a database and

4
00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.512
then filling out the page with the data so

5
00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:19.270
that when the user gets it,
the data from the database is in there.

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.640
Sometimes we do that with an AJAX
call does anybody say AJAX anymore?

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.323
Sometimes you do that with an HTTP call,
I'm really old,

8
00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:30.080
and sometimes we do it on the server.

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.101
It's sort of traditional to do it on the
server than doing it over an HTTP calls is

10
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.270
the newer way, we'll do it the older way.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.305
But in order to do that,
we need a templating engine,

12
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.390
because we wanted to find templates.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.794
So we needed a templating engine for Deno,
and we know that Deno has a third party

14
00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:50.470
registry, so let's just go out there and
see what it's got.

15
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.069
So if we look for template, we got
a couple different options, template,

16
00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.962
template_dir and look there's a handlebars
port for Deno which is perfect and

17
00:00:59.962 --> 00:01:02.840
that's the one that I wanna use.

18
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.126
Now, if you scroll down
here there's a view engine,

19
00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:09.850
which is a template view engine for
Deno, which seems like,

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.595
well why don't we just use that,
isn't that what you want?

21
00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:17.545
So the answer is yes and
I did look at this, I think that it's

22
00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:22.310
probably pretty good, but
syntactically is a little bit confusing.

23
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.848
So if I scroll down here, it gets into
adapters and adapter factories and

24
00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:27.360
engines and things like that.

25
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.308
And I thought that it
would be too confusing for

26
00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:34.840
this so, I wanna focus on just what
it's like to use raw handlebars.

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.186
However, I should point out that if
you do use that view engine for Deno,

28
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:42.440
that you'll get things like
caching which is good.

29
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.258
You want caching, you don't want
to have to read that template and

30
00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:50.621
re-compose it every time if the request
is exactly the same, all right, so

31
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:52.320
how do we use this thing?

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.423
Well, let's grab from their example
here and just import it and remember,

33
00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:03.010
we have this deps file here where we're
putting all of our nasty URL imports.

34
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.012
So let's just bring it in and
it's gonna wanna fetch,

35
00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:11.718
so let's do that, fetch, there we go.

36
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.426
While it does that, I'm actually gonna
remove this HandlebarsConfig cuz we don't

37
00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:21.173
actually need this object we're
gonna be fine without it.

38
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:29.538
Okay, and then remember we
need to export the Handlebars,

39
00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:34.631
alright and
did y'all see that it just rearranged,

40
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:39.161
I wonder if the Deno
formatters is doing that?

41
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:43.778
So I did router and if I do Handlebars
when I save it formats, and

42
00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:47.178
it wants them in alphabetical
order [LAUGH], so

43
00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:51.817
it rearranges them all right,
fine no I hit Escape again.

44
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080
All right, so how do we use Handlebars?

45
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.732
Well, we need to create some templates, so

46
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:05.500
let's create a folder in
here called views oops.

47
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.309
And then inside of this,
let's create a folder called layouts,

48
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:16.880
we wanna have a main layout,
we'll just call it main.

49
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.544
And hbs means Handlebars and
then we need to create some HTML here,

50
00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:27.835
we'll just call this Oak, where is it?

51
00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:32.710
Oak Project for our page title and
then what we wanna do is,

52
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.490
we want to render the body
here in the body, so

53
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.420
the way we do that with
Handlebars is like this.

54
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.666
All right, so basically what we're gonna
say is we're gonna find a template and

55
00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.580
we want you to insert
the template in the body.

56
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.572
Of this file but, having this main
layout file we can have a single,

57
00:03:55.572 --> 00:04:01.093
alright let's do this
is-size-1&gt;oak project,

58
00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:05.521
and this will appear on every single page.

59
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:11.339
And then let's include my
most favorite CSS library but

60
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:18.880
it doesn't work in Handlebars cuz this
is not there we go, no this is not HTML.

61
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.095
So we'll just have to go
with unstyled content,

62
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:28.164
all right, so we have this main file,

63
00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:31.866
let's create a index.hbs file.

64
00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:35.002
And what we wanna do is have
some content in this index file,

65
00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.330
which we can then insert
into the main file.

66
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.126
And so
what we're gonna do in our Handlebars

67
00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:47.670
index file here is, pull in some markup.

68
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.869
And what we're gonna do is we're
gonna pass data to this template,

69
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.937
we're gonna pass an object called title.

70
00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:59.053
And then the title will be
displayed out in the page and

71
00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:03.550
this content will be inserted
into this page templating.

72
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.959
Alright, to make that happen,
let's create a new folder and

73
00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.948
call it utils and then we wanna
create a Handlebars utility here, so

74
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.140
let's just call it hsb.ts Handlebars.

75
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.648
Alright, so
first we wanna import Handlebars

76
00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:29.490
from our depths file deps.ts, lovely.

77
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.421
And then what we need to do
is say const handlebars, or

78
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:35.860
let's just call it hbs is
equals new Handlebars.

79
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.152
And we have to pass a configuration
object to Handlebars,

80
00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:46.700
so our baseDir is just the base,
what else do we want?

81
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.466
A compilerOptions we can just
leave this as undefined,

82
00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:53.980
cuz we're not doing it,
what else do we need?

83
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.539
Defaultlayout is called main,
extname is just hbs,

84
00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.985
the helpers we're not using the helpers so

85
00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:07.210
we'll set that to undefined.

86
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.690
The layoutsDir is called layouts,

87
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.550
we just call it layouts and
then partialsDir is nothing.

88
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.518
We don't have a partials directory
we're not gonna deal with partial

89
00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:21.280
templates here.

90
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.027
So just let me make sure I
got all that syntax correct,

91
00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:31.881
I think we did, but
what we should be able to do now is render

92
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:37.220
our template using this hps.ts file,
so how can we do that?

93
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.031
Let's come back over to our indexRouter
and then here what we want to do is.

94
00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:47.025
Instead of just rendering this out,
what we wanna do is pull in of our hbs, so

95
00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:48.130
let's pull in.

96
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.638
And in fact, we need to,
I forgot to export it, let's do this,

97
00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:59.168
export default hbs and then we can
import it and use it over here.

98
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.919
[SOUND] Okay?

99
00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.848
[SOUND] So let's get,

100
00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:10.545
it's default, so we can just do,

101
00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:15.850
we should be able to just do hbs,

102
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.570
yes okay and then let's do.

103
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.411
Hbs what we wanna do is
await hbs.renderView, and

104
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.270
we're gonna render the index view and

105
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.472
then we're gonna pass a title object and
we'll just say Oak, okay.

106
00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:38.625
So now instead of just sending out text,
we are sending a render template,

107
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:44.194
so we're actually dynamically
composing the page on the server and

108
00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:47.530
sending that back and we air it out here.

109
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.800
Because our watch process,
I'm not confident about this,

110
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.393
let me run this again.

111
00:07:57.332 --> 00:08:02.405
Alright, now we're listening so
let's try this and

112
00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:08.843
see if you got all this right go
to 3000 my god [LAUGH] all right.

113
00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:13.004
We got not found so let's see,
what's going on here,

114
00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:17.548
let's take a look at one of
the things that we can do here is.

115
00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:18.971
On the layouts,

116
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:25.570
one of the things we can do is we can
create an empty partials directory.

117
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.996
And that will let us sort of opt
out of this configuration object,

118
00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:34.030
you have to have a partials directory or
else the air is out.

119
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.397
And just take the defaults,
but let's let's try

120
00:08:40.397 --> 00:08:46.198
this then we just need const
hbs equals new Handlebars.

121
00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:51.478
Okay, and then there we go,
let's try it now,

122
00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:55.174
there we go, Oak Project, Oak,

123
00:08:55.174 --> 00:09:00.190
Welcome to Oak,
it's not some pretty digits
