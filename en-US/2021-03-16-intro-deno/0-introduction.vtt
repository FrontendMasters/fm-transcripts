00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:05.361
Well, welcome to this
course Deno first look.

2
00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:11.020
The objective of this course is to
help you understand what Deno is,

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.803
and why on earth we need yet
another JavaScript runtime.

4
00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:17.890
I mean, isn't that good enough?

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.680
Why is that not good enough?

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.240
Why do we need another?

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.133
And then also,

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:26.630
what I wanna do is help you understand
how to build applications with Deno.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.240
And so we're going to
actually look at doing that.

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.466
And we're gonna do that later on today and

11
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.360
do something practical where
we're gonna build a website.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.880
And do you think like templating, and
routing and all the things that you would

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.690
normally need to build both backend and
frontend sort of a full stack application.

14
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.666
Depending on when you watch this,
Deno may or may not have gained enough

15
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:57.970
popularity in the JavaScript
community to be really prolific.

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.582
The truth is that we don't
know if it ever will.

17
00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:04.755
There's just no way to know what
things catch on and what things don't.

18
00:01:04.755 --> 00:01:08.464
But my hope is that going through
this course will help you so

19
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:13.156
that if it does you're not caught on
your heels and that you're prepared.

20
00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:18.669
Either way, today just might open your
your mind into considering a different

21
00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:24.200
JavaScript runtime because Dino
really does things very differently.

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.728
If nothing else, it's going to cause

23
00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:31.080
you to think about the things you
already know in a different way.

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.790
And that's always good.

25
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.690
So who should you be for this this course?

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.317
You should be a JavaScript developer
with some knowledge of Node.js.

27
00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:46.780
I think I'm posturing that's
probably most of you out there.

28
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.719
If you work with JavaScript, you do work
with node in some form or fashion, and

29
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.550
that's because node is used to build
pretty much every website these days.

30
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.920
It's used to build front end applications.

31
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.161
We're use it for tooling on the on
the command line, right like linting and

32
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:05.216
web packing and Our frontend apps and
CL eyes and things of that nature.

33
00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:09.670
Almost everybody that does JavaScript
is familiar with node or NPM and

34
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.658
NPM packages.

35
00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:18.619
If you're very familiar with node as
in like you build web applications

36
00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:23.972
with it specifically with like
an express or the COA framework.

37
00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:27.324
This course will be particularly relevant
to you because the application that we

38
00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:30.640
build is going to try to mirror some of
the concepts that you already know there.

39
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.224
And a lot of what we're gonna do today,
we're gonna compare back to node,

40
00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:37.880
because that's the only
baseline that we have.

41
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.960
in which to do that that's the only other
JavaScript runtime that I'm aware of.

42
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.860
I'm sure there are others.

43
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.625
But that's really sort of
the reality that we have.

44
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.616
That's the world we live in.

45
00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:49.548
And so that's the lens through
which we're gonna view things.

46
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:57.600
TypeScript would also be a plus if you
know TypeScript, that's gonna be a plus.

47
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.833
Although it's not specifically required,
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time

48
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:08.080
getting into the minutiae of TypeScript,
because there's just a lot of it.

49
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.634
And there's quite a bit of it that leaks
into Deno because TypeScript is a first

50
00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:14.019
class citizen in Deno.

51
00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.180
But my feeling on TypeScript is that If
we spend too much time talking about that

52
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.144
instead of Deno and
getting caught up in those details,

53
00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:24.928
that it's really distracting from
understanding the core principles

54
00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:27.094
of Deno and I don't wanna do that to you.

55
00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:28.397
I don't wanna confuse you.

56
00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:29.713
I wanna excite you.

57
00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:34.040
So some knowledge of TypeScript will
be helpful but it isn't required and

58
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.670
plain JavaScript works just
fine in TypeScript as it is.

59
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.430
So I don't wanna get too hung up there.

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.730
But we will be writing
mostly TypeScript today.

61
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.634
Although we're gonna stay away from
the complex constructs in TypeScript,

62
00:03:45.634 --> 00:03:48.226
like things like interfaces and
things like that.

63
00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:51.031
We just not gonna talk about that.

64
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.542
If you wanna get a general
knowledge of TypeScript,

65
00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:57.537
there's a video here I've included in the
course materials from Anders Hiles Berg

66
00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:01.608
when they first announced it, it's about
an hour long, it's really all you need.

67
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.409
If you wanna understand typeScript and
excellent video,

68
00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.296
I highly recommend watching that, and

69
00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:10.086
you'll know pretty much everything you
need to know to work with typeScript.

70
00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:16.081
All right,
The last time that I did a course here,

71
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:19.913
I got a lot of pairs are mistakes
that I made throughout.

72
00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:22.230
And I'm sure that I'll see
them today as we go along.

73
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.532
You'll see them too.

74
00:04:23.532 --> 00:04:26.650
Most of them will probably
be grammatical errors.

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.368
I tend to confuse it and
it's all the time.

76
00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:33.717
For some reason after 42 years of being
alive, I still can't get that right.

77
00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:34.264
[LAUGH] So

78
00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:38.880
what I would like to ask is that if
you're going through this course and

79
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.375
you see mistakes, you'll see things that
I can't because I just can't see them.

80
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:49.154
If you would open a poll request or
file an issue on the Deno

81
00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:53.649
first look repo,
I would very much appreciate that.

82
00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:57.555
If you wanna get in touch with me you can
find me on Twitter you can contact me

83
00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.836
there if you wanna just
hit me up directly.

84
00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:04.558
I'm just bird calm and on Twitter although
I do try to avoid social media because I

85
00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:07.552
want to be happy,
I don't want to be upset and sad.

86
00:05:07.552 --> 00:05:09.420
So I tried to stay away from that.

87
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.214
My name is Berg and
I'm a content engineer at Microsoft, and

88
00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:20.140
that's where I do in my day to day job
is primarily advocacy around VS code.

89
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.950
I spent a lot of time working with the VS
code team, GitHub, and also Azure,

90
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.070
and then all things JavaScript.

91
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.326
So there's quite a few JavaScript folks
at Microsoft, and we have a very strong

92
00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:37.348
sort of sub community inside of
Microsoft that includes folks from TC39,

93
00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:40.980
and folks from NPM, and
all of the different areas.

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.099
And we work really, really hard to make
Microsoft, and all of the things that we

95
00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.290
build at Microsoft a great place for
JavaScript developers.

96
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.905
I've been a JavaScript developer for
about 12 years.

97
00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:56.050
That's a long time,
I'm dating myself, that's okay.

98
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.990
I actually started as a C# developer.

99
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.780
Well, that's not true.

100
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.680
I did VB 6 and then I moved to C# and
I did C# for a while.

101
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.520
And I never really liked it because I
never really felt like I was good at it.

102
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.065
I was reading books all the time, and
I was really trying to learn it, but

103
00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:17.340
it always made me feel like I
never could quite get it right.

104
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.619
And I was never gonna be great.

105
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:24.086
And then about the time that jQuery
came out, I really got into JavaScript.

106
00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:28.267
I love JavaScript because
it makes me feel so

107
00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:32.225
smart and
it makes me feel like I can do it.

108
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:32.971
And I love that.

109
00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:38.183
And I think that JavaScript is bizarrely
suited for applications of all types,

110
00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:41.858
browser apps, server apps,
large apps, small apps.

111
00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:46.173
To me JavaScript is so
cool because it takes all of the rules.

112
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.596
All of the things that we know
about programming languages,

113
00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.267
basically throw them all out the window.

114
00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:56.410
And what we're left with is is this thing
that it's just a beautiful disaster.

115
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.180
I love it so much.

116
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.170
I love teaching because it's really
the best way to learn something.

117
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.530
If you can explain something to someone,

118
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.610
then then you probably
understand it yourself.

119
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.120
Otherwise you can't explain it.

120
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.644
It also lets me connect with people
like all you folks here today,

121
00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.110
which is awesome.

122
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.600
And through that I've learned that we are
a lot more alike than we are different.

123
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.805
Mostly I would say that everyone learning,
I'm learning.

124
00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:30.545
So if you feel like that you don't get it,
I promise you, you're not alone.

125
00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:32.103
I don't get it most of the time either.

126
00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:33.211
So there's at least two of us.

127
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:34.700
If you feel like that, it's you and me.

128
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.403
There's at least two, you're not alone.

129
00:07:37.403 --> 00:07:41.871
I have this diagram that I always refer
back to, which I think is very poetic that

130
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.806
I always feel like I'm on the left that
like what I know is just like this

131
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:49.631
small subset and everybody else knows so
much more than what I know.

132
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:53.902
But actually, what I know and what other
people know probably equal size and

133
00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:57.053
we just overlap in some places,
some places we don't.

134
00:07:57.053 --> 00:08:03.016
And so I love this diagram it
makes me feel better about myself.

135
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:07.913
I live in Nashville, Tennessee which
is scientifically the greatest

136
00:08:07.913 --> 00:08:12.652
city in the United States,
that's science I didn't make that up.

137
00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:16.419
I have three teenage boys, and two pugs.

138
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.890
I'm a huge fan of Overwatch.

139
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.680
I play it a lot, probably too much.

140
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.210
I mean the Wrecking Ball.

141
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.113
I know a lot of people don't
like the Wrecking Ball.

142
00:08:26.113 --> 00:08:30.669
They tell me all the time when we lose for
some reason.

143
00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:35.987
I also do some woodworking, some crafting,
amateur, build some pieces of furniture.

144
00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:40.182
My wife on occasion will ask for things
like hey, can you make me a bench for

145
00:08:40.182 --> 00:08:42.288
the bathroom and then I'll do that.

146
00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:47.291
It's woodworking and coding have
a lot in common as soon as knitting.

147
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.968
If you've never tried knitting before,
I'd encourage you to do that.

148
00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:54.786
If you like coding, you can go to
the craft store and buy these like round,

149
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.977
loom knits to make hats and yarn.

150
00:08:56.977 --> 00:09:01.186
And you'll find that the process of
knitting and coding is very, very similar

151
00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:05.217
that it can it engages the same part
of your brain, it's very fulfilling.

152
00:09:05.217 --> 00:09:09.720
So my friend Brian kedleston got
me into that, it's kind of cool.

153
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.570
Again, if you'd like to connect,
you can find me on Twitter.

154
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.760
Although I'm not there a lot,
I do try to avoid it.

155
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.500
I also put my email
address directly in here.

156
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.070
If you'd like to email me directly, that's
probably a better way to contact me.

157
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.328
And I would love to hear from you,
I do read my emails.

158
00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:26.289
I will respond and
I would love to hear from you.

159
00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.997
Why do we create this course?

160
00:09:30.997 --> 00:09:35.183
I think that the key to staying
sane as a JavaScript developer.

161
00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:38.231
Well in tact, but
it's even more exacerbated for

162
00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:41.944
JavaScript developers is to be
open to learning new things.

163
00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:43.710
And it's also good to learn in forget,

164
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.309
a lot of times you feel like I don't know
if I should invest time into doing that.

165
00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:50.127
Because what if it doesn't end up being
a thing and then I spent all this time

166
00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:52.960
learning it and then now I've
forgotten it and I don't use it.

167
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.060
I actually think that's not a bad thing.

168
00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.474
You will pick up things that stay with you
that will pay dividends down the road.

169
00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:08.372
Deno maybe just a ripple in the vast
ocean of JavaScript and tech.

170
00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:11.746
Or it may become the actual ocean.

171
00:10:11.746 --> 00:10:13.223
I mean, we just don't know.

172
00:10:13.223 --> 00:10:17.684
And the fact that we don't know
causes us distress because

173
00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:20.972
we're always trying to, we want to know.

174
00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:25.076
Learning something about
Deno will remove the fear.

175
00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:26.105
Then you might have about it.

176
00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:30.437
And this is true for actually anything
in life, I've discovered is that,

177
00:10:30.437 --> 00:10:34.721
if it scares you, if you learn more
about it, it won't scare you as much.

178
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:37.343
It takes the power away from the fear.

179
00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:39.416
So try that out.

180
00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:42.628
There's also no idea that should be off
the table when it comes to technology,

181
00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:43.414
I do believe that.

182
00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:47.257
So I think we should look at all of them
and then pick the one that's right for

183
00:10:47.257 --> 00:10:49.640
you, your team, your brain, your project.

184
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.294
There's no one right answer only
the answer that's right for you.

185
00:10:54.294 --> 00:10:57.977
There have been so
many instances of this in technology,

186
00:10:57.977 --> 00:11:02.966
a great one is from the React project
where when I was first writing JavaScript

187
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:07.879
people always said never, ever put
your JavaScript in your HTML together,

188
00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.979
you need to separate those out.

189
00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:11.950
You they used to call it
unobtrusive JavaScript.

190
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.926
And then some guy said, Well, yeah, but
what if we put the HTML in the JavaScript

191
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:19.370
file, which is an insane idea,
that's an insane idea.

192
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.518
But today, we just call that
JSX that's just react and

193
00:11:22.518 --> 00:11:24.920
we do that we don't think twice about it.

194
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.940
Bit and so we have to be willing to
embrace these sort of ideas that sound

195
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.840
kind of crazy because they may not
be as crazy as as we think they are.

196
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.818
I have another course on front end
masters called VS code can do that.

197
00:11:38.818 --> 00:11:42.588
If you'd like to check that out, it's
all about what you can do with VS code,

198
00:11:42.588 --> 00:11:43.940
it's completely free.

199
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.200
It's open to everyone no
subscription is required.

200
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.640
So you can check that out.

201
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.580
So thank you for being here with me today.

202
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:58.580
And that I hope you enjoy this
course this Deno first look.

203
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.630
By the way it is pronounced Dino,
not deno I wasn't sure about that.

204
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.504
So last night I went back to my room and

205
00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:08.620
I watched a video from the creator
of deno and he pronounces the Deno.

206
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.466
So I don't know if it's one of
those things where both Deno and

207
00:12:11.466 --> 00:12:12.342
Dyno are correct,

208
00:12:12.342 --> 00:12:16.200
but we're gonna say Deno is the right way
to say it, since that's how Ryan says it.
