00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.450
All right, let's talk about some of
the tooling that's available with Deno.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.112
Because in order to be effective with
a language, you need good tooling and

3
00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:10.850
Deno has got some remarkably good tooling.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.290
So tooling for Deno is available
in the form of a VSCode extension.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.870
All right, so
let's take a look at that extension here.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.340
I'm gonna just search in the Extension
gallery for the Deno extension.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.390
So here's Deno from denoland support for
VSCode, here it is.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.660
I've already got it installed.

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.910
Now, once you install it,
you actually have to enable it.

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.891
So we need to open up workspace settings
which this file's been deleted, so

11
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:43.470
that's fine.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.000
So let's go to workspace settings.

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.426
And then you need to come in and

14
00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:56.949
you need to say deno.enable is true.

15
00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.010
By default it's not enabled which I find
very strange but that's just how it works.

16
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.506
Then the other thing is that
I have had to reload my

17
00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:10.840
editor in order to get it
to pick up this change.

18
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.344
Also, I am unable to get
the extension to work by adding that

19
00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:18.520
setting to my global user settings.

20
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.146
So my first thought was, well,
I'll put it in my user settings just so

21
00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:24.100
it applies to Deno everywhere.

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.020
But that doesn't appear to work
unless they've updated the extension.

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.370
It only appears to work, at least for
me, in the workspace settings.

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.320
Now, after we've done this,
we'll have Deno support inside a VSCode.

25
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
And we know that because we can
look if there's a Deno object.

26
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.689
And then, if you hit dot, you can see all
of the things that are on the Deno object.

27
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.226
And so this is the extension providing
you with a lot of different tooling for

28
00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.356
Deno but this is just sort of
proof that it is working so

29
00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:55.210
that you know that you've got it right.

30
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.303
The other thing that it gives
you is a debugger for Deno,

31
00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:01.489
which is gonna be important.

32
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.116
It also is going to give you
the ability to fetch dependencies,

33
00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:09.870
which is going to be kind of important.

34
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.600
And then it has this thing that
it looks like they've just added,

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.840
which is a dependencies view.

36
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.862
So this is great,

37
00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:21.694
there shouldn't be anything here
cuz we're not doing anything.

38
00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:24.870
But I don't know, we'll see what
shows up in this panel later on.

39
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.510
But this is new.

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.190
Looks like they've just
added this which is cool.
