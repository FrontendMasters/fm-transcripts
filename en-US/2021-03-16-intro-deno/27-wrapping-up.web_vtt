00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.701
That is your first look at Deno folks.

2
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:11.388
From its philosophy about how
it thinks about dependencies,

3
00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:16.164
how it thinks about security,
how it puts TypeScript first and

4
00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:18.247
it really focuses on that.

5
00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.468
And the way that it sort
of asks you to rethink,

6
00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:28.328
the paradigms that you're already
familiar with in node.js.

7
00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:33.316
I hope that it's open your mind a little
bit to doing things differently,

8
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:37.507
when I first started working with
Deno I did not like it at all.

9
00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:42.364
But after putting this course together,
I like it quite a bit,

10
00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:46.594
I like it a lot, and
I think that it has a lot of promise.

11
00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:50.705
I don't know that it will take off but
I think that it might,

12
00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.346
I think it has a really good chance to.

13
00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:58.234
Thank you for being here with me today,
you can find me on Twitter,

14
00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:03.840
you can emailed me directly, and
I I'd love to hear from you, so thank you.
