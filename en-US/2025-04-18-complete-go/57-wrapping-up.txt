>> Melkey: That's the entirety of the course as it stands. And I think we've done quite a bit know. The first kind of section of the course, we really looked into preliminary Go, introduced syntax to Go for some people who maybe never written go before. And then we actually just from scratch, created this entire project with an API layer, an app layer, a middleware, entire routes.

[00:00:23]
A way to roll your own off and handle the tokens with migrations, composing it with tests, and there's quite a bit more. So something I wanted to do is kinda eat my own dog food here. As much as I love paws, I think they are great, what I really like is people to do things on their own and discover things on their own.

[00:00:47]
And so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna push the current live repo into the live repo. You guys can see as it stands. But what I'm also going to do is add additional material that I really want everyone, as an added bonus, to check out on their own time.

[00:01:04]
And this added advanced material is to include more testing on both the database side and even API side, and testing more of the mock function. It's also gonna include optimistic concurrency locking. So what if we get two requests at the same time? What do we do? And it's also going to include SQL query timeouts, right?

[00:01:26]
So every query that we have right now in our database store, it adheres to the HTTP server idle, read, and write timeouts. And so, I want to showcase how we can quickly add context with a time up to control the granularity of our SQL definitions. But yeah, thank you for sticking with me for two days, and I appreciate Frontend Masters for doing this.
