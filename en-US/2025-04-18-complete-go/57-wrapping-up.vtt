&gt;&gt; Melkey: That's the entirety
of the course as it stands.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.486
And I think we've done quite a bit.

3
00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:10.151
The first kind of section of the course,
we really looked into preliminary go,

4
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.552
introduced syntax to go for some people
who maybe never written go before.

5
00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:20.009
And then we actually just from scratch,
created this entire project

6
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.091
with an API layer and app layer,
a middleware, entire routes,

7
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:30.265
a way to roll your own auth and
handle the tokens with migrations,

8
00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:34.808
composing it with tests, and
there's quite a bit more.

9
00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:38.529
But with all that,
it was awesome having to do this course.

10
00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:41.997
And if anybody has any questions,
I'll gladly answer them and

11
00:00:41.997 --> 00:00:43.704
help anyone out through that.

00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:48.778
