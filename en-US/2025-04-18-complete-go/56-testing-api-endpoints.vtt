1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.056
&gt;&gt; Melkey: So we just finished kind of
doing some finishing touches on our

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:05.149
workout store.

3
00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.604
And so in the following part of
the course, the kind of final parts,

4
00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:16.062
we're gonna go through all of
the different scenarios of curling,

5
00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:18.858
all of the endpoints that we have.

6
00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:24.162
So if you see, in the post notes
dot txt underneath section 3.5

7
00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:30.347
we have a ton of different curls that
we're gonna be exploring here, okay?

8
00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:34.050
So if you want to follow along,
this is what we're going to be doing, and

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.628
I'm gonna be on annotating
everything that I do.

10
00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:41.332
So first, let's go ahead and quickly just
tear down and tear up the go server.

11
00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.702
So go run main dot go.

12
00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:47.920
Any obvious issues, no, it's still
on version five, which is great.

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.770
The next part,
we still have Docker compose running.

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.580
So our DB is running and
we still have psql, okay?

15
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.330
So again, we can check select all from
workouts, everything's fairly empty.

16
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.205
Select all from users.

17
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:07.893
We have two users, John and Jack,
which we will not be caring about, okay?

18
00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.436
We're gonna be making
some brand new users.

19
00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:13.880
We can still use them if you want,
but I'm gonna prefer to just

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.403
create new ones just to check if
everything works as it should.

21
00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:21.176
I'm gonna make this new terminal,
I'm gonna clear my terminal.

22
00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:26.875
And then the first request I'm gonna
be making is creating a new user.

23
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.597
So if we go back into the section 3.5,

24
00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:35.529
there's this curl request
here to create a new user.

25
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.210
This one has this John Doe,
I'm gonna just change this.

26
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.115
Let's change this to Melkey.

27
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:46.357
All right, and
let's change this to melky@example.com,

28
00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:48.991
let's go ahead and grab this.

29
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:55.155
Go back here, if we paste it,
we now have our melkey user, okay?

30
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:58.576
This is good, we know we at
least haven't regressed, right?

31
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.213
There's nothing that mess this up for us.

32
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.954
&gt;&gt; Melkey: Next thing is now
we know the username, melkey.

33
00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:08.808
I'm gonna go back to the post here, and

34
00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:12.623
the second curl request we
have is to authenticate.

35
00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:16.116
I'm going to go ahead and grab this, I'm
gonna go over here, I'm gonna paste it.

36
00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.750
I'm gonna make some changes, so

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.123
it's no longer username john doe,
it's gonna be username Melkey.

38
00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:28.669
All right, press enter,
we have our auth token.

39
00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.545
Now what I'm gonna do, is I'm just gonna
quickly, just copy this auth token and

40
00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:33.235
go back here.

41
00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:40.646
I'm gonna make another separate note
that just says, text or tokens dot text.

42
00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:44.706
You don't need to necessarily do this, but

43
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:49.543
to demonstrate and
have user Melkey and token here.

44
00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:53.449
Okay, so this is a token associated
with Melkey, it's a lot for 24 hours,

45
00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.387
it's something that we can control.

46
00:02:55.387 --> 00:03:00.019
We can, again, double check,
select all from tokens, there you go.

47
00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.375
User ID three, that's Melkey,
expires this time.

48
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.720
The scope is authentication and
it's hashed.

49
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.606
Cool, we've also already seen this,

50
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.499
it's nothing really new to us, okay?

51
00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.746
Now if I go back to post nose,

52
00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:21.570
you should see that we have this other
request to create a workout, okay?

53
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.948
So I'm gonna go ahead and
just copy this, I'm gonna go over here,

54
00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:27.520
I'm gonna paste this.

55
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.991
Now, if I run it with this bearer,
this is a completely different token.

56
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.331
This token is not the one
I just copied over here.

57
00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:35.988
They're very different, right?

58
00:03:35.988 --> 00:03:42.352
This one begins RV-7, and this is one
that I stored from many moons ago.

59
00:03:42.352 --> 00:03:46.140
So if I run this,
token expired or invalid.

60
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.598
Good, okay, so we have some letter
protection for people trying to create

61
00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:55.287
workouts that they can't, their token
expired or the permissions changed.

62
00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:58.575
So I rerun that exact same command.

63
00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:03.426
But this time I changed the bearer
from that old random one

64
00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.771
that's in the postnotes dot txt file.

65
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:09.666
And just bear with me as I go ahead and
delete this.

66
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:14.196
Okay, if I go back here,
I'm gonna go grab the one that

67
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:18.444
starts with RV-7,
the one we just saw me create.

68
00:04:18.444 --> 00:04:20.529
If I send this now,
we have this new workout, okay?

69
00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.533
So workout ID 3, user ID 3, jogging,
I'm not a big fan of jogging.

70
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:33.406
Select all from workouts, you can see here
now my morning cardio, it belongs to me.

71
00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:38.948
Select all from work out underscore,
entries.

72
00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:41.861
&gt;&gt; Melkey: You can see
that we have jogging.

73
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:45.205
Okay, cool, so that's pretty nice,
that's pretty cool.

74
00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:52.040
We have a way to allow people who are
logged in correctly to make modifications.

75
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.127
All right, that's pretty awesome.

76
00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:58.206
Now that we know this
workout belongs to me,

77
00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:01.380
I'm going to do is I'm
gonna make a new user.

78
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.273
Let's go all the way back to our post
underscore notes and let's go here.

79
00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:10.021
This is a request to create a user, right?

80
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:12.083
So I've already created a username,
Melkey.

81
00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:15.273
If I paste this, let's go ahead and
make a new username.

82
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.638
We're gonna call this one dustin,
all right?

83
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:24.105
&gt;&gt; Melkey: It should be
dustin@example.com, okay?

84
00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:26.524
If I click enter again,
we know this works.

85
00:05:26.524 --> 00:05:31.056
We have our new user, dustin cool,
and let's give dustin a token.

86
00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:37.651
So, let's authenticate, let's grab this.

87
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.022
If you go over here, username,
let's just put dustin here.

88
00:05:48.397 --> 00:05:50.851
&gt;&gt; Melkey: Cool, we have the new
auth token that belongs to Dustin.

89
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.733
So now let's grab this.

90
00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:58.692
Let's go back here into the tokens dot
txt node to remove this annoying line.

91
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:03.304
So now user,
this one belongs to a Dustin, and

92
00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:06.627
their token is like that, okay?

93
00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:11.187
So two very different tokens,
one is RV-7, the other one's SYL.

94
00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:15.649
So the thing I want to validate is,
can Dustin update my workout,

95
00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.501
or can Dustin delete my workout, right?

96
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.764
Everything we just did, we have to kind
of go back and fix it, it's gonna suck.

97
00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:23.770
However, if you can't,

98
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.394
then we know that we have everything
working accordingly, right?

99
00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:29.662
We've already validated that anonymous
users can't do things that they're not

100
00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:30.287
allowed to do.

101
00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:32.453
We've already validated
the validity of tokens.

102
00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:37.081
Now we need to make sure
that we check that owners

103
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:40.908
truly can update an owner's workout.

104
00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:44.723
So here and quickly clear this just so
we have more room.

105
00:06:44.723 --> 00:06:51.568
Go back to post notes, and in here, we
should have this pull request right here.

106
00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:56.173
So the last coral request in that file,
I'm gonna go ahead and copy this,

107
00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:57.527
I'm gonna paste it.

108
00:06:57.527 --> 00:06:59.102
Few things we need to change.

109
00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:04.788
So here, instead of workout 6,
I believe if we go here,

110
00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:10.957
it is what select all from workouts,
it is workout 3, okay?

111
00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:16.207
So the ID of that workout is three,
and quickly replace this.

112
00:07:16.207 --> 00:07:20.815
[COUGH] you can see the content
of the body is updated cardio.

113
00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:24.727
So instead of jogging,
I realized I was actually walking.

114
00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:29.368
And over here, I'm gonna bring
back Dustin's token credentials.

115
00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:33.550
And we know Dustin did not create
this workout the initial work,

116
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.651
I did not create workout three.

117
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:38.109
So if I paste this and I run this,

118
00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:42.312
you're not authorized to
update this workout right?

119
00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:46.302
Which is expected, because now we actually
have the logic that extracts the token.

120
00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.291
We know who the user belongs to.

121
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:53.595
And if we kind of go back and
remove Dustin's SYL

122
00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:58.240
token,
&gt;&gt; Melkey: And we go over here and

123
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.927
grab Melkey's token that
is definitely not expired.

124
00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:08.115
Go here and paste it, and if you run this,
we now updated the cardio,

125
00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:12.332
and we can validate this from
select all from workouts.

126
00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:16.399
And now it says updated cardio,
a relaxed 45 minute walk after dinner.
