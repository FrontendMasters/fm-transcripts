1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.353
&gt;&gt; Melkey: So we just finished,

2
00:00:01.353 --> 00:00:05.046
kinda doing some finishing
touches on our workout store.

3
00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:10.450
And so in the following part of
the course, the kinda final parts,

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.952
we're gonna go through all of
the different scenarios of curling,

5
00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.772
all of the endpoints that we have.

6
00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:23.855
So if you see in the post
notes.txt underneath section 3.5

7
00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:30.127
we have a ton of different curls that
we're gonna be exploring here, okay?

8
00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:33.646
So if you wanna follow along,
this is what we're going to be doing.

9
00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:36.551
And I'm gonna be on annotating
everything that I do.

10
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:41.260
So first, let's go ahead and quickly just
tear down and tear up the Go server.

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.643
So Go run main.go.

12
00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.094
Any obvious issues?

13
00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.860
No, it's still on version 5,
which is great.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.839
The next part, we still have Docker
Compose running, so our DB is running.

15
00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.503
And we still have PL/SQL, okay?

16
00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:58.055
So again,
we can check select all from workouts.

17
00:00:58.055 --> 00:00:59.211
Everything's fairly empty.

18
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:03.628
Select all from users,
we have two users, John and

19
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:07.851
Jack, which we will not be caring about,
okay?

20
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.395
We're gonna be making
some brand new users.

21
00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:14.899
We can still use them if you want, but I'm
gonna prefer to just create new ones just

22
00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.272
to check if everything works as it should.

23
00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:21.016
I'm gonna make this new terminal,
I'm gonna clear my terminal.

24
00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:26.694
And then the first request I'm gonna
be making is creating a new user.

25
00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:30.314
So if we go back into the section 3.5,

26
00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:35.108
there's this curl request
here to create a new user.

27
00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:37.988
This one has this John Doe,
I'm gonna just change this.

28
00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:41.569
Let's change this to Melkey, all right?

29
00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.085
And let's change this
to melkey@example.com.

30
00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:48.927
Let's go ahead and grab this.

31
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:49.764
Go back here.

32
00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:53.798
If we paste it,
we now have our Melkey user, okay?

33
00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:56.403
Nothing should be, this is good.

34
00:01:56.403 --> 00:01:58.551
We know we at least haven't regressed,
right?

35
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.629
There's nothing that mess this up for us.

36
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.679
Next thing is now we know the username,
Melkey.

37
00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.533
I'm gonna go back to the post here, and

38
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:12.351
the second curl request we
have is to authenticate.

39
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:14.026
I'm gonna go ahead and grab this.

40
00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.422
I'm gonna go over here.

41
00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:16.192
I'm gonna paste it.

42
00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:21.274
I'm gonna make some changes so
it's no longer username John Doe,

43
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.733
it's gonna be username Melkey, all right?

44
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:28.684
Press enter, we have our auth token.

45
00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:32.470
Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
quickly, just copy this auth token and

46
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.147
go back here.

47
00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:38.549
I'm gonna make another separate
note that just says text or

48
00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.630
tokens.txt, you don't need
to necessarily do this,

49
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.807
but to demonstrate and have user,
Melkey, and token here, okay?

50
00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:51.685
So this is a token associated with Melkey.

51
00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:53.474
It's a lot for 24 hours.

52
00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:55.270
It's something that we can control.

53
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.922
We can again double check,
select all from tokens, there you go.

54
00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:03.235
User_id 3, that's Melkey,
expires this time.

55
00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.057
The scope is authentication and
it's hashed, cool.

56
00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:12.479
We also already seen this,
it's nothing really new to us, okay?

57
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.001
Now, if I go back to post nose,

58
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:21.035
you should see that we have this other
request to create a workout, okay?

59
00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:25.805
So I'm gonna go ahead and
just copy this, I'm gonna go over here,

60
00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.520
I'm gonna paste this.

61
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.054
Now, if I run it with this bearer,
this is a complete different token,

62
00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:35.168
this token is not the one
I just copied over here.

63
00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:36.105
They're very different, right?

64
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:42.326
This one begins RV7, and this is one
that I stored from many moons ago.

65
00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:46.642
So, if I run this token expired or
invalid, good, okay?

66
00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:50.921
So we have some little protection for
people trying to create workouts

67
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.143
that they can't, their token expired or
the permissions changed.

68
00:03:55.143 --> 00:04:00.669
So I rerun that exact same command,
but this time I changed the bearer

69
00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.338
from that old random one
that's in post notes.txt file,

70
00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:09.930
and just bear with me as I go ahead and
delete this, okay?

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.725
If I go back here, I'm gonna go
grab the one that starts with RV7,

72
00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:18.326
the one we just saw me create.

73
00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:20.453
If I send this,
now we have this new workout, okay?

74
00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:23.069
So workout id 3, user_id 3.

75
00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.400
Jogging, I'm not a big fan of jogging.

76
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.335
Select all from workouts.

77
00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.534
Can see here now my morning cardio.

78
00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:33.249
It belongs to me.

79
00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:40.776
Select all from work out_entries.

80
00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:41.801
You can see that we have jogging.

81
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:42.402
Okay, cool.

82
00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:45.295
So, that's pretty nice,
that's pretty cool.

83
00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:51.846
We have a way to allow people who are
logged in correctly to make modifications.

84
00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:54.227
All right, that's that's pretty awesome.

85
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.453
Now that we know this
workout belongs to me,

86
00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.125
what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna make a new user.

87
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:07.086
Let's go all the way back to our
post_notes, and let's go here.

88
00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:09.919
Again, this is a request to create a user,
right?

89
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.845
So I've already created username, Melkey.

90
00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:15.037
If I paste this, let's go ahead and
make a new username.

91
00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:19.862
We're gonna call this one Dustin,
all right?

92
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:23.449
It's gonna be dustin@example.com, okay?

93
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.413
If I click enter, again,
we know this works.

94
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:28.287
We have our new user, Dustin, cool.

95
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:30.884
And let's give Dustin a token.

96
00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:34.360
So let's authenticate, let's grab this.

97
00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:41.565
&gt;&gt; Melkey: You go over here,
username, let's just put Dustin here.

98
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.782
&gt;&gt; Melkey: Cool, we have the new
auth token that belongs to Dustin.

99
00:05:50.782 --> 00:05:52.554
Now let's grab this,

100
00:05:52.554 --> 00:05:58.536
let's go back here into the tokens.txt
note to remove this annoying line.

101
00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:03.098
So now user,
this one belongs to Dustin, and

102
00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:06.468
their token is like that, okay?

103
00:06:06.468 --> 00:06:08.341
So two very different tokens.

104
00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:11.046
One is RV7, the other one's SYL.

105
00:06:11.046 --> 00:06:14.843
So the thing I want to validate is,
can Dustin update my workout or

106
00:06:14.843 --> 00:06:17.132
can Dustin delete my workout, right?

107
00:06:17.132 --> 00:06:21.266
If he can, everything we just did,
we have to kinda go back and fix it.

108
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:22.532
It's gonna suck.

109
00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:23.576
However, if he can't,

110
00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:26.424
then we know that we have everything
working accordingly, right?

111
00:06:26.424 --> 00:06:29.445
We've already validated that anonymous
users can't do things that they're

112
00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:30.184
not allowed to do.

113
00:06:30.184 --> 00:06:36.025
We've already validated the validity
of tokens, now we need to make sure,

114
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:40.785
do we check that owners truly
can update an owner's workout?

115
00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:44.408
So here, and quickly clear this,
just so we can have more room.

116
00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.729
Go back to post notes.

117
00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.482
And then here we should have
this pull request right here.

118
00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:53.989
So the last scroll request in that file.

119
00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:55.764
I'm gonna go ahead and copy this.

120
00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.421
I'm gonna paste it.

121
00:06:57.421 --> 00:06:59.072
Few things we need to change.

122
00:06:59.072 --> 00:07:05.308
So here, instead of workout 6,
I believe if we go here, it is what?

123
00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:10.933
Select all from workouts,
it is workouts 3, okay?

124
00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:13.058
So the ID of that workout is 3.

125
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.900
You quickly replace this.

126
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.728
[COUGH] And you can see the content
of the body is updated cardio.

127
00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:24.685
So instead of jogging I realized
I was actually walking.

128
00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:29.445
And over here, I'm gonna bring
back Dustin's token credentials.

129
00:07:29.445 --> 00:07:33.573
And we know Dustin did not create
this workout, the initial work,

130
00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:35.426
he did not create workout 3.

131
00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:37.819
So if I paste this and I run this,

132
00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:42.094
you're not authorized to
update this workout, right?

133
00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:46.127
Which is expected, because now we actually
have the logic that extracts the token.

134
00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:48.010
We know who the user belongs to.

135
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:54.009
And if we kind of go back and
remove Dustin's SYL token,

136
00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:58.860
and we go over here and
grab Melkey's token,

137
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.446
that is definitely not expired.

138
00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:03.931
Go here and paste it.

139
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:08.111
And if we run this,
we now have updated the cardio and

140
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:12.299
we can validate this from
select all from workouts.

141
00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:17.074
And now it says updated cardio,
a relaxed 45-minute walk after dinner.

142
00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:18.139
And so that's it.
