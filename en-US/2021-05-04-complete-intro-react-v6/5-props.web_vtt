00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.899
This is great, if you only care about
dogs that are have a niece named Luna but

2
00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.801
most of you probably like I would like
to pet components are able to represent

3
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:10.970
any pet, right?

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.574
That's where these things
called props come in.

5
00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:19.852
So here we could say like just what I was
showing you before Id My-brand, right?

6
00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.836
And this will give you
an idea of my brand.

7
00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.352
So these are attributes
being provided to this h1.

8
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.547
But now I want to kind of give some
sort of properties to this pet.

9
00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:36.487
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to give it a,

10
00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:40.632
another object just like this, and

11
00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:44.777
I'm going to give it a name of Luna,

12
00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:49.211
animal of Dog and a breed of Havanese.

13
00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:56.925
So that seems like it's kind of useful.

14
00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.966
So let's make a couple of those and
I'm gonna delete these ones.

15
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:06.560
And we'll do the bird that I used to
own growing up, her name was Pepper.

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.149
She was a Bird.

17
00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.335
And she was a cockatiel.

18
00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:20.362
I don't want that space there And
let's do Sarah Drasten's dog.

19
00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:26.905
His name was Sudo and
Sudo is a Wheaten Terrier.

20
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:35.781
Okay, so now we're passing down
properties into this pet element that

21
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:39.618
we need to be able to read
those here in the pet element.

22
00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:44.269
So this is gonna come in
a thing called props like this.

23
00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:46.692
This is basically this object
here that's being passed on.

24
00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:48.927
It's not exactly the same,
but it's pretty close.

25
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:52.891
So props here, now I can say,

26
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:58.447
instead of Luna, I can say props.name.

27
00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:03.183
Instead of dog I can say props.animal,

28
00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:09.461
instead of Havanese,
I'm gonna say props.breed.

29
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.070
So what do you expect to see now
when we pop over to the browser?

30
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.974
Well I'm gonna still see 6 h3s,
right, and 3 h2s.

31
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.448
The first one will be Luna dog havanese.

32
00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:27.089
The next one will be
Pepper bird cockatiel, and

33
00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.135
the next one will be Sudo
dog wheaten terrier, right?

34
00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:30.933
Let's go take a look.

35
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:37.849
Luna dog havanese,
Pepper bird cockatiel and

36
00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.937
Sudo dog Wheaten Terrier.

37
00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:46.012
So now I've made this component more
flexible by giving it the ability to react

38
00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:47.196
properties, right?

39
00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:49.188
These are called props, right?

40
00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:52.957
And these are what you pass down from one
parent component to a child component.

41
00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:55.279
And this is kind of the magic of react,

42
00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.707
is that you have the ability to pass
information from a child, or sorry,

43
00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:02.995
from a parent component down
into a child component.

44
00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:04.874
Now, one thing I want you to know and

45
00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:09.210
this is a very strong opinion that react
tastes with us, data flows down, right?

46
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.761
So I can pass things from App into the pet
component, that it doesn't flow up, right?

47
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.926
This is called one way data flow.

48
00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:21.572
And it's a big component of react is pet,
doesn't know who's rendering it, doesn't

49
00:03:21.572 --> 00:03:26.627
care who's rendering it and doesn't
interact with its parent ever, right?

50
00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:31.044
So I have no ability to get
information from Pet up to App,

51
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.537
there's just no way to do that.

52
00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:35.190
This ends up being
actually a huge blessing.

53
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.982
You kind of like reframe the way
that you're thinking but

54
00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:44.129
it ends up being a huge blessing because
if App has a problem with App, right?

55
00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.651
It knows it's not Pet messing with it,
right?

56
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:51.469
You've already precluded that
that ability by the fact that

57
00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.783
Pet can't mess with its parent, right?

58
00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:56.880
Now, you might ask like,
well, what if I need to and

59
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.621
there are methodologies to get around
that and I will show you that.

60
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.466
But for the most part, the default way of
interacting with react is that you have no

61
00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:06.551
way to go from child to parent,
it only goes from parent to child.

62
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:10.620
[BLANK AUDIO] Questions about that so far?

63
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:15.631
Cool.

64
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:22.797
So, this brings us to
our first checkpoint.

65
00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:26.932
If we go back to our course site here,
and look at Components.

66
00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:27.505
That's what we just did.

67
00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:30.628
At the very bottom here you see
this little chequered flag,

68
00:04:30.628 --> 00:04:33.818
that says click here to see
the state of the project up to now.

69
00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:37.905
If you click on that, this will take
you to a directory where you can see

70
00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.554
everything that you and
I just did together.

71
00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.890
It'll be slightly different from pieces
because I change things a little bit on

72
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.692
the flier but more or less the same.

73
00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:54.183
And you'll see that at the end of some of
the sections there of that little checked

74
00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:56.970
flag that just shows you
the state of the project.

75
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.904
Is this kind of code usable
in production scenarios?

76
00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:04.613
Looking at this kind of code here,
this sort of thing right here.

77
00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:07.052
What do I wanna say about that?

78
00:05:07.052 --> 00:05:08.182
Kind of, sort of.

79
00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:10.009
Yes, no, not really.

80
00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.187
Let's go with not really.

81
00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:15.585
Which is probably like the most wishy
washy answer that I've given so far.

82
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:22.516
Challenge except that I will try and
give wishes and wash your answers.

83
00:05:22.516 --> 00:05:25.232
I don't see anyone write
code like this anymore,

84
00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:27.763
with using React.createElement directly.

85
00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:29.890
It was more popular maybe five years ago.

86
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.036
But everyone writes react with JSX,
which I'm about to teach you,

87
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:39.069
That's literally the next thing that
we're gonna start talking about this JSX.

88
00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.657
But for the most part,
people don't write code like this anymore.

89
00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:46.915
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's to pull back behind

90
00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:51.896
the curtain of what's going
on underneath the hood.

91
00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:52.877
There's other problems with this.

92
00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:56.539
For example,
you typically have one component per file.

93
00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.577
It's not a hard rule but
it's pretty close to a hard rule.

94
00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:04.170
So typically I would have
a pet.js file and an app.js file,

95
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.519
that would be separate files.

96
00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:07.399
But we don't have a build step yet.

97
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.547
I don't want to mess
around with that too much.

98
00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:12.660
So the next thing we're going to do is
introduce introduce our build step.
