00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mpx parcel, build

2
00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:11.370
src/index.html.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.188
So before using react 43 kilobytes,
not bad right, that's pretty good for

4
00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:17.285
an application.

5
00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:20.198
But let's take a look at how big it
ends up being with a preaction and

6
00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:21.037
preact-compat.

7
00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:24.149
So 51 kilobytes just out of the box,
it looks a lot smaller.

8
00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.835
If we go into dist and

9
00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:37.396
run gzip on app 3AA.js and say lss.

10
00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:38.497
Here.

11
00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.262
This one right here.

12
00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:43.444
15 kilobytes, right, so
we shaved quite a bit,

13
00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:48.487
almost 30 kilobytes off that just be
switching to preact and preact-compat.

14
00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:55.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So and, if I switch off of
COMPAT and just directly under preact,

15
00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:58.512
I would shave an additional
five kilobytes off of that.

16
00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:03.400
So we would be down to 10 kilobytes for
our application from 43.

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.789
Now, make sure that that's
what you want to do, right?

18
00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.022
React has really great tooling.

19
00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.535
There's a bunch of really,

20
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:13.516
really cool parts about React that you
should not give up lightly, right?

21
00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:17.035
But this can be compelling particularly,

22
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:21.825
if you're trying to serve someone
like in India or China or

23
00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:25.457
rural America, like those kind of places.

24
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.622
Preact can be pretty compelling.

25
00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.247
Actually, one of my favorite ones to show.

26
00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:34.651
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, anyway, there's a
bunch of great stuff that you can look at

27
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.779
about React versus preact performance.

28
00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.787
And I would suggest taking a look at that.

29
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:44.808
So again, preact-compat is
a bridge if you decide to use

30
00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:51.826
preact start with preact-compat, but
you want to start migrating to preact.

31
00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:58.419
So from here like if I was converting
this particular route to be on preact,

32
00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:03.558
I would switch this to be from
preact-compat and do this.

33
00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:08.787
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But see,
you have to kind of like migrate.

34
00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:13.506
And this is what it will look like if you
switch to actually using preact directly.

35
00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:19.268
So remember, when you do JSX,
it's react.createelement,

36
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:23.190
that's what this JSX gets translated to.

37
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.265
When you're doing preact it
gets translated to H instead of

38
00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:27.625
react.createelement.

39
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.930
So you have to import H from preact.

40
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.165
So there's a bunch of things you have
to kind of massage it into doing and

41
00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:35.802
there's no prompt types.

42
00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:39.269
There's a bunch of other stuff that
preact doesn't have on purpose.

43
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.500
So you just kind of have to look at that.

44
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.484
And I gave you a link in the notes
here in preact down here to see all of

45
00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:49.911
the differences.

46
00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:56.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I will leave you to take a look at that.

47
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.941
Any questions about preact?

48
00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:04.350
There is a branch here obviously called
preact, we can see the complete code here
