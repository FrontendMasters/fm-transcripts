00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.707
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that takes care of the thunk.

2
00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:07.704
This is how you do asynchronous
data fetching with Redux.

3
00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:14.179
Now, let's go back to app.js.

4
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.273
Everything up to this point has probably
been a little frustrating with Redux.

5
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:20.163
And if you feel that way,
you have every right to.

6
00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:21.783
This is the satisfying part.

7
00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.970
We get to delete a ton of code
from our react application.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.020
So up here, delete pet finder client.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.703
Delete all this pet
finder stuff right here.

10
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.976
Delete the constructor.

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.994
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Delete all of these methods
in here, cuz we moved them out into Redux.

12
00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:57.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're not gonna be using
context anymore, so you can delete

13
00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:02.773
the SearchContext provider and we can now
just call this ReduxProvider as Provider.

14
00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:12.097
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So far so good,
you can just call this Provider.

15
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:19.033
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we can get rid of this
InteriorProvider, the on that was for

16
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:19.773
context.

17
00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:20.807
Oops.

18
00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:33.628
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,
this is what our app looks like.

19
00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:38.211
All of that data, all of that
functionality around managing state,

20
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.272
it's all been externalized.

21
00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:44.519
So it does kind of clean up
your React code a little bit.

22
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.808
This is nice.

23
00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.048
This is a lot easier to understand
than all of that craziness that app.js

24
00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.241
was doing earlier.

25
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:58.340
It's a compelling not to use Redux or
to use Redux, rather.

26
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.662
So anywhere that we were using
basically context before,

27
00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:06.286
we're gonna have to go
with refactor use Redux.

28
00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:08.460
So let's go back to results.js.

29
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now what we're gonna do is we're going to,

30
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.059
we already imported connect up here.

31
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.637
Anywhere that says, this.searchParams
right there, we're gonna delete.

32
00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.664
So just says, stops props.

33
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This dot or
let's look for a search context.

34
00:02:38.018 --> 00:02:40.049
We can get rid of the consumer up there.

35
00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And.

36
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, you can get rid
of this results with context business,

37
00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.154
because we're not reading
from context anymore.

38
00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:06.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this will just be
results now since we're not worrying

39
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.296
about context.

40
00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:13.188
And now we'll be reading from location,
breed and animal.

41
00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:16.898
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Location,
breed and animal and

42
00:03:16.898 --> 00:03:18.934
we'll just be passing
it directly on as well.

43
00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:22.709
Animal and breed.

44
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.412
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, can actually do it.

45
00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:33.103
So now, all these data will becoming
will becoming from Redux and this is how

46
00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:37.893
we've done it nefore we were using
consumer to inject that through context.

47
00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:42.525
And now we're using Redux and
mapstate to props to get to that results.

48
00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:49.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, this data
is coming from the Redux store and

49
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:55.756
this object that we're providing
back to Redux is injecting

50
00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:00.633
the location animal and
breed as props on results.

51
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:01.625
Make sense?
