00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.707
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that takes care of the thunk.

2
00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:07.704
This is how you do asynchronous
data fetching with Redux.

3
00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:14.179
Now, let's go back to app.js.

4
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.273
Everything up to this point has probably
been a little frustrating with Redux.

5
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:20.163
And if you feel that way,
you have every right to.

6
00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:21.783
This is the satisfying part.

7
00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.970
We get to delete a ton of code
from our react application.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.020
So up here, delete pet finder client.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.703
Delete all this pet
finder stuff right here.

10
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.352
Delete the constructor.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Delete all of

11
00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:44.994
these methods in here,
cuz we moved them out into Redux.

12
00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:55.242
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're not gonna be using

13
00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:59.443
context anymore, so you can delete
the SearchContext provider and

14
00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:02.773
we can now just call this
ReduxProvider as Provider.

15
00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:10.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So far so good,

16
00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:14.997
you can just call this Provider.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

17
00:01:14.997 --> 00:01:19.773
we can get rid of this InteriorProvider,
the on that was for context.

18
00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:28.983
Oops.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

19
00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:33.628
now, this is what our app looks like.

20
00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:38.211
All of that data, all of that
functionality around managing state,

21
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.272
it's all been externalized.

22
00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:44.519
So it does kind of clean up
your React code a little bit.

23
00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.808
This is nice.

24
00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.048
This is a lot easier to understand
than all of that craziness that app.js

25
00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.241
was doing earlier.

26
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:58.340
It's a compelling not to use Redux or
to use Redux, rather.

27
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.662
So anywhere that we were using
basically context before,

28
00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:06.286
we're gonna have to go
with refactor use Redux.

29
00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:11.617
So let's go back to results.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

30
00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:17.059
now what we're gonna do is we're going to,
we already imported connect up here.

31
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.637
Anywhere that says, this.searchParams
right there, we're gonna delete.

32
00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.664
So just says, stops props.

33
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.857
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This dot or let's look for

34
00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:38.018
a search context.

35
00:02:38.018 --> 00:02:40.049
We can get rid of the consumer up there.

36
00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:53.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

37
00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:57.457
you can get rid of this results with
context business, because we're not

38
00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:02.412
reading from context anymore.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

39
00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:08.296
this will just be results now since
we're not worrying about context.

40
00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:12.414
And now we'll be reading from location,
breed and

41
00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:16.430
animal.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Location, breed and

42
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.934
animal and we'll just be
passing it directly on as well.

43
00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:28.412
Animal and breed.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, can actually do it.

44
00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:33.103
So now, all these data will becoming
will becoming from Redux and this is how

45
00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:37.893
we've done it nefore we were using
consumer to inject that through context.

46
00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.821
And now we're using Redux and

47
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:45.132
mapstate to props to get to that results.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

48
00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:49.991
again, this data is coming
from the Redux store and

49
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:55.756
this object that we're providing
back to Redux is injecting

50
00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:00.633
the location animal and
breed as props on results.

51
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:01.625
Make sense?
