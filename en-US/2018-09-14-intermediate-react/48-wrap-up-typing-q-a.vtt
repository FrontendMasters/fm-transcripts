00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.093
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a bit of an effort,
right?

2
00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:05.206
But hopefully you kind of see the process
where you just kinda work your way up your

3
00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:07.036
tree until you arrive at App.tsx.

4
00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:11.946
If you wanna see what now what
happens if we run the compiler and

5
00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:15.545
say hey,
check my project to see if it works.

6
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.365
Hopefully, we will see no errors here.

7
00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:23.283
We do, this is now a fully TypeScript
project that you can continue forward

8
00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:25.550
doing TypeScript.

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.120
And again, anywhere inside of this
application I can just mouse over and

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.470
say what is breeds?

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.590
I don't know what that is.

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.470
It's a list of strings, right?

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.860
And if I try and do toUpperCase on this,
it's gonna say whoa, whoa, whoa.

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.420
toUpperCase does not exist on string.

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.150
Now that's kind of trivial,
I defined that, where I do find it

16
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.100
quite useful is like, hey, I don't
remember the name of what's on React.

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.290
So I can just mouse over that,
I was like, figure out what's in there.

18
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.310
And I can actually click into
it to figure out what's into.

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.390
So if I command click on this, I can look
at the type of definitions for this.

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.510
So this is the one that I actually wrote.

21
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.807
So for example, if you try and
say a size that's incorrect,

22
00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:13.023
these are the only
different kinds of sizes.

23
00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:15.871
Remember what we did pn for the size here?

24
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.620
But there's also a thumbnail size and
things like that.

25
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.200
This is the only file valid values for
that.

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.754
They probably enumerated type.

27
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:30.178
So there's so many different
ways to TypeScript as easily to,

28
00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:31.739
this is just the beginning.

29
00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:36.436
I just wanted to get you into it and
doing TypeScript with React cuz I think

30
00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:39.904
it's a really important skill
to know how to do this.

31
00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:42.070
I think we're gonna be seeing more and
more types of these as we go forward.

32
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.124
So that's my spiel on TypeScript.

33
00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:49.920
Any long-term project that I personally
start is gonna be done in TypeScript.

34
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.474
If I'm gonna be doing just little
minuscule things, like one-off things,

35
00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:56.439
I might not use TypeScript,
you can see that it takes more time.

36
00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.232
But anything that I'm
gonna maintain long term,

37
00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:04.619
I'm gonna write it in TypeScript.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions?

38
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.178
I get that feeling, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Kinda random, but

39
00:02:07.178 --> 00:02:10.887
when you had your sidebar open,
showing the little file names and

40
00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:14.740
the little associated icons,
I'm noticing that tsx shows React.

41
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.620
Is there some kinda special connection
between TypeScript and React,

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.615
or I don't know,
maybe why would that logo be that way or?

43
00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:24.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well-

44
00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:25.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Look at the x.

45
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:26.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, it's the x.

46
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.251
So you can see here next
to searchcontext.ts,

47
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.833
it's just showing the TypeScript logo,
right?

48
00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:34.674
So as soon as you add the x,
it's like this is a React file.

49
00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.309
I know what to do with React.

50
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.759
That's how that shows up.

51
00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.889
That's just built into VS Code.

52
00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:40.825
Sublime can do it too.

53
00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:42.477
I know, I used to use Sublime.

54
00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.442
So that's just
a configuration with Sublime.

55
00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:48.558
And I think, yeah, this just does
it out of the box with TypeScript.

56
00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:49.322
Yeah, thanks for coming.

57
00:02:49.322 --> 00:02:52.473
Thanks for people in the live stream.

58
00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:55.758
Thanks to those who are going
to watch the video later.

59
00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:56.930
But not, not these people here.

60
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.026
You all can just leave.

61
00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:58.783
[LAUGH] No, I'm just kidding.

62
00:02:58.783 --> 00:02:59.692
Thank you all, though.
Everyone's here.

63
00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.631
Thanks to Frontend Masters.

64
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:07.561
And yeah, we're done.
