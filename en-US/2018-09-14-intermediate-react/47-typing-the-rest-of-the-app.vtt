1
00:00:00.575 --> 00:00:03.521
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchParams,
we're getting close to the end here,

2
00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:05.707
we have refactored almost all of these.

3
00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:08.283
Rename this to .tsx.

4
00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:14.526
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This needs to be public and
that needs to be public, so

5
00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:16.439
these are both public methods.

6
00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:25.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we need to get
RouteComponents from up here,

7
00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:27.724
RouteComponentProps.

8
00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:37.127
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this just takes in RouteComponentProps.

9
00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:40.481
I don't think it was technically
an error not to have that, but

10
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:44.213
it's just good to know that in the future
if I try and come in use props,

11
00:00:44.213 --> 00:00:46.131
this has already been typed for me.

12
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.901
So that's just a useful thing to do.

13
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.491
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that's it for search props.

14
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:58.346
I think the last one up is App.tjs,
which we're gonna rename to App.tsx.

15
00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:09.684
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, again, from details
we'll just grab this process.env thing,

16
00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:12.262
that'll throw off if there's no API keys.

17
00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:15.312
And we will put that in
App.tsx here at the top.

18
00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:23.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Below this pf call, right
here, we're going to class our state.

19
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:29.109
And this has a lot of states, so
we're gonna have to do a decent

20
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.386
amount of typing here,
interface State, location string.

21
00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.359
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: animal is a string.

22
00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.264
breed is a string.

23
00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.855
breeds is a string array.

24
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:56.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: handleAnimalChange,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is

25
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.504
a,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Takes in

26
00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:05.283
an event which is a React.ChangeEvent,

27
00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:12.116
which takes an HTML.SelectElement and
returns nothing.

28
00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.600
This should look familiar,
this is what we were doing inside context.

29
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.411
But you have to kind of duplicate this
a little bit, because you need to let

30
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.502
it know these things match up,
these pieces fit together.

31
00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:25.159
So handleBreedChange.

32
00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.280
There's gonna be
a React.ChangeEvent as well.

33
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.643
I think one of these is mixed up.

34
00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:41.828
Let's see what I have in search
contexts in just a second.

35
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:46.034
This will be an input here.

36
00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:47.538
Yeah, let's finish that up.

37
00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:53.880
handleLocationEvent is

38
00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.828
a ChangeEvent on an input.

39
00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:11.468
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's just open our select or context.

40
00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.021
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: handleAnimalChange
was a KeyboardEvent.

41
00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:26.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I figured
each one of these is right.

42
00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:33.903
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go over and
look at my complete code here, TypeScript.

43
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.796
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which one
of these is correct?

44
00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:43.076
App.tsx, ChangeEvent,

45
00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:49.070
they're all ChangeEvents,
so these are wrong.

46
00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:54.538
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And HTMLSelect,
HTMLSelect, HTMLInput.

47
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:57.920
Okay, HTMLSelect,
HTMLSelect, HTMLInput, okay.

48
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.578
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does that mean you're
closing carrots on the left file there?

49
00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:06.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a ChangeEvent,
hold on, ChangeEvent.

50
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.903
Okay, sorry, what did you say?

51
00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:11.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think you might
need your closing carrots after-

52
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, you're right.

53
00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:22.951
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
this is what it looks like.

54
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:30.060
handleAnimalChange is a React.ChangeEvent,
SelectElement, ChangeEvent, SelectElement.

55
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.897
And this is a ChangeEvent
which is an InputElement.

56
00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:39.557
Now, if you look at the context,
I modified that as well, Search.Context,

57
00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:44.377
ChangeEvent, ChangeEvent, ChangeEvent,
InputElement, SelectElement.

58
00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:46.406
And that should be
a SelectElement as well.

59
00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:55.743
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's really key to
these line up routes, things break.

60
00:04:55.743 --> 00:05:02.406
Okay, going back to App.tsx,
one more method here which is getBreeds,

61
00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:08.755
and this is far simpler, it takes
no parameters and returns nothing.

62
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:17.253
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
here we're going to give it nothing for

63
00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:22.727
the props cuz it takes no props and
then give it State.

64
00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:30.018
The constructor, it takes the no props,
so you just delete that.

65
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what did I do here?

66
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.547
Okay, so
I guess you just don't have to call super.

67
00:05:51.547 --> 00:05:57.858
But yeah, that's what I thought,
you do have to call super.

68
00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.303
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And props are just an empty
object, I think, cuz that's what you say,

69
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.224
and you just pass that props up.

70
00:06:12.224 --> 00:06:15.649
So this is saying, I expect nothing from
these props, this could be anything.

71
00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.689
Or rather,
I expect it to be an empty object,

72
00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.811
pass it on to React cuz
I don't care what it is.

73
00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:25.887
And this is complaining
that string animal,

74
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:36.054
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: handleLocationEvent,

75
00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:40.940
handleLocationChange, right?

76
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:48.054
There we go, AnimalChange, BreedChange,
LocationChange, that works.

77
00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:52.873
This is public handleLocationChange,
public.

78
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:53.693
public.

79
00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:58.558
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: public.

80
00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:01.630
public.

81
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.724
And public down here.

82
00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.945
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we have
to go type all of these events,

83
00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:12.820
which I'm just going to copy and paste
these cuz I'm very sick of doing that.

84
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.042
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: AnimalChangeEvents
are on SelectElements,

85
00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:24.972
LocationChanges are on Inputs.

86
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:36.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And BreedChange are on,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SelectElements as well.

87
00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:46.378
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I think that covers all of our basis.

88
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
what is carousel upset about?

89
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.149
So you can see here that in my coding,
you can see that carousel is red,

90
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.536
so it means carousel is
still upset by something.

91
00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:08.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is something
that we had fixed previously.

92
00:08:08.344 --> 00:08:11.549
We never typed photos active is.

93
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:16.319
So here you can say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We

94
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.674
know that photos is a never.

95
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Photos is Pet.

96
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:37.315
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here we have to say,
as PetPhoto array.

97
00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:51.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that should fix that,
cuz now it knows this is PetPhoto, cool.

98
00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:56.472
So what I did is I typed this
photo as a PetPhoto up here.

99
00:08:56.472 --> 00:09:00.001
So I guess that was required.

100
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.269
Last thing in here is Results.tsx.

101
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:05.140
This is upset by what?

102
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.501
Props, you just gotta tell it what it is,
props are props.

103
00:09:17.892 --> 00:09:23.568
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
Results is still upset by what?

104
00:09:23.568 --> 00:09:24.650
RouteComponentType.

105
00:09:28.104 --> 00:09:29.129
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, there we go.

106
00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:37.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This entire project is now

107
00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:38.498
in TypeScript.

108
00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:41.024
[LAUGH]
