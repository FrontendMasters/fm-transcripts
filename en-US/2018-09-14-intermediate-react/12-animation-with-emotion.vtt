00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.237
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One more thing to show you
with styles component or with Emotion.

2
00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:09.318
There are several other cool things
that Emotion can do, but I wanna show

3
00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:14.248
you how to do keyframe animations cuz
you just have to know how to do it.

4
00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:21.834
So from react-emotion I'm going to import
another thing called keyFrame, okay?

5
00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:27.540
This is going to allow us to
do animations using Emotion.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.305
So let's say I have this icon up here,
and for reasons unknown to me,

7
00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.028
they wanna make it rotate all the time.

8
00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.528
So, what I'm gonna do here,

9
00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:44.388
is I'm gonna say, const Spin =

10
00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:49.387
keyFrames,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

11
00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:53.446
And this is another kind
of tagged template literal.

12
00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:55.883
And I'm just gonna say, from,

13
00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:06.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: transform: rotate (0deg).

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.093
So start at zero degrees and

15
00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:14.846
go to transform: rotate (360deg), right?

16
00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:18.684
So just go from zero degrees and
rotate all the way around to 360 degrees.

17
00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:23.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
underneath that I'm gonna make a spyglass.

18
00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:27.769
So const SpyGlass =

19
00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:32.741
styled("span").

20
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:37.392
And here I'm gonna say,
display: inLine-block,

21
00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:40.502
cuz if it's in line it won't work.

22
00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:48.735
And then, animation: 1s ${Spin}, right?

23
00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:53.644
So, what this is going to return,
is it's going to return to the appropriate

24
00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:56.980
key to refer to that spin
animation that we created.

25
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.485
And then we have to say linear and
infinite.

26
00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:08.452
So always spin and
don't do any sort of easing, okay?

27
00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:13.546
Let's get rid of that stupid outline here,
this one.

28
00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:19.743
And then I wanna replace
spin here with SpyGlass.

29
00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:28.659
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna start yelling at
you because it feels like this should be

30
00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.041
a spin, it is, right?

31
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.495
It's still a spin, it can't see through
the styles component to see that.

32
00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:37.020
So you would have to disable that, but for
now we won't worry about the eslint there.

33
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.810
But now if you go look at this,
now you have a spinning eye glass,

34
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.822
or whatever you wanna call that.

35
00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:47.840
I guess marketing came to you and

36
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.441
said we really want people to
click on this search thing.

37
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:52.672
And that's how you do it.

38
00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:57.628
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should hire me
to design your website, by the way.

39
00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:58.846
I have great ideas.

40
00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:02.814
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
that's pretty cool, right?

41
00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:07.239
And it feels pretty familiar if you
know how to write key frames in CSS.

42
00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.591
This isn't too different than
writing normal key frames.
