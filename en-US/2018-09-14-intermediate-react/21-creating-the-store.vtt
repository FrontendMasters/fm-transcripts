00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first term that
you need to know is the store, right?

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.210
The store is the central
repository of the data.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.750
It's kind of the state, right?

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.430
It's the store.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.408
So go ahead and make a new file here.

6
00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:14.567
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Save it.

7
00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.684
Call it store-js.

8
00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:19.910
Notice I am calling it lower case s.

9
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.254
It's because it's not a component,
it's just the data store.

10
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.017
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, the store can
be pretty simple up front, but

11
00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:30.761
I'm gonna just, we're gonna write
the entire store all at once.

12
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.627
So we're gonna introduce
also things called thunks,

13
00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.756
which I'll talk about here in a second.

14
00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:39.230
But let's just go ahead and
throw all this here.

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.785
React createStore.

16
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:43.304
This is the method that you
actually use to create a store.

17
00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:51.576
Compose and applyMiddleware from redux.

18
00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:56.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, sorry,
we have to go install those two, don't we?

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.943
Let's go install them first.

20
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:06.042
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm going to say mpm install redux,

21
00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:10.396
redux-thunk and react-redux.

22
00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:15.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, install those.

23
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:24.784
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Redux is the core library.

24
00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.802
Redux-thunk is going to allow us to
asynchronous actions with redux.

25
00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:32.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And react-redux is
a pretty small connecting layer

26
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.526
between react and redux.

27
00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.015
You could write react-redux yourself,
it's not very complicated.

28
00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:40.317
I think it adds about a kilobyte at most.

29
00:01:40.317 --> 00:01:41.863
But it's convenient.

30
00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:43.825
It's nice to not have to write it.

31
00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:45.434
So just go ahead and use react-redux.

32
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

33
00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:56.539
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have to start our dev,
so we can npm run dev.

34
00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.233
Okay, we're going to import thunk.

35
00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:05.940
Which is my favorite word in the world.

36
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.067
From redux-thunk.

37
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:09.795
Again, I'll explain
that when we get there.

38
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:18.336
And import reducer from ./reducers.

39
00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:27.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, making a redux
store is as simple as saying const

40
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.998
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: store equals createStore.

41
00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:42.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: With your root reducer,
and saying export default store.

42
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.280
It is this simple.

43
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.030
However, we wanna add some
additional abilities to redux,

44
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.410
to be able to do asynchronous things.

45
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.350
We need to do Ajax calls,
for example, right?

46
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.958
So in order to have any sort
of asynchronous action,

47
00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.833
you have to augment the ability of redux.

48
00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.240
So we're gonna have to add
a few more things here.

49
00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:05.378
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're gonna use the compose function here,

50
00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:08.181
which allows us to add
multiple things at once.

51
00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:11.564
We're going to do applyMiddleware(thunk).

52
00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:17.268
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This adds the ability
to do asynchronous actions with redux.

53
00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:22.626
And we're gonna do another one which,
I just literally

54
00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:28.677
took this off of the docs, so
that's why it looks ridiculous.

55
00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:36.034
typeof window triple equals object.

56
00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:39.433
Sorry, string object.

57
00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:50.243
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And type of
window.devToolsExtension is not undefined.

58
00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:59.484
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if so,
then do window.devToolsExtension.

59
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.946
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Otherwise,
give it an identity function.

60
00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:11.523
Okay.

61
00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:20.791
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Type of window right there,
okay.

62
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.229
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is an f.

63
00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.479
It might be hard to tell,
but that is an f.

64
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.564
So what is this madness right here?

65
00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:34.350
Again, I just copied this off directly
from the redux documentation.

66
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590
We have a thing called Redux DevTools, and

67
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.430
this little blurb right here makes
sure that you don't crash your app.

68
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.620
So if you have the Redux DevTools
extension installed,

69
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.480
then it instantiates it, right here.

70
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.210
Otherwise, it gives it a function
that doesn't crash Redux,

71
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.219
which is what that does.

72
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:56.335
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What I'm trying to say
is you don't actually really need to

73
00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:56.950
care about this.

74
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.220
This is the last you'll see of it.

75
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.800
You never have to care about it again.

76
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.650
This just starts the dev tools.

77
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.480
Unlike react dev tools, which just work
out of the box by inserting itself into

78
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.310
react, you have to kind of go from
the inside out with the redux dev tools.
