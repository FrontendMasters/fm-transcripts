00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.038
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That concludes testing.

2
00:00:01.038 --> 00:00:06.505
I'm going to go back to the root
directory of this, and I'm going to,

3
00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:14.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: git reset HEAD --hard.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.840
So don't do this unless you're gonna
wanna throw out all of your code.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.075
I wanna throw away everything that I just
wrote, cuz I wanna get back to the master

6
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.280
branch, but I want to warn you,
this is destructive.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.223
So be aware.

8
00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:31.287
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So rm- rf/src.

9
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:36.934
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now as you can see,
I'm back at my HEAD, and

10
00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.177
we're gonna be talking about emotion.

11
00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.383
Let's all share our feelings.

12
00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:46.285
[LAUGH] Just kidding,
let's talk about CSS and JS,

13
00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:49.500
everyone's favorite topic.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.270
It's not controversial at all,
everyone loves it.

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.250
Just kidding,

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.600
this is one of the most controversial
things in the React community.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.730
I wanna teach it to you because I want you
to make your own decision about it, and

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.640
then I will share with you
my opinion at the end.

19
00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:06.744
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The previous version,
v3 of Complete Intro to React,

20
00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:08.671
covered styled components.

21
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.085
So if you want to talk about
styled-components check out that one.

22
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:15.007
Today, we're gonna talk about emotion.

23
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:19.949
Emotion came out around the time that
I wrote the v3 version of this course.

24
00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:23.076
I did not use it because
it because was too new.

25
00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.943
But now it's kind of settled a little bit,
and most people, I think,

26
00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.071
are moving under emotion.

27
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:31.763
It's better performance, so
if you are going to use a CSS and

28
00:01:31.763 --> 00:01:35.355
JS solution, I personally suggest emotion.

29
00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:37.039
That's the one that I
think is the best one.

30
00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:42.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go and install it.

31
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:49.206
So here inside of our root directory
of complete-intro-to-react-v4,

32
00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:54.356
I'm going to do npm install,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: emotion,

33
00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:58.756
which is the core library,
that's gonna do what we need it to do.

34
00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:02.698
And we're also going to
install react-emotion,

35
00:02:02.698 --> 00:02:06.098
which is the React wrapper around emotion.

36
00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:09.079
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You need both.

37
00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that solved those two things.

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.969
Lets go into app.js.

39
00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:25.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here in app.js,
you'll see down here, we have this little

40
00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:30.750
link right here, or sorry,
this little header right here.

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.912
We should probably extract
this into a component, right?

42
00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:35.540
We wanna be able to test it individually.

43
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.330
We wanna be able to use
it in different places.

44
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.310
So we're going to extract this header,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Into its own component.

45
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:49.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the easiest way
to do this is to just cut this out.

46
00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:51.426
Well, we'll do that in a second.

47
00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:57.309
Make a new file in here, inside of
the src directory, and call it navbar.js.

48
00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:03.052
navbar.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

49
00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:05.952
here inside of this we're going
to import React from 'react'.

50
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: import {Link}
from '@reach/router'.

51
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.949
That's gonna be a anchor
tag from Reach Router.

52
00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:27.336
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here we're
gonna make a NavBar component.

53
00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.800
We'll just make it a function component.

54
00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:37.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're just going
to take everything that we had here

55
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.776
in app.js,
I'm just gonna literally cut this out,

56
00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:45.143
the header with the two
links inside of it.

57
00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:46.013
I'm just gonna cut that out.

58
00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:50.209
I'm going to paste that inside of
the render of the NavBar right here.

59
00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.925
And then I'm going to
export default NavBar.

60
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now we have this NavBar component,

61
00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:06.663
we can go back to app.js up at the top.

62
00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:11.602
And we're gonna say import
NavBar from ./NavBar.

63
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.357
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that place where we had the header before,

64
00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:18.437
we're going to replace that with NavBar.

65
00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:29.557
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here above the Provider,
we're gonna say, &lt;NavBar/&gt;.

66
00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.516
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the only thing we've
done here is refactored out a component.

67
00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:41.858
We cut everything from between
Provider and the enclosing div, and

68
00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:45.454
we replaced that with NavBar,
here inside of app.js.

69
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:52.495
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then up here,
we imported NavBar, right here on line 8.

70
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.866
Also, we're not using Link inside
of this component anymore,

71
00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:01.725
so we can delete that import up here.

72
00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:03.782
It would still work,
ESLint will just yell at you.

73
00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:09.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then inside of NavBar, it looks like this.

74
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.900
It's literally just the same
header that we pulled out.

75
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.030
So now we have this encapsulated
NavBar component, right?

76
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.700
So far so good?
