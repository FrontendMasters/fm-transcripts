00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now what happens if I want
to do a bunch of additional styling of

2
00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:03.920
this kind of stuff?

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.574
Right now I'm including all of the CSS for
you but

4
00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:10.806
what happens if we wanted to put all
the styling in with the component itself?

5
00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:12.747
Well, let's talk about how to do that.

6
00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:17.232
We're gonna import styled
from react-emotion,

7
00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:22.974
now the style is going to allow us
to make our style of components.

8
00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:28.539
So components that have
style associated with them.

9
00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.130
So I'm going to make a new react
component called container,

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.826
and it's going to be styled.

11
00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:41.744
Here, I need to give it something
the kind of tag that I want with it.

12
00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:47.914
So it's a header tag, I'm gonna
replace this header right here right?

13
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.392
So it's gonna be a styled header and

14
00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:54.862
then I'm gonna replace this
header right here with container.

15
00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:01.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So right now this wouldn't
do anything, it would still work but.

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.070
All container is it's just a header,

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.700
then I wanna give it style that's
only associated with this container.

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.800
So that we're gonna use what's
called a tagged template literal, so

19
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.530
if you've ever used a template
literal in JavaScript const

20
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.790
string equals lol this is a string right.

21
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.660
But notice these are backticks right here.

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.090
Backticks being on an American
keyboard is next to the one,

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940
on the left of the one, right.

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.770
Next to the tilde or
on the same key as the tilde.

25
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.390
There's something called
the Tagged Template Literal.

26
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.535
So right after this parenthesis right
here, I'm going to put a backtick.

27
00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.392
And now I can write the CSS and

28
00:01:46.392 --> 00:01:51.291
that's going to be fed into the header,
right?

29
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:55.900
So I'm gonna just give it a couple of
different things, background-color:,

30
00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:01.529
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: #333 Position colon sticky,

31
00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:06.684
so we're gonna make it a sticky header,
top colon zero, so

32
00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:12.270
it's stuck at the top and
z index of something greater than one.

33
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.563
We'll just give it 10 and
now, all of these CSS

34
00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:21.504
properties are going to be
associated with container.

35
00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:25.202
Now some of you might not be seeing
syntax highlighting with this.

36
00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:30.191
You're gonna need some sort of plug-in to
your editor to get the syntax highlighting

37
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.004
the work, I'm using VS Code.

38
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:36.864
So if you wanna know what that one is,
it's this one down here,

39
00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:39.441
vscode-styled-components.

40
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:42.702
That's the one that you need if
you wanna do it with VS Code.

41
00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:46.117
You'll have to install it and
then restart your editor.

42
00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:50.918
But Sublime should have it, JetBrains,
all of those should probably have it.

43
00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:52.343
If you're on Vim, you're on your own.

44
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:56.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
you're probably used to that.

45
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:01.259
[LAUGH] Okay, so
now I think I'll look at Container.

46
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.510
Hopefully, it broke.

47
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.591
You have to do npm run dev to get
your devServer started again.

48
00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:21.188
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
hopefully at the beginning of the course,

49
00:03:21.188 --> 00:03:23.752
we'll go through and
set it up and then re use that.

50
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.136
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so you can see
now there is a black background,

51
00:03:31.136 --> 00:03:33.344
the header has changed right,
and now it's sticky so

52
00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:38.465
if I scroll down it stays with me as well
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

53
00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:41.336
this is the beautiful thing
about style components,

54
00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:44.670
is now I have access to my CSS
inside of my JavaScript, right?

55
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.810
So I have the full power of JavaScript
available to me when doing my CSS styling.

56
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.767
That's powerful, right?

57
00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:56.300
And the other thing to me that's quite
compelling is Now all of my markup,

58
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.875
right, this is all my markup right here.

59
00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:03.620
All of my behavior, so all of my
JavaScript, and all of my styles for

60
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.969
one component lives in one file.

61
00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.434
That's really cool.

62
00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:11.456
My favorite part about this is that,
let's say I stop using Navbar and

63
00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:12.827
I move on to Navbar v 2.

64
00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:19.569
Or nav bar voltron or whatever
the next version of my nav bar is.

65
00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.752
If I delete nav bar,
everything gets deleted with it, right?

66
00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:27.988
All the CSS goes with it, all the HTML,
all the JavaScript goes with it.

67
00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:30.677
I think that's super, super compelling.

68
00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:31.490
Right?

69
00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:37.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Optimized for deletability,
that's one of my mantras writing code is

70
00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:40.390
if something is deletable,
that means it's modular.

71
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.013
And if it's modular, then it's great.

72
00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:46.071
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It just leads
to all sorts of good habits.
