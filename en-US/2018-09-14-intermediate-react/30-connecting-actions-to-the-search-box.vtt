00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is how you do reading, right?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:06.372
Where we're just reading from Redux
right now but we're not doing

3
00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:10.226
any dispatching of actions,
we're not doing any changes to Redux.

4
00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:14.765
So let's go make search box work because
search box is actually the one that's

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.346
doing all of the reading and

6
00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:21.996
writing to redux.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

7
00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:25.406
get rid of this Consumer import.

8
00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:30.370
And we're going to import

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.017
connect from react-redux.

10
00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:39.392
And then we have to go import
all of our action creators.

11
00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:44.249
So import getBreeds

12
00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:53.681
from./actionCreaters/getBreeds

13
00:00:53.681 --> 00:01:01.966
and we gonna get several of these,

14
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:09.403
this one will be changeBreed.

15
00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.983
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one will
be changeAnimal, changeAnimal.

16
00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:25.130
And this one will be change location.

17
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.627
So now all of these are coming in.

18
00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:31.745
We've imported these
from our action creators.

19
00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:36.989
We'll get rid of this consumer business
right here because that's all coming

20
00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:41.847
from context or sorry we don't use
context anymore we're using redux.

21
00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:47.408
So I can delete the wrapping stuff here.

22
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:55.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anywhere that we say

23
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.609
context dot
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

24
00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.581
[INAUDIBLE] context that handle,
location change or

25
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:12.276
[INAUDIBLE] location you now select,
highlighted all this and

26
00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:17.239
I'm just going to change this to
this dot props dot whatever it was

27
00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.971
before.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

28
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.519
you have to change it in ten places or
something like that.

29
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.365
So this.props.handleLocationChange,
this.props.location,

30
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:33.247
and then we're gonna go and
inject all of these into our,

31
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.136
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Component here,

32
00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:41.816
our search box, okay?

33
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:45.835
So we're gonna have to inject two things,

34
00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:50.869
the state and the action handlers,
or the dispatch.

35
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:56.833
So the first thing we'll make is const
mapStateToProps, just like we made before.

36
00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:01.148
In fact, it's almost the same thing.

37
00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:07.601
So we'll get breed, breeds,
animal, and location.

38
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:12.929
And we'll return here
an object that is just breed,

39
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.178
breeds, animal,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: and

40
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:21.717
location
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

41
00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:24.003
so all of these breed, breeds, animal and

42
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.942
location that's all gonna be injected
into search and then the next thing

43
00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:31.520
which we have not previously made
is called map dispatch to props.

44
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.363
So mapDispatchToProps,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It

45
00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:43.718
takes in a dispatch.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Parameter and

46
00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:47.896
then you return here an object of

47
00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:53.011
methods to dispatch actions to redux.

48
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.874
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So handle animal change

49
00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:05.825
Takes in an event.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

50
00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:12.644
whenever someone changes an animal,
the first thing we have to do is dispatch.

51
00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:19.164
ChangeAnimal event.target.value

52
00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:30.695
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What else happens
when someone changes the animal?

53
00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:33.565
We have to get a new list of breeds,
right?

54
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:38.009
So the other thing that we gonna do here,

55
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.855
is we gonna dispatch again and
gets breeds.

56
00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:48.270
So unlike react, when we had to be
cautious about set state getting batched,

57
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.948
that does not happen here with redux.

58
00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:55.621
We can guarantee to you that this one will
flush totally before this one happens, so

59
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.239
it will cue up your actions.

60
00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:03.523
First, okay?

61
00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:04.480
So that's the first one.

62
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.023
We'll do handleBreedChange,
takes in an event,

63
00:05:11.023 --> 00:05:17.577
and it dispatches
changeBreed of event.target.

64
00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:22.806
Target.value.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

65
00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:27.907
lastly here, handle location

66
00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:32.811
change, event, dispatch,

67
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:40.275
change location of event.target.value.

68
00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:47.124
Okay, and then down here, connect.

69
00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:52.124
First one you'll provide is
mapDispatchToProps, sorry,

70
00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:56.741
rather mapStateToProps,
then mapDispatchToProps.

71
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:59.963
There you go.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

72
00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:01.033
that was a lot, all at once.

73
00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:08.866
Let's kinda like recap here what happened.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First things we did,

74
00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:11.197
we ripped out context totally
in the search box here.

75
00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:16.267
We then imported all of our action
creators that we previously wrote.

76
00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:19.392
We've imported connect from react-redux.

77
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:23.327
So consumers gone now that
I was using context, so

78
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:27.170
now everything that was
context dot something,

79
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.024
we've changed it to
this.props dot whatever.

80
00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:35.992
So now location and handleLocationChange
that's all coming in via

81
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:40.014
prompts that are being
injected into this component.

82
00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:45.802
Okay, that's coming in through here,
this, is mapStateToProps,

83
00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:52.277
this is pulling breed, breeds, animal and
location out of our Redux store and

84
00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:57.302
injecting that into our search
component here Via connect.

85
00:06:57.302 --> 00:07:01.506
So mapStateToProps calls this
function here which returns this,

86
00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:04.893
which then gets injected
into the search component.

87
00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:07.269
And then mapDispatchToProps,

88
00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:12.376
this is a bunch of functions that is
being provided to search as well.

89
00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:17.499
So any time that someone calls
this.props.handleAnimalChange, it calls

90
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:23.265
this function Okay, or whatever, you know,
handleBreedChange will call this one.

91
00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:26.964
Dispatch is how you give
an action to Redux.

92
00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:29.105
It's like hey,
I have this complete action.

93
00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:31.499
I want you to do this thing.

94
00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:32.842
So what is changeAnimal.

95
00:07:32.842 --> 00:07:37.101
Let's just go take a look to remind
you what changeAnimal actually is.

96
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.013
changeAnimal Brian: Just
takes in an animal and

97
00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:42.932
returns an object that looks like this,
right?

98
00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:47.321
So, this "SET_ANIMAL" one is just
a payload it takes like this will be like

99
00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:49.426
dog or something like that, right?

100
00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:54.102
So, this is going to get
displatched to the route reducer,

101
00:07:54.102 --> 00:07:57.571
which if you remember was reducers, here.

102
00:07:57.571 --> 00:07:58.982
We did combineReducers here.

103
00:07:58.982 --> 00:08:01.278
This made our root reducer for us.

104
00:08:01.278 --> 00:08:04.013
So we have one called animal, right?

105
00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:07.163
So let's go to our animalReducer.

106
00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:12.012
In the animalReducer, it's gonna take in
the previous state of what animal was.

107
00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:14.592
So let's say it was cat, right?

108
00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:19.200
And action is gonna have
a action.payload of dog.

109
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.010
So it's gonna say is
this a set animal action?

110
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.370
It is, right?

111
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.560
So it's going to return whatever
the value of the action.payload is.

112
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.930
In this case, we were changing it to dog.

113
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.760
So now the new state,
the store will be dog, right?

114
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.301
And then it completes that action set.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Once this happens,

115
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:45.705
once it sees that it has a new state,
Redux says, hey,

116
00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:50.602
React, I had something change from my
story, you need to go and rerender now.

117
00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:54.915
And then it goes through and rerenders,
it rereads from the store, and we're back

118
00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:59.627
to waiting on user action again.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that

119
00:08:59.627 --> 00:09:03.084
whole circle make sense to you?

120
00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.285
You might not like it but
hopefully it makes sense to you.

121
00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:08.889
It's a lot of steps right?

122
00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:12.794
It's a lot of steps.

123
00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:16.244
So I just want to go through
that circle one more time,

124
00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:21.469
hopefully to help you again but we're
gonna do it with the asynchronous action.

125
00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:28.497
So search box, we just completed
our changeAnimal loop of events.

126
00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:34.445
Then right afterwards it dispatches
a thunk that came from getBreeds.

127
00:09:34.445 --> 00:09:36.163
So it calls getBreeds.

128
00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:39.737
So let's go look at what's in getBreeds.

129
00:09:39.737 --> 00:09:43.921
Get breeds is gonna return a function
that Redux then invokes, right?

130
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:48.086
Redux calls this function,
this getBreedsThunk function, okay.

131
00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:51.639
It's gonna go out,
it's gonna go find petfinder.

132
00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:54.727
It's gonna call the petfinder
API which does all this stuff.

133
00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:59.880
It's eventually going to get to here
Once it has all of the data, right.

134
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.400
So it's gonna go out and request
all of our dog reads for us, right.

135
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.520
This will be an array of dog breeds, okay.

136
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.690
We're then going to dispatch
a set breeds action, right.

137
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.500
So that's gonna come back
to our index reducers.

138
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.269
It's gonna call this breeds reducer.

139
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:22.435
So we go to breeds.js, and it say,
are you a set breeds, action.

140
00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:27.051
It says, yes I'm a set breeds action.

141
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:31.706
Then it returns the action, our payload
which is the new list of dog breeds,

142
00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:32.228
right?

143
00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:36.892
That gets fed into the state Redux as
I have a changed, it informs react,

144
00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:38.508
react calls a rerender.

145
00:10:38.508 --> 00:10:44.009
And inside of the search box when

146
00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:51.759
it goes here to read
from this one right here.

147
00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:56.732
When it calls this stop prompt dot
breeds that's reading from that thing

148
00:10:56.732 --> 00:11:00.820
that we just wrote to and so
it's the new list of dog breeds.

149
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.450
Do we get the whole circle?

150
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.370
Okay, so let's go check and
make sure this works.

151
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.750
We just wrote a lot of code and
something probably broke in that process.

152
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.346
Tends to happen.

153
00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:22.030
So animal Click dog,
it'll change that in the Redux store and

154
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.758
then request new breeds, which it did.
