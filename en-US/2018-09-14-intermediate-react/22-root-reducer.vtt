00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.788
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now we have a store, that's
what this is, this is a Redux store.

2
00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.172
It has the ability to use the dev tools,

3
00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.925
it has also the thunks
extension installed.

4
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.969
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, now what I want you to do,
let's go into here,

5
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.633
I'm gonna make a new folder inside
of my source directory, and

6
00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:24.512
call it reducers
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

7
00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm gonna keep of all my individual
reducers inside this reducers folder.

8
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:41.700
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, inside of reducers,
make a new file called index.js.

9
00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.660
&gt;&gt; Brian: Why index?

10
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.881
Well, here inside of store,
we said import reducer from ./reducers.

11
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:54.900
Reducers is not a file,
it's a directory, right?

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.025
But, if you say a directory, node will
result that automatically to be index.js

13
00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:04.500
inside of that directory if it cannot
find a file called reducers.js.

14
00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:10.386
&gt;&gt; Brian: So that's what this import
system ports the index file from reducers

15
00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.628
which will be this index.js file.

16
00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:15.592
&gt;&gt; Brian: Little bit
kind of clever hack but

17
00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:18.670
I think it kind of cleans everything up,
it makes it look nice.

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.728
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so
inside of this index,js file,

19
00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:32.545
we're gonna say import
combineReducers from redux.

20
00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:38.676
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we're gonna import a ./location reducer,

21
00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.281
which we have not written yet.

22
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.407
Oops, sorry,
import location from ./location.

23
00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:49.060
This will be an additional reducer
that we will write momentarily.

24
00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.554
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we will export default combineReducers.

25
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.520
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we'll have location be location.

26
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.047
So let's talk about what
combineReducers is here.

27
00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:09.787
&gt;&gt; Brian: CombineReducers is
a helper function from Redux.

28
00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:17.546
&gt;&gt; Brian: And what this helper function
does is helps us kind of keep everything

29
00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.222
in order.

30
00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:21.126
So now we have this
reducer called location.

31
00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:26.075
And the only thing that this
location reducer has to do is

32
00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:29.671
manage the location mutation of state.

33
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.273
So again, let's talk a little bit
about what a reducer is, probably,

34
00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:34.063
at this point.

35
00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.872
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
you don't have to follow along with this.

36
00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:40.438
If I were to write this without
using combinedReducers,

37
00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:45.654
the way that I would do this is, I'd write
a function called, const rootReducer.

38
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:49.407
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
this is going to be a function.

39
00:02:49.407 --> 00:02:57.324
All reducer is a function that takes in,
&gt;&gt; Brian: The previous state of the repo.

40
00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:01.247
And it takes in an action object, okay.

41
00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:06.201
This action object is something
that it got from React.

42
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:09.843
The user clicked on this button which
dispatched action which is going to land

43
00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:11.591
here inside of this action, right?

44
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.252
The state is going to be the previous
state of the store, right?

45
00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:23.170
So let's pretend that we're only dealing
with just location for the moment.

46
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.793
So with the previous state,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Would be an object that

47
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:36.143
is just,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Location

48
00:03:36.143 --> 00:03:40.032
is,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Seattle Washington

49
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:43.656
was the previous,
&gt;&gt; Brian: State.

50
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:51.367
&gt;&gt; Brian: And, the action is going to
be a new action, which is going to be

51
00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:56.684
of type,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Set location, and

52
00:03:56.684 --> 00:04:02.023
the payload for it will be San Francisco,

53
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.976
&gt;&gt; Brian: CA, okay?

54
00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:11.828
Or the state is that, so this is the
previous state here, will look like that.

55
00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:14.498
And the action it looks like this, right?

56
00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:15.809
That's what's gonna come in here.

57
00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:21.630
This is gonna be a huge switch
statement on action.type.

58
00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:25.924
&gt;&gt; Brian: And on the case of

59
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:32.033
SET_LOCATION,
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's

60
00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:34.401
going to dispatch to the location reducer.

61
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:39.865
So return,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Location

62
00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:43.805
with state and action.

63
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:47.931
So all this does is it delegates
to another reducer, right?

64
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:53.236
This rootReducer, 100% of what it does
is just handout to other reducers and

65
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.804
returns their values.

66
00:04:54.804 --> 00:04:58.589
Otherwise, this rootReduced would be
astronomically large for a big project,

67
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.607
right, so we have to separate
these out to delegated reducers.

68
00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:02.296
And honestly,

69
00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:06.115
you can have reducers that delegate other
reducers that delegate to other reducers.

70
00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:07.957
This can go as far and wide as you want.

71
00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:10.231
You can combined reducers
as many times as you want.
