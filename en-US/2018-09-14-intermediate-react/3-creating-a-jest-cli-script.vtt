00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
we've been running our jest with npx.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.684
The best way to do this is actually
go into your package.json.

3
00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:07.387
Here, I have test.

4
00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:14.272
Let's just make that jest --silent, okay?

5
00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:19.934
And then we'll add another
one called test:update.

6
00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.657
And we'll input that -u on that.

7
00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:27.788
So now instead of doing,
clear, npm run test,

8
00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.489
&gt;&gt; Brian: That'll run jest for us.

9
00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.570
In fact, test is special one, so
you can actually go as far as npm t.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450
It'll actually run test for you.
