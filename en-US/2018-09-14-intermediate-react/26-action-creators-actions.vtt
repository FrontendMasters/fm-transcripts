00:00:00.494 --> 00:00:02.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is it for
reducers, right?

2
00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:07.373
This is how you, hopefully you kinda see
that you just throw actions at reducers

3
00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.848
and you grab it's own old state and
it'll modify that.

4
00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:13.832
And then it'll inform Reactive,
things have changed, right?

5
00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:16.712
That's the kind of the process
with the store and the reducers.

6
00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:22.050
Now we have to see how do we
get the actions into Redux.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.971
So we're gonna cover two concepts here,
action creators and actions,

8
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.916
which are separate things.

9
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I want you to come in here, and

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.562
I want you to create a new directory
inside a source called action creators.

11
00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:51.403
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

12
00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:57.295
As is self-descriptive,
these are functions that create actions.

13
00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:58.914
These are also quite simple.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna
create another file in here and

15
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.661
we're gonna call it change animal.js.

16
00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:15.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The only thing this
function does is it creates a well-formed

17
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.891
action.

18
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:23.158
So here I'm just gonna say export
default function changeAnimal.

19
00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:32.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this takes in whatever
data it needs to for the payload.

20
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.652
So animal,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

21
00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:38.365
it returns a well-formatted object.

22
00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:42.483
So the correct type, which will be
CHANGE animal, sorry, SET_ANIMAL.

23
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.994
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And the payload,
which will be animal.

24
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:58.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty simple, right?

25
00:01:58.322 --> 00:01:59.114
That's it.

26
00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:02.487
That's all action creators do,
is they take in some sort of data and

27
00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:04.808
they return to you
a well-formatted object.

28
00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:09.775
Now I'm showing you what the community I
think considers the best practice here.

29
00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:13.960
I didn't invent this pattern of having
separate functions called action creators.

30
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.959
Sometimes your action creators can
be a little bit more complicated.

31
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.690
Rather than just setting just the animal,
it can set a whole bunch of data, right?

32
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.432
And so creating the correct structure for
these actions can be a bit burdensome.

33
00:02:25.432 --> 00:02:29.609
Obviously, this one's not,
two different things.

34
00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.137
Some people would just inline.

35
00:02:31.137 --> 00:02:34.474
These action creators will not have
separate functions that do it.

36
00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:38.795
I just did here to it because
that's what the community does.

37
00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:40.971
So this is up to you.

38
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.924
And you'll kinda get a little
bit more of that as we go along.

39
00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:45.506
But we have a couple
more that we have to do.

40
00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:49.269
We have to have changeLocation.js, and

41
00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.652
this is gonna look relatively similar,
changeLocation.

42
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:01.422
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is gonna be location,

43
00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:06.533
location, and SET_LOCATION.

44
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.156
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As a side note,

45
00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:16.260
these things are literally the ideal
use case for snapshot testing.

46
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.911
This is, don't do that,

47
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.970
this is a JSON structure
that would be perfect just

48
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.363
to say expect,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: changeLocation,

49
00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:35.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Seattle, WA,

50
00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:40.964
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: toEqual,

51
00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:44.805
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: type SET_LOCATION and

52
00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:51.852
payload,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Seattle, WA.

53
00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:53.531
So you could write it like that.

54
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:59.030
This is a little bit burdensome so
you could even just make this a snapshot,

55
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.835
which will make it toEqualSnapshot.

56
00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:06.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's pretty cool.

57
00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.367
Testing these action creators like
that is really compelling, and

58
00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:12.290
I think this is really why a lot of people
opt for this kind of structure, right?

59
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.171
Cuz this is going to store a snapshot
test inside of your Redux directory.

60
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:21.141
That's gonna say like, hey, if someone
comes in here it's like, you know what,

61
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:23.489
I wanted to call this change location.

62
00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:27.045
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This would fail the test,
right?

63
00:04:27.045 --> 00:04:28.054
Either one of these.

64
00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:35.495
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's one good reason
to have this cuz they make this particular

65
00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:39.723
part testable and make sure that
someone doesn't come in the future and

66
00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:43.051
change this to make it not work
the way they expect it to.

67
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.678
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that just

68
00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:52.668
basically a warning to say,
don't change this when it fails?

69
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:54.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so
you wouldn't put these inside of here,

70
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.396
you'd put this inside of
your test directory, right?

71
00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:00.773
But yeah, it basically makes your other
developers or your future self remember,

72
00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:03.776
it's like, I can't change this
because other stuff depends on this.

73
00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:15.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The thing that I try and
guard against in particular with tests is

74
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.718
innocent mistakes like that like
change the name of a action type.

75
00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:22.288
One, you should probably know if you read
any amount of Redux that action types

76
00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:23.272
are very sensitive.

77
00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:27.506
[LAUGH] If you just even misspell
set location, right, if I did that,

78
00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:30.499
it's pretty easy to
overlook that you did that.

79
00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.458
So I try and guard against
those kinda innocent mistakes.

80
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
one more chain of breed

81
00:05:46.683 --> 00:05:49.801
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: ChangeBreed.js.

82
00:05:55.758 --> 00:06:03.082
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Breed, breed,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And SET_BREED.

83
00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:06.892
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There you go.

84
00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:08.372
That SET_BREED as well, and

85
00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:11.935
remember all of the cascading data
affects our handling our reducers.

86
00:06:11.935 --> 00:06:13.894
So here,
it doesn't have to do anything special,

87
00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:19.366
it's just this is better breed,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Reducer looks like.
