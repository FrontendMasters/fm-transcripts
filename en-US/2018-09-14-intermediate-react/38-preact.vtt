00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.413
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're
gonna talk about Preact.

2
00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:05.242
I'm a big Preact fan, so
I get really excited about it.

3
00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:10.300
Preact is a extremely intelligent person
named Jason Miller, decided I can do

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.870
React, but instead of taking 45 kilobytes,
which is what it was at the time.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.510
I can do it in three, and actually at
the time, he did it in less than three.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.040
It's black magic.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.440
It's pure magician craziness.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.220
At the time Jason wasn't
working at Google,

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.280
but Google obviously hired
him because why not.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.780
We tried at Microsoft.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.190
At least I tried.

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.275
He told me-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that why you almost said

13
00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:40.459
stole him?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I wanted to steal him.

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.980
But nonetheless, extremely nice guy.

15
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.450
The Preact project is amazing.

16
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.380
I'm sure every company in the valley
tried to hire him as well.

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.324
[COUGH] So what's cool about Preact,

18
00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.700
Preact does differ
a little bit from React.

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.390
They made some different design choices.

20
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.270
Largely, it's the same.

21
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.623
It still uses JSX, it's still
components and life cycle methods.

22
00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:07.792
Today, even though we haven't
really talked about Preact,

23
00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:12.938
you pretty much know 95% of how write for
Preact, it's mostly the same.

24
00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:17.069
However, if you have an existing
large React application,

25
00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.310
they ship something called preact-compact.

26
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.401
That actually is a drop-in replacement for
React.

27
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:27.221
So it will make your entire React
application work with Preact.

28
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:31.868
So you can go from having,
I think React now has 30,

29
00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:36.742
32 kilobytes' worth of code,
to down to 3, today.

30
00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:40.444
Even though, well,
I guess that it would be about eight,

31
00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.557
because Preact compacts
about five kilobytes.

32
00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:45.774
So the three kilobytes in
the original library and

33
00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:47.841
then the five kilobytes
of the compact layer.

34
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.420
So pretty compelling.

35
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.473
It's not always one to one,
react is evolving and so

36
00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:56.618
it takes preact a bit of time to catch up.

37
00:01:56.618 --> 00:02:00.700
So at the moment of this filming,
there's several features that React does

38
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.830
that Preact doesn't quite do, and don't
get there that they're building them.

39
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.220
But a lot of the stuff that I
showed you with Reach Router

40
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.470
doesn't actually work with Preact.

41
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.060
So I'm gonna show you how to swap out
Reach Router for Preact Router, and

42
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.520
it's largely the same thing.

43
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.681
So not a big deal.

44
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:23.466
So let's get through this pretty quickly.

45
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:25.656
So you're here in the project,

46
00:02:25.656 --> 00:02:29.561
I'm just gonna reinstall my
Node modules really quick.

47
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:31.499
You probably shouldn't have to do this,
but

48
00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.808
you might.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have a question.

49
00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:36.352
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

50
00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:38.257
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why isn't everybody using

51
00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.659
Preact over React then if it's so
much smaller?

52
00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a tradeoff.

53
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:47.056
So in general, and
I'm making generalizations,

54
00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:52.236
this is not gonna necessarily always be
true, the runtime of React is faster.

55
00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:57.496
So once I've downloaded it,
React tends to run faster.

56
00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:00.212
That's not true in every
performance profile.

57
00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:05.124
Some places it's negligible and
some places Preact is gonna be faster.

58
00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:08.401
The big thing that React
does that Preact doesn't do,

59
00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:10.833
React has a synthetic DOM event system.

60
00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:14.081
So it's actually simulating
events inside of itself and

61
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:18.950
running events through its own process
rather than letting the browser do it.

62
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.540
And a big size win for [INAUDIBLE]
because it uses the dom the ben system so

63
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.760
it doesn't have to ship it's
own copy of [INAUDIBLE] system.

64
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.498
That's one of the bigger differences of

65
00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:34.487
the architectures.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Beyond that

66
00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:38.600
react is supported by Facebook and has
a core team of people working on react all

67
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.487
the time and there's just a certain
amount of trust that comes with that.

68
00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.716
Facebook's not gonna
break their own stuff.

69
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:49.320
Google as of this moment
in time employs Jason but

70
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.714
Jason doesn't work on Preact for
his day job.

71
00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:56.082
His day job, he works on Chrome.

72
00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:59.952
A guy working on it and
whatever contributors or

73
00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:03.349
an entire team at Facebook working on it.

74
00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.700
One's an easier sell internally,
I assure you.

75
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.600
[LAUGH] So reasons, I think is my answer
to your question, there are reasons.

76
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.940
I don't know.

77
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.909
Yes, for some things,
react is gonna be a little bit better, and

78
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.130
with the new fiber architecture,
there's really cool stuff coming,

79
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.403
that preact is gonna have
a hard time simulating.

80
00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:27.837
So I think as we go
further into the future,

81
00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:32.315
they're gonna diverged more cuz they're
making different design choices.

82
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.079
Does that not answer your question?

83
00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:36.610
[LAUGH] Cool.

84
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.570
So I want you to npm uninstall or npm un,

85
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.250
if you're lazy like me,
react react-dom and

86
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.387
@reach/router.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

87
00:04:52.387 --> 00:04:57.079
is gonna uninstall those packages because
we're going to install NPM installer

88
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.330
and NPMI.

89
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.350
Preact, preact dash compat,

90
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.250
preact dash context because right
now preact does not have context.

91
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.203
But there is a little library called
preact context that does it for us, and

92
00:05:10.203 --> 00:05:17.261
then preact-router.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A caution

93
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.385
to future video listeners,
by the time that you watch this

94
00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:24.430
video preact context may be built
into preact or preact compact.

95
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.500
They're going to include that in there.

96
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.080
But as of today's writing,
this is a separate library.

97
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.380
So you might want to just check that out.

98
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.461
And I'm sure we will add an annotation
that says this is or not, or it is or

99
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.077
is not.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

100
00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:45.300
so we're gonna come over
to your editor right now.

101
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.220
There's a couple ways you can do this.

102
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.090
You can go in an alias anytime
that using a parcel or

103
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.580
web app to say that anytime I request
a react give me preact compat instead.

104
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.470
Right now I'm just going to
do a giant find and replace.

105
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.593
I think that's going to be
the easiest way for me to do it.

106
00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:09.184
Any time I ask for React replace that with

107
00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:14.941
preact compat so let's see what that does

108
00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:22.303
and,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I need

109
00:06:22.303 --> 00:06:27.379
to do that inside of anything
that's a js file Files to include,

110
00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.400
anything that's a JS file.

111
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.980
So this is gonna go in and
do a find and replace.

112
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.520
Do find and replace in your favorite
way possible, or that you know how to.

113
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.510
I'm doing it with VScode here, so I just
clicked on the magnifying glass here.

114
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.590
And I'm doing a find and replace here so,
you need to search for, in quotes React.

115
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.780
And replace that with preax compat.

116
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.300
Very key here, to put the quotes
because I only want to replace this,

117
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.270
I want to leave React the way it is.

118
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.385
But I want to replace which
package it's coming from

119
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:06.722
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again,

120
00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:10.680
make sure quotes are there, double quotes.

121
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.820
Cuz we're using pretty and
pretty amazing double quotes, okay?

122
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.320
And I only wanna get there from

123
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.210
asterisk.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

124
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.860
let's find all those files
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there we go.

125
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.110
Cuz you should only be
importing react at the top, so

126
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.940
it should only come from
all of our component files.

127
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.310
Here I'm gonna do replace all.

128
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.973
Okay, and I'm gonna do the same for
react-dom.

129
00:07:39.973 --> 00:07:46.357
So that's just only an app.js and
modal.js, so that's good.

130
00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:51.350
Replace that, okay.

131
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.427
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then anywhere that it says

132
00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:02.666
at reach router at react slash router,

133
00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:07.163
replace that with preact dash router, so

134
00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:13.462
that's an app.js, pet.js and
search params, right?

135
00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:17.503
There's a link or a router, so
we'll replace all of those.

136
00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:25.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

137
00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:30.370
anywhere there is a link which
will be in search params,

138
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.240
I think, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where is there

139
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.232
a link?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

140
00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:44.781
in App.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What

141
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.215
are you doing here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is

142
00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:52.905
a difference between Reach router and
React router.

143
00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.041
This says to right here.

144
00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:59.453
So both these times are those too,
just make that an href.

145
00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:02.843
They just had different design choices
there, so that's what that does.

146
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:05.881
And then we also have to do it in pet.js.

147
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.574
So in pet.js, change this to href.

148
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:18.286
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And search context, so

149
00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:21.046
open Search context,

150
00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:26.440
here we have reacts.create context here.

151
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.330
Reacts doesn't, our pre act
doesn't have create context on it,

152
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.712
so we're gonna have to do here is we're
gonna have to import create context

153
00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:41.437
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From pre act -context and

154
00:09:41.437 --> 00:09:48.061
then just change this to
be context like that okay?

155
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.139
Now preact-context will work.

156
00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:01.459
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In search params here.

157
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.940
Where I have navigate.

158
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.870
It's actually called route inside of
preact-router so change that to route.

159
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.600
Again, search params.

160
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.913
This was navigate, but we changed this and
this to be net route instead of navigate.

161
00:10:23.938 --> 00:10:25.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Lastly, in details.js.

162
00:10:31.078 --> 00:10:32.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For whatever reason,

163
00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:39.566
there's a, you have to wrap this in a div.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of the modal,

164
00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:43.404
so you need to add an extra div here
cuz that didn't work in preact.

165
00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:45.990
So I'm demonstrating
to you there are tiny,

166
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.610
tiny differences here that you
kinda just have to worry about.

167
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.840
But in my opinion,
they're not that big of a deal.

168
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.900
So now, if I come over here and
run dev again.

169
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.680
You might have to remove the cache,
-rf .cache/ and dist/.

170
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.890
These are the generated files from
Parsel So I'm gonna say npm run dev.

171
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.101
It'll take a little bit
longer to start up,

172
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:16.480
because he killed the cache.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, up and running.

173
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.670
And now it works.

174
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.920
But the cool thing is, now this is running
with Preact, which is pretty cool, right?

175
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.876
Our entire application, we can search.

176
00:11:25.876 --> 00:11:31.650
Cats, American Curl, submit.

177
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.587
Working with a Preact, so just fathom for

178
00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:42.911
a second that you replaced the entire
core library with a different library.

179
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.221
To me that's fascinating.

180
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:46.186
I think that's really cool.

181
00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:48.844
You couldn't really do that with Angular,
right?

182
00:11:48.844 --> 00:11:52.165
You can't just drop in something else for
Angular, it's Angular, right?

183
00:11:52.165 --> 00:11:56.334
But we were able to save quite
a bit of space by doing that.
