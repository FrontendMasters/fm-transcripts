00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: People are asking how do
you style like global paragraph tags,

2
00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:06.708
stuff like that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

3
00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:10.964
if you didn't want to have any external
CSS and you want it to handle everything

4
00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:14.270
with emotion let's just pull
up emotions documentations.

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.288
Whoops.

6
00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:19.651
Emotion.sh, they have great docs.

7
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:26.162
But think there is a function called
like global or something like that.

8
00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.542
Global styles, this one right here.

9
00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.742
So yeah you import, inject.

10
00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:33.381
Let's make that a little bigger for you.

11
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:35.975
Import inject global like this.

12
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.719
That makes it unreadable.

13
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.351
And then you just do injectGlobal and
you can just put a style sheet in there.

14
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.723
And it will just inject that,
and you can do that in anything.

15
00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:50.637
So, if you wanted to see
what that looks like,

16
00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:54.893
does this export injectGlobal?

17
00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.514
InjectGlobal, like that.

18
00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.787
And then I say injectGlobal.

19
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:14.888
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you come back here

20
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:19.449
notice now all my text is red
cuz I injected in to global.

21
00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:21.979
Everything should have a color red, okay?

22
00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.244
So it literally takes that and
injects it into your global style

23
00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:30.338
sheet.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is fun.

24
00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:33.596
I would not suggest injecting
global in just a random component.

25
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:34.880
It's a terrible idea.

26
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.544
Because you are never
gonna find that lighter.

27
00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:41.495
[LAUGH] So you should have like one
file that does inject global and

28
00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:47.912
then be done with it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So one question

29
00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:52.342
you should be having from yourself
is look, CSS has no overhead, right?

30
00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:55.572
The browser just downloads it,
parses it and shows it.

31
00:01:55.572 --> 00:02:01.598
This is a terrible idea there shouldn't
performance overheads here, right?

32
00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:04.381
This is kinda why I've chosen to
move away from styles components.

33
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:08.999
Is style components, it's a big
library and it has a run time so

34
00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:13.808
the runtime is actually kinda slow
can be kinda slow I should say.

35
00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:16.425
Poorly written style
components can be slow.

36
00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:18.299
The motion's small.

37
00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.534
It's a couple of kilobytes,
and it's quite fast.

38
00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:24.926
Furthermore, you can actually
go even a step further.

39
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:29.395
You can run your application and
have it generate a style sheet,

40
00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.725
which is then loaded on the side.

41
00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:33.220
I'm not going to show you
how to do that today.

42
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.717
It's a lot of setup.

43
00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:38.523
You can actually have it
generate all of your CSS for you,

44
00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:44.978
which is great.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Going along with that,

45
00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:49.734
with that generated based on like
conditionals that you do, or

46
00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:54.847
would it just be kind of like
a baseline default styles, not the ones

47
00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:59.242
that where you could call a function?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You still need the runtime

48
00:02:59.242 --> 00:02:59.862
for that.

49
00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:03.846
Emotion still has to do things for you,
it's not just going to remove itself

50
00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:08.095
entirely from the equation, but there's
a bunch of stuff that it can do for you.

51
00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:12.037
So that's fair, it's not actually going to
generate everything in the style sheet,

52
00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:14.521
but you can have it basically
generate what you need for

53
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.031
the first render so that you can inline
it in the head or something like that for

54
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:23.681
your critical styles path.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

55
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:30.494
have to do service head
rendering to accomplish that.

56
00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:33.186
Which I will show you how to do
service head rendering later.

57
00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:35.364
Just not with emotion.
