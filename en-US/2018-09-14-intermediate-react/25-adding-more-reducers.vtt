00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.367
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here we have this
combine reducers, and this function

2
00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:12.270
that combine reducers makes is passed
into here, into the reducer here.

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.982
So, a brief aside here,
the only thing that's actually

4
00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:25.601
really required in a reducer is that
the action is an object and it has a type.

5
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:29.699
That's the bare minimum requirements
of what an action must look like.

6
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.170
We're going one step above this
by adhering to something called

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.922
Flux Standard Actions.

8
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just something
that I do because I don't have a reason

9
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.030
not to, [LAUGH] not because there's
any particular good reason to do it.

10
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.005
So Flux Standard Action,
this was invented by Andrew Clark who

11
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.091
invented Redux itself
along with Dan Abermoth.

12
00:00:55.091 --> 00:01:01.669
And it's basically just a shape to these
objects that has a type and a payload.

13
00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:03.909
In fact it really only has to have a type.

14
00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.075
It can have a payload, it can have
an error, and it can have a meta property.

15
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:13.395
Now, why do we adhere to
these Flux Standard Actions?

16
00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:15.903
Why don't we just make up
our own action shapes?

17
00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:20.388
There is some tools that you can use that
are built on top of Flux Standard Actions,

18
00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:24.679
and if you adhere to these different rules
then you get some additional tooling

19
00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.255
benefits behind the scene.

20
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:30.238
I've never used the tools so I really
couldn't explain much more than that, but

21
00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:31.654
that's what we're doing.

22
00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:35.253
If you're more interested,
just check out Flux Standard Action.

23
00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:41.489
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll talk about
the difference between Redux and

24
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:42.381
Flux at the end.

25
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.453
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

26
00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:53.426
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's actually just go through and

27
00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:59.360
finish out our reducers here since none of
them have to be particularly difficult.

28
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.764
So we have this location reducer,

29
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:10.639
I'm gonna make another one
called the animal reducer.

30
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.859
So animal.js, and
I'm literally just gonna copy and

31
00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.488
paste what was in the location reducer and
just rename all the correct things.

32
00:02:18.488 --> 00:02:21.812
animalReducer, the initial
state will be empty, right,

33
00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:25.136
cuz that's the initial state
that we have for animals, but

34
00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:29.741
it could be dog, if you wanted to have dog
be the default thing that you search for.

35
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:31.659
And this will be SET_ANIMAL.

36
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:35.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's it.

37
00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:39.158
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
someone might say, well,

38
00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.389
this looks really similar
to the other one.

39
00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.289
Couldn't we have some sort of
higher order reducer generator?

40
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.446
You could, but
the word higher order reducer generator,

41
00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:51.903
that's a bunch of words slammed together
that just gives me a little bit of pause.

42
00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:53.854
I like the explicitness of this, right?

43
00:02:53.854 --> 00:03:00.003
Cuz later I might come in here and
SET_ANIMAL might need to do more things.

44
00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.406
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, this is good.

45
00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:05.403
This is what animal.js should look like.

46
00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:09.745
We're going to make another
one called breed.js.

47
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:18.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is one that
we're going to the breed reducer.

48
00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:21.330
Again, you can have here Havanese or
Poodle or something like that.

49
00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:28.121
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna put above here,

50
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:33.934
if (action.type === "SET_BREED").

51
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:46.251
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then return action.payload.

52
00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:52.085
And then here, I'm gonna change
this to be else if it's SET_ANIMAL,

53
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:56.087
then we're going to return
empty string right?

54
00:03:56.087 --> 00:03:59.006
Because if we are changing the animal,

55
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.461
then the breech is reset
back to empty string.

56
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:07.546
So this is how one reducer can respond
to multiple different action types.

57
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, one more.

58
00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:33.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: breeds, with an s, .js.

59
00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:37.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We wanna
have a breedsReducer.

60
00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:44.351
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is gonna be SET_BREEDS.

61
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.671
And instead of making that empty string,
it'll be an empty array, and

62
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.970
that's it for that.

63
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.754
This is when someone request
a new list of BREEDS,

64
00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:55.218
we're gonna keep that Redux store as well.

65
00:04:57.876 --> 00:05:00.276
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that gets all of our reducers for

66
00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:01.859
our project out of the way.

67
00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:06.623
So go back to your index.js and
we're just going to import all of these so

68
00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:08.430
we're gonna have animal.

69
00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:18.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And breed and breeds.

70
00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:25.393
Okay, and we're gonna have to
import all of those as well,

71
00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:29.721
import animal from "./animal",

72
00:05:29.721 --> 00:05:33.914
import breed from "./breed" and

73
00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:38.261
import breeds from "./breeds".

74
00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, question.

75
00:05:45.517 --> 00:05:48.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why isn't breed
part of the animal reducer?

76
00:05:48.978 --> 00:05:54.295
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why isn't breed
part of the animal reducer?

77
00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:56.535
So if you go into the animal one, and

78
00:05:56.535 --> 00:06:02.422
someone calls SET_ANIMAL,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

79
00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:05.741
if someone sets the breed
to be a different breed, so

80
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:10.733
you go from Poodle to Havanese, you
don't have to change the animal, right?

81
00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:12.473
It's still a dog, right?

82
00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:15.919
But the inverse is true
that if I come into breed,

83
00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.147
if someone changes from cat to dog,
Poodle doesn't make sense anymore.

84
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.491
So you have to set that
back to empty stream.

85
00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:30.887
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
breedReducer, its entire world,

86
00:06:30.887 --> 00:06:35.044
the only thing it ever cares
about is the breed, right?

87
00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:37.888
It doesn't care about animal,
it doesn't affect any other reducer.

88
00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:39.943
Reducers don't talk to each other, right?

89
00:06:39.943 --> 00:06:43.531
The only thing this ever cares
about is the answer to what is

90
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:48.163
the currently set breed, and if you
set the breed then that's the answer.

91
00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:50.608
If you set the animal
then it's empty string,

92
00:06:50.608 --> 00:06:53.063
otherwise it's just
whatever it was before.

93
00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:57.407
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's a good question, but

94
00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:59.807
it has to do with your data dependencies.
