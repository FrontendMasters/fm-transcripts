00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's kind of
the general tour of the application.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.920
Now, you want to go in and
write some tests for this using Jest.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.925
So Jest is a testing framework
built by Facebook, and

4
00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:16.116
it's what they actually use
themselves to test React.

5
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.074
It's not necessarily exclusive to React,
in fact,

6
00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:21.914
I use Jest extensively to
test Node applications.

7
00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:23.936
It's really good at
testing Node applications.

8
00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:27.920
So Jest is useful beyond just
testing React applications,

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.396
though it is also quite good at that.

10
00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.941
Jest is actually, underneath the hood,

11
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:36.733
mostly Jasmine if you've ever
used Jasmine testing before.

12
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.865
It uses the same testing, or matchers and

13
00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:44.860
those kind of things that all
stuff it's built into Jasmine.

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.200
You don't necessarily need to
know that but just know that,

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.770
that's what actually what's
doing the testing is Jasmine.

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.927
So you can look at the Jasmine
documentation when we're using Jest.

17
00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:58.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and

18
00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:03.598
go install our testing solutions.

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.753
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So inside of your
directory, the complete intro to react v4.

20
00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:17.040
We are gonna do npm install -D to
install into the dev dependencies.

21
00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:23.760
Jest and react-test-renderer,

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.200
make sure that you get
renderer cuz it's a renderer

23
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.340
that threw me off,
it's also hard to say for me, okay?

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.208
Cuz we're gonna install two
independencies, one being Jest, right?

25
00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:42.095
The testing solution and
one's going to be a renderer for React.

26
00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:45.728
That's not ReactDOM, cuz ReactDOM
requires a browser to be present, right?

27
00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:48.461
So react-test-renderer allows
this to be done inside of Nodes,

28
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:49.938
we don't have to spin up a browser.

29
00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.262
So this goes way faster.

30
00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:54.509
Anything that has to use
a browser goes super, super slow.

31
00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:03.176
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that'll take a second to install.

32
00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:08.164
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're just gonna
test one of our routes, right?

33
00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.752
We have this details.js page,
that we're gonna test.

34
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:18.169
Doesn't do a ton,
it's just this page right here.

35
00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:22.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one, if it works.

36
00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:27.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One of
these is bound to work.

37
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.600
Zorbo, that one worked.

38
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.777
So we're gonna test this route
right here that renders this page.

39
00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.733
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it has a componentDidMount,

40
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:43.323
it has a modal that it does and
a render method.

41
00:02:43.323 --> 00:02:48.443
So what I want you to do is
I want you to go in to your

42
00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:53.572
application inside of
your source directory.

43
00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:58.621
I want you to make a new folder and

44
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:05.922
call it __, so two underscores tests__.

45
00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:08.579
Now, that's a weird name,
why would I call it that?

46
00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.784
Well, the nice thing that Jest does for
you,

47
00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:13.702
Jest has a bunch of just same
configurations out of the box.

48
00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:18.205
It knows by default and
it's under in an __tests__ directory,

49
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:22.239
it's a test and so,
it will run that for you automatically.

50
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.417
You don't have to tell
it where they exist.

51
00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:27.433
It just looks for those folders and
runs everything in them.

52
00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:31.349
We can also put this in the same directory
and call it like app.test.js and

53
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.728
it would run that as well.

54
00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:36.614
So that's the kinds of
things that it looks for.

55
00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:39.223
If you're curious where the double
underscore thing comes from,

56
00:03:39.223 --> 00:03:40.394
it's actually from Python.

57
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.460
If any of you have written Python before,
double underscore means magical.

58
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.170
So it magically will
find these directions.

59
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.755
So it's just kind of a forewarning,
it's like hey,

60
00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:54.039
magical stuff happens because
there's double underscores here.

61
00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:59.060
So, okay.

62
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.624
So in here, make a new file,
and we're gonna call that

63
00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:08.969
Details.test.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

64
00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:12.528
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
instead of the test directory,

65
00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:15.459
make a file called Details.test.js, and

66
00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.387
now we are gonna write some tests for,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This particular route,

67
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:25.029
so first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna import React from React.

68
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to import,

69
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:36.215
create from react-test-renderer, and

70
00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:43.872
we're going to import Details
from ../Details, right?

71
00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:48.488
Because we're going upper directory
to grab the details route, okay?

72
00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.418
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna

73
00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:59.681
write test,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

74
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:01.789
we're gonna write a snapshot test.

75
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's talk about that for a second.

76
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:11.870
First thing is, it's gonna say,
hey, I don't know what test is.

77
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.221
This project is using ESLint.

78
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.928
So if you are using ESLint,

79
00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:21.990
the way that you can make
this not be an error anymore

80
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.759
is to go into your eslintrc.json,
and you come in here and

81
00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.982
where it says env down here,
just add a jest: true.

82
00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:36.794
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now if you go back in here,

83
00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:40.530
it's gonna say, test is a global that
comes from Jest, I know what that is.

84
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.922
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then the first
thing that we're gonna do here is make

85
00:05:49.922 --> 00:05:50.455
a component.

86
00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:56.895
So I'm gonna say,
create Details / like that.

87
00:05:56.895 --> 00:06:03.156
So now inside of c is gonna be
an instance of this details.

88
00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:07.476
And then I'm gonna say,

89
00:06:07.476 --> 00:06:16.128
expect(c.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot.
