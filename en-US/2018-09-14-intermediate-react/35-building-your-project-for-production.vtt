00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.516
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna need babel-cli
so that we can compile our node

2
00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:09.310
applications with babel, cuz we still have
JSX inside of our application, right?

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.400
And node out of the box does
not know how to understand JSX.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.440
JSX is not normal JavaScript, so

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.330
we need to have babel compile our
node code, which is not atypical.

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.349
That happens frequently.

7
00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.774
So babel-cli, and then the other one
we need to put in here is express.

8
00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:31.371
Express is a JavaScript
node's server-side framework.

9
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:35.036
You could use happy.js, you could
use any of the other ones out there.

10
00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:38.743
I'm just gonna show you Express cuz it's
the most common and the most simple,

11
00:00:38.743 --> 00:00:39.429
to be honest.

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.290
So install those two as well.

13
00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:48.202
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you don't need
the capital d there, so that's fine.

14
00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:51.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that'll install those two.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.878
I want you to go into
your package.json now.

16
00:00:55.878 --> 00:01:00.597
Here inside of scripts,
we're gonna put a couple more things.

17
00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:03.389
The first thing is,
we're not gonna be using our dev server,

18
00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.871
we're gonna be building for
production now, right?

19
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.444
Because that's what our
Node server's gonna serve.

20
00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:11.150
So we're gonna make
another one called build.

21
00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:17.841
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's gonna be parcel

22
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:22.918
build --public-url

23
00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:30.028
./dist/src/index.html.

24
00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:31.843
You need a comma up there as well.

25
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:32.814
So let's talk about this.

26
00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:35.942
Parcel build is going to build
your application for production.

27
00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:39.611
So it's gonna minify,
it's going to do all that stuff for you.

28
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:43.851
--public-url, this is going
to identify where your static

29
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:45.936
assets are being served from.

30
00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:50.857
Right, cuz all these relative
paths need to be correct, right.

31
00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:58.361
So if I'm trying to serve client app,
I need it to say /dist/public url.

32
00:01:58.361 --> 00:01:59.612
That's what that's doing.

33
00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:02.680
And then here I'm giving it the entry
point just like I did up here.

34
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.849
So that's what build does for you.

35
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:09.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you're
gonna put start underneath that.

36
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.653
This is gonna start our Node application
to do the server-side rendering.

37
00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:18.564
So npm,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna do it so

38
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:20.123
it does npm run build, so

39
00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:24.074
it's gonna run build first before
it starts the application.

40
00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:28.563
And then I'm gonna say &amp;&amp;, so
this is only gonna work in bash.

41
00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:35.098
If you're in Windows, you might have
to do this a little bit differently.

42
00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:37.633
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're
doing this with Windows,

43
00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.586
I'll show you how to do
it in just a second.

44
00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:45.795
But if you're doing this with bash,
babel-node

45
00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:50.892
server/index.js
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

46
00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:53.124
now you can do one command
if you're doing bash.

47
00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:54.435
It just says npm run start.

48
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:56.698
It'll build it and it'll start serving.

49
00:02:56.698 --> 00:03:01.349
If you're on Windows,
get rid of this &amp;&amp; business right here.

50
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.139
And so it's just this.

51
00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:08.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's just that,
and then you, on Windows,

52
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.211
have to remember to run npm run build
first and then run npm run start.

53
00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.519
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, good.

54
00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:25.862
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The key is that you have
to build your project first, right?

55
00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:28.042
You have to compile all
the assets together.

56
00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.966
I just do this because I often
forget to compile my assets, but

57
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.343
I can't start the Node
server until I compile it.

58
00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:35.601
So it works a little bit better for me.
