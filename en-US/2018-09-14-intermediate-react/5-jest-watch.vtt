00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Brian: Show you one more cool feature
about Jest that I like, npm run test, and

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.840
if I do --, anything that I put after
the -- will actually pass to Jest.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.456
So I can put -- watch,
like that, and run it.

4
00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:20.056
And it's actually gonna run Jest in
an interactive mode which I find to be

5
00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:20.910
fascinating.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.635
So I can just hit A, and
it'll rerun all the test again for me.

7
00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:29.957
&gt;&gt; Brian: Or I can tell to,
only run some tests, right?

8
00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:33.914
But it'll actually be file
watching all of my modules.

9
00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:38.229
And if I change anything inside details,
it'll rerun the test because it knows that

10
00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.790
the details test pulls in
the details module, right?

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.010
So, let's go make it fail again.

12
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.980
If I turn this to true.

13
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.450
Saved it.
Now, I have to go back over here and

14
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.980
it's going to say, hey,
that failed, right?

15
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.990
You get instant feedback that that failed.

16
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.487
And then, if I go back and change it
to false again, it goes, no, I'm happy.

17
00:00:56.487 --> 00:00:59.930
So, it only runs the subset of tests that
could have possibly failed in the interim.

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.770
I don't know if any of you have enormous
test feats that take minutes to run.

19
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.540
This is a godsend for
those sorts of people, right?

20
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.470
Something else that just does
that's really intelligent,

21
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.300
it runs the last test to fail first.

22
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.404
So it'll actually run
your tests out of order,

23
00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:21.414
because it wants to fail
as fast as possible.

24
00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.955
Which I also find to be extremely useful.

25
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:30.682
So, let's go ahead and
add that to our pax.json as well.

26
00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:36.736
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, we have test update here,
test : watch.

27
00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:45.162
This is jest -- silent -- watch,
like that.

28
00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.729
&gt;&gt; Brian: And now, you can just say,
mpm run test : watch,

29
00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.410
and it puts you right into
that mode right away.
