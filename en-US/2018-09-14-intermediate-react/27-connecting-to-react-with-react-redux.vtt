00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:02.962
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's go actually make
this work with redux itself.

2
00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:13.242
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
rather we're gonna open app.js again.

3
00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:23.541
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we're just going to import the provider.

4
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.380
&gt;&gt; Brian: import [ Provider
as ReduxProvider },

5
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:43.854
&gt;&gt; Brian: from './', not './', reactRedux.

6
00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:48.812
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
now this gives a ReduxProvider.

7
00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:53.669
It works just like the provider from
context that we have previously

8
00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:54.782
talked about.

9
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.221
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then down here wrapping
this Provider right here or inside,

10
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:04.098
it doesn't actually
really matter too much.

11
00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:09.943
We'll put it on the outside here, I guess.

12
00:01:09.943 --> 00:01:15.151
So ReduxProvider,
store is going be equal to store.

13
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:20.721
And I have to import
that store from ./store.

14
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.530
So I'll show you that
here in just a second

15
00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:31.445
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then you can see up here,

16
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.902
I imported store right there on line 10.

17
00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.304
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so
that's ReduxProvider right there.

18
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:58.320
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now anywhere that I
want to grab the Redux store state,

19
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.331
I can do that because now I
have this ReduxProvider here.

20
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.717
&gt;&gt; Brian: So just to kinda show you what
that looks like before we kinda change

21
00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:09.337
that for good.

22
00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.830
We're just doing location at the moment,
and then I'll show you the rest and

23
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.454
how to connect everything back up.

24
00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:18.899
So just go ahead and
delete LocationChange right here.

25
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:22.159
And we'll drop that as
well from our state.

26
00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.598
And we'll drop Location from
here in our state, as well.

27
00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:31.160
So I'm deleting everything to do
with location, inside of our app.js.

28
00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:39.575
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

29
00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:53.070
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Just

30
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.853
to kinda show you how that works and
then we'll refactor here in just a second.

31
00:02:56.853 --> 00:03:02.172
I'm going to,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

32
00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:05.285
let's do this this inside of Results.

33
00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:12.046
So inside of Results.source, right here,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right now,

34
00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.677
everything is coming from
the searchParams here in the context.

35
00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:24.218
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, this got messy quickly,
but that's okay.

36
00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:30.552
const function ResultsWithContext, here.

37
00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:37.438
I'm gonna do a thing here called
mapStateToProps, const mapStateToProps.

38
00:03:37.438 --> 00:03:42.130
This is at the bottom of results.js.

39
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.720
This is gonna be equal to
a function with animal, breed, and

40
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.412
we'll just do actually
location at the moment.

41
00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:58.183
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then we're going to
return an object here of location.

42
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:09.583
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then we're going to export

43
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:16.524
default connect(mapStateToProps) and

44
00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:21.156
(ResultsWithContext).

45
00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:29.600
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this automatically,
not http2, wow.

46
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.792
We want this from react-redux.

47
00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:38.657
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
that's what this connect function does.

48
00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:43.154
[COUGH] It takes the mapStateToProps
function that we use,

49
00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:46.747
it grabs data out of the store,
looking here.

50
00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:48.192
So this is the store, right?

51
00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:50.092
This gives you everything
inside of the store and

52
00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:51.767
I'm just grabbing the location out of it.

53
00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:54.478
And I'm returning here an object.

54
00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:59.212
If you're confused about what this is,
you could totally

55
00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:04.750
put,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like this.

56
00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:10.492
&gt;&gt; Brian: return, that's it, so
that's what this is actually doing.

57
00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:16.654
It's just returning an object
with location: location, right?

58
00:05:16.654 --> 00:05:21.679
So I'm connecting this, I'm connecting
the results with context to the react

59
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:26.405
store and it's going to inject location
as a prop to ResultsWithContext,

60
00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:28.967
which then get passed on to these props.

61
00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:32.884
Which then eventually get
passed in to Results.

62
00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:36.363
It's kinda several steps there,
but that's okay, right?

63
00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:41.326
What I want you to observe at this
is the mapStateToProps, right?

64
00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:45.293
We call connect into the first
function here with mapStateToProps.

65
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:49.783
And this is one function that returns
another function that we're calling right

66
00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:51.633
here with ResultsWithContext,

67
00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:54.816
which is injecting location
into ResultsWithContext.

68
00:05:54.816 --> 00:06:00.180
So now, up here in Results, on this.props,

69
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.451
this.props.location like that.

70
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.282
&gt;&gt; Brian: location, location.

71
00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:20.469
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep, that's good.

72
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.347
So now this.props.location is
coming from the Redux store.

73
00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:25.807
So everything here should still work.

74
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:29.293
We just won't be able to update it right
now cuz we haven't written that part

75
00:06:29.293 --> 00:06:29.897
of the code.

76
00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:33.359
&gt;&gt; Brian: So is this running?

77
00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:37.228
It is, okay, localhost.

78
00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.920
&gt;&gt; Brian: Which is going
into the search box, right?

79
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.184
And search box reading it from context.

80
00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:56.530
So we'd have to do that as well.

81
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.036
So we'll get there in just a second, but

82
00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:05.828
do you see how we get data out of
Redux and into a React application?

83
00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:07.118
Does that make sense?

84
00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.942
&gt;&gt; Brian: We use this mapStateToProps,

85
00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:18.542
connect is a function that
we give this function to.

86
00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:24.706
And that will inject that as
props into ResultsWithContext.

87
00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:27.192
And that's all that mapStateToProps does.
