1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.173
Astro by default,

2
00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:05.217
anything that you put in the pages
directory gets treated as a route.

3
00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:09.143
So index.html is your / home route.

4
00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:12.796
So just, your site.com/,
that's what index is.

5
00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.673
And if we wanna create something
else we can create about.astro, but

6
00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:19.823
we can also use mark down here so

7
00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:24.631
we can create about.md and
we'll get /about there as well.

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:27.530
You can ship .HTML files if you'd like.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.625
Those .HTML files are missing
a few of the Astro features.

10
00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.853
So those are like if you're trying
to migrate something over and

11
00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:38.997
you don't have time to make it work with
the astro components syntax or something.

12
00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.982
Or you've got some special
thing you don't wanna rewrite,

13
00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:44.333
drop some HTML in
incrementally migrate over.

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.607
With a plugin you can use MDX,
if you're familiar with MDX.

15
00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:50.011
We won't really touch on that today.

16
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.011
I've talked about it in
previous workshops and

17
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:54.871
there are great resources out there for
anybody who wants to learn.

18
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.209
But the general idea is MDX is
a way to write markdown that

19
00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.341
supports JSX components.

20
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:06.334
So you can bring in a React component or
there's one for Svelte, there's one for

21
00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:11.400
Solid, and that way you can kinda build
out sites that are mostly content driven,

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.807
but where you need it.

23
00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:16.599
Like if you wanna put in a dynamic
newsletter capture or something,

24
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.334
you can use a React component to
drop that in, and MDX allows that.

25
00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:25.300
We also have the ability to use .js or
.ts in a markdown page,

26
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.847
which is a special case
called an endpoint.

27
00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:31.849
We'll look at that later when we
get into the rss feed for the blog.

28
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.393
But you can use that for delivering json,
sending up a little, like a simple API,

29
00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:42.155
and a whole bunch of other things
that we can talk about later on.

30
00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:46.951
So what I wanna do is I want
to create an about page.

31
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.773
So I'm gonna create a new file and
we're gonna set it up as about.md.

32
00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:53.528
So this about page doesn't
have anything but text on it.

33
00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:55.315
So I'm gonna keep it
as simple as possible.

34
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.175
I just wanna have some markdown.

35
00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:01.303
And in here I have the content.

36
00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:03.423
So I have this workshop assets folder.

37
00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.894
And this is all the stuff that I don't
want anybody to have to watch me type out

38
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.511
or I don't want you to have
to transcribe off the screen.

39
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.279
So whenever I'm using one of these,
I'll try to remember to call it out, but

40
00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.897
a lot of times, I'm just gonna be
copy-pasting something out of here.

41
00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:19.204
So for this about page,
I'm going to copy this and

42
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:22.397
come in to my new about page and save.

43
00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:26.707
And then when I come out here,
I can navigate to About,

44
00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:29.156
and we've got a page, right?

45
00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.443
So this is the Astro workflow.

46
00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:32.006
We're kind of just getting in here.

47
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:36.046
We're creating pages,
we're making things just function.

48
00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.554
And when I say that things
are really quick to start,

49
00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:39.870
this is kind of what I mean.

50
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.065
We were just making the website now,
right?

51
00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:47.946
So if you wanna quickly mock something
out, you wanna try something out,

52
00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.691
it happens nice and fast.

53
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:52.659
Next, these pages aren't linked together.

54
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.060
They're not styled we
don't have a lot going on.

55
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.300
So what we wanna do is create
what's called a layout.

56
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.233
And this is gonna introduce
the idea of an astro component.

57
00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:04.684
So the index page is,
you may have noticed a .astro file.

58
00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:09.466
So that's an astro component, but we're
not really using it as a component right

59
00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.114
now, we're just putting some HTML in here.

60
00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:15.738
So let's create a new
folder called layouts.

61
00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:23.405
And inside of that folder,
we're gonna create a new file, and

62
00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.377
we'll call this one default.astro.

63
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:34.504
Inside of this, we are going to move
a lot of what was in the index.astro.

64
00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:39.985
And I think I have this
stored up in the markup, yes.

65
00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:44.534
So in this markup folder,
there is a starter here.

66
00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:49.232
And this is all the markup we want

67
00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:53.586
to use in our default layout.

68
00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:55.528
So let's look a little
bit at what this does.

69
00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:56.795
I'll make this bigger.

70
00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:02.856
So we've got our head component, and
I'm gonna use a few Google fonts in this.

71
00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.563
So we set up the "preconnect" here.

72
00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:07.613
We set up our favicon,

73
00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:12.999
we've got a link to the actual
Google font that we're gonna use.

74
00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:18.687
And then we add in a title, so
that we can identify our site.

75
00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:20.597
Next, we've got a header so

76
00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:26.101
the header has a link to the homepage with
a logo we've got todo to add in NAV items.

77
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.489
And a todo to add in display content.

78
00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:31.181
And then we wrap the whole
thing up with some footer.

79
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.083
You can functionally ignore the footer.

80
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:38.291
I mostly just left it in there for
the link demo.

81
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.989
So with that,
this is the layout that we wanna use.

82
00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:46.498
And it looks as you can see,
it's we're just telling Astro,

83
00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:49.545
here's some HTML that we want you to use.

84
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:52.934
So this isn't done yet, but we're
gonna go ahead and give it a shot and

85
00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:53.920
see how this works.

86
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.672
So I'm gonna go into my index.astro.

87
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:05.989
And I'm gonna introduce something called
frontmatter, which is how Astro files or

88
00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:11.878
Astro components allow us to do
kind of like build time processing.

89
00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:14.899
It allows us to do stuff that
won't show up in the browser.

90
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:19.849
And the way that I'm gonna
do this is I'm gonna import

91
00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.931
my layout from layouts/default.astro.

92
00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:26.354
So that's the file we just created.

93
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:32.324
And then instead of having all of this

94
00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:38.107
I'm going to change it to a layout.

95
00:05:38.107 --> 00:05:42.227
And so this is then all we
need inside of our index

96
00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:45.935
because the layout is handled elsewhere.

97
00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:49.863
Now, this is gonna break but I wanna
show you how this works to start and

98
00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:51.737
then we'll look at how to fix it.

99
00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:57.339
So if we look at the homepage right now,
you can see that we've got the header and

100
00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.360
footer, but we're missing our content.

101
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.108
So how do we get that
content into our layout?

102
00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:07.541
Because this is the way
that we want this to work.

103
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:10.873
We're passing in the content
of the page as children, but

104
00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:13.661
Astro components aren't React components,
so

105
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:17.685
we don't have that concept of like
adding children in there as a prop.

106
00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:22.619
Instead, we do something different
in an Astro component.

107
00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:26.122
Now, frontmatter can do a lot,
instead of kind of doing a whole

108
00:06:26.122 --> 00:06:29.032
session on the individual
pieces of frontmatter and

109
00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:32.952
what you can do with it, we're gonna
learn it incrementally as we go.

110
00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:36.998
So we'll start with this,
we're importing a component.

111
00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:39.918
And throughout the course of
this workshop, we'll do more and

112
00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:42.520
more things with the frontmatter
in Astro components.

113
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.544
So stick with me, and
more things will become available.

114
00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:51.155
There's also a whole section in the Astro
docs, which are excellent, that will help.

115
00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:54.847
Kind of disambiguate anything that
you feel like I glossed over, or

116
00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:58.860
if you just want a deep dive on a
particular concept, if we didn't cover it

117
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.328
in a way that you want,
definitely check out those Astro docs.

118
00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:08.469
So what I'm gonna do next is I want this
content to show through in my layout.

119
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:13.813
So back in the default.astro,
we've got this to do to display content.

120
00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:18.541
And the way this works in
Astro is you put in a slot.

121
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:26.536
And so a slot, it's very similar
to how children in React works.

122
00:07:26.536 --> 00:07:29.541
The major difference is that
you can have named slots,

123
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:32.492
which allows you to have
multiple slots on your page.

124
00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:38.422
So for example, if you wanted to
make the title of your page dynamic,

125
00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:41.505
you could have a slot called title.

126
00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:46.792
And then on each page, you could
specify the title tag on that page.

127
00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:50.930
Now, there are easier ways to do that in
Astro where you can use the frontmatter

128
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.199
to specify the title and
so on and so forth.

129
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.696
But this is a really flexible and
powerful way to do it.

130
00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:59.425
We're not gonna get into it because I feel
like a lot of times that's not necessary.

131
00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:03.331
I think as you get into more complex
projects, you may need that, today for

132
00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:06.191
what we're building,
we're not going to need that.

133
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:07.959
So we'll start here.

134
00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:11.465
But as you can see, adding that slot,
now we've got the content,

135
00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:12.973
is coming through, right?

136
00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:20.689
So that's the guts of
how an Astro site works.

137
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:21.518
We've got layouts.

138
00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:26.571
And if I go over to, I wanna actually
set this up in my About page as well,

139
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.810
because my About page right
now doesn't have that layout.

140
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.658
So if I head into my markdown file
I can do the same thing where I

141
00:08:35.658 --> 00:08:37.845
add some frontmatter, but

142
00:08:37.845 --> 00:08:43.570
frontmatter is a little bit different
this isn't an Astro component.

143
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.624
So we're not using in
JavaScript to import,

144
00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:51.683
we just set a tag of layout or

145
00:08:51.683 --> 00:08:57.808
a frontmatter property of layout and
give it the path.

146
00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:04.886
So we save that and,
spelled it wrong, there it is.

147
00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:10.245
So now, same concept,
we've got our home page is using a layout,

148
00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:12.936
our About page is using a layout.

149
00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:16.549
This is a combination of Astro
components and markdown files.

150
00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:21.433
And all of that is running
off of the same layout.

151
00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:24.770
Now, there are ways that you
can do some specialty things,

152
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.125
we'll look at that in just a minute here.

153
00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:32.465
But this is giving us the control
we need to get through building

154
00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:37.418
out the guts of our site,
our homepage and our About page.

155
00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:41.187
So, at this point,
we're not styled we don't have any any,

156
00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:43.807
like visual layout or anything like that.

157
00:09:43.807 --> 00:09:45.309
So let's add that and

158
00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:50.408
this is going to show another another
really powerful concept in Astro.

159
00:09:50.408 --> 00:09:55.116
It's not original to Astro, this is
something that I believe was borrowed from

160
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:59.840
Vue, from Svelte, probably from
frameworks before that that I didn't use.
