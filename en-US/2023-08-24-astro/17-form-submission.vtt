1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.270
What if I wanna use this newsletter
form on a different page?

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.470
Do I have to make that page pre render or
server rendered as well?

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.220
The answer is no.

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.920
And this is why I love this
hybrid rendering so much.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.880
So why don't we just go ahead and
add this to our homepage now.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.556
So the first thing I need is we're
gonna add a newsletter image so

7
00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:22.950
we can go back up into
our workshop assets.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.312
We've got this newsletter.jpg,
so copy that, and

9
00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.460
then come down to your images and
paste it in here.

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.360
And I think that might be
the end of the workshop assets.

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.330
We're in the homestretch here.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.649
We're gonna get this running and
then we're off to the races with Astro.

13
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.746
So the next thing I wanna do,
I'm gonna close all these down and

14
00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:48.990
let's make that big again and
I'm gonna open up our home page.

15
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.690
So let's add a newsletter
to our home page.

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.382
So to do that I'm gonna come
up to import our newsletter

17
00:00:56.382 --> 00:01:01.050
image from images and newsletter.jpeg.

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.290
And then down here,
we wanna add one more section.

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.795
And this one has a class of block and
then newsletter.

20
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:20.300
Inside, we're going to add our image
as a source of newsletter image.

21
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.038
The newsletter image, give an Alt,

22
00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:30.109
civil say bag with the word

23
00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.107
sandwich superimposed on it and

24
00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:41.630
that's everything for that image.

25
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.610
So then we're gonna set up some copies so
we'll give a class of copy.

26
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.340
So this is the nudge for somebody
why they would join this newsletter.

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.353
So for ours, we're gonna say,
prefer your sandwiches to go?

28
00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:00.210
Can you tell that I wanted
to be a copywriter also?

29
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.203
And then we're gonna say,

30
00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:09.411
get the sandwich newsletter to hear

31
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:15.494
what else qualifies as a sandwich first.

32
00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:20.550
All right, and
then we're gonna drop in that form again.

33
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.764
So we can get the same
form that we had here.

34
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.329
With one small difference which
is that we are not going to

35
00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.521
include this class list,
we actually don't need the class at all.

36
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:44.752
We do want a class we're gonna change
it back to a regular class and

37
00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:48.164
give it a class of newsletter-form.

38
00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:51.278
The way that forms work as
a reminder to myself is,

39
00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:54.242
so we set the method and
then we gave it a class but

40
00:02:54.242 --> 00:02:58.346
we didn't tell it where to submit to,
so it's submit to itself.

41
00:02:58.346 --> 00:03:02.390
All right, so we have to give it
an action to tell it where to submit to.

42
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.660
And we built that newsletter
page to handle form submissions.

43
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.605
So we add this action of newsletter, and

44
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.990
that now is going to send
it to the right place.

45
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.326
So let's try that one more time.

46
00:03:18.058 --> 00:03:19.950
Subscribe, there we go.

47
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.520
We're on this.

48
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.790
We're on the newsletter page.

49
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.870
It did a server render,
it handled that post submission.

50
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.940
And it shows us that we did in fact,
subscribe.

51
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.460
Now does this one work
without JavaScript enabled?

52
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.702
Let's find out.

53
00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:42.785
It does, right?

54
00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:46.440
So this, this is, I think,
a good example of like.

55
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.329
Some of the things that we
think are really complicated,

56
00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.272
they're complicated because we're
compensating for things that were

57
00:03:55.272 --> 00:04:00.770
made harder by tools that were made
to compensate for challenges, right?

58
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.462
And so by by taking a step back and
looking at what does the browser do,

59
00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:06.380
what does the platform do?

60
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.309
We can skip some of that really
complicated stuff of capturing the form

61
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.830
submission event and then managing it.

62
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.290
We don't have to do that
on the server side.

63
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.520
We don't have to do that
on the client side.

64
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.860
We can just say, was this form submitted?

65
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.530
Great.

66
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.360
Do some stuff with it.

67
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.510
This is very similar to
what we used to do in PHP.

68
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.831
This is very similar to what you would
have done in any back-end language if you

69
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:31.520
were working in really whatever,
since the dawn of the Web.

70
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.667
If a form gets submitted,
you grab the body out of the post and

71
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.290
do some stuff with it, right?

72
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.990
So very familiar from a server standpoint.

73
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.847
And we didn't have to compensate for
like, the way that frameworks have

74
00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:49.320
changed events or the way that
something makes it all client side.

75
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.153
And now we're trying to figure out how to
do the same things that we would do on

76
00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:53.680
the server on the client side.

77
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.290
It just allows us to really
take the idea through

78
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.280
the platform to production in
a very short span of time.

79
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.515
And, to that end, let me turn
JavaScript back on before I forget,

80
00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:14.020
because otherwise I'm gonna
be really confused later.

81
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:22.731
So, we just built a very complicated
website in the span of features, right?

82
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:27.490
We've got a homepage with Hero components.

83
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.310
We've got previews of different data
that's loaded from third-party API's.

84
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.670
We've got form submissions being handled.

85
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.778
We've got a full on E-commerce store,

86
00:05:37.778 --> 00:05:40.630
including a shopping cart
that's actually running.

87
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.780
You can add things up and go with that.

88
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.294
We've got a blog including
like content collections and

89
00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:49.936
RSS feed individual blog pages with URLs.

90
00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:55.493
We're writing in Markdown where it
makes sense to write in Markdown and

91
00:05:55.493 --> 00:06:00.044
all of that was built in the span
of what half a day, right?

92
00:06:00.044 --> 00:06:05.807
These are the types of frameworks that
when I get the chance to work with them,

93
00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:10.240
I'm so excited because not once
today did I have to think,

94
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.490
how do I get my tool to do
the thing that I wanted to do?

95
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.990
I got to say,
how does the browser do that?

96
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.234
And then I did it, right?

97
00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:18.886
And so I think that to me, I get so

98
00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:22.565
excited because it means that what
I'm spending my mental energy on and

99
00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:26.454
what I'm spending my time on is building
the idea on building the feature.

100
00:06:26.454 --> 00:06:29.138
Building the thing that I
was either hired to build or

101
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.430
that I'm excited to build
as a hobby project.

102
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.880
I don't get to do that very often.

103
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.680
I feel like I spend a lot
of time wrestling tools.

104
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.670
I spend a lot of time trying to figure
out how to get the thing that is in

105
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.540
production, to stop doing
the special things so

106
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.791
it can just do the thing I want it to do.

107
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.106
And I love that Astro
doesn't take that stance.

108
00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:52.510
They very much are like let's get
this framework out of the way.

109
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.007
Use the platform and
let people just ship their ideas,

110
00:06:56.007 --> 00:07:00.580
get stuff out of their heads and
into production in a few hours, right?
