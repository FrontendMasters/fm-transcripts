WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.957
Let's talk a little bit about
what we're gonna build today.

2
00:00:01.957 --> 00:00:05.292
We are going to be building
a full-featured modern web app.

3
00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:09.395
It's gonna have a marketing homepage,
because that's kind of the bedrock of

4
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:12.392
the Internet,
everything has this no matter what it is.

5
00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:16.478
We're gonna build an e-commerce store,
so we're gonna get products from an API,

6
00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:18.387
we're going to build a shopping cart.

7
00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.851
We are going to set up a blog and
add an RSS feed to that blog.

8
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:26.740
And we're going to set up a newsletter
signup form that will work without

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.513
JavaScript.

10
00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:31.563
So we're going to add a little bit of
server side rendering into Astro to show

11
00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:34.171
how that would work if you
want to run it that way.

12
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:37.520
So how we're gonna build it, we're gonna
make sure that the whole site works

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.147
the Javascript disabled with
the exception of the cart, but

14
00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.332
we are gonna add a no script fallback for
the cart.

15
00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:45.055
We're going to do
cross-framework state sharing.

16
00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:49.659
So we're gonna set up both Solid and React
in this app as a means of demonstration,

17
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.418
and then we're gonna have state
that gets shared between the two.

18
00:00:53.418 --> 00:00:56.949
So you'll be able to act like
update state in React and

19
00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.814
access that changed state in Solid in
a way that still respects the partial

20
00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:05.127
hydration or
the Islands architecture of Astro.

21
00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:07.297
We're gonna write Type-Safe Markdown.

22
00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:11.347
The blog is gonna be using Astro's
content collections, which means that we

23
00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:15.347
can provide a schema and validate that
people are using the allowed fields.

24
00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:19.983
If you've ever worked with a markdown
blog, one of the most challenging pieces

25
00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:24.147
of it is that it tends to kinda run
away from you in terms of frontmatter.

26
00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:28.067
Where some of them have categories,
some of them have tags, some of them add

27
00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:32.136
a special field about whether or not
you should show the newsletters opt-in.

28
00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:36.615
And over time, all those fields
become somewhat meaningless.

29
00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:40.449
So what we'll be able to do is
actually add schema validation.

30
00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:44.016
So you can say, these
are the categories you can choose from.

31
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:45.888
It's not a it's not
a freeform fill anymore,

32
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.059
it's gonna actually throw an error if
you're not using an allowed category.

33
00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:51.878
We're gonna fetch data from external API,

34
00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.390
so we're gonna show how
Astro handles data fetching.

35
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.730
We're going to set up some server-rendered
pages, but only when necessary.

36
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.138
So we're gonna use a feature
that I love about Astro,

37
00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:02.752
which is called hybrid rendering.

38
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:06.870
Where instead of having to opt all the way
into server rendering, you identify one or

39
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.643
more pages to be server rendered, and
the rest of them are static by default.

40
00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:14.196
So things that you're gonna need
today it are a GitHub account.

41
00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:17.966
You're gonna need git installed locally,
because we're gonna be cloning and

42
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.343
pushing the repos,
Node version 16 or higher.

43
00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:23.672
I didn't use to call this out,
but I've started.

44
00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.404
If you're on a work computer,
you are gonna need permission to clone and

45
00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:29.190
run repos on your local computer.

46
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.387
That has been a challenge in the past.

47
00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:34.016
Things that I will be using
that you don't need to use, but

48
00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:35.796
this is what's gonna be on the screen.

49
00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:39.450
I'm gonna use VS Code for
both the terminal and for my code editor.

50
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.302
I'm gonna use the GitHub CLI.

51
00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:45.641
I love the GitHub CLI,
it saves me a ton of time.

52
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:48.808
If you haven't used it before,
it's definitely worth checking out.

53
00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:51.168
I'm not gonna go into it today,
I'm just gonna use it.

54
00:02:51.168 --> 00:02:55.541
Again, you don't need it that's why
you'll see me typing the gh command in my

55
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.477
terminal, that's what that is.

56
00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:01.075
We're gonna be using Netlify, that's how
we are going to deploy the site today.

57
00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:03.036
You can deploy to whatever
platform you wish, but

58
00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.524
this is what I'm gonna demonstrate
at the end of the workshop.

59
00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:11.798
And yeah, just as a note for posterity.

60
00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:13.880
You don't need these,
these are just my preferences.

61
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
So assume knowledge,

62
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.470
I'm assuming that everybody here has
some beginner JavaScript capabilities.

63
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.511
You don't need to be a JavaScript pro, but

64
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:23.132
I am not going to explain
the mechanics of JavaScript.

65
00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:25.603
So if you're not familiar
with JavaScript at all,

66
00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:28.024
there might be some parts
that are a little dense.

67
00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.818
Feel free to ask questions,

68
00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:34.241
but yeah, I probably won't be
explaining JavaScript syntax today.

69
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.926
General knowledge of Typescript, we're
not gonna write a lot of TypeScript, but

70
00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.083
I will be using Typescript for
autocomplete, so

71
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:43.259
there will be some points where I'm
including type definition stuff.

72
00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.219
The starter repo comes with all
the required types already in it,

73
00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.602
so we don't have to write TypeScript.

74
00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:51.597
We're just gonna have them there.

75
00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.988
But if you've never seen it before,
it might look a little bit wild.

76
00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:56.879
Again, feel free to ask questions,

77
00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.783
but we're not gonna get into the
nitty-gritty of how types work and stuff.

78
00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:05.602
Basics of JSX and components,
not gonna do an intro to React, or Solid,

79
00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:09.640
or Viewer Svelte,
just gonna start using some components.

80
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.185
So if you've never seen those before,
might be a little bit of a wild ride.

81
00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:18.656
Familiarity with Markdown,
if you've ever written a README,

82
00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.130
you'll know enough about Markdown.

83
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.130
That's all we're really looking at today.

84
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.260
Basic usage of the command line,
we're gonna be running some commands.

85
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.764
So knowing where your terminal is,
how to execute commands in it,

86
00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:30.336
that's gonna be important.

87
00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.946
And a basic understanding of API calls,

88
00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:33.754
we're gonna be running
the Fetch API today.

89
00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:38.659
If you've never used it, it is
a reasonably straightforward API to use.

90
00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.051
You don't need to understand
all the ins and outs of it.

91
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.805
But if you've never seen it before, I'm
gonna go a little bit quick over those.

92
00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:50.940
So a quick demo to start, we're gonna
use a starter repo, but I wanna show how

93
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.558
the start-from-scratch experience works
in Astro, because it's just so good.

94
00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:59.315
So let me get a terminal up, and

95
00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:04.096
I'm gonna collapse this down so
that we can see this.

96
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:10.089
And so the way that you start a new Astro
site is you can run npm create astro.

97
00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:15.074
And what this is gonna do is
shows this little Houston robot,

98
00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:19.884
which is adorable, and
then it asks you for some details.

99
00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.334
So it'll auto generate a name
of a project if you want.

100
00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:26.009
And since we're not actually
working in this project today,

101
00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.474
you can just hit Enter to continue and
then it lets you choose what you want.

102
00:05:30.474 --> 00:05:33.162
So if it's me,
because I've done this a few times,

103
00:05:33.162 --> 00:05:35.003
I'll start with an empty project.

104
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:39.407
If you wanna see how the best practices
work, you can choose this one.

105
00:05:39.407 --> 00:05:42.962
And then it starts just kinda
stepping through everything, so

106
00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:45.452
it's gonna install our NPM dependencies.

107
00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:48.086
And it's going to give us
some words of affirmation.

108
00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:54.879
It's going to just kinda be a little
pleasant experience that I really love.

109
00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.900
And do I wanna initialize the repository?

110
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.629
Sure, I do, and
then it asked about TypeScript.

111
00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.441
So strict is the default, and
then it tells you what to do next.

112
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:10.027
So we can move into this project and
start it,

113
00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:15.907
and it's gonna open up in localhost 3000,

114
00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:19.436
and this is your Astro site.

115
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:25.127
So here, you're running, you have a site
installed and running and ready to go.

116
00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:28.590
This is not super novel in
the framework world anymore.

117
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.916
They've all got pretty good
getting started experiences.

118
00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:36.747
To me, thing that sets Astro apart is the
attention to detail with the little robot

119
00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:41.719
saying fun, cute things and the fact that
they are installing your dependencies and

120
00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.210
setting up TypeScript.

121
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.003
And just making sure that you're set
up in a way that allows you to quickly

122
00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:49.348
get up and running.

123
00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:54.165
So we're not actually gonna run
off of this site because, again,

124
00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:57.014
the starter repo is effectively this.

125
00:06:57.014 --> 00:07:01.899
It just has also some images and
style sheets that we're gonna use so

126
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.252
that we don't have to
write all those by hand.

127
00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:11.101
And as well as the Markdown files so
that you don't have to write the Markdown.

128
00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:15.228
So next up, let's actually get started.

129
00:07:15.228 --> 00:07:20.487
So we're gonna use the start
branch of this repo here.

130
00:07:20.487 --> 00:07:24.556
So I'm gonna run this command,

131
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:29.264
In, may open code actually.

132
00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:40.280
So we're going to move into GitHub, and

133
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.662
we're going to gh clone repo,
and then it's gonna

134
00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:51.435
be learnedwithjson and
astro-frontend-masters.

135
00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:56.491
And then I want the start branch, so
I'm doing the double dash to kind of

136
00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:01.479
escape the GitHub CLI, and then I can
add any git commands that I want.

137
00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:03.729
So -b is a branch.

138
00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.624
So I can say,
I want the start branch of this repo.

139
00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:09.861
So I am, what did I just do?

140
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:11.842
I know what I did wrong.

141
00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:14.958
I did these commands backwards.

142
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.337
So github-repo-clone
is what I meant to do.

143
00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:27.044
And that is going to give us our, Site.

144
00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:31.696
&gt;&gt; Alternatively, you could probably
just clone the repo and then see the or

145
00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:33.506
check out the start branch.

146
00:08:33.506 --> 00:08:39.467
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, so
if you wanted to get into it like that,

147
00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:45.696
you can also go into
astro-frontend-masters here and

148
00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:48.628
you can grab one of these.

149
00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:51.880
So you can use the SSH or the CLI.

150
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.232
And then once you've got it,
just do a git checkout start and

151
00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:57.415
that will move you to the start branch.

152
00:08:57.415 --> 00:09:01.042
Okay, so we're in this repo now,
and we've got everything.

153
00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:05.390
We're gonna install the dependencies, so

154
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.861
npm i to install, and
then we can npm run dev.

155
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:14.086
And that, again,
is gonna start on localhost 3000.

156
00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:19.457
I've stripped out the defaults and
all the things that Astro provides so

157
00:09:19.457 --> 00:09:24.842
that we're not having to remove code,
we're just gonna be writing code

158
00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:36.532
Okay, so to actually get running here,
what we're gonna do is create a new page.

159
00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:41.493
So the way that an astro directory
works is we have this source

160
00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:45.006
folder that's got pages in it by default.

161
00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:47.934
You can put anything you want here,
components, layouts, etc.,

162
00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:49.460
we'll step through those as we go.

163
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:56.002
In the package json, you can see here
that it gives us a handful of commands.

164
00:09:56.002 --> 00:10:00.707
Dev is the one that we're gonna
spend the most time on today, but

165
00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:02.896
later we will be building it.

166
00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:05.834
And I've added a few type packages, but

167
00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:09.904
we'll install everything else
as we go in the starter.

168
00:10:09.904 --> 00:10:13.089
You've got an astro.config,
which right now is just empty.

169
00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.662
This comes with the npm create astro,
we'll use this later.

170
00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:21.883
But I'll show you one of the other
reasons I love Astro is that we

171
00:10:21.883 --> 00:10:25.548
won't have to manually touch
this file almost at all,

172
00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:31.147
because they've got this wonderful flow
of adding integrations that just works.

173
00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:34.519
The other things that are worth noting,
the types here,

174
00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:36.848
those are types that we're gonna use.

175
00:10:36.848 --> 00:10:38.787
Again, we're not really
talking about TypeScript,

176
00:10:38.787 --> 00:10:41.279
it's just to make sure that we've
got autocomplete and everything.

177
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:45.918
Astro as well has some types,
this is supplied by the npm vreate astro.

178
00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:50.727
Public is a place where we can put
anything that we want to be published as

179
00:10:50.727 --> 00:10:52.021
part of the build.

180
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:55.520
So anything that we put in this
folder will be URL addressable.

181
00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:02.128
So in this case, the the favicon will be
addressable at your site.com/favicon.svg.

182
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.351
And anything we wanna put
in here can go in here.

183
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:08.567
If you wanna put PDFs up on your website,
you wanna put images, etc.,

184
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:11.047
you just drop it in here and
it just works.

185
00:11:11.047 --> 00:11:15.062
The source folder is what will actually
be processed as part of the Astro build.

186
00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:22.350
And inside of that,
you can see we've got this, Simple page.

187
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.509
And this is, by default, it's just HTML.

188
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.336
There's nothing special going on here.

189
00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:34.048
The only thing that is different from
plain old HTML is this generator tag,

190
00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.598
which is optional.

191
00:11:35.598 --> 00:11:39.893
It's just there so that we can identify
whether or not a site was built using

192
00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:44.528
Astro, which is helpful for adoption for
somebody who wants to snoop a little bit

193
00:11:44.528 --> 00:11:48.716
on your site and learn what technology
you use and all that kind of stuff.

194
00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:51.045
That's all this is really here for.

195
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:55.247
Otherwise, we're just putting
out a little h1 tag, and

196
00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:58.434
that h1 tag is telling
us what we need to do.
