WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.908
This is, I think, such a powerful way
of building because we went from,

2
00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:07.812
idea and
we skipped over the CSS and stuff.

3
00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:12.596
So if you assume with a design cycle and
getting all that stuff, that front end

4
00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:17.529
review, you're probably looking at maybe
a day or two, but you can really just

5
00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.114
move from idea to production with Astro
as your your framework of choice.

6
00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:28.620
And so I'm very happy with it overall it's
given me a lot of my creative energy back.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.410
So when I was younger, I used to build
a lot of silly sites to make me laugh.

8
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.840
And I would send them to my friends and
they were there to troll people and

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.313
just to kind of be goofy,
right like the goofy web.

10
00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:42.336
And as frameworks got more complex,

11
00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:48.393
building a goofy website got a lot slower
and I lost a lot of my taste for it.

12
00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:52.651
It was harder to just get an idea out
of my brain, and that slowed me down.

13
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.748
And so in the case of me building
a goofy website, not a huge net loss for

14
00:00:56.748 --> 00:01:01.192
the world or for the web, but in the case
of companies that If it's hard for

15
00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:04.900
you to try something,
then you're not gonna get it out there.

16
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.011
You're not going to see how people use it,

17
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:10.245
you're not gonna ship that new
idea because it's too much work.

18
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:14.888
And that really prevents us from trying
things and learning and understanding how

19
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:19.290
our customers use and interact with
the software that we're building.

20
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.596
So something that I think is really
exciting about Astro is that,

21
00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:26.683
by eliminating some of those loops, and
getting us to the point where we just have

22
00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:30.648
an idea, and then it's shipped, we're
back to the point where we can get into

23
00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:33.720
an almost real time conversation
with our customers.

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.610
I have an idea, I'm gonna ship it today,

25
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.122
we'll have data in a week on how people
use it and whether or not they liked it.

26
00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:42.111
And then I can go back to the team and
say, hey, that really worked,

27
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:44.590
we should double down on this
direction of the feature.

28
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.272
Or hey, nobody cared about that,
let's just quietly sunset that and

29
00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:47.912
we'll move on.

30
00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:54.048
Even better if you've got feature flagging
or something built into your workflow.

31
00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.075
And I mean, that's Astro in a nutshell.

32
00:01:56.075 --> 00:02:00.785
This is, I think a very
exciting time to be in web dev

33
00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.840
because Astro is one of
several exciting frameworks.

34
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.970
In addition to Astro, solid is just
kind of out there saying, hey,

35
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.754
what if all the things that we liked
about component-based UI frameworks were

36
00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:15.820
really fast?

37
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.020
Qwik is asking, what if you didn't
have to do hydration at all?

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.784
What if the page was just there and

39
00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:24.350
it started running as soon as
the page was done downloading.

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.492
There's so much exciting innovation
happening in the front end space right now

41
00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:34.650
that I hope that what you take away from
this isn't, you must use Astro or else.

42
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740
That's not at all what
I'm intending to say.

43
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.604
I wanna Astro to become a tool in your
tool belt that allows you to build things

44
00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:44.707
that it's a good match for quickly, to get
feedback quickly, so that you can have

45
00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:48.774
a little bit of fun, so that you can make
those funny sites to troll your friends.

46
00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:52.919
And just keep exploring, I hope it
gives you some energy to go out and

47
00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.645
have a lot of fun on the web and spend,
spend a little less time getting paged,

48
00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.118
a little less time, putting out fires,

49
00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:04.086
and a little more time doing
stuff that's actually enjoyable.

50
00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:08.982
A couple resources here
just to wrap us up,

51
00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:15.378
these are some things that
are useful to keep bookmark.

52
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.977
The Astro docs are very,
very good if you're gonna use nanostores.

53
00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:22.541
Nanostores is wonderful,
again, it's very tiny, and

54
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.083
that means that it can
be a little bit weird.

55
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.391
So having the docs handy is useful.

56
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.920
The issues in nanosstores are actually a
really good source of information as well,

57
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.470
because somebody will say,
I can't do this and

58
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.262
then they'll show you how you do it
because it's not like a .delete.

59
00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:42.235
It's a set key to undefined.

60
00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.346
[LAUGH] It's stuff like that.

61
00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:49.319
Solid docs, React docs the new React Docs,
a good friend of mine, Rachel Nabors put

62
00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.420
a lot of work into those along with
other people, and they're excellent.

63
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.502
Zod is very,
very cool if you haven't tried it.

64
00:03:57.502 --> 00:03:59.414
Netify if you wanna get
into their documentation.

65
00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:04.532
And then I have a bunch of episodes of
Learn with Jason about Astro with the Astro

66
00:04:04.532 --> 00:04:10.047
core team, with others from the ecosystem
showing how they've used Astro to build

67
00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:14.933
cool stuff including, the multiframework
shared state demo from Aryan

68
00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:18.292
Deora that inspired the cart
that we built today.

69
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:21.485
So definitely check that out and
see what you can learn there.

70
00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:23.019
All right, thank you so much.

71
00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:26.957
