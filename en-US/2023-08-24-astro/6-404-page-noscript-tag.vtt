WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:03.632
From here, what we wanna do is,
we've got our styles,

2
00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:06.707
we've got our homepage
set up with a hero image.

3
00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:10.578
And to this point,
we're kinda doing what you would do for

4
00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.956
just about every website, right?

5
00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:17.404
But if we head over to our About page,
after I start the server again.

6
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:21.733
There it is.

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:27.349
Okay, so we've got our homepage is
looking good, it's got that hero image.

8
00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.370
And our About page is looking a little
squished up against the side of

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.960
the screen.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.704
And even if I make this bigger,
it's just not ideal, right?

11
00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:38.318
So what we could do at this point,
is we could go in and

12
00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:41.625
we can make an About page
specific style sheet.

13
00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.091
But we're gonna have a blog later, and

14
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.586
we're gonna have other pages that
are content-heavy like this.

15
00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:48.527
So what we actually wanna
do is update our layout so

16
00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.058
that it can be shared between those pages.

17
00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:54.874
However, if we update the layout
to squish content together,

18
00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:59.703
it's gonna break our hero image, cuz we
want that to run to the edge of the page.

19
00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:04.795
So in this case, what we're gonna do is we
are going to introduce a nested layout.

20
00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:07.681
And this is very straightforward in Astro,

21
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.649
it's something that I
really like about it.

22
00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.183
There's no magic.

23
00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:17.429
Nothing magical is happening at all,
you're just gonna import that layout,

24
00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.985
add some extra stuff, and
then make that the new layout, right?

25
00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:24.933
And so it's really, really pleasant
to work with this workflow,

26
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:29.657
because you don't have to remember that
this specific file name overrides this

27
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.295
other specific file name.

28
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.916
It's just here's the layout file,
I'm gonna use it or not.

29
00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.786
So what we can do in here is
we can grab our defaults,

30
00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:42.572
let's add a new file in
here called page.astro.

31
00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:47.162
And this is gonna be our
content-heavy page setup.

32
00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:51.996
And in this,
we're going to set up our Frontmatter.

33
00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:58.783
Grab that original layout
from layouts/default.astro,

34
00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:01.317
and then we can use it.

35
00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:03.207
So here's our original layout.

36
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:07.570
And then inside, we want to just
add a little bit more information.

37
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.825
So we're gonna set up a section
with a class of block and

38
00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:15.789
page, And then we put our slot inside.

39
00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:21.908
So what this has done is this has allowed
us to say, we want that default layout,

40
00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.401
we want the header,
footer, all the styles.

41
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:25.557
And also on pages,

42
00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:30.184
we want this additional wrapper that will
allow us to keep it off the sides and

43
00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:34.907
give us some breathing room in the top and
bottom, and all those good things.

44
00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:39.851
And then to use it,
we just have to go into about.md and

45
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:43.195
update this one to say page instead.

46
00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.089
So now, if I head over to that page,

47
00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.563
we can see that it's
looking a lot better now.

48
00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:50.848
It's a little less jammed into things.

49
00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.283
Let's do one more thing here before
we start working on the shop,

50
00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:57.350
which is gonna be the most
complex part of our build today.

51
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.926
I want this custom 404 page to be
a little more friendly to our site users.

52
00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:07.251
And this is a great 404 page for
development, because it tells you which

53
00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.455
page isn't working, and it lets you
know that Astro itself is working.

54
00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:13.374
But for a user,
this would be really confusing.

55
00:03:13.374 --> 00:03:17.809
It's not branded for the site,
it doesn't give you anything to do next.

56
00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.511
There's no way to get back, you just
have to go hit your back button in your

57
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:25.785
browser, which may not be something that
somebody instinctively knows what to do.

58
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.168
They honestly might just close the tab and
Google it again or something,

59
00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:32.064
which is a really frustrating
way to interact with a website.

60
00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:39.519
So I would like to add a custom 404 page,
and Astro has made, oops.

61
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.725
Astro has made this pretty
straightforward to do.

62
00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:45.891
We can add a new file, call it 404.astro.

63
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.623
This is gonna be an Astro component.

64
00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:51.224
And in that Astro component,
we're going to grab our layout.

65
00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.944
Pages, no, layouts.

66
00:03:56.944 --> 00:04:01.926
Layouts &gt; page, cuz this is one
of those pages that we need.

67
00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:04.984
And then we're gonna grab that layout.

68
00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:11.995
And inside of it, I'm going to add
a div with a class of not-found.

69
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:16.636
And then we'll set up an h1 and
say page not found.

70
00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:21.478
We'll include the 404 so
that people know what to look for there.

71
00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:25.868
And then the next piece that
I'm gonna grab is actually,

72
00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:29.719
I think I included this
in the markup here, yeah.

73
00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.795
Let's just grab this in fact, because I
don't want anybody to have to manually

74
00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:39.343
type out this,
This unsplash hot link that I used.

75
00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:43.789
So this is an image, and then it has
a little bit more information and

76
00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.277
a link to go back home.

77
00:04:45.277 --> 00:04:47.131
And because it's wrapped with the layout,

78
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:49.294
it's also going to feature the header and
footer.

79
00:04:49.294 --> 00:04:53.032
So if I save this and
then head over to one of these pages,

80
00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:57.090
now we get a little more,
we still need some styles here, but

81
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.298
we're a little closer to
where we want it to be.

82
00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:05.009
So let's add in those styles,
create a style tag at the bottom.

83
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.649
And then up in the workshop assets,

84
00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:13.288
we have a pages-404 with a few things
that we need to make that page work.

85
00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:16.229
Now, we have a nicely styled 404 page.

86
00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.049
It looks good enough, looks on brand,
and gives us the ability to give

87
00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:26.115
someone an indication that the site's
not broken, they just found a page

88
00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:31.282
that doesn't exist, and they've got
a next step, they can go back home.

89
00:05:31.282 --> 00:05:35.139
So that's a nice little piece to have
in your back pocket as you're building

90
00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:35.752
out sites.

91
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.672
And again, it doesn't take a ton
of effort, which is great.

92
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:43.423
You can just reuse that layout that you've
built, and everything works as expected.

93
00:05:43.423 --> 00:05:47.717
So the next thing that I wanna do
is I wanna dive into building out

94
00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.349
an e-commerce store.

95
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.819
So we are going to be building out a shop.

96
00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.856
That shop is going to include products
loaded from a third party API.

97
00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:02.254
It is going to include a shopping cart so
that you can add things to the cart and

98
00:06:02.254 --> 00:06:03.096
remove them.

99
00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.455
And the cart features
are gonna be dynamic.

100
00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:10.639
So we'll be using the partial hydration,
Islands architecture of Astro, and

101
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.518
we're gonna mix up our framework.

102
00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:16.981
So we're gonna build it in both React and
Solid to show how it works, to show how

103
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:21.853
those things can talk to each other across
the partial hydration or between islands,

104
00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:26.072
depending on who's talking about it,
which terminology they'll use.

105
00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:32.229
So let's dive right on in and
creates a page.

106
00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.108
So the page we're gonna create is
going to be called shop.astro.

107
00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:41.404
And inside of it, we're going to,

108
00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:45.711
as is tradition, grab the layout.

109
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:49.671
And this one,
we're gonna use the default layout,

110
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:54.363
because we have some different
styling needs for a shop page.

111
00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:58.067
So we'll wrap everything
in that layout again, and

112
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:02.203
then we're gonna have a div,
give it a class name of shop.

113
00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:05.013
And inside of that,
we're going to set up a headline.

114
00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:08.913
Shop sandwich kits.

115
00:07:08.913 --> 00:07:12.428
And then because we want this to
work without JavaScript enabled,

116
00:07:12.428 --> 00:07:14.195
we're gonna add a noscript tag.

117
00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:18.448
And this is just a note to anybody who has
JavaScript disabled that the shopping cart

118
00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:19.857
is not gonna work, right?

119
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.995
The shopping cart requires JavaScript.

120
00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:26.959
There are ways that we could work around
this, but they were a little more complex

121
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:31.705
than I think we could have covered in
a day just because building a fully server

122
00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:35.868
rendered cart involves some things
that I didn't wanna set up, but

123
00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:39.107
you can find some tutorials
on it if you wanna learn.

124
00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:43.040
These days it's fairly common for
JavaScript to be enabled.

125
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.386
So just sending somebody a note that says,
hey, for this page,

126
00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:52.790
you're gonna need it if you wanna buy
something, I think we're okay, right?

127
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.774
So we're gonna say JavaScript is
required to purchase things from

128
00:07:57.774 --> 00:08:01.515
the sndwch web store, and
we'll give him an out.

129
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:07.167
If you wanna order by phone, call,
and then, why is this not wrapping?

130
00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.145
Wrap you, there it is.

131
00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:15.600
We'll give them a tel to or
tel protocol link, which I love.

132
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.948
And let's see, we've got an actual number.

133
00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:19.553
This is a real number
that actually does work.

134
00:08:19.553 --> 00:08:26.426
I encourage everybody to call it,

135
00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:31.403
and then we'll just +1

136
00:08:31.403 --> 00:08:37.569
248-434-5508.

137
00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:42.717
Okay, and then, now that we've
got a note to somebody who has

138
00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:48.368
JavaScript disabled, we can get
around to setting up our product.

139
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:52.449
So we're gonna create
a div called products.

140
00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:55.342
And inside of that,
we're gonna have two to-do items.

141
00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:57.625
So the first thing is gonna
be the list products.

142
00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:06.595
And the second thing is going
to be to show the cart.

143
00:09:06.595 --> 00:09:09.079
Okay, so save that.

144
00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:14.406
And things are kinda happening here,
but we need a little bit more.

145
00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:17.338
So in this one,
because the shop is unique,

146
00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:20.447
we are just gonna put its
styles right in line.

147
00:09:20.447 --> 00:09:25.596
And those are up in the styles,
we can go to page-shop and

148
00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:31.730
grab them and drop them in here, and
that is our layout for the shop.

149
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.326
So showing this for everybody again,
we've just imported the layout.

150
00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:42.615
We've got a div that contains
our heading and a noscript tag.

151
00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:48.868
So if we do disable JavaScript, I don't
know, sometimes I do this stuff and

152
00:09:48.868 --> 00:09:55.124
I realize that people haven't actually
seen how some of these things work,

153
00:09:55.124 --> 00:10:01.658
so let me disable JavaScript here,
And refresh the page.

154
00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:03.542
And so
if you don't have JavaScript enabled,

155
00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:05.050
it's just gonna show this message.

156
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.840
And the message is nice and
straightforward.

157
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.258
You can order by phone.

158
00:10:08.258 --> 00:10:10.629
If you don't wanna use JavaScript,
order by phone.

159
00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:12.459
Great, that is just fine.

160
00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:18.531
And then in here, we can enable
