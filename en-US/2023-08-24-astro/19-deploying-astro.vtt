00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
So this is the page that shows all
the places you can deploy an Astro site.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.562
And like I said,
you can deploy virtually anywhere.

3
00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:11.972
Because by default,
an Astro site is HTML and CSS and

4
00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:18.800
like client-side JavaScript, any CDN is
a great place to deploy an Astro site.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.676
So if your company has some
kind of like cloud storage and

6
00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:28.148
S3 bucket or you're using Azure or
Google Cloud.

7
00:00:28.148 --> 00:00:32.941
If you've got the ability to do an S
some equivalent of a storage bucket and

8
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:34.734
a CDN, you're good to go.

9
00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.546
You can deploy an Astro site, you don't
need to get special infrastructure,

10
00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:42.418
you don't need to provision new deployment
servers, or new environments, or

11
00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:43.481
anything like that.

12
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.070
You just put it up on your
CDN that already works.

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.947
It's gonna be great.

14
00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:49.313
This is a trick that I used over and
over again when I worked at IBM.

15
00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:55.660
Static sites don't have to go through the
same kinds of rigorous deployment reviews.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.181
So you can just ship something and

17
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.728
not fight with everybody else on your
team about whether or not it's secure.

18
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.796
Because HTML, CSS, they're just secure.

19
00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.966
You can't hack an HTML file,
you can deface it but

20
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.092
like you're not getting
through to the server.

21
00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:12.706
[LAUGH] So you have a lot of
options with Astro built in and

22
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:18.224
once you've built the assets,
you can just deploy them wherever

23
00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:22.956
you want as long as it has support for
that static files.

24
00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:27.919
The most common options I've
seen are tools like Netlify or

25
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:31.598
Vercel, render Cloud flare pages and AWS.

26
00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.066
But you've got a lot of options.

27
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.314
You can use any one of these or
roll your own if you want.

28
00:01:37.314 --> 00:01:39.954
If you are interested in
building one of these,

29
00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.452
if your company is a hosting provider and
you want to run Astro,

30
00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:46.830
the code under the hood for
one of these is not super intense.

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.045
You just have to tell Astro
how does the server work and

32
00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:51.693
this is what it looks like.

33
00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:55.305
So these are all open source you can go
find, I think they're all open source,

34
00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:57.137
you can go find them and check them out.

35
00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:02.056
I'm gonna be using Netlify today you are
welcome to use whatever your favorite is

36
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:07.205
we're going on preferences, not this is
what I enjoy, not like a dogmatic choice.

37
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:08.130
I don't care, you do you.

38
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.705
So the way this actually works is
we've got that Astro CLI again.

39
00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:17.577
And so I'm just gonna run,
let me collapse this down, and

40
00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:20.513
we're gonna open up the command line here.

41
00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:27.973
And I'm going to say
npx astro add netlify.

42
00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:31.822
And it's going to ask me if I
want to install this package.

43
00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:34.099
And I do.

44
00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.931
And then it's going to ask
if I wanna update my config,

45
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.093
gives me a Netlify adapter and I do.

46
00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:46.299
And that's kind of it on the Astro site,
it's ready to go.

47
00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.960
So then I'm going to commit my changes, so

48
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.007
we're gonna git add everything and
we'll git commits and

49
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.121
say, site ready to deploy.

50
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:00.525
I'm gonna push that up.

51
00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:04.616
And so, we're on the workshop branch, so

52
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:09.050
what I'm gonna do is if
you haven't forked it yet

53
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.394
you can actually GitHub repo
fork to get your own copy and

54
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:19.761
it's going to allow you to
create a new fork of the repo.

55
00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:20.650
Would I like to add a remote?

56
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.032
Yes, I do.

57
00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:25.450
So then I'm going to git push origin.

58
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.432
Actually, I'm gonna rename
this to main just for

59
00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:31.992
the sake of not having to like
go specify a specific branch.

60
00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:34.953
So I'm gonna call this branch main and
then I'm gonna git push origin Main.

61
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:44.795
And if I go to that repo now,
so github.com.

62
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:53.808
jlengstorf and
then I've got astro-frontend-masters,

63
00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:57.930
I now have this, this is the repo,

64
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.770
this is what we pushed up and
it's ready to rock.

65
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.360
So from there I can get over
to the Netlify site. So, over to

66
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.371
app.netlify.com I don't know
why collapse that down.

67
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:18.208
And I can add a new site, so I will import
an existing project let's say you get

68
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:23.047
something in from Git and I'm gonna
click GitHub because that's where I sent

69
00:04:23.047 --> 00:04:25.525
everything and I can search for Astro.

70
00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:31.213
I have a lot of repos so
this takes a while.

71
00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:33.720
And here's the one.

72
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.736
Okay, so
it's gonna deploy this main branch.

73
00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.405
It would let me deploy any
of the others if I wanted.

74
00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.884
And it auto detected that
this is an Astro site, so

75
00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:44.908
I don't have to change any settings,
I can just hit deploy.

76
00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:56.429
And now it's gonna do
its deployment thing and

77
00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:03.819
this should take about 30 seconds all and
I think.

78
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.128
And that 30 seconds includes all the setup
and tear down of, of the Netlify servers.

79
00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:14.435
I wanna point out if I
can get it to hold still.

80
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:20.081
This building,
the Astro site itself took 1.08 seconds.

81
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:24.745
Now granted we're not like this is,
with the products and the blog and

82
00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:29.265
everything, we're looking at
maybe like 10, 15 pages tops.

83
00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:34.717
But it's pretty dang cool
that this just works, right?

84
00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:38.900
It didn't require us to do a lot.

85
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.848
It's very, very fast.

86
00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:42.273
This is powered by Vite, under the hood.

87
00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:48.061
So we get a lot of that just screaming
fast performance that Vite is supplying for

88
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:48.700
folks.

89
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.689
And that is all the way done.

90
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.660
So let's see,
how long did this take total?

91
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.022
Remember, this is our first deploy.

92
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:58.878
So 25 seconds with no cache, no nothing.

93
00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:02.006
It's just very fast to deploy Astro sites.

94
00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:07.098
And the slowdown will come in as you start
to add more and more complex queries and

95
00:06:07.098 --> 00:06:11.740
you're parsing more and more data as
part of your deployment pipeline.

96
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.771
So you can make anything slow.

97
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:19.997
But the thing I like is that by default,
these deployments are extremely fast.

98
00:06:19.997 --> 00:06:22.205
And now that we've got that, there we go.

99
00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:23.763
We're live, we're in production.

100
00:06:23.763 --> 00:06:28.523
So this is now up live
at Stupendous Halva And

101
00:06:28.523 --> 00:06:32.133
then this hash.netlify.app.
