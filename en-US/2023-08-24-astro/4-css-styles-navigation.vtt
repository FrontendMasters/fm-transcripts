WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.890
So what we wanna do next is we wanna
add in global styles to our layout.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.740
And these are styles that are gonna
be shared across the entire app.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.401
This is gonna be how we set the colors,
how we set the fonts,

4
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.845
how we set basic shared
typography across the site, and

5
00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:18.793
a few components that
will be used everywhere.

6
00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:23.569
And the way that we do that is we
are going to use the single-file component

7
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:24.889
approach in Astro.

8
00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:27.406
And this as a concept
is not unique to Astro,

9
00:00:27.406 --> 00:00:30.400
it's borrowed from frameworks like Vue,
Svelte,

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.920
probably additional frameworks that
I'm not thinking of right now.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.866
And it allows us to declare the styles
not as part of the template, but

12
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.757
alongside the template.

13
00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:44.094
And then Astro can do optimization and

14
00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:48.985
in-lining of those styles to give us a
little more flexibility in how this works

15
00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:53.086
without having to understand
the intricacies of a CSS processor.

16
00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:57.620
Or if we're using Sass or Tailwind or
something like that, the way that those

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.903
all function is kind of not a part of
the thing that you want to care about.

18
00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:04.329
You just kinda wanna have some
styles show up on your page.

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.248
So the way that they do
that is we're gonna set up

20
00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:11.763
global styles by marking it
with this is:global attribute.

21
00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:15.690
And that tells Astro not to
change the class names so

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.981
that they are in fact global.

23
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:22.109
And the reason that that's important is
that by default, Astro is gonna scope,

24
00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.307
styles to the component that they're in.

25
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:28.440
And this is really, really powerful
because it basically eliminates

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.360
the need for a lot of the complex
CSS setup that we've had in the past

27
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.038
with things like CSS and
JS, with Tailwind.

28
00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:41.246
And now I'm gonna add a big caveat to
all this, which is that I love CSS.

29
00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.290
Writing CSS is one of my
favorite things to do.

30
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.977
It's, l think, the most joyful part
of building for the web to me,

31
00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:50.460
is writing CSS.

32
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.933
So with that being said,
I don't really love abstractions over CSS

33
00:01:54.933 --> 00:02:00.280
because it makes it harder for
me to do that because I love writing CSS.

34
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.512
I know that not everybody does, and I know
that CSS is very frustrating for people.

35
00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:08.404
So I will say, if you want to use
Tailwind, there is a built-in plugin.

36
00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:11.120
You can just add it to Astro and
you're off to the races.

37
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.664
If you wanna bring in your favorite CSS
and JS library, you can do that as well,

38
00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:17.100
there's no restrictions on this stuff.

39
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.542
What I like is that by default,
this stuff is just built so

40
00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:25.133
that you write plain old CSS, and
you get the benefits of scoped styles, and

41
00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:27.935
avoiding the global
namespace collisions and

42
00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:33.590
the challenges that kind of, I think,
give CSS its challenging reputation.

43
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.920
Those just get solved in a way that don't
require you to actually change the way you

44
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.750
write styles.

45
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.375
So inside of this, we've got up here in
the workshop-assets, some style sheets,

46
00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:51.250
and we've got the default-global, and
that's the first one we're gonna grab.

47
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.112
And so I'm going to take the contents
of that and paste them in here.

48
00:02:57.112 --> 00:03:02.010
And then let's see,
do we wanna look at this step by step?

49
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.652
Why not?

50
00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:03.515
Let's do it.

51
00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:08.418
So head out here, and okay, so
now we're starting to get some styles.

52
00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:10.210
Here's some typography.

53
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.400
We can see that that it's not
using the serif font anymore.

54
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.990
It's using the system default,
sans serif font.

55
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.246
We've pulled in our Google font,
this this kind of bubbly, headline font.

56
00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:25.900
But we're not quite there yet,
we still got a ways to go.

57
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.748
So next, what we're gonna do is add
our scope styles that are just for

58
00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:32.870
the layout itself.

59
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.386
And the way that those work
is nearly identical to

60
00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:41.360
the way that the global styles work.

61
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.051
We just don't add that is:global.

62
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.425
So I can add style, and save.

63
00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:52.488
And then if I close this out, okay,
so let's take a look at this.

64
00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:55.890
I'm gonna resize this.

65
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.420
Now let's take a look under the hood
at how this is actually working.

66
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.992
So on something like the header, which
is a unique component of the layout and

67
00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:12.422
doesn't need to be accessed anywhere else,

68
00:04:12.422 --> 00:04:17.682
we get these classes that
are unique to Astro itself.

69
00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:22.891
Where it's saying, you can look at
the style, the actual targeting over here,

70
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:27.269
and it's saying, give me the header
where it's this Astro class.

71
00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:32.078
And this is that scoping, because you'll
see that all of these have the same

72
00:04:32.078 --> 00:04:36.905
Astro class, and we just append that
where on it to give us the scope styles.

73
00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:41.329
And this allows us to kind of, we can
have really generic class names, box,

74
00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:44.107
container, wrapper, whatever we wanna use.

75
00:04:44.107 --> 00:04:47.001
And we don't have to worry if we
use wrapper in two components,

76
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:48.966
about those conflicting with each other,

77
00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:52.094
because they'll be scoped to just
the component they're used in.

78
00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:55.603
Now, on something that's more global,
like a header,

79
00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:58.172
we will see that these don't get scoped.

80
00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:03.807
So it's just saying if it's any heading,
apply the Google font, right?

81
00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:07.541
So this is the global versus the scoping,
and

82
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:13.970
you can make a choice as is necessary for
how you wanna write your code.

83
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.480
There are no hard and fast rules here.

84
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.150
This is just whatever works best for
you and your team.

85
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.024
And again,
if you don't wanna use scope styles,

86
00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:22.830
you wanna write something like Tailwind,
you can do that as well.

87
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.320
This is just a preference of mine, and
we're gonna power on ahead with that.

88
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.101
Next up, what I wanna do is add some
navigation, because right now the only way

89
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.660
to get to that About page is to
go up here and manually type.

90
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.990
And again, you can see we've got
the layout is showing up for us here.

91
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.446
We've got our heading fonts are working,
the typography looks a little bit better,

92
00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:52.392
it looks more, kind of what we intended,
not the sans serif default styles.

93
00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:54.960
But I want those to be linked together.

94
00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.280
So let's get into a little bit
more with the frontmatter.

95
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.158
So in my heading here, or in my default,

96
00:06:04.158 --> 00:06:08.962
we're gonna add frontmatter
to this component.

97
00:06:08.962 --> 00:06:17.023
And I'm gonna set up a new const called
navItems, and that's going to be an array.

98
00:06:17.023 --> 00:06:18.164
Boy!

99
00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:21.718
We're gonna add a few things in here.

100
00:06:21.718 --> 00:06:24.644
I'll get the gut set up and
then explain what I'm doing.

101
00:06:24.644 --> 00:06:27.464
So we've got an array of navItems, and

102
00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:32.602
then each navItem is an object with
two properties, a path and a label.

103
00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:37.720
So I'm going to copy this and
we're gonna put three navItems in.

104
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.148
This one will be blog, and
this one will be about.

105
00:06:44.148 --> 00:06:47.479
Okay, so now that I've saved these,

106
00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:53.215
what I can do next is I can go in and
actually use these in my layout.

107
00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:57.032
And this is where we're gonna start to see
the power of using an Astro component over

108
00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:00.849
just plain old HTML, because it lets us do
some templating and stuff that would have

109
00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.902
traditionally required us to either reach
for something like Handlebars or Mustache.

110
00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:08.361
This is what this is kind
of reminiscent of, or

111
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:12.813
we'd have to move to a JSX
component style rendered thing.

112
00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:16.313
And this is one of those instances where I
think that Astro has found a nice balance.

113
00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:23.498
So in where the nav goes,
I'm going to add a nav component,

114
00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:29.698
and inside of that,
I'm going to navItems.map.

115
00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:33.130
And for each one of those,

116
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.810
we'll get a navItem, and, oops,

117
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:43.430
I'm gonna return a href(item.path).

118
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.144
We've got autocomplete there
because it's in the same file.

119
00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:49.382
And then we can do an item.label.

120
00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:56.406
And it seems to have forgotten that
label exists, but that's okay.

121
00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:59.860
All right, let me make this bigger so
everybody can see.

122
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.371
So one thing to call out is
while we've got this setup here,

123
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:06.533
this looks very familiar
if you've used JSX before,

124
00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:09.977
you may have written something
almost identical to this,

125
00:08:09.977 --> 00:08:14.790
but there's one important call-out,
which is, I didn't have to key this.

126
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.624
I don't have to add a key prop for
keeping track of it or anything,

127
00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:21.720
because Astro is not
setting up a virtual DOM.

128
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.706
And so we don't need that extra overhead
of keeping track of these components

129
00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:28.300
in some way,
Astro is just gonna render them out.

130
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.752
So this is sort of a blend of JSX and
the way React does things, and

131
00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:39.530
something like Handlebars or Mustache,
and the way that they do things.

132
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.910
Once we've saved this,
we've already added the styles.

133
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.900
So we can see that we've got our Shop,
Blog, and About up in the nav here.

134
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.590
And if I click through to the homepage,
we get to the homepage.

135
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.960
About, we get to the about.

136
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.619
And if I try to go to one of these
other pages, we get a 404, and

137
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.300
that's to be expected.

138
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.750
We'll talk a little bit about how to
customize that 404 page here in a moment.

139
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.143
And we'll also be
building out the shop and

140
00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.850
the blog pages throughout
the rest of the workshop.
