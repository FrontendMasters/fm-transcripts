1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.231
So we're talking about security.

2
00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:04.054
We talked about SSH,
we talked about firewalls.

3
00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.071
We talked about the importance of
keeping your software up to date.

4
00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:10.812
We talked a bit about two factor
authentication that doesn't really come

5
00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:12.450
into play as much on the server.

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.774
And we talked about the VPN.

7
00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:18.229
And a VPN is a virtual private network,
which allows you to say like, hey,

8
00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:20.068
I trust all these devices, but

9
00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:24.636
within my network we're gonna throw
all these massive walls and barriers.

10
00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.748
To make sure that nobody
outside can get it and

11
00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:29.815
we make it really really onerous
to try to break into our network.

12
00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.536
That way it cuts out on
kind of the negotiation,

13
00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:36.968
you have to have security where security
is always wants to lock things down.

14
00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:39.640
Where's you as Sin engineer
while access to things.

15
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.100
So it's always a trade-off for
making constantly.

16
00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:49.068
And before getting the firewalls,
we have to understand what a port is.

17
00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:51.092
A port just is a communication and

18
00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.937
point that maps through specific
processor network service.

19
00:00:54.937 --> 00:01:00.213
Ports are amazing because we talked
earlier about the IP addresses and

20
00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:03.711
how there's a finite
number of IP addresses.

21
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:07.624
But even so, without ports,
we'd run out IP addresses much faster.

22
00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:11.901
So a port allows us to have multiple
services on one IP address,

23
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:15.064
even thaosands of services
on one IP address.

24
00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:19.255
Now if you wanna see the well known ports,
and there are some ports that are usually

25
00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:22.071
reserved or well-known,
we can take a look at those.

26
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.158
So we'll say less.

27
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.890
And we're using less
here because it's a lot.

28
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.122
So we wanna go through slowly.

29
00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.243
Any familiar ports in there?

30
00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:43.854
SSH, 22, yeah,
it's usually reserved for SSH.

31
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:48.597
Now, more of my old school people
out there know what FTP is,

32
00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:50.834
Port 21, very familiar.

33
00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:54.091
Telnet, yeah, that's a throwback.

34
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.597
I think it still exists, but I don't know
if it's worth going into in this class.

35
00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:03.419
Let's see, look at that, port 80,
the most popular port in the world.

36
00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:06.841
That's what the Internet runs on,
is port 80 in your browser.

37
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:09.506
Not a lot of people know that.

38
00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:12.622
And I won't go through the whole thing
because it goes and goes and goes and

39
00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.340
goes and goes and goes and goes and goes.

40
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.516
But these are all well-known
ports that other companies or

41
00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:21.029
general practice they tend to use.

42
00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.082
You can still use them but you run into
something called a port collision?

43
00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:28.388
If there's already another port,
that's why we usually use port 3000,

44
00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:29.950
that's not reserved for anything.

45
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.106
We use port 8000 or 8080,
something like that.

46
00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:37.888
But really there's thaosands and thaosands
of ports, if your odds of running to

47
00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:42.337
collision if you pick a high enough
number, you're usually pretty good.

48
00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:48.945
Port 443 HBS, yeah,
that's what the Internet runs on.

49
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:54.413
So, ports are an opening in your computer.

50
00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:56.973
So you can't connect to your
computer without some sort of port.

51
00:02:56.973 --> 00:02:59.677
You connect to an IP address that
doesn't really tell you anything,

52
00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:00.993
you have to give it a port as well.

53
00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:05.665
Ports and open ports are one of
the more I won't say dangerous, but

54
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:07.845
things you have to be aware of.

55
00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:11.417
So let's take a look at our open ports.

56
00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:13.365
We're gonna use a program called nmap.

57
00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:17.449
So sudo apt install nmap and
you can do this on your machine,

58
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.704
you can do this on your server,
it actually doesn't matter.

59
00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:28.767
And then run nmap against
your droplet's IP, and

60
00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:32.154
it'll give you a list of your open ports.

61
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:33.320
All right, let's do it together.

62
00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:43.395
So for this one, I'm actually
gonna do it on my local machine,

63
00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:46.911
I think I have nmap installed, I do.

64
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:47.872
Make that bigger.

65
00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:02.519
So I need my droplets IP and
I have not used this droplet

66
00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.215
enough usually over time I can
memorize it my IP address but

67
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:14.741
it's been a while so let me pull this
one up here and get my IP address

68
00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:26.363
I'm just going to run
Nmap against my server,

69
00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:32.648
and it'll tell me which ports
are open on my droplet.

70
00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:40.463
Let me just clear that out so

71
00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:45.048
it'll be a little easier to read.

72
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:56.701
And there, it's showing the ports that
are open on my server, right now, port 22.

73
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:58.002
What's port 22?

74
00:04:58.002 --> 00:04:58.670
&gt;&gt; SSH.

75
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.147
&gt;&gt; SSH so port 22 is always gonna be open.

76
00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:02.370
Port 80?

77
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.381
What's port 80?

78
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.343
&gt;&gt; HTTP.

79
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:07.095
&gt;&gt; HTTP, yeah,
it's always gonna be open as well.

80
00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:10.273
Port 3000, why is that open?

81
00:05:10.273 --> 00:05:11.599
&gt;&gt; Node.

82
00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.038
&gt;&gt; Node, that's right.

83
00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:16.414
But it shouldn't be open, because
we don't need port 3000 to be open,

84
00:05:16.414 --> 00:05:18.754
because nginx is actually
intercepting all those.

85
00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:23.404
So we only want requests to port 22 for
SSH, port 80.

86
00:05:23.404 --> 00:05:26.749
So what we need to do is close port 3000,
which opened by default,

87
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.577
because our node server opened it up.

88
00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:34.207
So let's talk about how to do that.
