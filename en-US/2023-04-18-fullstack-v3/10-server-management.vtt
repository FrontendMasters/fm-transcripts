1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.104
All right, so you did it.

2
00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:02.927
You wrote a server.

3
00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:04.021
All right, let's go.

4
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.272
No, no, no, no.

5
00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:09.320
So we touched on this earlier,
but why can't we just run this?

6
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.132
Why can't I just build an application
based off my local host running a server?

7
00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:18.619
Well, one we talked
about that availability.

8
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.730
That it's just not gonna run forever.

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.603
The OS needs an update here,
I need to close my laptop,

10
00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:25.107
I wanna use something else.

11
00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:28.407
I wanna use the memory for
playing a game or something like that.

12
00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:32.073
So maybe our laptops probably
aren't the best server.

13
00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:36.160
Another consideration is,
how are you all gonna work on this?

14
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.952
This is great for
me as a single developer, but

15
00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:41.034
how are you gonna run this server?

16
00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.902
I guess you can copy it and then we
can both iterate on it same time, but

17
00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:48.909
that's gonna get messy and
then we can't use the development server,

18
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.010
it's probably not gonna work well.

19
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.953
And then how do we scale this?

20
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.212
Buy more laptops?

21
00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:59.133
I mean, sure, if you're rich, but that
doesn't seem like a good solution either.

22
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:03.264
Servers as we said, the core tenet
is they have to be 100% available.

23
00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:07.497
If your web page is down, your application
is down, that's costing you money,

24
00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:08.882
it's costing you users.

25
00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:13.106
It's defeating the purpose of
writing the application itself.

26
00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.188
So we talked about servers.

27
00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:15.476
It's always more than one.

28
00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:17.415
That you never had just had one server.

29
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:21.929
You have redundancies built in,
you have things for accounting, for

30
00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.001
fail overs, for
power outages, for updates.

31
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.001
Half your servers' down for update,

32
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.133
the other half stay up to respond to
requests, that's known as red and green.

33
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.778
There's different strategies for
updating your servers, things like that.

34
00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:39.246
But, it's a whole big world of server
management and developer operations.

35
00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:43.312
This whole world that's probably hidden
from most of us as frontend engineers,

36
00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:46.743
where we never thought, yeah,
what is powering all these things?

37
00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:49.000
What are the rules that govern this?

38
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.803
So, it used to be in the old days, and
by old days, I mean, like ten years ago.

39
00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:59.661
You can just get away with running
a server firm in your company's basement.

40
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.689
And a lot of companies still do.

41
00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.731
A lot of like Goldman Sachs, the financial
companies, they have server firms that

42
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.557
look like this, usually in the bottom
part of their building or in a fireplace,

43
00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:14.467
a very fire [LAUGH] resistant place
because servers run very hot.

44
00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.550
And that's fine.

45
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.880
Generally when we think of as developers,

46
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.362
you're probably not running a server rack
in your kitchen or in your living room.

47
00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:26.955
Some people do, some people run things
like open NAS or something like that for

48
00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:29.545
serving, or Plex for serving their media.

49
00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:30.785
You can do that as well.

50
00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.104
But, when we're talking web applications,

51
00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:36.142
you're not gonna run a server
from your corner of your room.

52
00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:40.390
Cuz, get some plugs, everything goes down,
people are mad at you.

53
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.144
But a lot of companies you'll
see have something like this.

54
00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:50.371
What we use today is actually what we'll
call, it's called cloud computing.

55
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.811
So this idea that there's
a giant data center somewhere,

56
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.711
a giant server firm somewhere.

57
00:02:55.711 --> 00:03:00.322
And I could just buy time on those
servers, I can buy resources.

58
00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:04.227
And this is one of the bigger innovations
when it comes to web development.

59
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:07.710
Because, say 20 years ago,
this wasn't a thing.

60
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.085
Everybody was running their own server.

61
00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.288
Everybody needed their own IT person.

62
00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:14.102
They needed their own sysadmins.

63
00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:16.511
It was a pain in the butt to do this.

64
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.060
Now, we can firm all that
work out to companies and

65
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.171
people that know what they're
doing a lot better than we do.

66
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:25.673
Companies like AWS, or
DigitalOcean, or Rackspace, or

67
00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.748
a lot of cloud hosting providers.

68
00:03:27.748 --> 00:03:29.365
And that's all cloud computing is.

69
00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:33.734
It's just the idea that there's this
massive pile of servers somewhere and

70
00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:38.112
we can borrow some time from them or
we can install our applications on that.

71
00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:43.018
Nothing fancy, nothing special about it,
but people like to use cloud

72
00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:48.190
computing as a buzz term when that's
all it is, just renting server time.

73
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.750
The secret that makes cloud
computing work these days,

74
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.103
is this concept of virtualization.

75
00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:57.841
That's dividing the resources
into a virtual computer.

76
00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:01.716
So instead of, well,
say a 32 core intel processor,

77
00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:05.350
where in the old days I had
to rent that entire thing.

78
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.887
Whether or

79
00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:09.418
not I needed it or I just wanted to
run a very, very simple note server.

80
00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.025
I had to rent the entire thing.

81
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:15.098
Now, I can buy just one
core of that computer.

82
00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:20.446
So now that 32 processor computer,
is 32 different virtual computers.

83
00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:25.693
This is a really powerful concept and
it's actually very difficult.

84
00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.868
Because computers originally
were not built for this,

85
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.373
they're built to do multi-processing,
multi-threading.

86
00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:34.462
And this concept of taking one thread
to one core was totally foreign.

87
00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:37.240
So the early days of cloud
computing were very bumpy,

88
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.907
there are a lot of issues
that have been solved now.

89
00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:42.552
Some of that we talked
about earlier which,

90
00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:46.635
there are special processors that
excel at doing virtualization.

91
00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:50.385
They excel at doing this one thread,
one core type idea.

92
00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:53.086
There's the concept of virtual machines,

93
00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:56.378
which is literally an entire
computer virtualized.

94
00:04:56.378 --> 00:05:00.959
So that means the memory, the hardware,
the GPU, all of the parts of your computer

95
00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:04.047
that make it run,
we can pick a virtual version of that.

96
00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:06.148
So it's literally a clone
of your computer.

97
00:05:06.148 --> 00:05:09.796
We don't tend to do that as much these
days because virtual machines are very

98
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:13.843
expensive as you can imagine, me cloning
my laptop and then putting another version

99
00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:16.701
of it back onto the hard drive,
takes up a lot of resources.

100
00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:20.696
So it's less than ideal, but sometimes you
need an exact copy of what's going on.

101
00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:27.394
But we'd really, what we're gonna do
next is we're gonna buy our own server.

102
00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:30.142
That's called a VPS,
a virtual private server.

103
00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:31.235
Why is it virtual?

104
00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:32.977
Because it's not real,
it's totally made up.

105
00:05:32.977 --> 00:05:37.872
We can buy four cores,
we can buy one core, it's all virtual.

106
00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:41.984
But this is the secret to kind
of how all modern applications,

107
00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:47.380
whether it's Netflix, or Facebook, or
any applications, they all use VPSs.

108
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.413
Facebook use their own hardware,
really different case.

109
00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:55.225
But all modern web applications use some
sort of VPS, a virtual private server.

110
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:02.077
So we'll take a pause here
because we're about to go deep.

111
00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:06.013
We're about to go deep, deep,
deep in SSH and hashing.

112
00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:09.430
It's a lot of fun, but this is where
it starts to come all together.

113
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.164
So, so far we've learned terminals,
command line, how to edit a file,

114
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.308
what a server does and
how to create one, in a couple of lines.

115
00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:18.032
Next, we're just gonna buy one.

116
00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:19.205
Why create one locally?

117
00:06:19.205 --> 00:06:20.397
We're just gonna buy a server.

118
00:06:20.397 --> 00:06:21.872
We're gonna pick the operating system.

119
00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:23.942
We're gonna figure out why we're
picking that operating system.

120
00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:28.033
We're gonna talk about how to log in,
how to authenticate ourselves.

121
00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:32.594
Which is its own fun topic,
I'm really excited for that one.

122
00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:35.951
And then you'll have your own server
running in a cloud somewhere in the world.

123
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:39.364
This little tiny chunk of real estate
that you can do whatever you want with.

124
00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:40.199
And from there,

125
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.085
we're really gonna start going to places
you probably have not seen before.

126
00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:44.979
So I'm really excited.
