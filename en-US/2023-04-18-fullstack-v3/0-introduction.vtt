00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:04.452
Hello, everyone, welcome to Full Stack for
Frontend Engineers 3.

2
00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:06.374
Version 3 of this course,

3
00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:10.646
it promised to be a lot more
exciting than versions 1 and 2.

4
00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:14.591
Those were not as good as this
course is going to be, all right?

5
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:17.129
First off, I want to say thank you all for
coming today.

6
00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.412
I know life can be
a little hectic sometimes.

7
00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:26.938
So, it's really great that you all
made the time to join us today.

8
00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:30.745
My name is Jem Young, I'm a software
engineering manager at Netflix.

9
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.785
I've been at Netflix for
about seven years now.

10
00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.970
A lot of that time was spent as a UI
engineer working on netflix.com.

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.224
And then the lure of platform
work pulled me in, so

12
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.024
I worked on platform for
a number of times.

13
00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.609
And then I did a little bit more UI.

14
00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.142
And now I manage the platform.

15
00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:52.290
So I manage the team that runs
the platform for netflix.com.

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.500
We use a pretty standard stack,
Node and React and

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.181
all the other fun stuff you've heard of.

18
00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:01.360
And I have to say about two
years in the management now,

19
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.862
it is very different
than I thought it was.

20
00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:08.330
In the best of ways, and maybe later on we
can talk a little bit more about that and

21
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.948
how it plays into my thinking of
what full stack engineering is.

22
00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:17.908
I'm also the father of two boys, they
are six months and three years old and

23
00:01:17.908 --> 00:01:23.024
they are a delight, if not the extra
gray in my beard these days.

24
00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:27.424
I'm also the co-host of
the podcast Front End Happy Hour,

25
00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:32.185
it's a podcast that's been going on for
about seven years now.

26
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.246
Man, we doing it seven years.

27
00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:38.714
Mm-hm, we still make no money
on this podcast, all free.

28
00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:43.095
But this podcast is kind of a casual
conversation where just a bunch of people

29
00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:46.996
who work in front end across a bunch
of companies in Silicon Valley,

30
00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:50.501
just have a couple of drinks and
talk about frontend topics.

31
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.409
It's pretty, pretty relaxed time.

32
00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.523
I have a few other courses
on Frontend Masters.

33
00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:59.336
One of them is the Introduction
to Web Assembly,

34
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:01.471
that's more of an advanced course.

35
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:05.939
We dive into hexadecimal and kind of the
nature of programming itself and then we

36
00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.550
pull ourselves back up all the way through
rights and web assembly in the browser.

37
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.264
That's pretty tactical but
also a good time.

38
00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:17.221
Also have a course, Interviewing for
Front-End Engineers on Frontend Masters.

39
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.700
That one's a lot of fun.

40
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.787
That's where we cover a bit of everything
from how to craft your resume,

41
00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:24.529
to the right questions to ask,

42
00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.226
to how to think about think from
an interviewer's perspective.

43
00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:32.349
So if you have a job coming up soon, or
you just wanna be a little bit better at

44
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.021
interviewing as we probably all wanna do,
check out this course.

45
00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:42.133
So for the introduction, I want to cover
some of the prerequisites for the course.

46
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.726
I want to talk about what
modern computing is, and

47
00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:47.711
then I want to talk about what
full stack engineering is.

48
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:50.476
It's not a very clear definition and
if you try to look it up,

49
00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:52.660
you will get a hundred
different definitions.

50
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.220
So, let's dive into what that means.

51
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.020
So some prerequisites for this course,

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.951
I would consider this a beginner course,
of bits, all right?

53
00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.515
You should have some familiarity
with coding, all right?

54
00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.216
Some of the concepts we're going to cover,

55
00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:13.871
not super deep in terms of
the technical on the coding side.

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.483
But if you've never written
a line of code before,

57
00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:19.779
it will probably look like gibberish or
spaghetti, all right?

58
00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.794
You need access to a terminal, all right?

59
00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:23.396
Ideally on an OS X machine.

60
00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:26.745
I know Windows can also
emulate Linux environment, but

61
00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.746
there's a lot of caveats there.

62
00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:32.967
And we just, I only have two hands, I
can't do both computers at the same time.

63
00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:36.280
You're going to need Internet access,
which if you're watching me now,

64
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920
you probably have Internet access.

65
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.277
You'll need a credit card, and
that's if you want to buy a domain.

66
00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:46.270
You don't have to buy a domain, but
that's part of the fun of this course,

67
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.010
is hooking it all up, and
you have your own domain name.

68
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.464
But lastly, you need a sense of adventure.

69
00:03:53.464 --> 00:03:57.457
We're going to go into places
that you may have heard of.

70
00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:59.150
You may even know something about them.

71
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.879
But we're going to cover the entire stack,

72
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.820
all the way from the terminal to building
a webpage hooked up to your own server,

73
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.052
and we're going to do it all by hand,
for the most part, all right?

74
00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:14.486
Your brain is going to hurt by
the end of the day, that's okay.

75
00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:18.793
We're covering a lot of material,
a lot of different topics.

76
00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:22.329
So buckle up and
bring your sense of adventure.

77
00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.008
Let's talk about modern computing.

78
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:27.340
What is modern computing mean?

79
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.568
Well, I like to break it down
to the three primary parts.

80
00:04:30.568 --> 00:04:33.696
There's the UI,
that's one of the bigger parts.

81
00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:36.131
That's the part you're all familiar with.

82
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:41.008
You can't use a computer without some
sort of UI or terminal interface.

83
00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:45.527
There's a server, the server is
the thing that's sending you the data.

84
00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:49.913
Pretty straightforward there, but even
that definition is kind of murky these

85
00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:53.063
days with serverless and
all the other topics out there.

86
00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:54.856
And then there's a database.

87
00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:58.640
Probably the thing people always forget
exists, but you have to have a database.

88
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.527
Otherwise, the UI and server don't
really do that much on their own.

89
00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:06.964
And that's what I like to think of as
kind of the modern computing stack.

90
00:05:06.964 --> 00:05:10.643
When it comes to user interfaces,
they're everywhere.

91
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.939
We have browsers,
we have our mobile devices.

92
00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.027
There's even some in cars, unfortunately.

93
00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:19.871
Find me later and I will go on a good
rant about touchscreens in cars and

94
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.279
why they're a bad idea.

95
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.730
Your desktop computers
like we're using now,

96
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.743
TVs have a user interface,
even your appliances and smart fridges.

97
00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:33.104
Later, I will go on a rant
about smart appliances too, so

98
00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:37.394
you can see where this course is gonna go,
a lot of my rants about things.

99
00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:39.835
But user interfaces are everywhere, and

100
00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:44.239
a lot of times we don't really think
of the thought that goes into all them.

101
00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:48.481
We think a lot as front engineers,
we think about maybe the browser or

102
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.807
even a mobile phone.

103
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:53.542
But really UI is every
single place you see.

104
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.013
When it comes to servers,
most of us know servers as for APIs,

105
00:06:00.013 --> 00:06:04.637
application programming interfaces,
but servers also do logging.

106
00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:07.875
Logging is critical to any website or
application.

107
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.563
You absolutely have to have it.

108
00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:13.969
Of course, almost any website today
have some sort of authentication.

109
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:15.471
You can only do that on the server.

110
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:20.570
Of course, another thing about servers is,
we forget is, it's a development platform.

111
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.334
How else do we build our applications?

112
00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:27.427
We need some sort of server,
whether it's a local dev server or

113
00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:30.839
a remote one on something like AWS or
DigitalOcean.

114
00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:36.215
Then we have our databases, the database
is just structured data storage.

115
00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:38.269
It can be loosely unstructured, but

116
00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:41.196
it's not just a pile of
things you dump things into.

117
00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:44.679
There is an order to it,
and database are useful for

118
00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:49.464
things like data analytics,
getting insights into how things work.

119
00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:55.496
All, any sort of modern AI or business
intelligence uses some sort of database.

120
00:06:55.496 --> 00:06:58.159
But that's probably one
as front engineers,

121
00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.351
we don't really talk about too much.

122
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.849
But we'll dive into that today as well.

123
00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:06.766
So when I think about these
three parts of modern computing.

124
00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:09.821
You have the UI, the server, the database.

125
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:11.784
We generally call the UI frontend, and

126
00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:15.304
then we call everything else that's
not the frontend, the backend.

127
00:07:15.304 --> 00:07:19.348
It's funny with backend engineers,
they don't really argue about this.

128
00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:20.627
You say, I'm a backend engineer.

129
00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.194
They're not like, well,
I actually do this.

130
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:24.507
They're like, yeah, okay.

131
00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:29.245
But frontend engineers,
we get really particular about the titles.

132
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:30.566
What's the common one?

133
00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:31.862
You build websites?

134
00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:36.477
And we're like, no, I craft artisanal
JavaScripts that's running at the highest

135
00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:40.380
performing, and it's 60 frames per second,
and it's beautiful.

136
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.525
Or someone's like, I do accessibility.

137
00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.253
I make sure my website's
accessible to everybody,

138
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:48.481
no matter any sort of visual
impairments or things like that.

139
00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:50.892
Or, hey, I do UX.

140
00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:55.712
I talk to the users and I make sure that
what we're building here makes sense.

141
00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:57.014
Do we need to change that button color?

142
00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.537
Will that get us more sign ups?

143
00:07:58.537 --> 00:08:01.058
Is our font the right size?

144
00:08:01.058 --> 00:08:04.660
The backend is just, you do backend.

145
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.034
You do databases.

146
00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:10.861
Today, we're gonna dive in more and
find out what does the backend look like.

147
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:13.613
&gt;&gt; I just have a personal question.

148
00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:18.673
What do you think about the whole
trend of, I think it was the state

149
00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:23.457
of JavaScript survey,
I don't know which survey it was, but

150
00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:28.241
it was essentially half the people
who used to call themselves

151
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:33.726
frontend engineers,
now call themselves full stack engineers?

152
00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:37.905
&gt;&gt; Man, it's early in the class
to be getting such spicy topics.

153
00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:44.522
My respectful opinion is I don't think
most people are full stack engineers.

154
00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:47.637
I don't think they understand the details.

155
00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:52.211
What I've seen is people call themselves
full stack engineers because they can

156
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:55.896
put together some sort of backend,
some sort of frontends, but

157
00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:58.436
it's always using someone else's tools.

158
00:08:58.436 --> 00:09:01.667
It's always using some sort of
service in place, which is fine,

159
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.037
there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

160
00:09:04.037 --> 00:09:08.368
However, in this course,
we're diving into the actual nuances.

161
00:09:08.368 --> 00:09:11.651
We're not using tools,
we're using as plain software as we can,

162
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.128
because it's important we understand
how it all connects together.

163
00:09:15.128 --> 00:09:17.918
When we're done, yeah,
you can use all the tools you want.

164
00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:23.083
You can use Firebase or Vercel or Netlify,
all these other fantastic products that

165
00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:28.264
kind of make your life easier, but I don't
consider that full stack engineering.

166
00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:34.835
If you can't tweak an IP config table,
you can't adjust a firewall.

167
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:38.507
If you can't pick an operating system,
the right one to use for

168
00:09:38.507 --> 00:09:41.220
your company maybe not
a full stack engineer.

169
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.568
And that's not a slight on anybody,

170
00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:47.980
it's just a reflection of today's
modern computing environment.

171
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.138
Good question and bring the questions.

172
00:09:51.138 --> 00:09:55.354
Yeah, it helps me get my rants out,
because if you asked me a question,

173
00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:56.918
I can go on a rant about it.

174
00:09:56.918 --> 00:09:58.559
If I just go on a rant, it looks bad.

175
00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:02.374
But, if you give me a question, then it's
okay cuz I'm answering your question.

176
00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:11.508
And to that point mark, this is what I've
seen a lot in kind of today's world.

177
00:10:11.508 --> 00:10:15.991
I have someone, hey, build me a React
component or build me a page in React.

178
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:19.105
No problem, million tutorials out there.

179
00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:20.856
Really, I wouldn't say easy.

180
00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:24.159
I try not to say things are easy
cuz we all came from a place

181
00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.917
where things weren't easy,

182
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:30.723
but generally, most of you are not gonna
be confused by code, if I gave you this.

183
00:10:30.723 --> 00:10:34.110
Now, if I say, hey,
you write JavaScript, right?

184
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.883
And say yeah, I'm like okay,
can you build me a server in Node?

185
00:10:37.883 --> 00:10:40.043
Just real quick, a couple lines.

186
00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:42.362
Most people probably couldn't do that, or

187
00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:46.069
understand what's even going on
because they never really see that.

188
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:50.976
It's all obfuscated by tooling and library
these days, and of course, if I say,

189
00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:53.052
hey, can you write me a SQL query.

190
00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:57.048
All right, yoh,
[LAUGH] people's faces are like, what?

191
00:10:57.048 --> 00:10:58.960
What's a SQL query?

192
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.741
When I was making the slides, my partner
walked in, and she's, what are you doing?

193
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.325
I was, I'm adding a few slides, so

194
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:11.592
I can explain relational databases
to these frontend engineers.

195
00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:14.735
And she's, they don't know
what relational databases is?

196
00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:15.700
How do you not know that?

197
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.590
But again, she a data scientist, so
this is all she does is SQL queries.

198
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.348
We're gonna cover all of this stuff.

199
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:26.711
By the end, you will know what every
single piece of this code means,

200
00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:28.905
which I'm pretty excited about.

201
00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:36.484
And I joke a lot about,
front engineers and full stack, but

202
00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:38.466
really frontend is huge.

203
00:11:38.466 --> 00:11:42.271
We talked about this earlier,
UI is everywhere.

204
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:46.474
So we tend to think that's what software
engineering is, it's UI, it's frontend.

205
00:11:46.474 --> 00:11:49.146
But the everything else is massive.

206
00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:54.187
It's a massive amount of knowledge,
a lot of history, a lot of communication,

207
00:11:54.187 --> 00:11:58.341
a lot of technology that goes into
allowing us to build frontends,

208
00:11:58.341 --> 00:11:59.915
allowing us to build UI.

209
00:11:59.915 --> 00:12:02.947
And today,
we're gonna cover the everything else.

210
00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:07.371
There are many courses on Frontend Masters
that are fantastic that cover frontend and

211
00:12:07.371 --> 00:12:11.426
it will teach you how to build every sort
of website in every sort of language you

212
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:12.295
could imagine.

213
00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:16.680
But the everything else part,
that's a tricky part.

214
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.023
By taking this course,

215
00:12:18.023 --> 00:12:22.666
you have a competitive advantage against
people who haven't taken this course.

216
00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:25.617
And I'm not patting myself on the back or
anything like that.

217
00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:28.079
Just there's nothing wrong with knowledge,

218
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:32.305
even if you never use this these things
again, you will see them and you'll be,

219
00:12:32.305 --> 00:12:35.209
okay, I understand that
versus something comes up and

220
00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:39.657
your like [SOUND] I'm gonna stay away from
that cuz I don't really understand that.

221
00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:42.662
I want you to understand,
I want you to know and

222
00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:46.065
not just believe how all
these things tie together.

223
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.875
And it's a complex relationship.

224
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:53.626
There's a lot of rules we have to follow.

225
00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:58.691
There's a lot of, say regulations as
well in terms of what we can and can't.

226
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:03.676
But when we follow the rules, we can make
these completely disjointed systems.

227
00:13:03.676 --> 00:13:07.669
So you have a browser,
could be Chrome, Firefox, Edge,

228
00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:10.367
it doesn't really matter, or any UI.

229
00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:13.834
We can make that talk to any sort
of server running on any sort of

230
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.835
operating system,
talking to any sort of database,

231
00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:19.723
which is staggering
the combinations we can make.

232
00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:24.096
But that's what this course is all about,
is if you follow these rules,

233
00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:27.191
you can exist and
write any sort of system you want.

234
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:28.043
That's what I want.

235
00:13:28.043 --> 00:13:30.285
I want to give you that confidence,
that you can go out and

236
00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:31.567
build any sort of application.

237
00:13:34.357 --> 00:13:38.001
So in this course, we're going to cover
a deep dive into servers and networking.

238
00:13:38.001 --> 00:13:40.332
We're gonna have a good
overview of databases.

239
00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:44.359
Again, something we probably don't
look into it as much as we should.

240
00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:48.389
We're gonna understand how the Internet
works, my favorite question.

241
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:52.141
And we're gonna understand
the relationships between all of these

242
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:52.741
systems.

243
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:55.084
We're gonna be doing some coding.

244
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.149
We're gonna be doing some listening.

245
00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:58.608
We're going to be doing some mistakes.

246
00:13:58.608 --> 00:14:01.358
You will make a mistake, that's okay.

247
00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:05.531
I do my best to try of anticipate, the
kinda mistakes you're going to make, and

248
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.795
kinda lean you back on the right course,.

249
00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:11.816
But if you get stuck, don't forget
to ask a question in the chat or

250
00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:13.146
really ask anybody.

251
00:14:13.146 --> 00:14:16.567
I think, we're all moving
incrementally through this.

252
00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:21.059
And speaking of incremental, I will have
to say, the early part of this course,

253
00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:25.370
you may have seen some of these things,
may have seen some of these concepts.

254
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.855
But as we go deeper and deeper and

255
00:14:26.855 --> 00:14:30.546
deeper, it's really hard to come back
if you haven't followed all the steps.

256
00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:34.376
You can go way off the trail,
and then I can't help you.

257
00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:35.867
You can lock yourself out of your server,

258
00:14:35.867 --> 00:14:37.620
and there's nothing
anybody can do about that.

259
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.628
That probably won't happen, but
it usually happens to a few people.

260
00:14:42.628 --> 00:14:44.776
But that's okay, that's okay.

261
00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:47.361
The first step to being good at
something is making mistakes, and

262
00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:48.914
you can't be afraid to make mistakes.

263
00:14:48.914 --> 00:14:50.896
So we're going to do this
on is very low stakes.

264
00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:56.197
There's no million dollar systems

265
00:14:56.197 --> 00:15:00.265
on the line here, not yet.
