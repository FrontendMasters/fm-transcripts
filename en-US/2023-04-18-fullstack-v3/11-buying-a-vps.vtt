WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.837
Now it is time to buy a VPS.

2
00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:07.499
VPS, as we said before,
was the virtual private server.

3
00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.297
Again, your own piece of
internet real estate,

4
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:12.422
the place we can do wherever we want.

5
00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:18.151
I like the concept of the VPS because it's
a wide open field, it's a blank canvas.

6
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.266
We can make it to be whatever we want, but
essentially we're just buying a server.

7
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.923
So by server,
we're going to open our browsers and

8
00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:30.946
we're gonna go to digital ocean.com.

9
00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.363
If you use that link,
you get some credits.

10
00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:34.830
I get some credits.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.479
We're all happy.

12
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.017
That's the lesson learned from previous
courses where I did not do that I lost

13
00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:40.996
a lot of credits, but

14
00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:44.443
click on that link instead of going
directly to Digital Ocean and I will do.

15
00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:49.283
Do you get free credits to run your server
which is great so won't cost you any money

16
00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:53.652
in the short term and generally these
servers run about $5 a month or so.

17
00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:58.618
So, don't worry about the costs running
out but make sure you shut down your

18
00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:02.746
servers afterward because that'll
get you to I paid that one.

19
00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:05.350
So I'm gonna navigate to digitalocean.com.

20
00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:10.640
And I already have a login so
I'm just going to log in.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.906
So generally we're gonna
create a new project.

22
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.712
You can call it whatever you want.

23
00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:20.122
And the purpose doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:23.554
But we'll say class project educational.

25
00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:28.427
Purposes, that we will get a pretty broad
a lot of help make the UI a little bit

26
00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:31.031
simpler, and description if you want.

27
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:36.236
I created one called Full Stack For
Frontend 3, and for

28
00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:41.463
class educational purposes
I'll move really slowly.

29
00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:46.578
The reason why we're using Digital Ocean
and not something like AWS.

30
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.200
AWS is much more complex,

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.770
it has a probably a broader suite of
offered services that you can do but for

32
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.550
the purpose of this class we
don't need any of those things.

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.250
We don't need to set up route 53 or
a bunch of easy-to-use things like that.

34
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.171
And guess what?

35
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.983
Is there a course on AWS
on frontend masters?

36
00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:08.824
You bet there is.

37
00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.015
There is a course on AWS.

38
00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:14.956
So if you really wanna get good,
there's an entire course talking about

39
00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:19.330
the tools and the procedures you
use to set up AWS environments.

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.974
So if you want to dig in there.

41
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.893
I like Digital Ocean,
they have really great tutorials.

42
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:27.266
A lot of what we're gonna cover today,
you could probably look up and

43
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.431
see some of the tutorials
on Digital Ocean.

44
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.159
The UI is very friendly.

45
00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.446
You're probably not gonna shoot yourself
in the foot, which is possible pretty

46
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:37.171
easily when you're creating a server or
even modifying a server.

47
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:39.282
Digital Ocean does
a pretty good job on that.

48
00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:41.553
And now I'm not sponsored
by Digital Ocean.

49
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:47.161
I just like their UI for
a creating service.

50
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.241
So we need to create a server
we're on Digital Ocean.

51
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:57.544
So it's gonna create, and Digital Ocean
calls them droplets Digital Ocean droplet.

52
00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.449
Yeah, you see where it's going?

53
00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.201
AWS calls them easy to.

54
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:05.225
Yeah, not as interesting.

55
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.443
[LAUGH] That's AWS or Digital Ocean.

56
00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:10.097
But let's create a droplet.

57
00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:12.714
So let's click the droplet.

58
00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:15.559
So next let's pick our region.

59
00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.336
So why does the region matter?

60
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:24.274
That we pick.

61
00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:25.109
Why would it matter?

62
00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:25.718
Yes.

63
00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:28.696
&gt;&gt; It helps determine where you're
gonna serve the website from.

64
00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:30.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

65
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.101
We wanna know where we're serving from,
so we're developing on that,

66
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.564
but we also wanna know where
our visitors are coming from.

67
00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:39.374
So we always want the closest region to,
where we think our visitors are gonna be,

68
00:03:39.374 --> 00:03:43.533
not necessarily where we're developing
from, unless it's just development server.

69
00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:47.663
In that case, put it closer to
where all the developers are.

70
00:03:47.663 --> 00:03:51.015
I live in California,
I live in beautiful Oakland, California.

71
00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:55.958
So I'm gonna pick San Francisco
as the closest droplet location.

72
00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:01.997
New York is generally a good choice for
East Coast people and in general.

73
00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:07.101
In the console of AWS, they have
different regions to have US East 1,

74
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.790
2, they have US West 1, 2, etc.

75
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.545
And at least that Netflix
we use all the regions.

76
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.661
So we have servers
available in all regions.

77
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.373
And generally if you're creating a high
scale web application you're gonna have

78
00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:22.428
servers in all the regions
around the world.

79
00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.299
And you rely on load bouncers and

80
00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:27.846
really good routing to direct
your users to the right place.

81
00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:34.667
But for this is class, pick the one that's
closest to you and your part of the world.

82
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:38.237
Next, I'm gonna choose the data center.

83
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:39.408
And it doesn't really matter.

84
00:04:39.408 --> 00:04:45.471
In this case, I'm just gonna say SFO1,
totally fine.

85
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:47.398
And look, Digital Ocean,
they even have a tip here.

86
00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:50.537
Just what I was saying, select
a data center closest to your users.

87
00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:54.369
See, that's why we use Digital Ocean,
little helpful tips like that.

88
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.222
Now it comes time that we'll get serious.

89
00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:01.759
Region, total easy we
can pick another region.

90
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.817
Operating system,
the OS you have to live with.

91
00:05:04.817 --> 00:05:08.493
You can easily switch OSs once
you start developing on one.

92
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:13.237
So we wanna be really concerned
about what we're gonna choose here.

93
00:05:13.237 --> 00:05:15.582
We're gonna choose Ubuntu.

94
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:22.497
And we're gonna choose the LTS version and
the 64 bit LTS version.

95
00:05:22.497 --> 00:05:26.376
And let's talk about that here.

96
00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:33.900
Because the the OS is
actually fairly important.

97
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.402
Like I said, Ubuntu the most common one.

98
00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.618
And LTS stands for long term support, and

99
00:05:37.618 --> 00:05:39.052
that's the one you want
running on your server.

100
00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:43.348
If you're gonna go through the trouble
of buying an operating system,

101
00:05:43.348 --> 00:05:46.867
putting all these hours into
developing an application.

102
00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:51.553
You wanna make sure it's on the LTS and
not something that's on the bleeding edge.

103
00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:55.047
It's really tempting to be on the bleeding
edge, but you have to think like

104
00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:58.824
an enterprise software developer, which
is is it gonna be on the bleeding edge?

105
00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:01.428
No, because there's bugs, there's
things that people haven't encountered.

106
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:05.989
You want the most recent, but the slowest,
most stable version you can get for

107
00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.455
your operating system.

108
00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:10.441
That's always the rule when you
think about enterprise computing.

109
00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:13.742
You're welcome to choose
something more on the bleeding or

110
00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:17.185
close to the more recent version,
but always stick with LTS.

111
00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:21.409
I was gonna say that's a pretty good rule,
unless you really need a registration.
