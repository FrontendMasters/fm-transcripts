1
00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.929
So now we're done.

2
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:04.627
We're done for this particular section.

3
00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:06.452
You got very far.

4
00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:09.543
If you stopped now and said,
I'm done with the course, Jim,

5
00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:12.584
your beard is magnificent, but
I just can't take any more.

6
00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:13.704
That's fine.

7
00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:16.771
You have more than enough to be
a full stack engineer at this point.

8
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.545
What we've done today is we've purchased
domain, we've purchased server,

9
00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:24.283
we've tied them together and we've hand
created all these things on our own.

10
00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:27.343
Where you're now ready to go off and
create something,

11
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.956
a standard application that you know and
love.

12
00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:34.205
So for our take home project,
because you've all done git,

13
00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:39.804
I want you to create a git repository,
which we've already done with git init.

14
00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.754
And I want you to create, sorry,
I want you to do this on GitHub.

15
00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:45.100
Create a Git repo on GitHub.

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.607
Add your SSH key called GitHub key.

17
00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:52.452
Or you can use the SSH key you've
already used before, totally up to you.

18
00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.816
We wanna add that SSH key to GitHub,
which you know how to do, copy and

19
00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:58.776
pasting the public key just
like you did with DigitalOcean.

20
00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:02.190
Add a remote repo,
there are steps all linked in here, and

21
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.058
share the new SSH keys being used or
your old one.

22
00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:09.944
And then I want you to push your local
repo to GitHub from your server.

23
00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:15.800
But this you can do offline,
this is nothing particularly full stack.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.421
But we want this to ensure that we can
do local development on our machine, so

25
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.261
we don't have to use VI for
everything if we don't want to.

26
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.032
So now by creating a Git repo, we're
piping it back into a central location.

27
00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.222
Then I can push changes and
then I can pull them into my server, and

28
00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:33.586
that way I can edit code and
create a development environment that's

29
00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:36.262
not necessarily working on
the server the whole time.

30
00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.850
So that's the homework.

31
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.980
Nothing too complex here, but
you'll run in some nuances in Git,

32
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.654
you get to configure it and
all that stuff.

33
00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:48.528
Man, are you tired?

34
00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:49.616
I'm a little tired.

35
00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:54.608
We covered so many topics that require
probably years of expertise to know, but

36
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:57.149
we now know just enough to be dangerous.

37
00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.042
We understand how the Internet works.

38
00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:02.270
We understand domain name systems,
registrars.

39
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.102
We understand TCP, IP, UDP, ICNP,
all these phrases that if I asked you this

40
00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:11.514
morning what they mean, you'd be like,
you're just making that up.

41
00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:15.887
But now you understand this connected
system of networks, puts it all together

42
00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:19.933
and it's all built on these processes and
these configurations that if we

43
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:24.717
standardize them, and we follow the path,
we can create literally any application.

44
00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:26.433
We're gonna have some fun.

45
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.442
Even more fun than this.

46
00:02:27.442 --> 00:02:29.834
I had a lot of fun, hopefully you did too.

47
00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.076
For the next section,
we're gonna create a subdomain.

48
00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:33.367
We're gonna create a database.

49
00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:35.408
We're gonna link the database
to our application.

50
00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:37.980
We're gonna create a fake CI/CD pipeline.

51
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.184
And I'll explain what CI/CD is,

52
00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:44.291
pretty important in today's
modern computing environments.

53
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:46.226
Man, what are all the things
we're gonna cover tomorrow?

54
00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:49.171
We're gonna get to,
it'll be a lot more tactical.

55
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.164
We're gonna explain firewalls.

56
00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:52.179
I'm gonna go much deeper in security.

57
00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.430
You thought I spent some
time on security today.

58
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.087
Just wait.

59
00:02:55.087 --> 00:03:00.919
We're gonna talk more into permissions
which I kind of glossed over a bit.

60
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.524
Checking all the things.

61
00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:07.553
We're gonna set up a cron job before
the cron, probably super powerful tool.

62
00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:08.832
You can do a lot with a cron job and

63
00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:11.118
some shell scripts, and
we're gonna do that tomorrow.

64
00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:16.298
I'll show you really basic things that
are really, really powerful tools.

65
00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:17.741
I wanna go to all stuff we're gonna cover.

66
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.119
We're gonna have a lot of fun tomorrow.

67
00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.868
It's gonna be tactical.

68
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.288
We're gonna move probably
a bit faster than today,

69
00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:25.165
since you already have a good baseline.

70
00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:29.035
So, bring your Red Bull,
bring your energy, and

71
00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:33.838
bring your sense of adventure,
because we are gonna dive in.
