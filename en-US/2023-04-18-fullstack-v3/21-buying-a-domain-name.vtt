1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.645
Yes, Mark.

2
00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:08.454
&gt;&gt; With the domain name,
are there other things offered like SSL,

3
00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:12.500
hosting, etc, or do I need to get it?

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.581
Or are there any add-ons or things?

5
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:19.875
&gt;&gt; So we're gonna use Namecheap for
our domains,

6
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:24.005
we're gonna use Namecheap even
though the UI is just okay.

7
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.684
We're using them cuz they have
a lot of functionality built in.

8
00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:30.237
So if you want SSL,
you want email hosting,

9
00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:34.380
you can do all that via Namecheap,
they don't try to push you too hard.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.689
Originally, I tried to use
the Google Domains, cuz I'm like, Google,

11
00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:43.088
things like google.domains, or
domains.google, I forget which one.

12
00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:45.313
So I went through,
I bought a domain with them, one,

13
00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:46.952
it was more expensive than Namecheap.

14
00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:50.857
Two, they really were trying to upsell me
the whole way, which I really don't like.

15
00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:54.042
You already know my stance on ads and
privacy,

16
00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:57.893
I have a strong stance on being
upsold on things as well.

17
00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:01.643
So we use Namecheap because it's gonna
give you the cheapest domain name

18
00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:02.266
possible.

19
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.775
There might be something like or something
like that which maybe a little cheaper.

20
00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:09.362
But Namecheap's gotta have the biggest
selection at the cheapest prices.

21
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:15.280
And there's another question about
country level top domains, who owns them?

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.200
Generally, something like,
.ru comes to mind.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.003
Russia owns the .ru domain name,
they've registered that with ICANN.

24
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.864
Most countries own their own domain names,
that's not always the case.

25
00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:34.502
Because the country can sell away
the rights to their domain for money.

26
00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:38.635
I've tried think of some examples from
the earlier days of the Internet, but

27
00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:40.872
there's like some country, .io.

28
00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:45.501
You all remember a couple years ago
the explosion of, every startup and

29
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:49.221
tech company had .io company name or
.ly company name?

30
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:53.872
It was bit.ly and fast.ly and
all these other things.

31
00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:56.257
Yeah, that was a trend that went away,
I don't know what happened to that.

32
00:01:56.257 --> 00:02:01.237
But the .ly domain name
is actually a country TLD

33
00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:06.105
owned by somebody,
some small island nation.

34
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:09.611
I think they sold it, or
they made a bunch of money from that, .ly,

35
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:13.447
just because it happened to rhyme, or
go well with the English language.

36
00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:16.362
So countries generally own them,
not necessarily.

37
00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:19.850
The other one is, there are reserved
domain names that you cannot get.

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.952
So .org, the only way to get a .org
is to be a registered organization.

39
00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:27.442
So generally, maybe a nonprofit or
something like that.

40
00:02:27.442 --> 00:02:32.401
I can't just say like gem.org, I have
to actually be a 501(3)(c) nonprofit or

41
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:33.680
something like that.

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.102
The other one is .edu,

43
00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:39.804
you have to be a legitimate educational
institute to have a .edu domain name.

44
00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:44.574
Another one comes to mind is .gov,
you can't get a .gov domain name,

45
00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:46.253
that kinda makes sense.

46
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:50.701
Only legitimate government entities
can do that, .mil, .military,

47
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.655
you can only get if you're
part of the military.

48
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:58.574
So there are restricted domain names that
you may see that aren't available besides

49
00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:01.009
the ones that are owned by corporations.

50
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.203
But don't get distracted,
once we go to Namecheap,

51
00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.124
you will see how many
possible TLDs there are.

52
00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:08.578
And you probably won't be able to
think of funny names for all of them.

53
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:15.883
So I'm gonna jump to namecheap.com.

54
00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:21.941
And what sort of domain name do I have?

55
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.845
I really should plan this ahead of time.

56
00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:28.057
I put 100 plus hours in this course, and

57
00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:32.977
I didn't bother thinking
of a funny domain name.

58
00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:36.492
I'm stuck here.

59
00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:41.270
&gt;&gt; If it helps,
I'm gonna register quake3lanparty.lol.

60
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.579
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Because that brings me back to my

61
00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.059
college days.

62
00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:52.186
&gt;&gt; So someone's gonna register
quake3lanparty.lol, that's pretty good.

63
00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:57.020
&gt;&gt; Someone registered at
Google to the sql2google.com.

64
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.246
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, jemstack.lol,

65
00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:03.414
I wish I bought fullstack.

66
00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:07.921
All right,
you do not need any services, SSL,

67
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:13.907
we're gonna do that ourselves and
we're gonna do it for free.

68
00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:16.947
So you don't need any of this stuff.

69
00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:20.511
Business email, I will show you
how to set up email forwarding,

70
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:23.419
just nice to have with domain,
it's pretty sweet.

71
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.195
All right, so I'm gonna check out, I
already have an account with Namecheap and

72
00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:30.523
my cart, so I'm just gonna check out.

73
00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:35.896
Blah, domain privacy,
sure, confirm my order.

74
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.462
We see here with the registration,
remember we talked about ICANN?

75
00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:45.342
We pay them a fee every time
we buy a domain or renew it,

76
00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:48.673
it helps keep the nameservers alive,
helps keep it running.

77
00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.765
I'm just gonna buy it.

78
00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:00.625
Important thing on Namecheap or
any other registrar, so

79
00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:03.210
Namecheap is known as
the registrar at Google Domains.

80
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.074
Any sort of domain hosting are known as
registrar's because they register your

81
00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:10.115
domain to yourself as the owner.

82
00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:13.622
You always want a strong password,
you always want two-factor authentication.

83
00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:21.765
There have been times in the past where
people have stolen people's credentials.

84
00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:26.684
And suddenly, microsoft.com goes
somewhere else entirely different.

85
00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:30.575
And imagine the chaos there, because
it's very easy to clone a webpage and

86
00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:31.640
make it look legit.

87
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.958
And then make a login page, and

88
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.757
then you're just stealing
everybody's logins really easily.

89
00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:40.394
Hence, you always want security around
your domain to be very limited to

90
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:43.523
a subset of people and
very, very, very tight.

91
00:05:43.523 --> 00:05:47.056
Okay, so I have secretly put
in my credit card information,

92
00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.635
everybody in the room
knows my credit card.

93
00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:53.323
Seeing some unusual purchase
activity already, but that's okay,

94
00:05:53.323 --> 00:05:55.047
we'll just recharge it later.

95
00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:59.745
So I've bought a domain name, I bought
jemstack.lol, which, following the rules

96
00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:03.677
of a domain name, it needs to be funny or
memorable, preferably both.

97
00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:07.504
So now we're into the domain
management screen.

98
00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:12.064
So if you need to get to here in
Namecheap, you just go to your domains

99
00:06:12.064 --> 00:06:16.229
list here, you can see all
the domains that I own, I told you.

100
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.130
I should have just kept one of these,
like netflix.college,

101
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.056
it cost me $70 a year to maintain this.

102
00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:24.785
And I don't do anything with it,
I just bought it cuz I was like,

103
00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:29.220
someday I'll do something with it,
netflix.design, why do I own these?

104
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.926
Really dashboard, anyways, we won't go
into the issues with domain squatting and

105
00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:34.993
things like that.

106
00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:38.284
So we're gonna go to jemstock.lol,
and I'm gonna to Manage.

107
00:06:41.013 --> 00:06:41.695
Okay.

108
00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:51.455
All right, so
you've probably gotten this far before,

109
00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.390
most engineers I know
own some sort of domain.

110
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.650
But now it's the part where we
actually hook it up to something.

111
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.469
This is the missing link for a lot of
people, I know it was initially for me.

112
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.652
So let's check out what the slides
have to say for our next steps.

113
00:07:06.652 --> 00:07:09.231
So we're gonna buy
a domain with a registrar.

114
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:14.207
Again, you don't have to use Namecheap,
they just happen to have the cheapest

115
00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:17.413
domain names for
educational purposes or for fun.

116
00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:21.469
Then we're gonna update the nameserver,
remember we said who the nameservers were?

117
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:26.560
That giant kinda phone book
mapping names to IP addresses?

118
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.182
So we're gonna move those name
servers over to DigitalOcean,

119
00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.216
which will make it a little
bit easier to manage.

120
00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:34.432
We can leave it with Namecheap,
it doesn't really matter.

121
00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:38.411
But for this exercise, let's just
switch over to DigitalOcean cuz I want

122
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.439
you to have that experience
of moving your nameserver.

123
00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:46.137
And then once we update our nameserver,
we're going to go in DigitalOcean instead

124
00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:48.899
of Namecheap and
we're gonna add two A records.

125
00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:50.485
And remember what we said A records where?

126
00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:52.939
They map domains to IPs.

127
00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.611
So we're gonna add one for the @,
the @ is just your domain name.

128
00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.891
So in this case,
mine would be jemstack.lol, that's the @,

129
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:02.549
it always represents the root.

130
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.647
Dub dub dub, www,
it's not considered a subdomain, but

131
00:08:06.647 --> 00:08:10.256
it's generally the convention,
World Wide Web.

132
00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:14.054
Not a phrase we use a lot these days,
but it exists by convention.

133
00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:18.148
So I want jemstack.lol to
work on both jemstack.lol and

134
00:08:18.148 --> 00:08:22.970
www.gemstack.lol, depending
on how you navigate it.

135
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.492
So let's go ahead, and
first thing we're gonna do,

136
00:08:25.492 --> 00:08:27.351
we're gonna update our nameservers.

137
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:30.079
So click on your droplet,

138
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:35.167
then click on the three dots and
say Add a domain.

139
00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:41.649
So we can do this first, we can do
it after, it doesn't really matter,

140
00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.164
let's do the nameservers first.

141
00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:47.787
So the nameservers are just
ns1.digitalocean.com,

142
00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:52.603
ns2.digitalocean.com,
ns3.digitalocean.com,

143
00:08:52.603 --> 00:08:55.308
and they're somewhere in here.

144
00:08:57.633 --> 00:09:01.530
I usually have them listed out, I forget
where, but I'll find it in a second, but

145
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.238
they're pretty easy to remember.

146
00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:07.585
So back in Namecheap,
under our Domain Management page,

147
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:11.230
we're gonna go all the way
down to nameservers.

148
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.230
And we're gonna say Custom DNS, and

149
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.069
the name server for DigitalOcean,

150
00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:25.105
ns1.digitalocean.com.

151
00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:29.858
And I'm gonna copy paste cuz I don't
wanna type in the wrong thing.

152
00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:42.047
And we wanna add all three, so ns2, ns3.

153
00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:50.705
And all this is saying is Namecheap
is a registrar, they say,

154
00:09:50.705 --> 00:09:52.989
hey, I own jemstack.lol.

155
00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:55.302
It's registered to me personally,
my address,

156
00:09:55.302 --> 00:09:57.954
I'm the one in charge of renewing it,
things like that.

157
00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:02.238
However, I'm gonna move my actual DNS
management over to Digital Ocean,

158
00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:04.250
using their nameservers.

159
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.840
That means Digital Ocean will be
the authoritative answer as far as where

160
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.580
the domain actually goes.

161
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.990
So I'm gonna say Save, it may take a
second to propagate some of these changes.

162
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.264
Because again, there's a whole bunch
of registrars and nameservers.

163
00:10:22.264 --> 00:10:24.794
It can take anywhere up
to a couple minutes for

164
00:10:24.794 --> 00:10:27.466
the changes to propagate
across the Internet.

165
00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:37.213
And I didn't do it because I
moved my redirect email, but

166
00:10:37.213 --> 00:10:40.744
I'll show you on a different
domain how to have some fun.

167
00:10:40.744 --> 00:10:45.274
So I'll pick gogemgo.com,
again, a great domain name, but

168
00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:50.331
I haven't done anything with it,
I also moved that to Digital Ocean.

169
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:56.494
Let me pick a random one that I know,
let's see, I'll pick netflix.college.

170
00:10:56.494 --> 00:10:59.454
I really just need to drop these,
I don't know why I'm paying for these.

171
00:10:59.454 --> 00:11:01.499
I'm sure everybody says that every year.

172
00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:07.146
So on Namecheap, a cool thing you
can do is you can make an alias for

173
00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:09.730
all of your email addresses.

174
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:16.545
So if I wanna make,
I don't know, jem@jemstack.lol,

175
00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:21.561
I can do that, so
I can put a wildcard here.

176
00:11:27.868 --> 00:11:31.477
Put a catch-all, actually, and

177
00:11:31.477 --> 00:11:37.701
I can just forward it to myself
at one of my email addresses,

178
00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:45.347
@gmail.com So now I can send any traffic,

179
00:11:45.347 --> 00:11:50.349
I can't write emails using this
because it's just a forward.

180
00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:54.680
But what I like to do, and
this is one of my favorite things to do,

181
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.898
is if I'm using a product or service,
I say, for instance, like my personal

182
00:11:59.898 --> 00:12:05.076
domain name, jemyoung.com,
I just say I'm on amazon@jemyoung.com.

183
00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:10.017
That way I know if I ever get spams
where all these things are coming from,

184
00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:11.811
and I can wildcard it all.

185
00:12:11.811 --> 00:12:15.129
If I wanna sign up for Frontend Masters,
I can say frontendmasters@gemyoung.com.

186
00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:18.279
And I have all these custom email
addresses that just forward to

187
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.175
my personal one.

188
00:12:19.175 --> 00:12:23.149
Now, you can't send email addresses with
a forwarder, that you have to pay for,

189
00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:25.405
which is possible, it's not too expensive.

190
00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:29.165
And that way you can have your own
private domain, your own private email,

191
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.808
it makes you look professional when
you own yourself@yourself.com or

192
00:12:32.808 --> 00:12:33.956
something like that.

193
00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:38.692
But if you just want to do forwarding,
it's free, and it's a pretty fun

194
00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:43.367
way of catching spam or just making
life a little bit more interesting.

195
00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:47.194
I will say this,
people are not as technology adept,

196
00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:49.586
they sometimes get suspicious.

197
00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:52.569
I use one,
it was like mybank@jemyoung.com,

198
00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:54.911
like, do you work for this bank?

199
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:59.020
And I'm ending the bank, so
don't call my bank, but I was like, no,

200
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.588
that's just a forwarding address,
they're like, okay.

201
00:13:02.588 --> 00:13:08.394
And they really gave me,
is this a hacker, man?

202
00:13:08.394 --> 00:13:10.510
So be careful, that's actually
happened to me a few times.

203
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.199
If I use the company
name at mydomainname.com,

204
00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:14.844
they get really suspicious.

205
00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:17.941
Then I have to explain email forwarding
and that's the whole thing, but

206
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:19.839
it's worth it to have
a custom domain name.

207
00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:28.484
Okay, so now that those changes have
hopefully propagated out on the Internet,

208
00:13:28.484 --> 00:13:31.651
we can add domain names
to Digital Ocean now.

209
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:34.013
So I'm gonna say gemstack.lol.

210
00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:41.559
And we're gonna add that domain, and
we're gonna map it to my droplet here.

211
00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:44.783
Remember, I only had one droplet,
if you made more than one,

212
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.521
make sure you pick the right one.

213
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:50.109
So we're gonna add that domain here,
and of course,

214
00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:53.236
we can't just add it,
we need to add a record.

215
00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:56.834
So remember we said the @ was the root?

216
00:13:56.834 --> 00:14:03.273
So that's just gemstack.lol, and
we're gonna pick, is this the right one?

217
00:14:03.273 --> 00:14:04.921
See, this way you don't
have too many droplets.

218
00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:08.470
That's the right one, is it the right one?

219
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.188
Let me double check.

220
00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:17.705
Scroll up to my actual IP
address cuz I'm lazy, yes,

221
00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:22.581
it ends in 128.44, okay,
so this is the right one.

222
00:14:22.581 --> 00:14:28.664
So we're gonna create an A record,
and then we'll create another one for

223
00:14:28.664 --> 00:14:32.897
www, and
we're gonna map it to our droplet again.

224
00:14:32.897 --> 00:14:34.534
And then we're gonna
create another record.

225
00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:43.739
Okay, everybody there with me?

226
00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:49.809
One small step for you,
one giant leap for your web application.

227
00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:53.273
And at this point,
if you've done everything right,

228
00:14:53.273 --> 00:14:58.696
we have connected our random domain to our
random server using the power of Internet,

229
00:14:58.696 --> 00:15:00.297
DNS, and nameservers.

230
00:15:00.297 --> 00:15:04.156
But if I go to jemstack.lol, nothing,

231
00:15:04.156 --> 00:15:08.136
cuz our server doesn't do anything yet.

232
00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:11.701
So it doesn't know how to respond
to any requests to that query.

233
00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:17.007
But using our network tools,
let us validate,

234
00:15:17.007 --> 00:15:21.917
let's see what the nameservers have done,

235
00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:26.835
maybe they haven't propagated fully yet.

236
00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:30.832
So we'll say dig jemstack.lol,

237
00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:39.206
And it's not available yet, again,
these changes can take time.

238
00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:42.482
So in the meantime, if it still
hasn't happened for some reason,

239
00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:46.166
because vagaries of the Internet,
we can always just use our IP address for

240
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.764
now instead of our domain name.

241
00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:50.908
Let me try nslookup, I don't know if
that will tell me something different.

242
00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:04.418
Yeah, so the changes haven't propagated
fully yet, it can take time, yes.

243
00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:09.260
&gt;&gt; What service do you use to
send emails from your domain?

244
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.132
&gt;&gt; I think Namecheap, depending on who
you're using to manage your nameserver,

245
00:16:13.132 --> 00:16:15.697
you can just buy a service,
Namecheap will have it.

246
00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:20.785
I forget how much it costs, I know Google,
you can do with Google as well,

247
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:24.000
if you wanna hand them
control of your domain.

248
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.137
So what will happen if you
wanna do Gmail forwarding, or

249
00:16:27.137 --> 00:16:29.353
have a Gmail address with your domain.

250
00:16:29.353 --> 00:16:33.115
You have to hand, not control, but
you need to move the nameserver over to

251
00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:35.914
Google Domains,
just like we did with DigitalOcean.

252
00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:38.796
Then that way they can
manage the DNS system, and

253
00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:40.845
then you can do email forwarding.

254
00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:42.859
I think DigitalOcean will allow it too,

255
00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:45.181
that's usually a service
you have to pay for.

256
00:16:45.181 --> 00:16:48.857
If you just want to do email forwarding,
that's free, you can do that for free.

257
00:16:48.857 --> 00:16:51.818
But if you wanna send that email back out,
that costs money.

258
00:16:51.818 --> 00:16:58.377
And here there's a button to buy a private
email for your domain name if you need.

259
00:16:58.377 --> 00:17:01.608
And if you need to transfer
it to a different registrar,

260
00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:04.678
you would go to Sharing &amp; Transfer.

261
00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:09.625
They usually make this pretty difficult,
because, obviously, I don't

262
00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:14.816
want someone buying randomly netflix.com
because they felt like it, yeah.

263
00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:18.316
&gt;&gt; I think Namecheap does,
with the private email at least,

264
00:17:18.316 --> 00:17:23.104
back with one of my other domains, they
do integrate with Google Workspace, or

265
00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.472
it used to be Google Apps for Business.

266
00:17:25.472 --> 00:17:30.440
But if you want that Gmail feel and
Google Drive and everything,

267
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:36.063
you just click a couple buttons and
they configure the DNS in Namecheap.

268
00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:40.525
And they'll bill you for the Google
account through your Namecheap account.

269
00:17:40.525 --> 00:17:41.710
&gt;&gt; Nice, did not know that.

270
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.410
So for those who couldn't hear, Namecheap
will hook up your domain to Google Drive

271
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.000
and Gmail if you need, and
they'll hook it all for you.

272
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.571
I do like Namecheap, the UI may be
a bit much, it's a little clunky,

273
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:57.342
maybe more information than you need for
most cases,

274
00:17:57.342 --> 00:18:00.315
but they are the cheapest and
they're pretty reliable.

275
00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:04.755
I've used them for well over a decade
now and haven't had any issues.
