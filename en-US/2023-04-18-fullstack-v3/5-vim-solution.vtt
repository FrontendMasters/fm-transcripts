1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.661
How is that, everyone?

2
00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:06.189
Little uncomfortable, little weird
if you haven't used Vim before,

3
00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.156
like why can't I use my mouse?

4
00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:13.469
So let's go and walk through the exercise
and I'll tell you why Vim and why we're

5
00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.572
gonna use Vim today for editing our files
and not some of the other solutions.

6
00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:21.820
So I'm gonna jump back
to my terminal here.

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.372
Write clear, so the instructions were
to navigate to your home directory.

8
00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:32.185
I am here, pwd, and I'm gonna make
a directory called temp again.

9
00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.339
So make your temp.

10
00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:40.945
Well, maybe I didn't delete it.

11
00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:50.680
Last time, okay, and
I'm just gonna make it again to temp.

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.061
All right, on mkdir,
if you wanna make an extended,

13
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:02.767
you wanna follow it so if I wanna
just tip if you wanna say mkdir -p.

14
00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:10.252
So I can say tepm/foo/bar.

15
00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:13.095
Read only files, how did I get there?

16
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:19.137
Ls TMP, maybe I do the Rockmount, will
look this up, because now I need to know.

17
00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:21.124
&gt;&gt; Do a ./ for temp.

18
00:01:23.877 --> 00:01:26.637
&gt;&gt; Let's try the ./.

19
00:01:26.637 --> 00:01:31.807
And let's use the arrow key
to jump up to my history.

20
00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:33.856
Good call, ./.

21
00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:38.767
So now when you navigate in the temp,
we'll see foo, we'll see bar.

22
00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:43.465
So the -p will let you make extended
file system down and down and

23
00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:45.991
down instead of make a directory.

24
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.319
Go into that directory,
make another directory.

25
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.677
Go into that directory, et cetera.

26
00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:54.920
And thanks for
the tip on the dot, in this case.

27
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.404
So next, we're going to open Vim.

28
00:01:57.404 --> 00:02:00.844
So we can say VI,
I think we can all say Vim.

29
00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:01.747
We'll try them.

30
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.857
Yeah, you can say Vim.

31
00:02:02.857 --> 00:02:04.555
You can save VI, they both work.

32
00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:09.634
So now we are in command mode,
so we can't really do anything.

33
00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:12.208
If you touch keys, you might get into
a weird state like macro mode or

34
00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:12.942
things like that.

35
00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:18.977
We just say I, so now I'm in insert mode,
we can see at the bottom it says insert.

36
00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:25.303
And now I'm just gonna say hello,
not a whole lot there.

37
00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:29.724
That's really groundbreaking
programming here.

38
00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:33.257
So I need to get out of command or
I need to get out of insert mode now.

39
00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:37.472
So I'm gonna hit escape and
I'm gonna hit Shift Colon.

40
00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:43.631
And I say WQ if I wanna write and quit.

41
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.237
And now, I can say cat test.

42
00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:50.715
Hey, it says hello, that's awesome.

43
00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:58.357
So a common way of, this will happen
to you at some point, I promise.

44
00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:06.739
You will say,
I edit this file blah blah blah blah blah.

45
00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.420
I don't really like that,
so you can hit escape U.

46
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.799
Once were back into primary mode,

47
00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.121
say U undo, pretty cool.

48
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:23.618
Now, what if you say, hey,
I don't really wanna save this.

49
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:28.860
So the challenge with Vim is if
you do something, hello world, and

50
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.141
you hit Escape, and you're like, I just
wanna quit, so I'm just gonna say Q.

51
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.970
It's gonna say, hey,
you didn't save your file.

52
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.354
So if you say Q, bang,
that means do what I say.

53
00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:46.537
That means you're forcing it.

54
00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:50.437
So I've definitely done that many
times where I'm editing a file and

55
00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:51.523
I didn't mean to.

56
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.091
The undo doesn't work for some reason.

57
00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.229
And I'm like, what do I do?

58
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.931
I don't want to save this.

59
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.410
Just to bang.

60
00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:06.190
And if you ever get stuck in, and you
will, don't worry, Vim feels unnatural.

61
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.369
If you get stuck,
escape cubing just we talked about.

62
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:15.040
It's a common joke on the Internet,
you get stuck in Vim.

63
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.827
It's really easy to do
cuz people don't know.

64
00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:19.082
They're like,
just open this file and edit it.

65
00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:21.452
They read the tutorial of mine, but

66
00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:25.726
they don't really go into more
detail about how all that works.

67
00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:31.262
There's a course by the Primagen,
also a Netflix engineer.

68
00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:33.183
It's called Vim fundamentals.

69
00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:35.417
And if you can see the length,
it's four hours of Vim.

70
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:39.068
Four hours of Vim, so
you can go really, really deep.

71
00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:41.400
We spent what, ten minutes on it.

72
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.043
That's really all we need to know for
today, but

73
00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:47.535
you can go really deep and
come really productive if you want to.

74
00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:51.925
Fair warning, the people that I've seen
at work use Vim are really efficient.

75
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.609
But It takes a long time and
dedication to become good at it,

76
00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:59.601
cuz it's just not a natural way
of programming for most people.

77
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.389
But if you do,
you will become very efficient at it.

78
00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.581
There's also links here about Vim.

79
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.758
There's an entire wiki dedicated to Vim,

80
00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.179
if you're wondering how
hardcore people get.

81
00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:14.333
There's a cheat sheet telling you how to
navigate around how to find things very

82
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:18.554
quickly and then Open Vim is a nice set of
animated examples and things like that.

83
00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:22.737
So again, like we said at top of this
course, everything we're doing here has so

84
00:05:22.737 --> 00:05:26.676
much more complexity that we're just
not gonna touch because we could spend

85
00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:28.660
an entire day on most of these topics.

86
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.908
We could spend an entire day on shell
scripting and things like that, and

87
00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:33.091
how to use your terminal.

88
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:34.504
We won't do that today.

89
00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:37.912
We're learning just enough to
know what we need to do and

90
00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:42.569
to get you some familiarity with kind
of how all these systems tie together.
