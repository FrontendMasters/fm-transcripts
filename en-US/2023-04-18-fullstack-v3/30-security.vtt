00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.068
I said it once,

2
00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:06.011
I said it again, security is one of
the most important things we can do.

3
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:09.826
So this whole section is on different
ways of securing your application,

4
00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:11.371
which are pretty important.

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.651
So let's go back to that auth log.

6
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:18.611
Remember that yesterday, our server's
been up for about 24 hours or so.

7
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:22.271
Let's check out what's going on
in the world of our auth log.

8
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:24.691
So give it a second to navigate there.

9
00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:45.656
So I'm going to say, sudo,
Cat to read that file,

10
00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:50.394
var/log/auth.log, that's for our password.

11
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.771
And everybody's auth.log is gonna look a
little bit different, but what do you see?

12
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:02.911
&gt;&gt; A lot of activity.

13
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.331
&gt;&gt; A lot of invalid users.

14
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:09.176
&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, the minute you
open your computer to the web,

15
00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.788
you're getting port scanned by everybody.

16
00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:14.766
Everybody's trying to
connect to your machine.

17
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.025
The Internet is a wide world place,

18
00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:20.427
not necessarily full of
the best actors all the time.

19
00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:24.630
So we spend extra time in
this class going to security.

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.485
Nothing too onerous that's going
to interrupt your workflow but

21
00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.917
just really good practices to
have because if you don't,

22
00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:35.925
people are going to take your machine and
they will not stop trying.

23
00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.292
And we talked a bit about this yesterday,
but what do we do if,

24
00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:45.022
because we blocked root,
which was a good idea, but

25
00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.637
what do we do if someone just gained
access to your server in general?

26
00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:49.597
What could they do?

27
00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.860
&gt;&gt; They could download as
much stuff as they want and

28
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.265
run through our bandwidth caps.

29
00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
they could download as much as they want,

30
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.335
run through your bandwidth caps,
what else?

31
00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:11.701
&gt;&gt; Use it as a bot to
attack other sites or

32
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:14.477
infrastructure.

33
00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:18.849
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they can take it over use as
bots to attack the other infrastructure.

34
00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.906
What about this one,
which we often don't consider?

35
00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:24.464
Now that we have an SSH key on our server,

36
00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:27.776
they could connect to your
GitHub via your server and

37
00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:32.907
then your company's profile, your
company's work is probably on GitHub too.

38
00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:37.310
So they can steal your entire company
via one unsecured server by you, and

39
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.371
you didn't mean to do that, but
that's the way these things work.

40
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:43.731
Another thing they can do
is they can connect and

41
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.449
then they can erase their tracks.

42
00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.899
They can delete the log files or
just delete the lines log files, so

43
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:53.149
you'll never even know your machine was
compromised because people can clear all

44
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.023
this stuff out.

45
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:58.803
And the rule on a compromised machine is,
you don't know what they've done.

46
00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:02.548
So generally, if your machines or
any company's machine have been hacked or

47
00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:06.349
taken over, all you can do is wipe them
and restore something from a backup from

48
00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.367
a long-time ago because you
don't know what they've done.

49
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.107
And we've seen lots of this
in history with computer,

50
00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:16.101
with companies getting hacked, and
the people were in their machines for two,

51
00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:20.286
three, four years, because they thought
they fixed the breach and they didn't.

52
00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.898
Because people have dropped like
a rootkit or something in there, and

53
00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:24.593
they're just in there watching, waiting.

54
00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:27.531
People think it's a bunch of kids and
teenagers having fun,

55
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:30.295
trying to take down your website,
things like that, but

56
00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:33.712
the real malicious actors are the people
that they play the long game.

57
00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:37.805
They will wait years, and years, and years
and try to compromise as much as possible.

58
00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:42.524
Hence, security is paramount when it comes
to servers because everything's connected.

59
00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:45.270
So the strongest thing
we do is use SSH key,

60
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.788
we talked about that in a previous
section, we don't use passwords.

61
00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:53.579
Passwords are weak, passwords can be
broken, people can brute force passwords,

62
00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.459
so we use SSH keys.

63
00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.855
We use something called firewalls,
which says, hey,

64
00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:02.850
you're allowed to come into my server for
say, I need to serve Internet traffic.

65
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.534
You're allowed to do that, but
you're not allowed to touch anything else,

66
00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:07.561
so we use a firewall.

67
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:11.728
Another thing we do that people don't
often think of is we keep our software up

68
00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:12.251
to date.

69
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.499
Because if there's a hack or

70
00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.991
a breach, you wanna make sure that your
software is always running the latest.
