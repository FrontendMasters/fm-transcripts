1
00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:03.713
So now we talked about
the importance of https.

2
00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:08.291
And it kind of makes your website
a real website, not just a toy one.

3
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.802
So let's go ahead and implement it.

4
00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:16.728
To do that, we're gonna use a really
nifty service called certbots.

5
00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:18.464
And then we're gonna install certbot.

6
00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.075
It's gonna do all the work for us.

7
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:24.085
Where in the old days, we had to do a lot
of copy pasting, NGINX configuration.

8
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.751
It does all that for us.

9
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:29.848
Which again, is the benefit of being
on this paved road of Ubuntu and NGINX,

10
00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:32.294
a well-supported and well-trodden path.

11
00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:35.745
Then after that, all we have to do
is open the firewall for ports.

12
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.945
What's https, anybody?

13
00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:40.224
&gt;&gt; Not 80.

14
00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:40.890
&gt;&gt; Not 80.

15
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.714
&gt;&gt; It's 443.

16
00:00:41.714 --> 00:00:42.755
&gt;&gt; 443, that's right.

17
00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:44.459
It's one of the common ports.

18
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:51.140
So if you click on the link or
navigate to certbot.eff.org,

19
00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:54.949
And I just sorta kinda
through instructions.

20
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.430
Certbot is run by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, if you've never heard of them,

21
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.133
very, very good organization.

22
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.087
They fight for the users on the internet.

23
00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:06.475
They open lawsuits and
privacy and things like that.

24
00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:09.322
It's probably one of the few charities
that I donate to every one of my

25
00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.101
paychecks cuz I believe in their mission.

26
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:12.703
And they're doing something like this.

27
00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:16.678
So if you go on Namecheap or
DigitalOcean, they'll be like, hey,

28
00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:21.028
we can set you up on an https certificate,
but it's gonna cost you money.

29
00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:22.903
This will not cost you any money.

30
00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:27.738
So it's fantastic organization
donate if you'd like, but

31
00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:31.546
let's go make use of
their software right now.

32
00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:33.708
So I'm gonna click there.

33
00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:35.223
And it makes it so handy.

34
00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:42.501
So my HTTP website is running on nginx and
look at all these other things.

35
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:46.748
We could be running
Apache Troxy plus we're not,

36
00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:48.746
nginx on [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Ubuntu.

37
00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:49.920
&gt;&gt; Ubuntu 20.

38
00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:58.285
And it walks you through all the steps.

39
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.276
So this uses something called snap.

40
00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:03.246
And I played around with snap
when I was creating this course.

41
00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:05.173
I didn't find it super reliable but

42
00:02:05.173 --> 00:02:07.815
we gotta use it this one
time to install Certbot.

43
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.841
Snap is just a package manager,
just like APT.

44
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:14.765
But I'd say it's a little more janky.

45
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:18.634
So we don't use it for most things,
but we use it for this one.

46
00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:20.190
So we can just follow the instructions.

47
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.583
So we're gonna SSH into our server,
we're probably already there.

48
00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:24.999
We're gonna install snapd.

49
00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.135
It may already be installed by default.

50
00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:33.549
And then we're gonna just
use snap to install certbot.

51
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.826
So I think snap is installed by default,
but

52
00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:43.533
I'm gonna copy these commands just
to make sure it's up to date.

53
00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:45.910
So SSH into my server,

54
00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:54.331
Yeah, I'm lazy, I'm telling you I'm lazy.

55
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.093
I will go through all my entire
history to avoid typing three lines.

56
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.342
So clear, paste this command sudo snap

57
00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:10.661
install core, sudo snap refresh.

58
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.849
This might take a few seconds

59
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:29.817
All right, Give you a second there.

60
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.803
So next we're gonna remove certbot.

61
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:44.897
I don't think it exists already,
but, let's just be sure.

62
00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:47.849
Removes certbot, actually I know for

63
00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.732
a fact that doesn't exist yet,
but just in case.

64
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:58.885
Maybe that's sudo,
just saying removed from apt,

65
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:04.095
so sudo-apt-gets remove certbot.

66
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.236
Let's double check I'm reading
these instructions correctly.

67
00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:15.338
Yeah, try that, yeah,
it was installed, but doesn't hurt me.

68
00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.163
So now you snap that package manager.

69
00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:20.682
We say sudo snap install classic certbot

70
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.953
All right, it's installed, but
it's not quite running yet.

71
00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:40.219
So we'll jump back here.

72
00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:45.541
Or we're just gonna make a logical link,
that's the ln.

73
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:51.383
We're gonna link the snaps,
the binary of certbot/snapbin,

74
00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:54.952
bin is binary, certbot to ourselves,

75
00:04:54.952 --> 00:05:00.829
the one that we own,
/user/ binary, bin/certbot.

76
00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:01.973
Pretty easy.

77
00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:06.834
If you wanna see the man Ln,
just make links between files,

78
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.887
nothing fit on Windows.

79
00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:11.106
It's like create short
term equivalent of that.

80
00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:21.338
So now we're gonna put
this into easy mode.

81
00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:27.269
Sudo certbt--Nginx,
it's gonna do all the work for us.

82
00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:39.450
It's gonna ask for an email address,
I'm just gonna say jem@gemyoung.com or

83
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.243
you can use your new domain name if
you have the email forwarding setup.

84
00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:47.370
Did I read the term service?

85
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.287
Nobody reads the terms of service.

86
00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:51.221
Do I wanna sign up for the newsletter?

87
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:57.146
No, I do not, sorry, FF, I love you,
but I don't want another newsletter.

88
00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:59.826
And it's saying, because it's
reading our Nginx configuration,

89
00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.686
it sees we have two
different types of servers.

90
00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:03.329
We have our default server.

91
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.510
So in my case, it's gemstock.lol.

92
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.056
And we have a subdomain we created, too.

93
00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.464
Do we want certificates for both?

94
00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:09.698
Of course we do.

95
00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:11.289
So we're just gonna leave it blank.

96
00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:23.895
So what this is actually doing, because
I've done this the hard way back in

97
00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.676
the day, where I've had to do this all
by hand before certbot came around.

98
00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:32.328
Is what it's doing is one it's adjusting
our Nginx configuration actually

99
00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:35.610
let's go look at it,
don't just take my word for it.

100
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.705
Let's take a look at what it was doing so

101
00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:47.865
sudo cat /etc where nginx is

102
00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:54.100
sites-enabled and let's look at

103
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.476
the full stack front end one.

104
00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:01.854
And there we can see
that certbot went in and

105
00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:04.576
changed our Nginx virtual
host configuration.

106
00:07:04.576 --> 00:07:09.356
It didn't touch this part, but
it did add the 443 listing on.

107
00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:12.995
So it created 443 port it says ssl,

108
00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:18.012
secure socket layer is
the encryption technology.

109
00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:20.067
It adds a certificate.

110
00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:25.934
And a .pem is it's sort of similar to
an ssh key in terms of it's used as a key,

111
00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:29.927
but pem files are used as
certificates in this case.

112
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:33.891
AWS I think still uses pem
files instead of ssh keys,

113
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.145
sometimes just a lot of background there.

114
00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:42.523
And then it created a certificate for
us, created a private key.

115
00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:45.350
And then it did something really
nice which is added a redirect.

116
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.166
So if someone connects to us on ports 80,

117
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:52.720
it's gonna redirect them to the port 443,
this is a nice to have.

118
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.933
That way you're ensuring people
are always using HTTPS connection.

119
00:07:56.933 --> 00:08:01.713
But really what we missed out on is What
certbot does is it creates a certificate,

120
00:08:01.713 --> 00:08:06.304
it puts it in a certain directory,
then certbot as a certificate authority.

121
00:08:06.304 --> 00:08:11.276
Someone that puts a stamp on your website
that says like this is an official

122
00:08:11.276 --> 00:08:15.857
website, is it creates a file just
to make sure you own the website.

123
00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:19.206
Something you don't think of is, yeah,
what if I create a certificate for

124
00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:20.227
a website or I don't?

125
00:08:20.227 --> 00:08:20.766
By that point,

126
00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.425
I can intercept all the traffic cuz
I'm just decrypting all their traffic.

127
00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:26.682
So it creates a temporary
file on your file system.

128
00:08:26.682 --> 00:08:28.762
Make sure that you can connect to it and

129
00:08:28.762 --> 00:08:32.338
just validates that you actually
are the website requesting it.

130
00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:35.270
That's why we had to do all the website
stuff earlier, where I said it didn't

131
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.085
really matter until we got to HTTPS,
then we actually need a domain name.

132
00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:41.194
Cuz you can't do HTTPS
over just an IP address.

133
00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:45.536
Pretty nice.

134
00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:51.982
So let's test automatic renewal because
certificates have to be renewed over time.

135
00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:55.262
You can't just have one in perpetuity,
it has to run every so often.

136
00:08:55.262 --> 00:08:59.107
Certbot will do this for us, but we just
wanna make sure that it all worked out.

137
00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:01.039
So we'll do a simulated registration here.

138
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.272
All right, let's check this out.

139
00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:06.590
So let's get a jump start that lol.

140
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.317
We forgot to open the port.

141
00:09:08.317 --> 00:09:11.141
And all that certbot will not do that for
us, which is probably good.

142
00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:13.495
You don't want something
messing up your firewall.

143
00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:17.017
Fortunately, uncomplicated
firewall makes it really easy.

144
00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:23.567
So we can just say sudo clear,

145
00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:28.023
sudo ufw allow https

146
00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:35.125
And we're gonna check sudo
ufw status just to be sure,

147
00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:42.769
we see port 443 is now open.

148
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.585
So let's give this a shot again.

149
00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:51.697
Hey, it's all working too,
what do you know?

150
00:09:51.697 --> 00:09:55.354
We got that nice little certificate there?

151
00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:56.514
What do you mean look at it.

152
00:10:04.462 --> 00:10:08.294
So that's that's pretty nice,
that It does so much work for us.

153
00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:11.052
So all the work that goes on
the background all the tweaking and

154
00:10:11.052 --> 00:10:13.292
moving around a file certbot
does all that for us.

155
00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:17.631
So again EFF is a really good organization
it helps us as software engineers, it

156
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:22.000
really looks out I recommend donating to
them if you have the time and the money.
