1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.280
So next we haven't done anything with
our server, it is a blank canvas.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.241
So what we're gonna do now
on any brand new server for

3
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:11.040
the first time, we need to one,
update our software.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.920
Two, we're gonna restart our server.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
Then we're gonna create a new user
because we don't wanna operate as roots.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.515
That's very, very,
very dangerous and I'll explain why.

7
00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:24.200
We want to create a user that is
a super user who can use root.

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.940
We want to enable login for the new user.

9
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.700
And we want to disable the root login.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.530
It sounds like a lot.

11
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.047
It's kind of a lot, but
once you do it once, you'll be like, okay,

12
00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:36.590
I kind of get where we're going here.

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.873
So, I laid all the steps
I'll walk through them,

14
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.480
I'll talk through them and
then we will execute them.

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.190
I'll do them with you.

16
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.620
So, and I'll move slowly.

17
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.360
So follow along.

18
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.170
Let me know if I'm going too fast.

19
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.400
So obviously, the first thing we need to
do is we need to SSH into our server.

20
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.020
We've already done that.

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.600
Next thing we need to do is
we're gonna update our software.

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.930
So we're gonna say apt update and
then apt upgrade.

23
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.400
apt is just the package manager for
Ubuntu and the Linux distributions.

24
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.167
And then we're gonna restart our server,

25
00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.040
kinda how you have to turn it off and
on again.

26
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.035
We're gonna say, shutdown now -r.

27
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.500
So that sounded like a lot.

28
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.609
Let's do it together.

29
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.370
So I'm going to ssh into my server.

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.370
And like I said,
I always go through history.

31
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.246
It's so much faster.

32
00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:28.000
I could just do this a different way,
but I just like doing the up arrow.

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.057
So ssh into root.

34
00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:36.490
And then the next thing we're going to do
is, we're still root, that's okay for now.

35
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.640
We're going to apt update.

36
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.750
So this is just kind of a fetch and saying
like, what are the latest libraries?

37
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.015
This might take a few seconds here.

38
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.250
So I'm running APT updates

39
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.580
So now I'm ready for
actually upgrading the software.

40
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.407
So I'm gonna run apt or
APT upgrade and clear.

41
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.520
And we'll just say, yes.

42
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.683
And this just gonna check all the built-in
libraries and libraries that are installed

43
00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:26.260
on our current operating system, and
just bring them up to the latest version.

44
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.501
We want to do that first because if we
do it after we install the software,

45
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.710
it could turn out to breaking
change somewhere along the way.

46
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.900
So we do this the first thing we do is
make sure all our software is up to date.

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.920
That way later down the line, we can just
iterate and not have to worry about it.

48
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.120
The good news is we generally
only have to do this once.

49
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.473
Later in the course, we'll figure out how
to do this automatically, unattended,

50
00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:51.530
which will be nice.

51
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.080
So you're probably going to
run into something like this.

52
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000
It's going to throw up a window saying,
hey, there's a newer version.

53
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.845
We're just going to keep
the local version installed,

54
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:02.470
because the local version works, and
we don't really want to mess with it.

55
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.089
So we'll just say, OK.

56
00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:13.030
And pending kernel upgrade.

57
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.176
Remember we talked about
what the kernel is,

58
00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.990
that's the second lowest
layer between the hardware.

59
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.420
So the kernel talks to the hardware.

60
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.718
So we'll just say okay,
not much else we can do here.

61
00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.140
And we're just gonna restart
all the services by default.

62
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.749
So we're just going to scroll down.

63
00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:36.296
And tab to move to the OK.

64
00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:39.528
If you get stuck, it'll say OK.

65
00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:41.970
I usually don't mess with it too much.

66
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.036
It works just fine.

67
00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.750
So hopefully, all your upgrades ran fine.

68
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.257
There's no issues.

69
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.560
So next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna restart the computer.

70
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.005
So we're gonna shut down, but
we need to say want to shut down when.

71
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.787
If we just say shut down,
it'll say by default scheduled it for

72
00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:11.200
a day in advance because assuming you
don't want to pull the plug immediately

73
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.460
it's not something you do very
often on a server naturally.

74
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.508
So we want to say shut down right now,
but we want to make sure we restart it.

75
00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:22.060
So the -r will let us restart.

76
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.050
So I'm going to hit that is going to take
me from the server because it's rebooting.

77
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.230
And it'll take a few seconds
to come back online.

78
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.487
But when it does, we'll have a nice
clean install with the latest libraries,

79
00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:35.570
and hopefully nothing broke along the way.

80
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.942
I don't think so, but you just don't
know you saw those packages and

81
00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:40.450
commands being run.

82
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.730
You never know when somebody's
gonna go a little bit aray.

83
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.880
If so, we can probably get you back.

84
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.135
Now if you forget the -r,

85
00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:50.820
you can always manage your server from
the control panel in DigitalOcean.

86
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.170
You can bring it up,
bring it down from there.

87
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.140
But we try to do as much as
possible from the command line.

88
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.240
So I'm gonna ssh back in.

89
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.530
Nope, still not up.

90
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.990
So still coming back online.

91
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.980
&gt;&gt; I connected through New York.

92
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.141
New York has rebooted already so just FYI.

93
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:11.032
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; New York is faster and SFO is backup.
