00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.169
So we've made it.

2
00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.135
We've navigated through the terminal.

3
00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:06.370
We learned how to edit a file in Vim.

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.233
We learned how to edit our shell
configuration and kind of what shells are.

5
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.569
Now let's dive into I
won't say the meat and

6
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.172
potatoes because I feel
like it's a little bit.

7
00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:19.155
Let's dive into the core of really
what we wanna do is we wana talk about

8
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.109
service today.

9
00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.051
So let's understand what is the server,
and I'm gonna talk about cloud computing.

10
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.189
We're gonna talk about a VPS.

11
00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.059
Let's talk about operating systems
which we just touched on a little bit.

12
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.930
And then we're gonna talk about SSH,
one of the coolest,

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.046
most important things you
probably don't know enough about.

14
00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:37.850
And we're also gonna talk about hashing,

15
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.666
because you can't talk about SSH
without talking about hashing.

16
00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:47.843
Alright so, what is a server?

17
00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:52.429
You've all heard of it surely, it doesn't
matter if your first time using computer

18
00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.635
you've been doing this for 50 years.

19
00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.245
Everybody's heard of a server.

20
00:00:56.245 --> 00:00:58.124
So, what is a server?

21
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.927
&gt;&gt; A program that is listening for inputs
that may or may not come over the network.

22
00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:10.112
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.

23
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:16.015
&gt;&gt; Or even a computer that hosts
an application that listens for inputs.

24
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:18.293
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that too.

25
00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:21.537
There's a
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the chat.

26
00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:29.175
&gt;&gt; A computer that serves content,
it serves a request.

27
00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:34.636
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everybody said the right answer.

28
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.251
That's all it does it serves requests.

29
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:40.244
That's it,
there's nothing magical about that.

30
00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:43.231
It's more of a concept than anything.

31
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:48.383
But really, anything can be a server,
literally anything my phone, my computer.

32
00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:52.585
If it's a computer, I can make it a server
because I can just make the computer

33
00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:55.120
respond to some sort of
formulated requests.

34
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.278
However, when we think about servers,
we think, dedicated hardware and

35
00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.586
there's a lot of reasons why
to have a dedicated hardware.

36
00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:06.849
Servers run on different chipsets than
the one we use on our computers, and

37
00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.030
that's for
a variety of reasons like virtualization,

38
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.223
which we'll talk about when
we get to cloud computing.

39
00:02:13.223 --> 00:02:17.981
Efficiency, they're generally more
efficient than your home computers.

40
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:22.971
But that's why server chip can cost 1000s
of dollars versus that's how much my

41
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:24.475
entire computer costs.

42
00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:28.654
Servers need to be
available 100% of the time.

43
00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:31.396
So, yeah, in the next exercise,

44
00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:35.663
we're gonna write a home
server here pretty simple.

45
00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:38.486
We're gonna use Node and you'll say like,
why can't we just do that?

46
00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:40.603
Why can't I build a web
page based off of that?

47
00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.513
Well, what happens when you close your
laptop and you go home for the day?

48
00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:48.061
Your webpage goes down,
probably not a good idea.

49
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.575
So, when we think servers we
think dedicated hardware,

50
00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:55.321
it has to be available 100%
of the time to other devices.

51
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.566
These are kind of the rules of what
makes a server versus what's just my

52
00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.173
machine responding to requests.

53
00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:04.111
So for this one, this exercise,

54
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:08.456
we're gonna make a really simple server
receiving the call it simple server.

55
00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:12.051
We're gonna use Node.JS, and
it's gonna be running on port 3000.

56
00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:16.211
And if you're like, I don't know how
to make a server, Jem, don't worry,

57
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.710
we're gonna walk through
this one together.

58
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.846
I have all the code here.

59
00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.411
And this is all the code you
need to create a server,

60
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:26.361
probably even less because of the console
log in there we don't need the port.

61
00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:34.290
But so open vi create a file
called simple server.js.

62
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.161
And you can type all this out,
and then I will type it out and

63
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:41.736
then we're gonna learn how
to run the server itself.

64
00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:45.455
We might need some homebrew, we might need
some Node.JS, but it's all part of the fun
