1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.846
We're gonna use something
called a firewall.

2
00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:08.204
And a firewall, this is the long
definition from Cisco, but

3
00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:11.406
it essentially applies rules and says,
you're allowed, you're not allowed.

4
00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:14.647
You're allowed, you're not allowed.

5
00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:15.737
And we can open and

6
00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:20.558
close these ports at will based on what
we need the rules we need to access them.

7
00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:26.500
Fortunately for our case,
we only need a few ports open and

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.515
even better, we can use a really nice
piece of software, which is called ufw.

9
00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:38.465
I made a typo there,
it is the uncomplicated firewall,

10
00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.162
[LAUGH] not the complicated firewall.

11
00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:45.524
So, we need something called ufw,
which is uncomplicated firewall.

12
00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:50.080
In the old days you had to do things like
IP tables, and you had to run these really

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.304
long commands and they're very esoteric
and didn't make a lot of sense.

14
00:00:54.304 --> 00:01:00.122
Ufw is a pleasure to use, it's very,
very easy to use, I would say.

15
00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.861
It's something that historically
used to be hard and

16
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:08.776
the commands we're going to use is
ufw allow, ufw deny, ufw reject.

17
00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:12.387
So, it makes it really easy
to manage your firewalls.

18
00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:13.708
And if you're like me, you're saying,

19
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.304
what's the difference between deny and
reject?

20
00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.315
Those seem like the same concepts.

21
00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:23.298
Well, reject it'll tell you
that it's rejecting you.

22
00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:26.664
So if you try to connect to my ports,
it's not open.

23
00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:30.943
My firewall will say hey you're blocked,
you're not allowed to go in there.

24
00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:35.338
Versus reject won't tell you anything,
it'll just be silent and

25
00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:37.308
that's something you want.

26
00:01:37.308 --> 00:01:40.525
We talked in a previous
section about DDOS attacks and

27
00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:45.459
amplification attacks things like that,
well, it's possible that someone can

28
00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.408
still overload your system by forcing you
to send a bunch of reject error packets.

29
00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:54.066
They DDOS you hard enough cuz your
system still has to respond to that.

30
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.269
Versus, if we just say reject
everything else, it'll never respond.

31
00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.488
People won't even know
your server is there.

32
00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:02.459
And that's usually what
we tend to go with,

33
00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.726
unless we're explicitly trying to
tell people that the port is denied.

34
00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:12.752
So, let's go ahead and use ufw,
because we wanna close that port 3,000,

35
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:15.786
it's doesn't need to
be open on our server.

36
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:24.070
So the first thing you wanna do
is you wanna sudo ufw the status.

37
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.985
And it's likely if you're using
the default installation that the status

38
00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.193
is disabled,
because we didn't turn it on yet.

39
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.359
And that's what we'll do in the last step.

40
00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.186
But the first thing we wanna do is we
wanna allow ufw take over management of

41
00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:41.839
our firewall, because right now
it's just done an IP config tables.

42
00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.905
So, we're gonna say sudo a lot,
ufw allow ssh.

43
00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:50.870
That's obvious,
we want sudo to allow http, also obvious.

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.047
And then we're gonna turn on the firewall,
that's it.

45
00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:59.779
So go ahead and try that.

46
00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.804
&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't you allow
htttps instead of http?

47
00:03:04.804 --> 00:03:09.244
&gt;&gt; Good question, the question was, why
wouldn't we allow https instead of http?

48
00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:14.183
We haven't set up https,
we will, that's the fun part.

49
00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.814
But right now, we don't have it,
it doesn't exist.

50
00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:20.038
We don't have certificates,
it's not configured in NGINX.

51
00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:25.168
So, we just have a port open for no reason
at this point, we will later, though.

52
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.793
Alright let me go ahead and

53
00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:38.640
try this out stay clear and
sudo ufw status.

54
00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:43.109
Yeah, it's not running yet.

55
00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.984
So, let's allow it to let me set
up the rules before I enable it.

56
00:03:47.984 --> 00:03:54.311
Say allow ssh updated for ipv4 and ipv6.

57
00:03:54.311 --> 00:04:00.128
So, I'm gonna say sudo allow,

58
00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:04.012
sudo ufw allow http.

59
00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:10.998
Oops, typo, all right, and
that's kinda all we need right now.

60
00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:17.812
So, we'll say sudo ufw and

61
00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:24.040
we're gonna enable it.

62
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.836
All right, and
hopefully you didn't skip that ssh step.

63
00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:35.032
Otherwise, you're in
a bad time at this point.

64
00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:36.929
You may have locked yourself
out of your server.

65
00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:39.834
So, I probably should have
hit that a little harder.

66
00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:43.719
But [LAUGH] make sure you don't close
off the one port you need to connect to.

67
00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:50.248
But you're probably okay it's pretty,

68
00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:56.737
ufw is a lot easier to use than
some of the other tools we used to,

69
00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:01.399
and I think we can say
sudo ufw lists try that.

70
00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:08.442
Enable, denable.

71
00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.151
Wow, so I see a ufw status.

72
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.567
Yeah, there it's showing we have port 22.

73
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:19.668
Port 80 open for ipv four, ipv 6.

74
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:23.013
Easy, pease,
this used to be very very difficult.

75
00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:28.405
I'm glossing over the benefits of
technology in modern software these days.

76
00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.298
This used to be something
that only experts could do,

77
00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.883
which is modify your
firewall configuration.

78
00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:41.116
Ok, so our firewall setup that's great,
what else can we do?

79
00:05:41.116 --> 00:05:44.424
Well, if we ever needed to
block all http connections, for

80
00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:46.352
instance, when we enable https.

81
00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:50.423
We probably want to disable
http in general or not,

82
00:05:50.423 --> 00:05:53.275
sometimes you want it to redirect.

83
00:05:53.275 --> 00:05:56.147
We can talk a bit more about
redirection in a few minutes.

84
00:05:56.147 --> 00:06:02.308
But If you want it to,
you can reject all http connections.

85
00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:06.353
But I'll say once I'll say it again,
do not close port 22.

86
00:06:06.353 --> 00:06:12.496
You will be in a bad place if you do that.

87
00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:14.775
So that's the uncomplicated firewall,

88
00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:17.513
it lives up to its name
it's very uncomplicated.
