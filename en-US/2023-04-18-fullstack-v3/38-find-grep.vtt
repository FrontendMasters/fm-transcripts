00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:05.008
So, we talked about redirection, we talked
about the power of standard streams,

2
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.629
standard in, standard out, standard
error all functions like these makes it

3
00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.958
really easy to chain things together.

4
00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.970
And we learned what is this do, foo &gt; bar.

5
00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:22.528
Next, let's talk about finding things, you
see me grep a few things here and there,

6
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:26.444
grep is one of my favorite commands
because it can make sense of really,

7
00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:27.705
really large output.

8
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:31.647
Earlier, we tried to play around with AWK,
AWK, that gets a little tedious,

9
00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:35.373
you've probably heard Aachen said
those are really powerful commands.

10
00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:39.858
But I don't think we're gonna dive
into them this class because they're

11
00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:44.339
a little bit tricky, but we are gonna
use find, we are gonna use grep, and

12
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.035
we'll see how powerful these tools can be.

13
00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:53.468
So, find the syntax, looks a little
strange, but once you're you

14
00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:58.354
understand it's find, where to look,
what exactly you're looking on?

15
00:00:58.354 --> 00:00:58.954
Is it a name?

16
00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:00.012
Is it a file?

17
00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:03.833
And then where to look, see,
find actually is pretty accessible.

18
00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:09.210
And this is a good slide to keep as
a reference, because it's not really

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.921
intuitive to remember these off top your
head unless you're doing them constantly.

20
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.084
But this is the syntax, find,

21
00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:22.195
where you're looking,
what you're looking for

22
00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:27.925
,and then what particular
are you looking in exactly?

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.208
Let's try it out.

24
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:41.094
So, can you find all
the log files in /var/log?

25
00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:43.763
We talked about all the log files,
when you look in there you will

26
00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:46.643
see how many there actually is,
remember, most things you logged.

27
00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.809
Star logged star.

28
00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.835
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, let me try that, does it work?

29
00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:01.559
The great thing about finding things,
and if you can't get it right,

30
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.122
you're not gonna break anything.

31
00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.180
&gt;&gt; It's a read only operation.

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.877
&gt;&gt; And that's how you do it, find,
we're finding, where are we looking?

33
00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:14.638
Slash for our log, the type,
dash type, we use f for file,

34
00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:19.307
we're looking for
things with the name of star.log, but

35
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:24.470
you probably ran into an issue,
what's the issue you ran into?

36
00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:29.756
Actually, I already know
what issue you ran into, but

37
00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:31.712
that was a rhetorical question.

38
00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:35.389
So, you probably ran into an issue
with this command, let's find out why.

39
00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.090
So, clear, so we'll go before,

40
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.208
find/ var/ log, and I'm looking for files.

41
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:47.722
So, type f -name.

42
00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:52.812
So we start out log, so
I want everything that ends in a log.

43
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.811
Mm-hm, that's okay, but I'm still
getting permission denied, why is that?

44
00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:04.148
&gt;&gt; Sudo find.

45
00:03:04.148 --> 00:03:07.194
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't sudo it, however,

46
00:03:07.194 --> 00:03:13.206
here is a very handy shortcut that I
use all the time, if we just say sudo!!

47
00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:22.849
It will rerun that command as sudo, and
that's a nice shortcut I use all the time.

48
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.029
Sudo(!!) It just runs the last command in
your history with the sudo applied to it.

49
00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.154
So, that way you don't have to
go through and retype sudo and

50
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:33.518
the whole command again.

51
00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:38.381
So, we found all the log files, and we
learned how to use the sudo(!!) command,

52
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.792
you'll use that way more than you think.

53
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.690
So next, can we find all
directories with the name log?

54
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.919
I'm just saying log cuz I know there's
a lot of manual default installation.

55
00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.709
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's try that one.

56
00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.403
Say find / -type, so

57
00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:04.377
the slash is?

58
00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.018
&gt;&gt; Roots.

59
00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:10.289
&gt;&gt; Roots, that's right, so we're looking
at the very top level of our file system,

60
00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.545
type is d for directory,
just anything named log.

61
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.180
Oops, forgot the name.

62
00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:34.358
Name log, we get a lot of permission
denied because, again, you,

63
00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:37.691
generally, don't wanna
be sniffing around root,

64
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:42.709
the file system doesn't like it, you
don't need to be in most of these paths.

65
00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.774
But if you really,
really wanna look, pseudo bang bang.

66
00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:54.340
Yeah, so funny thing,
it's just part of just muscle memory,

67
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.667
it's not that difficult, it looks like
it's more complicated than it is, you just

68
00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:04.947
have to remember to find where that type
of thing you're looking for, that's it.

69
00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:10.166
So, next we'll try a grep,

70
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:14.677
find is the where something is,

71
00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:18.697
and grep is looking inside.

72
00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:23.456
So, find will just give you the files,
but grep looks inside the files.

73
00:05:26.614 --> 00:05:30.644
And grep is, grep the option you're
looking for, what expression,

74
00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:34.007
a regular expression you're looking for
and then where?

75
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.621
And bonus are something called zgrep,
which you can look inside the zipped

76
00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:42.549
files, which is pretty awesome too,
you don't have to unzip them to search.

77
00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:50.148
You're like, what's the benefit of this?

78
00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:55.316
Grep is pretty cool, grep is the one
you're probably going to use a lot

79
00:05:55.316 --> 00:06:01.376
more than find, for example, if we wanna
find all of our running node processes.

80
00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:06.210
Try running this command, but
try running it without typing

81
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.756
into grep first, and
see what you see, I'll go ahead and

82
00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:15.321
run that here, ps aux,
that's a lot to cipher through.

83
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.401
I can't read all this, and there's not
even that a lot going on in our system,

84
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:19.300
we're running what?

85
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.121
Engine X and Node,
the only two things we're really running,

86
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:28.112
that's a pain, so
how about if we pipe this into grep, so

87
00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:32.957
when you use that redirection of the pipe,
I'm just gonna say grep.

88
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.397
And I wanna find the node process,

89
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:42.670
there we go, look at that, easy peasy.

90
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.363
And that's why we use grep a lot when you
have this giant output, and you're like,

91
00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:51.404
I just wanna find one thing, we pipe
it to grep to find something for us.

92
00:06:51.404 --> 00:06:55.521
You will use this command quite a lot,
the pipe and the grep, and I'd say grep is

93
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.167
probably a little bit easier for
you to kind of wrap your heads around.

94
00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:03.674
And you can use regular expressions if you
want to get really, really specific, but,

95
00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:08.265
generally, this works, grep whatever thing
I'm looking for, it works pretty well.
