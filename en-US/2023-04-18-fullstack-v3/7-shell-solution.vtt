00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.442
All right,
welcome back how was that exercise?

2
00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:10.202
Maybe we're starting to go into places you
haven't seen before, which is good and

3
00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:14.690
that's the whole point of this course
slowly build up these kind of new areas,

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.127
so that you'll feel a little bit more
comfortable next time it comes around.

5
00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:22.284
And you'll be aware of what's possible.

6
00:00:22.284 --> 00:00:29.453
So let's go ahead, and
I'll walk through how to do the exercise.

7
00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:33.263
So I'm going to go back
to my terminal in item,

8
00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:36.898
gonna type clear,
gonna cd back to my root.

9
00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:42.215
I don't really need to for this case, but
so I need to open my shell configuration.

10
00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:44.421
And which shell am I using?

11
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:48.211
So I'm gonna say echo dollar sign which
tells me my currently running process.

12
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.964
So that tells me I'm using zsh
remember the earlier slides

13
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:56.262
the zsh is located in the dot zsh rc file.

14
00:00:56.262 --> 00:01:05.150
So I'm gonna say vi
-/.zs which one was it?

15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.851
Lemme tab complete, mm-hm there we go,
tab complete it's amazing.

16
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.127
It's like one of the most
best of modern conveniences,

17
00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:15.948
I put it up there sliced bread.

18
00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:19.569
But I don't really have
a lot going on these days.

19
00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:26.287
I'm kidding, I'm kidding [LAUGH] so,
now we're in our zsh file.

20
00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:30.702
And you see a lot of things that
are kind of a little strange.

21
00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:32.422
You're like,
where'd all this stuff come from?

22
00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:33.776
Yours may look different from mine.

23
00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:39.306
It depends on the state of your computer,
the things you installed I use something

24
00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:44.434
called my zsh a very, very popular way
of a default installation for zsh,

25
00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:49.349
it allows you to configure it adds
color and does everything by default.

26
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.170
I have not touched too much of it, so
yours may look a little different.

27
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.050
And you may have some git plugins,
things like that.

28
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.193
But this exercise I just wanna say,
make my shell tell me good morning.

29
00:02:01.193 --> 00:02:03.291
So, what's the command to do that?

30
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:07.015
We said echo, actually lots of space here.

31
00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:13.514
So we say echo, and
I can say good morning.

32
00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:17.662
I'm gonna use one of those reserved words,
we're gonna say good morning user.

33
00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:21.531
That should say good morning to me.

34
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:24.424
So I'm gonna do this the lazy way,
I'm just gonna open a new tab and

35
00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:25.702
see if this works.

36
00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:27.487
And there it goes.

37
00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:32.676
So every time I open a new terminal,
I can make it say, good morning to me.

38
00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:35.839
And I know this is a simplistic example,
but

39
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.797
think of all the possibilities you
can do when you say every time I open

40
00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:44.154
a new terminal I want my
shell to do this for me.

41
00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:50.305
I wanted to check my mail, I don't
know see the status, see the weather.

42
00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:54.721
I wanted to see all the open PRs, you can
make it do a lot of things by default.

43
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.053
So there's a lot of power and
configuring your terminal,

44
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.168
your cell to do kind of what you want.

45
00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:02.380
We won't go very deep into that,

46
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.437
I just want to make you aware that it
is possible and it's pretty fantastic.

47
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.856
If you do wanna go deeper,

48
00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:12.024
there's an entire course on
this on front of the masters.

49
00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.824
There's a meme I'm building here,

50
00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:18.019
there's almost always a course on front of
the masters for anything you wanna learn.

51
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.308
This one is by SubSack,
it's on Bash, Vim, Regex.

52
00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:27.649
There's also one by Brian Holt,
which I will link in a future slides.

53
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:32.204
And there's a link on the side to that
terminal configuration, it's called my

54
00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:36.840
zsh, which is a great, it's just a great
name all around, I highly recommend it.

55
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.689
The defaults are quite good.
