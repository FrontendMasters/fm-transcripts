00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.847
So we understand permissions,
we understand how to set firewalls.

2
00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:05.870
Next, we got to keep our
applications up to date.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.183
One of the biggest source of hacks and

4
00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:12.295
breaches is people that just
simply don't patch their systems.

5
00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.012
And it's kind of wild that,
especially WordPress installations get

6
00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:20.107
hacked all the time and all people have
to do is keep their stuff up to date, but

7
00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:21.871
it's really really easy to get.

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.880
And you know me I'm pretty lazy so

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.914
I wanna do this as easy as possible,
I want my system to do it for me.

10
00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.594
Fortunately if you're getting the kind
of gist of Ubuntu there's always

11
00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:37.564
an apt package to do it for you.

12
00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.436
So we're gonna install
unattended upgrades.

13
00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:45.620
So that will allow the upgrades to run
on the system at a periodic function and

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.243
we don't do anything.

15
00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:51.909
It'll just do it automatically for us,
we just have to configure it a little bit.

16
00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.225
So go ahead and try that out now.

17
00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:58.009
The package might already be installed
depending on your flavor of Linux that

18
00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:59.637
you're using or Ubuntu.

19
00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:00.904
But I like to double check.

20
00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:05.114
So it's sudo apt install
unattended-upgrades.

21
00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:09.029
So hopefully you ran the sudo
apt install unattended-upgrades.

22
00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:10.914
It may have been installed already.

23
00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:12.892
Save yourself from trouble.

24
00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:14.717
But let's go ahead and configure it.

25
00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:16.604
We want it to run at a low priority.

26
00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:19.004
That means we want it to
happen in the background,

27
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.413
whatever the system is not
really doing too much.

28
00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:25.022
So we're gonna use
dpkg-reconfigure just to double

29
00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:29.410
check, So it does

30
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.135
a nice friendly warning sign like applying
updates on a frequent basis is important,

31
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:37.036
blah, blah, blah, blah, just like we're
saying, it's telling you the same thing.

32
00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:39.967
So it's saying automatically
download install stable updates.

33
00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:43.257
So again more the LTS,
which we talked about yesterday.

34
00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:44.886
LTS stands for?

35
00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:46.211
&gt;&gt; Long term support.

36
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:47.619
&gt;&gt; Long term support, that's right.

37
00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.052
So more on the line of these we never want
it to automatically install bleeding edge

38
00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.508
things because they just
haven't been that well tested.

39
00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:56.706
And when it comes to servers you
want things that are well tested,

40
00:01:56.706 --> 00:02:00.441
cuz things that are not well tested tend
to have more errors and bugs in them.

41
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:05.936
So we'll just say yes, And that's it.

42
00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.733
Pretty handy.

43
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.265
Normally before we'd have to
do some sort of cron job,

44
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.251
which we'll talk about in the next
section, what a cron job is.

45
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.643
And it would have to do all this
work we have configured but

46
00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:19.329
as these technologies
advances as Ubuntu and

47
00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.724
APT advance it makes life a lot easier
just like uncomplicated firewall.

48
00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:27.519
So much better,
we're living the dream these days.
