1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.584
So I'm doing a lot of talking,
you're just taking my word for it.

2
00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:07.596
Let's dive into some network tools to
kind of show you the hidden layer.

3
00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:11.581
We're gonna lift up the sheets and
see, what's going on over here?

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:14.231
How does this all connect together?

5
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.538
So the first network tool I
want you to check out is ping.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.467
Ping, and I won't hold the terminal
because these are pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:30.713
There's no flags or anything we're
running other than netstat one.

8
00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:34.466
ping is useful because it tells you,
is the host up or down?

9
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.348
I use ping all the time.

10
00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:40.136
If my Wi-Fi goes out, I'm like,
or if suddenly, I don't know,

11
00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:43.198
the browser is loading slow,
is it the application?

12
00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:44.400
Has my browser locked up?

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.731
Or is it my network itself?

14
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.055
Ping is a really fast way of telling
you if the network's up or down.

15
00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.482
I like Google, Google's almost never down,
at least google.com.

16
00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:57.380
So it's a pretty reliable way of
saying is my network up and down?

17
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.242
And it's very, very lightweight.

18
00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:01.920
So you can ping all day and
won't do anything.

19
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
Fun facts, if you ping
frontendmasters.com it will not respond,

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.555
because they disabled replying to UDP or
ICMP requests.

21
00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:11.479
How dare you, Mark?

22
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.096
[LAUGH] I was talking to Mark,
the CEO of Frontend Masters.

23
00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.439
So you can disable your computer
responding to pings if you want.

24
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.632
I prefer to leave it open.

25
00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.783
It's good to know if
your domain name is down.

26
00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.352
The next tool that is pretty fun,
actually, I'll show you this one.

27
00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:38.449
Cuz this gives you, when we talk
about how does the Internet work,

28
00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.097
this gives you maybe
a stronger idea of it.

29
00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:46.551
So I'm gonna exit my server,
cuz I just left it open, exit, clear.

30
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.989
So we're gonna run traceroutes.

31
00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.010
And this, you may get varying results
depending on where you are in the world

32
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.656
and what your network looks like,
but let's traceroute google.com

33
00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:08.138
So what's happening in traceroute?

34
00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:10.513
Traceroute, actually, as always,

35
00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:14.978
we can man the page first because
it'll give you a better explanation.

36
00:02:14.978 --> 00:02:18.446
But what traceroute does,
oops, what's going on?

37
00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:23.638
Traceroute tells us all of the hops
it takes to get from your computer

38
00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:29.939
all the way to the destination host, and
it prints every single hop along the way.

39
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:38.350
So when we run traceroute to google.com,
We see all the hops.

40
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.590
And we'll talk about why
it pauses in some places.

41
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.870
But right now, what this is telling
me is I have a local IP address.

42
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.296
Remember we talked about the router gives
us a local IP address that allows us

43
00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:51.415
to connect to Internet and
they usually start with 192.168.

44
00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:54.984
So my current IP address is 192.168.3.1.

45
00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:56.555
That's my computer.

46
00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.401
The next hop is going to be
to the modem in this case.

47
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:03.400
So looking at this tells me they probably
have a modem-router combination,

48
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.978
probably just a router and then a modem,
which is pretty common too.

49
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:11.232
And their internet provider is, Cogentco?

50
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.680
I never know how to pronounce that one.

51
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.407
But a pretty common ISP,
one of the bigger ones.

52
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:21.037
So that's connecting to one of the ISPs,
which connects to probably the bigger ISP

53
00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:23.815
of the same name,
which connects to another one,

54
00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.880
which connects to another one,
and so on and so forth.

55
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.864
So we see the hops within just the ISP
taking to get it to the outside world.

56
00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:35.112
And some of these are actually probably,
actually,

57
00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:38.880
you can tell some of these
are co-located by their IP blocks.

58
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.775
And I can tell you just looking at
this that Cogentco owns 154.54.

59
00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.898
They own that entire block address,
cuz they are an ISP and

60
00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:50.439
they hand out IP addresses.

61
00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:56.235
The second column is how
long it took to respond.

62
00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.673
So that tells me how far away they are,
how fast and how busy they are.

63
00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:05.869
And then, again, I'm telling you,
I can see all this stuff by traceroute.

64
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.207
So we keep going,
we keep going, we keep going.

65
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.782
We are finally out of our ISP.

66
00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:14.568
It's made ten hops to get
out from the internal block.

67
00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:16.509
Now, we're on something else.

68
00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.325
I don't know what as6453.net is, but

69
00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.673
it's probably a backbone in the Internet
if we wanted to look it up.

70
00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:26.841
It looks like it's in New York,
interesting.

71
00:04:29.358 --> 00:04:34.354
And then these along the way are just
routers, maybe some other ISP,

72
00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:39.193
maybe some backbones,
maybe some Level 3 networking services.

73
00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:46.036
But it's fascinating that we'll hop, we'll
hop, we'll hop, we'll hop, we'll hop, and

74
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:51.155
then we'll get to, Probably about here.

75
00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:54.318
Here is probably where
Google's data center starts.

76
00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:58.938
We can tell because the IP addresses
underneath start to come from the same

77
00:04:58.938 --> 00:04:59.467
block.

78
00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:04.003
So that tells me we're kind of
narrowing in on the same location,

79
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.739
on the same data center.

80
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:10.654
So we hop, we hop, we hop, we hop,
and then we finally get to our

81
00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:15.938
destination IP address, which is
the IP address of probably the load

82
00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:21.245
balancer with the server cluster
that's serving out google.com.

83
00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:22.454
So that's pretty cool.

84
00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:24.839
You see how complex the Internet is?

85
00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.225
And it took 20 hops just from my
computer to talk to google.com.

86
00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:32.184
So that diagram that I showed
earlier of the different hops,

87
00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:33.758
that was a simplified diagram.

88
00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:35.714
Some of these hops can take 30, 40,

89
00:05:35.714 --> 00:05:38.144
50 hops sometimes to get
to where we're going.

90
00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:41.854
If we're trying to get to, say,
an IP address in another country,

91
00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:45.710
you will see a lot of hops and you will
see the latency go up and up and up.

92
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.233
But I really like traceroute,

93
00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:50.112
because it can tell you where
the problem is in your stack.

94
00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:54.477
So let's say you can't connect to Internet
or you can't connect to your domain or

95
00:05:54.477 --> 00:05:55.243
your server.

96
00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:59.329
You ping it, it doesn't respond, but your
network is actually online of some sort,

97
00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:01.443
or maybe your network is not and
it's slow.

98
00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:04.967
You can use traceroute and
figure out what's the slow part.

99
00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:08.323
Maybe it's actually my ISP, and
it's timing out at one of these blocks,

100
00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:10.071
which tells you it's not your fault.

101
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.790
Or maybe it's Google.

102
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.624
When you get to Goggle, they have
a problem with their data set, and

103
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.737
you'll see the latency
jump up there too as well.

104
00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:20.156
So again, traceroute and ping and
network tools are good for

105
00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:22.580
uncovering what's going on in the world.

106
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.382
And if you're really a network admin or
DevOps, you know these tools pretty well,

107
00:06:26.382 --> 00:06:28.956
they're very useful,
they're pretty simple to use.

108
00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:37.849
Last but not least is, this will by
far give you the most verbose output,

109
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.746
and that's netstat.

110
00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:43.100
So netstat tells you all of the things
that are happening on your computer.

111
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.107
All of the open ports, all of the IP
addresses you are connected to,

112
00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:51.343
all the processes that are running
just internally on your local host.

113
00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:58.256
So if you just did netstat, [SOUND] you
will get blown away by all of the data.

114
00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.772
So not super useful to do it in the raw.

115
00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:07.309
But you can see all the processes that
are running on all the open ports.

116
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:13.684
Let's see if we can get, DNS responder,
I can see my VPN is running.

117
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:16.568
We have UDP and TCP,
which we're gonna talk about in a second.

118
00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:21.138
You see all these local host ports
are just local processes that open

119
00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:23.475
a port to talk to other processes.

120
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:26.269
I don't know I have iPhone,
I don't own an iPhone, but

121
00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:29.491
it's probably something to do with iOS and
the way it's named.

122
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:33.756
So netstat tells you everything that's
going on your computer related to

123
00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:34.589
networking.

124
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:36.857
Not super useful, I mean,
it is useful, but

125
00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:39.508
let's make this information
a little bit clearer.

126
00:07:39.508 --> 00:07:43.483
Let's run netstat-lt.

127
00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:46.194
I'm gonna pipe it into less.

128
00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.249
Less displays my pages one at a time.

129
00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:51.552
It's a very, very convenient way of
displaying a lot of information,

130
00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.868
whereas cat just dumps the entire file,
not super useful in this case.

131
00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:01.670
So now, netstat-lt tells me
just my TCP connections and

132
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.605
some of my local host connections.

133
00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:08.728
So this makes it a little bit easier to
reason about what's going on my computer.

134
00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:11.828
And I still have a lot of these,
because your computer is always open.

135
00:08:11.828 --> 00:08:15.589
These ports are always open,
talking to each other.

136
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:19.160
And don't ask me what some of these do,
I'm not that good.

137
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.106
I'm not an expert at
the OSX operating system.

138
00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:25.779
But it's just fascinating to know
all this stuff is going on and

139
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:27.551
it's hidden from you in the background.
