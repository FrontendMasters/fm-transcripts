1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.607
What does it mean to be
a Full Stack engineer?

2
00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:05.201
Anybody?

3
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:06.412
Take a stab at it.

4
00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:14.005
&gt;&gt; Having like full responsibility for
data input,

5
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.492
handling and representation to the user.

6
00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:22.036
&gt;&gt; Yeah, full responsibility for
data input, and data, yeah I like that.

7
00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.748
Any other interpretations?

8
00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.113
&gt;&gt; One who can do a bit of everything.

9
00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:34.165
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Generalist.

10
00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:37.468
&gt;&gt; Proficient in all aspects
of modern computing.

11
00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:41.600
&gt;&gt; I like the proficient,
but I'll be honest,

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.927
it is almost impossible to be really
really good at all these things.

13
00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:52.245
Almost every topic here is so nuanced and
has so much complexity underlying it that

14
00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:55.249
your best chance is to understand
all these systems, and

15
00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:56.830
be able to put them together.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.721
But to be called an expert or anything
like that is very difficult proposition.

17
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.281
There's probably only a few people in the
world who have that level of expertise.

18
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.185
And again, that's okay,
that's totally okay.

19
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.087
I just want you all to understand
how all these systems tie together.

20
00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:16.099
Take the interesting parts for yourself,
but if nothing else, by the end,

21
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.300
you will be familiar.

22
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.208
And when you see these concepts in terms,
you'll be like, okay.

23
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:23.230
I don't necessarily remember
how to implement it myself, but

24
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.997
I remember I've done it before, and

25
00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:28.431
I understand how they work and
the role they play in the broader system.

26
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.770
And someone said generalists,
that's what I like.

27
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.085
I like that term generalists, someone
that can do a little bit of everything.

28
00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:39.166
Again, you don't have to be an expert, but
it just means you can put it all together.

29
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.883
&gt;&gt; The Full Stack engineer
can implement and

30
00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:45.306
develop the whole life cycle
of the web app website.

31
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.539
Jack of all trades Master of None.

32
00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.208
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Full Stack engineer is someone who

33
00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.256
builds a complete working app

34
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.576
Full Stack technology refers to the entire
depth of a computer system application.

35
00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:10.172
And Full Stack web developers
are those who are capable

36
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.624
of developing both frontend and
backend of the web.

37
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:20.014
A Swiss Army coder.

38
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:24.568
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Someone who can understand the big

39
00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:29.468
picture and uncover all that was needed
to deliver the software alone or entity.

40
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:35.455
Having an understanding of
all pieces of the stack

41
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:41.868
Is a tongue in cheek one in here someone
who can barely put together half

42
00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:45.709
working software
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true too.

43
00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.972
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The entire IT department.

44
00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:55.088
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So
say IT is different from Full Stack,

45
00:02:55.088 --> 00:03:01.428
but there's some overlap
there suprissingly enough.

46
00:03:01.428 --> 00:03:05.438
Those are all good answers I still
like the generalist jack of all

47
00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:07.226
trades with Army Knife etc.

48
00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:10.942
Because it emphasizes the point that you
don't have to be an expert all these

49
00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:11.473
systems.

50
00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:13.217
You're not gonna be an expert
in all these systems.

51
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:16.059
But you just need to understand
how they fit together, and

52
00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.199
then find out who to talk to you
when you do need an expert system.

53
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.520
So what is Full Stack engineer?

54
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.349
What is a stack?

55
00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.839
Don't worry I won't talk to the audience
because who knows where we're gonna go

56
00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:29.513
with that one.

57
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:34.537
But a stack I generally consider
is some sort of user interface.

58
00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:37.267
Otherwise, what are you building,

59
00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:40.977
if people can't interact with it,
a web server.

60
00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:45.906
If we're talking specifically about web
applications here which we are, a database

61
00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:50.630
of some kind, the operating system,
something a lot of people don't consider,

62
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.847
we just take for granted,
but they exist, on every UI,

63
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:58.732
there's some sort of operating system
underneath it, and an application server.

64
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:02.425
Application server depends on the stack,
whether or not you need one.

65
00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:05.938
But I consider this a pretty
good definition of a stack.

66
00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:08.221
But again, the term will vary wildly.

67
00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:12.401
There's a few popular stacks.

68
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:16.659
You may have heard of the LAMP
stack anybody, LAMP stack?

69
00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.649
Yeah, funny enough,
the most popular stack in the world.

70
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.287
But a lot of frontend engineers are like,
what's Apache?

71
00:04:25.287 --> 00:04:27.578
What's PHP?

72
00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:29.512
PHP, what's my SQL?

73
00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:32.626
Generally considered
a WordPress stack which again I

74
00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:36.574
think a lot of us writing code in
our day to day writing react forget.

75
00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:40.503
WordPress is still by far the most
popular way of creating a web page on

76
00:04:40.503 --> 00:04:41.395
the internet.

77
00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:45.975
There's the MEAN stack, Mongo,
Express, Angular, Node.JS.

78
00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:50.624
There's the MERN stack which is probably
a little bit newer Mongo, Express,

79
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.829
React, Node.JS.

80
00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:58.891
You're saying Jem how did these cool names
like MEAN and MERN come about marketing.

81
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.770
No, I'm joking, but
like, I'm also serious.

82
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.238
These stacks are kind of arbitrary.

83
00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.620
The names they put together are arbitrary.

84
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.534
It's really about marketers,
developer advocates,

85
00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:14.370
fanboys putting together these terms.

86
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.175
So if someone is like, You're not using
the MEAN stack, don't, bother with them.

87
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:22.525
It doesn't matter what your stack is
really, as long as you're familiar with it

88
00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:25.894
and you're comfortable and there's
a million different acronyms we can make.

89
00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:30.652
So generally a good, not a good, but
a common friend in stack is Reacts,

90
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:31.906
NodeJS and Redis.

91
00:05:31.906 --> 00:05:36.808
That's fairly popular one.

92
00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:39.785
Another one that may be
a little less popular, or

93
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:44.664
at least that a lot of people haven't
heard of is Angular, Tomcat, and MySQL.

94
00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.908
Anybody heard of Tomcat?

95
00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:47.636
&gt;&gt; No.

96
00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.832
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what is it?

97
00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:50.717
&gt;&gt; Web server.

98
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.334
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

99
00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:51.864
&gt;&gt; Basically.

100
00:05:51.864 --> 00:05:57.025
&gt;&gt; For Java yeah, very popular
application server or web server.

101
00:05:57.025 --> 00:06:00.553
But Friend Engineers, we probably haven't
heard about that because we consider that

102
00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:02.208
a backend thing, but it's really not.

103
00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:04.164
It's powering our websites.

104
00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:11.649
Then there's an interesting, one Vue,
Apache and Postgres all right?

105
00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:14.889
So again, it doesn't really
matter what your stack is.

106
00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.045
So you say Full Stack I'm not referring
to any particular set of technologies.

107
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:20.150
It's whatever you're comfortable with and

108
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.195
whatever the people you're working
with are comfortable with,

109
00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:26.697
that you can cobble together and
make an application that's good enough.

110
00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:32.378
So, a Full Stack Engineer is just an
engineer who can manage both the frontend

111
00:06:32.378 --> 00:06:34.125
and the backend of an application.

112
00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.733
Someone that can tie it all together,

113
00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:37.901
someone that understands
how those systems work.

114
00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:42.848
That's it, nothing super spicy or
worthy of Twitter, unfortunately,

115
00:06:42.848 --> 00:06:45.340
unlike some of the responses we got.
