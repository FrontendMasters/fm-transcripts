WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.006
So next we're gonna change the file
permission authorized keys,

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.776
ssh will complain over time because it's
very particular about the permissions.

3
00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:08.994
We're gonna change it to 644.

4
00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:11.549
Then we're gonna disable our root login.

5
00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.982
And then we're gonna
restart the ssh daemon.

6
00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:17.890
So why do we disable our root login?

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.738
I will show you.

8
00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.840
I have gone on about it, but
I wanna demonstrate this.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.742
So we're gonna say sudo Slash cat again,
slash var.

10
00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:30.988
And we're gonna take
a look at the auth log.

11
00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.979
So remember,
logs live at /var/log/auth.log here.

12
00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:41.168
And we can say auth.log,
Then you put in your password.

13
00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:48.042
So what's going on in the world today?

14
00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:53.689
So auth.log is gonna say, hey,
what's going on in our system?

15
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:58.595
And this is not,
it's hard to read when it's so zoomed in.

16
00:00:58.595 --> 00:00:59.828
But auth.log just says,

17
00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:02.972
hey, who's trying to connect to
our system and what's going on?

18
00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:07.649
And already this brand new server
barely connected to the internet,

19
00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.270
doesn't do anything.

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.782
What do you see in your auth log?

21
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:14.483
&gt;&gt; Invalid user.

22
00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:15.281
Trying to connect.

23
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:16.643
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

24
00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.164
You see a lot of,
you might see random usernames.

25
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:20.751
They're guessing commonly used.

26
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.506
Usernames see a lot for
root cuz that's pretty common.

27
00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:28.559
Where's a good one here.

28
00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:34.242
Invalid user called user.

29
00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:37.508
So the minute you bring
a server online into the world.

30
00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:40.412
People are gonna try to connect into it.

31
00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:45.014
Over time you'll see this grow, you'll
see various different types of exploits

32
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:49.291
trying to be applied common passwords,
common usernames, common ports.

33
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.552
So I talk a lot about security, I spent a
long time on it probably not enough time,

34
00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:57.331
honestly, because this is the reality
of the world you're living in.

35
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.802
Everybody is trying to
get into your system, and

36
00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:03.731
if you give them even a little bit,
they will take over, and then it's gone.

37
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.332
The only way you can solve that is
to delete your system entirely,

38
00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:08.858
which sometimes, if they get far enough,
you can't even do.

39
00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:10.657
You've lost control of your system.

40
00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:12.636
Hence, SSH keys.

41
00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:13.618
No passwords.

42
00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:16.610
We're gonna disable root login,
just to be sure,

43
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.104
cuz we don't ever ever need to
be logged in as root anymore.

44
00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:24.268
I found that SSH authorized keys
was already there and maybe there.

45
00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:27.321
It kind of depends on how
you set up the system.

46
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:29.594
If you follow those same steps,
it's never been there for me.

47
00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:34.234
I've always had to create it but Again,
there's so many things going on.

48
00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:38.581
It's possible you did something a little
bit different this time around,

49
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:43.483
maybe use a different operating system or
a different version, or something else.

50
00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:46.062
&gt;&gt; Still logged in as root possibly?

51
00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:47.748
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're like this route,

52
00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:50.175
that authorized keys file
will probably be there.

53
00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:54.045
So you need to switch to the user you
actually need otherwise none of this

54
00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:54.701
will work.

55
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.817
You'll just be logging in.

56
00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:58.079
You're just like saying the same
information that's already there.

57
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:01.720
Yeah, good.

58
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.663
Good call there Kyle.

59
00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:10.136
So the next thing we wanna do is we wanna
change the permissions of the authorized

60
00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:10.847
keys files.

61
00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:14.716
Otherwise when we restart the ssh daemon,
the thing the process that's actually

62
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.866
listening for ssh connections,
it's probably gonna complain.

63
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:22.139
So we're gonna use something
called chmod change.

64
00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:28.241
Actually, we meant chmod
change file mode bits, yes.

65
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:35.073
So remember we said ls-
la shows the permissions.

66
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.228
So these are the actual permissions for
the files.

67
00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:42.422
Read, RS stands for read,
write sensor right x stands for

68
00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:46.703
execute but there's different levels,
there's route,

69
00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:50.812
there's anybody and
then there's the user itself, and

70
00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:55.793
I forget the actual order cuz we'll
cover permissions a little bit.

71
00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:56.966
Let it on the road but

72
00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.693
chmod is just saying we're changing
the bits of access to that.

73
00:04:00.693 --> 00:04:05.124
So in this case,
we're gonna say chmod 644 and

74
00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:08.403
I don't think we need sudo for this.

75
00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:11.309
Yeah, we don't need sudo for this, and

76
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.511
we're just gonna change
the permissions on the ssh file.

77
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:18.982
Actually we're diving into that just
to check all the permissions here.

78
00:04:26.457 --> 00:04:31.200
Clear ls- la, so I'll take a look,

79
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.485
right, so it's chmod 644 and

80
00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:40.704
then we're doing the authorized keys.

81
00:04:40.704 --> 00:04:43.519
Now let's do ls -la.

82
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:47.677
Okay, so we see we've changed the,
it's never executable,

83
00:04:47.677 --> 00:04:51.765
authorized_keys will never be
executed it's not a script.

84
00:04:51.765 --> 00:04:56.878
So all we did by change the permissions
we just flipped a few more bits saying,

85
00:04:56.878 --> 00:05:00.349
we are the only ones allowed
to write to it are using.

86
00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.229
Everyone else can read from it that's
totally fine, any process, any

87
00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.591
system can read from it, but we're doing
once you're allowed to read through it.

88
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:07.973
And that's what we did with 644.

89
00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:12.311
We'll talk a bit more about permissions,
the numbers don't line up the way you

90
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.048
think, it's not like
a straight forward thing.

91
00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.489
It's just something we had to do for
this html,

92
00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:21.404
the next thing we wanna do is what do we
say, we wanna disable the root login.

93
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.530
So now we're gonna look at our ssh_config.

94
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.504
So config and files, when we get to ngnx,
it's always gonna live under the /etc.

95
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:35.784
So let's go ahead and check that out.

96
00:05:35.784 --> 00:05:37.461
However, we do need to be sudo.

97
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:42.107
Anything in etc is gonna need to be
sudo cuz we're messing with things now,

98
00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.600
getting real serious.

99
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.633
So I'm gonna say, sudo vi/etc/ssh, and

100
00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:53.530
we want the sshd so that's the ssh daemon,

101
00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.618
the process that's running,
we want the config file there.

102
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:16.799
First diver.

103
00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:21.394
All right, so there's a few parts of this
whole process where I say if you touch

104
00:06:21.394 --> 00:06:25.869
things, they can go off the rails very
quickly, you can lock yourself out.

105
00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.654
This is one of these times.

106
00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.682
Try not to mess with the ssh config
file unless you know what you're doing.

107
00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:35.430
There's a reason why we follow these
exact steps for creating the user,

108
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.828
double-checking SEO access, logging out,

109
00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:40.917
making sure we can log in as
the user before we disable root.

110
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:47.116
Because if you can't log in with your new
user and you disable root, what happens?

111
00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:48.439
&gt;&gt; You lose access to your server.

112
00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.631
&gt;&gt; You lose access to your server and
no one can get it back.

113
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:52.759
You have to delete your entire server and
start over.

114
00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.825
So we don't want that.

115
00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:55.322
That's why we follow these very,

116
00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:58.222
very tight steps just to double-check
we're in the right place.

117
00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:00.408
So if you're not there yet,

118
00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:04.792
do not do this step until you
have all the previous steps.

119
00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:10.402
So let's scroll down to PermitRootLogin,

120
00:07:10.402 --> 00:07:13.359
and we're just gonna
edit that file to say no.

121
00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:23.403
No There's a lot of other
fun we can have in here,

122
00:07:23.403 --> 00:07:26.321
we can enforce passwords ssh keys,
you need to have passwords,

123
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.525
we can disable them, we can change
our port, we can do lots of things.

124
00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:35.145
But again, don't mess around in here too
much unless you know what you're doing,

125
00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:38.289
you can put yourself in
a corner very quickly.

126
00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.688
So we're gonna escape.

127
00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:40.810
We're gonna write quit.

128
00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:45.903
But that's not it.

129
00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:48.868
Anytime we change a config for
a daemon, a daemon is an process.

130
00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.113
It's not reading the config file.

131
00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:53.549
It only reads it once at runtime and
then it keeps it in memory.

132
00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:56.328
So we need to restart the ssh process.

133
00:07:56.328 --> 00:08:02.839
So we can say sudo service

134
00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:09.976
sshd restart, all right.

135
00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:12.188
Hopefully you didn't get
kicked out at this point.

136
00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:16.267
If you had kicked out,
something bad happened and I don't know.

137
00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.499
All right, a quick tip if you ever,

138
00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:21.929
I'm tired of suing everything
I really wanna be root.

139
00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:26.478
If you say sudo-i,
you can jump back to root.

140
00:08:26.478 --> 00:08:28.355
So the user is always there,
root is always there.

141
00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:29.803
You can't get rid of it, obviously.

142
00:08:29.803 --> 00:08:34.358
But we don't operate as root most of
the time or actually any of the time.

143
00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:37.713
There are some cases where do you wanna
do is when you're tired of suing, but

144
00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:39.083
I really don't recommend it.

145
00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:43.019
So we'll say exit,
we'll jump back out to our original user.

146
00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:46.458
And let's just test this out just to
be sure that we actually did something.

147
00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:49.305
So I'm going to SSH and exit out.

148
00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:52.514
I'm going to try to log in as roots, and

149
00:08:52.514 --> 00:08:57.489
it should deny me if we did
things correctly, which is good.

150
00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.239
So I'm going to ssh back in.

151
00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:07.864
So if you did something wrong,
you can't log in as root and

152
00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:10.214
you can't log in as your user, it's okay.

153
00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:12.533
Go back through the slides and
the steps and

154
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.433
just follow the steps again
to recreate the server and

155
00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:19.057
bring it back up and double check
every single line you're doing.

156
00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:24.010
This I will say is the most dangerous
part of the course in terms of

157
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.257
where things can go pretty wrong for
you but we're pretty careful.
