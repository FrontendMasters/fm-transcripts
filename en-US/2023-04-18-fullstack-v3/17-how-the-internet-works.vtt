WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:01.401
So we have our server.

2
00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.257
We have our SSH key.

3
00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:04.907
We are now connected to our server.

4
00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:07.474
What we're gonna do next
is we're gonna buy domain.

5
00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:11.419
So if you have a domain, and I know
most of you probably squatting on a few,

6
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.256
that's okay.

7
00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:14.437
If you haven't,
I'm gonna walk-through how to buy one.

8
00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:18.141
And I won't say who to buy it from,
but that's one of my opinion.

9
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.465
And then, we're gonna put all together.

10
00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:22.427
We're gonna connect your
domain to your server.

11
00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:24.097
And then now, now we're cooking.

12
00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:28.197
So now I'm going to roll up my sleeves
because now is where we get really,

13
00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:31.897
really serious before some of
the stuff you may have done before,

14
00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:34.739
creating SSH key,
maybe even creating a server.

15
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.270
But we're going to hook it
all together and by the end,

16
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.917
we're going to understand how the internet
works, how does any of this work.

17
00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:43.899
So how does the internet work?

18
00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.280
Probably my favorite interview question.

19
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.037
I don't ask it anymore
because I'm known for it.

20
00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:52.413
So you're not getting any free passes
if I ever give you an interview, but

21
00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:56.166
I like it because the internet
is a complex piece of machinery.

22
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.295
I said it before, but I'll say it again.

23
00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.301
The internet is one of mankind's
greatest achievements.

24
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:05.851
And what's great about is like it
wasn't any one person's vision.

25
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.941
Yes it was sort of quasi invented
by DARPA, which is the military,

26
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:14.850
the US government created a loose sort
of internet, but nothing on this scale.

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.603
They just wanted computers to
be able to talk to each other.

28
00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:17.854
It's some loose way.

29
00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:20.086
Some universities wanted
to talk to each other.

30
00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:23.716
But the internet itself where we are today
is not the result of any one company or

31
00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.931
person or organization.

32
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.808
It is a collection of people,
a collection of organizations,

33
00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:30.253
a collection of technologies
that somehow makes it so

34
00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.318
that I talk to you live in a completely
different part of the world.

35
00:01:33.318 --> 00:01:36.048
And you're all tuning in and
we're all creating these things.

36
00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:38.131
And that's just that's really cool.

37
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:38.948
I don't know.

38
00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.060
I think we get so caught up in
the day to day programming and

39
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.303
arguing over frameworks and VI or
vim or Emacs or just arbitrary things.

40
00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:52.991
We get caught up in our day to day and
forgetting the magic of how all this stuff

41
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:55.933
works together and
it's incredibly complex.

42
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.331
So I want to talk a little
bit more about that.

43
00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:01.050
So normally when I say how
does the internet work,

44
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.153
people assume it's some magic,
the browser talks to a server somewhere.

45
00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:07.132
How does the server talk back to you?

46
00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:08.450
Some other magic?

47
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.745
I don't know.

48
00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:12.615
And that's usually the answer I get.

49
00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:15.970
The reason why I like to ask how does
the internet work is because it gives you

50
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.431
a chance to shine on any part
of the stack that you want.

51
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.829
Remember earlier we talked
about what a stack means?

52
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.212
The operating system, the web server,
the application server.

53
00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:25.494
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:30.314
You can dive into any particular part and
you can give me a good answer.

55
00:02:30.314 --> 00:02:34.697
That's why it's a really freeform answer
that tells me how thoughtful you are,

56
00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:36.903
how much kind of research you've done.

57
00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:40.459
And kind of how curious you are because
most of the stuff you don't need in your

58
00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.827
day-to-day if you're
just creating webpages.

59
00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.433
You're not going to need to know how to
spin up a server and open a firewall and

60
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:46.102
things like that.

61
00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:48.192
That's probably done by someone else.

62
00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:53.329
But it shows me how curious you are and
how much you pick up

63
00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.357
on the overall ecosystem that we
exist in as front end engineers.

64
00:02:59.357 --> 00:03:03.729
The core of the internet is
built on cooperation and rules.

65
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.485
Some corporations monetize.

66
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.546
So internet service providers.

67
00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:11.301
Well they get paid,
we pay them to access the internet.

68
00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:16.194
And they're paid to maintain their part
of the internet, the fibre lines, etc.

69
00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:17.495
But what about the other products?

70
00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.384
What about, I don't know,
talking to a server?

71
00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:22.851
How's it that I can SSH into a server?

72
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:26.966
Like who made Ubuntu to say
you need to implement SSH and

73
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:32.283
then OSX implement SSH and then made it so
they can talk to each other?

74
00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:36.415
Well it's just cooperation, it's just
saying hey here's a common standard we all

75
00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:40.153
agree on it let's implement it in this
way and now we can all use it together.

76
00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.067
And that's what the internet is,

77
00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:45.771
just these series of decisions of
all of us, how we came together.

78
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:48.629
And I'm going on and
on about it but again it's so

79
00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.159
magical how this all mysteriously works.

80
00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.153
By the time we get to the end of this,
you'll be,

81
00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:58.906
how in the world do all these disparate
pieces of technology come together and

82
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:03.317
make it work even though they're
completely unrelated to each other?

83
00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:07.102
This is a very, very simplified
diagram of how requests works.

84
00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:11.253
You have your computer, your computer
has a network card of some sort and

85
00:04:11.253 --> 00:04:12.486
interface outward.

86
00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:16.540
In the old days you had to buy a modem
you had to buy an exterior modem.

87
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.168
I don't know if any of you
familiar with phone lines.

88
00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:23.046
I'm dating myself but there's something
called a 56k modem that ran over your

89
00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.752
phone lines you had to plug it in and you
couldn't use the phone at the same time

90
00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:29.854
as you're on Napster or
something trying to download the mp3.

91
00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.802
Now I'm dating myself for sure.

92
00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:35.805
But all computers need a network
card without that they can't talk to

93
00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:36.711
the internet.

94
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:37.277
Pretty simple.

95
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.446
It's built in now it
didn't always used to be.

96
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:43.926
If your network card is going to talk to a
router somewhere, okay, maybe if you work

97
00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:47.576
in an ISP, you can plug directly
into like one of the servers there.

98
00:04:47.576 --> 00:04:50.857
But if you do that on the way you're
taking this course you probably know a lot

99
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.302
more about networking than I do.

100
00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:57.473
But any network you connect
to is connected to a router.

101
00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:00.219
The router enables so
we can have one IP address.

102
00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.914
So we're here in Minneapolis right now.

103
00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:06.004
We might have one IP address that
connects to the Internet, yet

104
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.997
all of our computers have
different internal IP addresses.

105
00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:11.098
And that's what the router gives us.

106
00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:16.459
It fans out and allows us to multiply our
connections without making too many more.

107
00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.432
So your router will connect to
probably a modem, maybe not,

108
00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:22.246
but probably a modem,
I didn't even include that here.

109
00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:23.515
That connects to your ISP,

110
00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:26.226
the person you're paying to
provide internet access to.

111
00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:28.447
Everybody has an ISP of some sort.

112
00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:31.422
That ISP may be a Tier 1,
it may not be a Tier 1, but

113
00:05:31.422 --> 00:05:34.561
that ISP eventually is gonna
connect to a Tier 1 ISP.

114
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:36.982
Those ISPs are known as the backbone.

115
00:05:36.982 --> 00:05:40.535
The backbones of the internet
are the big players.

116
00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:44.034
They keep everything running,
the backbone goes down.

117
00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:45.268
You feel it.

118
00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:48.535
And we've seen it a few times and
probably the past year.

119
00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:51.944
Usually, every year something some
part of the internet goes down.

120
00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:55.336
And it's usually one of these backbones
that go down due to some mis configuration

121
00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:56.379
or something like that.

122
00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.447
From there, the backbones usually
talk to another backbone, and

123
00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:01.488
these backbones are really, really fast.

124
00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:05.328
These Tier 1 ISPs, they process speed
at probably a hundred gigs a second or

125
00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:08.509
something like that, and
that's pretty slow these days, but

126
00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.986
that's the minimum you
need to become a Tier 1.

127
00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:14.537
Those ISPs will likely connect to
a data center somewhere in the world,

128
00:06:14.537 --> 00:06:17.452
whether we talk about Rackspace,
ORs or digital lotion.

129
00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:19.153
They're connecting to a data center.

130
00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:22.617
That data center is going to is
going to have a server cluster

131
00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:26.726
that server clusters owned by you or
me or any corporation or company.

132
00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:31.055
From the server cluster you usually
had a load balancer of some kind.

133
00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:34.267
So you don't just connect to one server,
that would make a lot of sense.

134
00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:36.100
You overload that server for
all hitting the same ones.

135
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.462
We have a load balancer
to balance that out, and

136
00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:40.597
that ultimately connects to your server.

137
00:06:40.597 --> 00:06:43.706
And if I say how the internet works and
you have this slide or

138
00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:46.704
you have this in your mind,
you're doing pretty well.

139
00:06:46.704 --> 00:06:47.709
I left out a lot.

140
00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:50.169
There is a lot here not shown.

141
00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.283
We didn't talk about BGP.

142
00:06:51.283 --> 00:06:54.282
We talked about modems a little bit.

143
00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:57.973
We didn't talk about
interconnection agreements and

144
00:06:57.973 --> 00:07:01.430
how does a ISP in the US
connect to an ISP in England?

145
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.522
And how do they talk to each other?

146
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:05.325
Where do those cables run?

147
00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.539
Again, it's amazing this all works.

148
00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.187
Look at all these different
steps to pull up a web page.

149
00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:12.971
And we didn't even talk
about the software you need.

150
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:17.865
We didn't talk about browsers, the
standards they run on, that can read TCP

151
00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:23.231
requests and HTTP requests and translate
those into something that is renderable.

152
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:25.733
There's a whole ecosystem.

153
00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:29.723
So think back to that iceberg picture from
the beginning of class where you see front

154
00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:31.324
end and you see everything else.

155
00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:36.672
This is part of the everything else
that makes everything around us work.

156
00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:38.348
So some terminology.

157
00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:41.861
The internet is a network of networks.

158
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.915
That's all it is nothing fancy.

159
00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:46.755
In the beginning days,
it was just some university

160
00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:50.068
nerds talking to each other on
their very slow mainframes.

161
00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:55.146
Now, we're all part of the internet,
and intranet is a private network.

162
00:07:55.146 --> 00:07:59.588
If you work at a big corporation,
they have an intranet.

163
00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:00.980
Most people do these days.

164
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.482
That's just a private internet,
it is connected the outside world but

165
00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:09.620
it doesn't let people in and
we do that via firewalls VPNs, etc.

166
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.649
LAN is something you don't hear as much.

167
00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:14.751
Anybody remember LAN parties?

168
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:16.268
Yeah.

169
00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:16.958
Yeah.
See,

170
00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.407
I can tell how old you are already based
on if you're nodding long enough to tell

171
00:08:20.407 --> 00:08:21.097
me very clear.

172
00:08:21.097 --> 00:08:25.158
Because in the old days before the
internet when the internet was too slow to

173
00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:28.317
actually do that much,
you had to be on the same network and

174
00:08:28.317 --> 00:08:32.142
play the same games in the same room
generally or in the same building.

175
00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:36.727
Yes, LAN is great because, like Mark was
saying there's no latency, generally

176
00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:40.847
speaking, and then there's something
called a WAN a wide area network,

177
00:08:40.847 --> 00:08:43.648
not something as used as much but
similar to a LAN.

178
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:47.066
It's just say multiple
buildings at this time, but

179
00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:50.258
that's generally been
replaced by internets.

180
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.581
And I keep saying IP, IP, IP address, etc.

181
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.689
IP just stands for Internet Protocol.

182
00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:01.830
Remember the internet is built
on rules and cooperation.

183
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.596
So those rules are general in
the form of standards and protocols.

184
00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:08.524
Internet Protocol just specifies, hey,

185
00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:11.626
what is an address
connecting to a computer?

186
00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:12.578
What does that look like?

187
00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:14.114
What are the rules around it?

188
00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:15.534
Are there letters allowed in there?

189
00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:16.885
Is there spaces?

190
00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:19.048
In Internet Protocol just says no.

191
00:09:19.048 --> 00:09:21.165
Here's what an IP address is.

192
00:09:21.165 --> 00:09:23.775
Here's the number of blocks we have and

193
00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:27.819
I'll talk about that one second
when we get to IP addresses.

194
00:09:27.819 --> 00:09:32.597
And here's the rules that govern
how these how this protocol works.

195
00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:36.265
An IP address is just a label assigned
to any internet connected device.

196
00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:40.694
Every single device on the world
has an IP address of some sorts.

197
00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:45.664
Now, a lot of times because they're behind
a router, that internet address is just

198
00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:49.948
192 dot 168 dot something those
are considered local addresses.

199
00:09:49.948 --> 00:09:52.965
But again, they're wider when you connect
to a wider net you're going to have

200
00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:54.026
generally one IP address.

201
00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:59.709
And that's the beauty of the router,
it allows this multiplexing.

202
00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:03.989
So I don't think people know this but
company's own blocks of

203
00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:08.610
the internet in different forums
they own blocks of IP addresses.

204
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:14.530
So I forget off the top of my head which
governing body owns IP addresses but

205
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.879
somebody does.

206
00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:21.287
And somebody says hey,
let's get an example, Cloudflare,

207
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:26.388
Cloudflare owns 1.1.1 and
they own an entire block.

208
00:10:26.388 --> 00:10:28.886
Google owns an entire block of addresses.

209
00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:31.902
Amazon owns this entire
block of addresses.

210
00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:35.985
The government owns probably
the biggest block of IP addresses.

211
00:10:35.985 --> 00:10:38.201
And again, you have to buy
these things from other people.

212
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:42.985
So it's a weird dichotomy here where
the internet's open and free, but

213
00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:46.211
it's also not,
it's also owned by people too.

214
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:50.923
But it generally all works out
this private public cooperation.

215
00:10:50.923 --> 00:10:55.488
So way back in the day, and this is
more of a math thing, people said, hey,

216
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.313
let's create an IP address.

217
00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:59.700
An IP address will have four places,

218
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.945
four different blocks to specify
the location of the IP address.

219
00:11:03.945 --> 00:11:12.127
So when we take IPv4, so it's going to
be something like that 127.0.0.1, etc.

220
00:11:12.127 --> 00:11:13.295
People are like, that's enough.

221
00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:19.856
That gives us roughly 4.3 billion
addresses, that should be plenty, right?

222
00:11:19.856 --> 00:11:24.264
In 1990 when they're coming up with all
these standards in the 90s and the 80s.

223
00:11:24.264 --> 00:11:29.584
That seemed like a lot, we'll never have 4
billion connected devices to the internet.

224
00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:33.816
It turns out we ran out of IP addresses
quite a while ago, this was a problem.

225
00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:35.817
4.3 billion is not enough.

226
00:11:35.817 --> 00:11:37.024
Hence, we created IPv6.

227
00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:44.548
IPv6 has 340 undecillion,
I'm pronouncing that right addresses.

228
00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:49.438
So that effectively means we will
never run out of IP addresses.

229
00:11:49.438 --> 00:11:52.476
I say this now they find that
the same thing 30 years ago,

230
00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:56.878
we're never gonna run out of IP addresses
but I think we're pretty safe with IPv6.

231
00:11:56.878 --> 00:12:01.305
IPv4 is 32 bits IPv6 is 128 bits so

232
00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:04.831
that is exponentially larger.

233
00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:09.568
So we're not really gonna dive into
IPv6 too much but if you ever see it is

234
00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:13.929
a legitimate address it's just
one of the more modern standards.
