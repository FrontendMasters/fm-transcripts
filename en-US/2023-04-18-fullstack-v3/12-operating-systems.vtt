00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.952
So when it comes to operating systems,
there's essentially kind of just two basic

2
00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:10.133
kind, if you've got Windows-based systems
and you have your Unix-based systems.

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.517
The interesting thing is Windows,
it really just goes to

4
00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:18.462
Windows Server when you talk about server
operating systems not a whole lot there.

5
00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:22.995
The consumer operating system, there's
on windows eleven, now, is it twelve?

6
00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.162
It's on windows eleven.

7
00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.129
You could probably run a server there,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

8
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.484
Windows Server is optimized for that.

9
00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:34.731
When it comes to Unix, there is every
flavor you can possibly imagine.

10
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.225
I have some of these listed here.

11
00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.167
So you have Solaris,
you have Linux, you have BSD.

12
00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:45.154
These are kind of the three main
subsets of the Unix Operating System.

13
00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:47.983
Now, Linux is the one you're
probably most familiar with.

14
00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:50.166
Linux you've all heard of there's this and

15
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:54.119
that's one where there's the most versions
of the operating system of Linux.

16
00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.629
Linux is a much more user friendly,

17
00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.657
much more accessible version of Unix
with a lot more built in commands.

18
00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:05.956
And when it comes to Linux,
there's Debian, CentOS,

19
00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:09.437
Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat, Alpine, Arch.

20
00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:10.769
I just named a few.

21
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.446
And there's a flavor of Linux for
whatever you wanna do,

22
00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:16.907
because it's highly customizable.

23
00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:19.988
We're gonna use Ubuntu,
which is by far the most common and

24
00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:21.722
most popular operating system.

25
00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:24.347
It's owned by a company called Ubiqiuiti,
and

26
00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.244
I think Red Hat may have
bought them a few years back.

27
00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:31.724
I'm a little not up to date on
my Linux comings and goings.

28
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:37.347
But Ubuntu's a safe bet,
you can't go wrong going with Ubuntu.

29
00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.696
I've used in every version of course,
all those operating system or

30
00:01:40.696 --> 00:01:44.174
all those websites are still running
there's no problem with Ubuntu.

31
00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:46.616
When it comes to the other
operating systems,

32
00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:48.816
BSD is probably one you've not heard of.

33
00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:53.805
But BSD creates freeBSD,
which is based off BSD.

34
00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.604
And freeBSD is of course MacOS,

35
00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:58.476
the operating system that
we're using right now.

36
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:01.903
Again, but
why do all these tools work together?

37
00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:03.915
Because the root is Unix.

38
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:08.169
So the commands we're using here on our
terminal, in the command that we did

39
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.571
a little bit earlier, will also work on
Ubuntu because the core is still Unix.

40
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.340
So that's the important thing.

41
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.733
So, you pick Unix and pick Ubuntu when
you're choosing the operating system.

42
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.024
And I forgot to mention the best thing
about Linux is most of them are open

43
00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:28.430
source and they're all free.

44
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.417
Well, most of them are free,
Red Hat is not free.

45
00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:34.875
But that's fantastic, what an amazing
accomplishment we've made all these

46
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:39.550
versions and flavors operating systems and
most of them are open source and free.

47
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.023
There's nothing else in life
that gives you things for free.

48
00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:48.293
Just doesn't happen anywhere else other
than software engineering, what a great

49
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:55.288
field we work in So
before we keep going with the VPS, I

50
00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:59.435
do wanna talk a little bit about operating
systems because we're all running them.

51
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:02.333
My phone's running one,
your car is running one, your watch,

52
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.168
if it's a smart watch, is running one.

53
00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:06.484
Everything's running on some
sort of operating system.

54
00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:09.434
And operating systems,
at least in the Unix terms,

55
00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:11.455
is made up of three distinct parts.

56
00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:16.263
The programs or utilities that's
kind of what we were using earlier.

57
00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.844
When we say makedir, rmdir,
vi these are all programs and

58
00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:22.635
utilities built into the operating system.

59
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.538
There's the Kernel, which is the main
part of the operation system,

60
00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.995
that's the one that talks to the hardware.

61
00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.164
That's what gets really really tricky.

62
00:03:31.164 --> 00:03:34.151
When I said we're going deep,
we're not going kernel deep.

63
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.067
We're staying at the shell
in the user land.

64
00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:41.200
But it is possible to go into the kernel
we get the hardware programming,

65
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.998
which is its own field
of computer engineering.

66
00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:47.768
And that's more computer engineering
than software engineering,

67
00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:49.397
different fields entirely.

68
00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:53.347
But I think the most interesting thing
about Unix and why it's such a powerful

69
00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:57.077
operating system is everything is
either a file or a process that's it.

70
00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:59.927
It's a really simple model of operating.

71
00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:02.383
So, it's a file that you interact with or

72
00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:05.691
it's a process something
that's running that's it.

73
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:10.157
All these utilities, they're just files
and they follow the POSIX standard.

74
00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:13.036
They have standard in
standard out standard error.

75
00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:15.022
And it's amazing that all
these things come together.

76
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:19.596
All these disparate tools come together to
form the operating system that we can use

77
00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:24.120
interchangeably no matter where we are on
Phone, MacOS or on Ubuntu or on Fedora.

78
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.423
They all work the same
across all these tool sets.

79
00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:30.856
I don't know,
it's astounding that we've come this far.

80
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.330
Before we jump to security,
let's jump back and see how far we got.

81
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.089
So we chose Ubuntu,
we chose the LTS version of Ubuntu.

82
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.478
On droplet size, choose the smallest one.

83
00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:50.780
We're not pushing the bounds here.

84
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.608
We're not creating Netflix 2.O just yet.

85
00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:57.761
And choose the one that's the cheapest.

86
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.477
I'd say, again we don't need
a lot of compute power for this.

87
00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:10.128
The $4 droplet is not available on SFO
isn't available in New York, should be.

88
00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:14.760
Let's double check.

89
00:05:18.205 --> 00:05:22.053
Yes, so if you want the absolute cheapest
one choose the New York data center.

90
00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.525
Again for this exercise,
focus on the costs, the compute power,

91
00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.700
we're not really gonna push it too hard.

92
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.078
But I'm gonna stick with San Francisco
because Loyal to the West Coast and

93
00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:35.127
it's gonna run about $6
a month in compute time.

94
00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:37.284
But again, if you use that link,
you get free credits.

95
00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:40.136
So it shouldn't cost you anything,
unless you forget about it.

96
00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:41.167
So don't forget about it.

97
00:05:45.202 --> 00:05:47.440
So how do we get into the server?

98
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.568
We can make one pretty easily.

99
00:05:48.568 --> 00:05:52.011
We got the operating system,
we got the data center, but

100
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:54.182
how do we actually connect into it?

101
00:05:54.182 --> 00:05:56.253
Well, we can use a password but

102
00:05:56.253 --> 00:06:00.252
it's actually this like well
why we won't use a password.

103
00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:01.914
We're gonna use an SSH key.

104
00:06:01.914 --> 00:06:05.403
And this is where things get
a little more complex but

105
00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:07.871
they get a lot more interesting too.
