1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.848
After all that information, we know
a tiny bit more how the Internet works,

2
00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:06.984
but there's still so much more.

3
00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:10.385
How do domains work?

4
00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.525
I mean you see IP addresses, but that's
not the same as an actual domain name,

5
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:15.802
how does all that work?

6
00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:20.081
We know all this happens at
the TCP connection level,

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.276
which is running on packets of data,
but what else?

8
00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:28.674
We need something called
the domain name system.

9
00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:33.309
Think of a domain name system as,
I don't know, like a phone book.

10
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.105
So instead of you memorizing 127.0.0.1,
you know its local host.

11
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.851
That's probably not the best example, but.

12
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:44.439
Instead of remembering,
I don't know, the IP address for

13
00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.255
frontendmasters.com off
the top of my head.

14
00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.362
But instead of remembering that,

15
00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.777
you remember frontendmasters.com
because that's easier to remember.

16
00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:54.506
You remember google.com,
you remember netflix.com, Facebook etc.,

17
00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:57.197
all that's possible by using
the domain name system.

18
00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:59.198
The things that hold the records,

19
00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:03.961
these giant phone books that map names
to IP addresses, are called nameservers.

20
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.193
Nameservers are independent entities
that again hold all this information,

21
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:09.743
they share with each other.

22
00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:15.065
That's how in a second when we buy our
domain name how whatever ISP you're using,

23
00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:20.250
whatever service you're using, will
know how to talk to a different service.

24
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.020
And they're all using nameservers
to translate all these things.

25
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.757
And think what the Internet
would be without domain names,

26
00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:29.422
it would never make it as far because no
one is gonna remember all these IP address

27
00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.644
off the top of their head.

28
00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:33.554
So your computer talks to the browser.

29
00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:36.690
The browser actually talks to
the name server and says like, hey,

30
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.442
this person wants to go to google.com,
but that doesn't mean anything to me,

31
00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:43.476
I actually need the IP address
to actually make the connection.

32
00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:46.564
It talks to the name server,
the name server is like, okay, I got you,

33
00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:49.668
here's the IP address, then we use
that IP and then we talk to a server.

34
00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:54.084
The server then talks back to
the browser only on the IP level, and

35
00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:55.702
then it gets back to us.

36
00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:59.408
All that's hidden from us, all we know
is we typed in frontendmasters.com and

37
00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.750
it showed up in our browser.

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.680
But underneath is this
really complex mechanism

39
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.903
of parties working independently but
all together.

40
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.112
We're almost there to buying our domain,
probably the most exciting part.

41
00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:18.327
There's two types of records
we need know in DNS.

42
00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:21.298
There's an A record, so
that maps a name to an IP address,

43
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:24.410
pretty straightforward,
this is the one we're gonna use.

44
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.101
There's also CNAME, that's where
I can map a name to another name.

45
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.292
So instead of frontendmasters.com, I could
say Masters Frontend, and we can map them

46
00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:35.533
the same way without having to create
a new IP address in the middle.

47
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.447
And don't go to that website,
I don't know what it is.

48
00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:41.053
I should stop making random websites,
it's the Internet.

49
00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:46.342
Okay, so
let's dive in a little bit to the DNS,

50
00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:50.537
cuz I want you to see how these systems
work, we're not gonna touch it too much.

51
00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:55.126
But again, I want you to know and
not just believe that these things work,

52
00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.990
I want you to understand how
these systems are all connected.

53
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.322
So to see the nameservers for a particular
domain, we're gonna use the nslookup tool.

54
00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:10.231
So in your terminal you can say
nslookup frontendmasters.com,

55
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:14.783
any address you want, and
you should get a list back of some IP

56
00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:18.545
addresses that are associated
to those domains.

57
00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:22.686
Now if you wanna have fun, just plug one
of those IP addresses into your browser

58
00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:24.589
and it'll connect to that domain.

59
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:29.353
And let's check out what
frontendmasters.com looks like.

60
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.008
Let's go to frontendmasters.com.

61
00:03:35.008 --> 00:03:38.460
Again, I don't know what
Frontend Masters is, don't go there,

62
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.998
I take no responsibility for
random addresses.

63
00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:43.528
There we go, that's more like it.

64
00:03:43.528 --> 00:03:48.998
So frontendmasters.com doesn't just have
one IP, it has multiple IP addresses,

65
00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:52.473
and the names from our lookup
can give us some of them.

66
00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:55.076
I think there's some flags we
can get to get all of them, but

67
00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:56.704
usually it's only to give us three.

68
00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.295
Cuz most domains have
multiple IP addresses and

69
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:01.051
that would not be super useful.

70
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:05.205
So that's nslookup, that's pretty
useful if you have a domain name and

71
00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:09.233
you're like, where's it actually
mapping to, this will tell you.

72
00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:15.028
Now if we wanna go deeper, beyond the
nameserver into the actual DNS records for

73
00:04:15.028 --> 00:04:17.293
a domain, we can use a tool called dig.

74
00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:21.639
So let's go ahead and clear,
let's dig frontendmasters.com.

75
00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:28.433
A bit more verbose.

76
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:34.655
But again it's giving us the same
IP addresses as the nameserver, but

77
00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.070
now it's telling us these are A records.

78
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.565
Which we just talked about,

79
00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:42.811
these A records are DNS records that map
frontendmasters.com to an IP address.

80
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:48.871
These are all stored on the nameservers
and the actual domain registrars, yes.

81
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:54.153
&gt;&gt; Can you clarify, my one domain name
could have multiple IP addresses,

82
00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:58.125
is it because they're hosted
on different servers?

83
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.206
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very few websites these days,

84
00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:03.590
very few commercial websites
are just running on one server,

85
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.489
they're almost always running on multiple
servers and they're load balanced across.

86
00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:13.134
And so when we go to frontendmasters.com,
we don't actually know where we're going.

87
00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:17.077
But usually through the combination
of CDNs and load balancers,

88
00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:19.735
it's gonna direct us to the shortest path.

89
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:24.240
But these are all available for
us if any IP address ever goes down.

90
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.938
So yeah, very few web applications
only have one IP address these days,

91
00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:33.032
it's just very easy to scale up and
it's good for resiliency.

92
00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:36.559
So dig is a good way of digging into the,
[LAUGH] digging,

93
00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:40.401
sometimes the tools all work out,
to get to the DNS records.

94
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:44.996
And we're so close to buying a domain,
I know you want it.

95
00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:48.872
But we have to learn all this stuff
before, cuz you have to know how this

96
00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:52.631
works in order to understand how
all the systems talk to each other.

97
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.069
The last one we're gonna cover is a URL,

98
00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.101
probably something you don't spend
a lot of time thinking about.

99
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:01.408
But again, rules and cooperation.

100
00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:05.022
URLs have a structure, they have rules,
they have things they can do,

101
00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:06.719
they have things they can't do.

102
00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.729
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator,
where something is,

103
00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.078
that's all it does, or it's all it says.

104
00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:20.037
You can break your URL down into domain,
so yourdomain.com, frontendmasters.com.

105
00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:23.811
The subdomain, which is anything with
a dot in front of the actual domain.

106
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:28.857
So test, dev, doesn't matter,
that's called the subdomain.

107
00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:30.951
TLD is a top level domain.

108
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.728
So TLDs are actually owned
by companies at this point.

109
00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.882
It used to be .com was the only one,
it's owned by,

110
00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:43.069
I wanna say ICANN which is kind of
the governing body of domain names.

111
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.254
And every time you buy a domain
you pay them a small fee, and

112
00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:49.314
that helps keep all these
processes working together.

113
00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:52.968
Then companies came along and
said you know what, this is some BS,

114
00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:55.005
why can't I have my own domain name?

115
00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:58.213
So that's what companies did,
they created their own, they paid ICANN.

116
00:06:58.213 --> 00:07:03.424
So now Google owns .google,
I don't know of any of the other ones.

117
00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:07.164
But now there's a lot of fun domain names,
maybe 10 years ago,

118
00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:10.429
about 15 years ago,
there's .com, .net, .org.

119
00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:13.620
I feel like .nets are always the sketchy
ones cuz you're always like,

120
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.134
who has a .net domain name,
that doesn't seem right.

121
00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:21.973
But now there's .science, .best,
I feel like .cooking is one.

122
00:07:21.973 --> 00:07:23.593
There's a lot of them, so

123
00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:27.141
you can kinda make any sort of
domain you want these days.

124
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:32.054
Anything after the domain, after the TLD,
the top level domain, is called the path,

125
00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:35.981
that's probably one as front
engineers we're most familiar with.

126
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:39.062
And then anything after the path
followed by a question mark is known

127
00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:41.937
as the query parameters, and
those can go on, and on, and on.

128
00:07:41.937 --> 00:07:46.207
So yeah, even URLs, the thing you use
every single day, they have rules and

129
00:07:46.207 --> 00:07:47.488
they have processes.

130
00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:50.762
&gt;&gt; So
question about just the top level domain.

131
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:55.691
Back in the day, there was a lot of
cybersquatting rules where you couldn't

132
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.938
buy a company's name if they
didn't have their domain name yet.

133
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:04.160
Do you know do those same cybersquatting
rules kind of apply to top level domains?

134
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.856
Like if I wanted to go out and
buy the .microsoft,

135
00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:11.200
I'm assuming they would
own that already but

136
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.779
if I bought .microsoft is there
rules around not doing that?

137
00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:17.389
&gt;&gt; There are, again,

138
00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:22.420
ICANN is the regulatory body
that arbitrates these disputes.

139
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.845
You'll never be able to buy Microsoft
because they're already gonna have

140
00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:27.379
an arrangement with Microsoft.

141
00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:32.110
And if Microsoft's like, we don't want
to buy that then it just wouldn't exist,

142
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.084
they wouldn't go down that path.

143
00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:37.241
Similar like you're never gonna
own a .google domain name,

144
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.619
Google owns that, it's never gonna change.

145
00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:43.802
Where it gets tricky when it comes to
this concept of cybersquatting and

146
00:08:43.802 --> 00:08:46.099
can you buy a TLD, can you buy a domain,

147
00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:50.630
is in individual cases where a company
wants to buy it because they're like,

148
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.139
this is our trademark,
this is our IP, this is something.

149
00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:58.005
But the other person has a legitimate
case where they're not squatting,

150
00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:01.993
they're not just, like, it's an empty
website that's filled with ads or

151
00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:05.011
one of those this website is for
sale type placeholders.

152
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.755
The case that I always
think of is toyota.com.

153
00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:11.040
So you're like, Toyota, the car company.

154
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.207
But the original owner of toyota.com
was this small business owner who

155
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:22.251
ran a car repair shop whose last name was
Toyota, so a legitimate use of the domain.

156
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:27.537
This person owned it first,
we know under the very authoritative

157
00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:31.681
doctrine of finders keepers
they got there first.

158
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:35.947
But Toyota sued this person cuz
they're saying we're Toyota,

159
00:09:35.947 --> 00:09:41.240
you work on cars and we sell cars, there's
a chance consumers might be confused

160
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.905
when they go to this domain so
we're gonna sue you for ownership of it.

161
00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:48.359
I forgot the resolution of
what happened with that.

162
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:50.373
But that was one of the more,
I don't know,

163
00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:53.749
unpleasant cases where a corporation's
trying to bully their way around

164
00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:56.428
the Internet when that's not
how the Internet's built.

165
00:09:56.428 --> 00:10:00.242
The Internet's built of you got
there first it's yours, whether or

166
00:10:00.242 --> 00:10:04.071
not you do anything with it that's
nobody's business but your own.

167
00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.614
That has changed over time,

168
00:10:05.614 --> 00:10:09.347
where corporations increasingly
are pressuring people to buy out,

169
00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:13.091
or they'll force you off a domain,
they'll arbitrate with ICANN.

170
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:18.074
And ICANN's usually gonna side with
the corporation cuz the corporation has

171
00:10:18.074 --> 00:10:21.301
20 lawyers, you have one,
so that can happen.

172
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:26.957
Where it comes to cyber squatting,
that's a little bit different these days.

173
00:10:26.957 --> 00:10:30.947
So cybersquatting refers to the act
of me buying microsoft.com and

174
00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:34.797
I either it's just a bunch of
malware ads or something like that,

175
00:10:34.797 --> 00:10:37.464
I'm not making good use
of that domain name.

176
00:10:37.464 --> 00:10:41.390
Then Microsoft could maybe sue me and
say like, hey, ICANN,

177
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.240
this person is not using this,
this is our trademark and IP,

178
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.174
we wanna own this domain, then that
becomes a little bit different of a case.

179
00:10:50.174 --> 00:10:53.655
But if you're making legitimate use,
it's harder to make.

180
00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:56.732
Fun fact, and
we keep bringing up Microsoft, but

181
00:10:56.732 --> 00:11:01.350
every time there's a new TLD that's
released people immediately buy, or

182
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.570
companies immediately buy all of the bad
domain names associated with these sites.

183
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:12.815
So I'll say .com for instance,
Microsoft bought like microsoftsucks.com.

184
00:11:12.815 --> 00:11:14.914
Or if there's like a .worst,

185
00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:19.374
Microsoft bought microsoft.theworst or
something like that.

186
00:11:19.374 --> 00:11:23.934
Companies do this every time there's a new
TLD just to make sure that people don't

187
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:28.515
squat on those or use them for trolling or
malicious purposes, things like that.

188
00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:31.728
And that's kind of
the challenge that we talked

189
00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:35.516
about the explosion of TLDs
in the past couple of years.

190
00:11:35.516 --> 00:11:38.090
Is if you run a company that has an IP,

191
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.411
you have to buy all these domain
names every single time just to

192
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:47.087
ensure that someone didn't squat on it or
use it to direct people.

193
00:11:47.087 --> 00:11:52.301
I think a good example would be, it's not
possible by like a .google domain name but

194
00:11:52.301 --> 00:11:55.313
if it were what if I
bought help.google.com but

195
00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.672
I redirected it to some malware site.

196
00:11:57.672 --> 00:12:02.587
And I'm like hey grandma, are you stuck
on something, go to help.google.com.

197
00:12:02.587 --> 00:12:05.936
And you're like, that's a legitimate
website, it has the .google in there,

198
00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:06.643
it must be legit.

199
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:11.009
And everything looks legit, you download
it, and it's a bunch of viruses.

200
00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:14.477
I'm joking about cybersquatting and
things like that, but

201
00:12:14.477 --> 00:12:18.154
these have real consequences when
you have a valid domain name.

202
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.434
Another one is domain
names that are one off.

203
00:12:20.434 --> 00:12:25.924
So like netflix.com, but
instead of an i it's a one.

204
00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:30.264
You can glance at that and go netflix.com,
maybe they cloned the homepage and

205
00:12:30.264 --> 00:12:33.617
it looks legitimate, and
they're just like stealing logins.

206
00:12:33.617 --> 00:12:37.671
That's another common
case of kind of one-off,

207
00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:42.699
we see that a lot,
microsoft.com with a zero instead of an o.

208
00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:47.970
So the whole TLD domain,
it's a lot more complex than it looks.

209
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.715
So for our class we're gonna
keep to the simple ones.

210
00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:55.448
I hope you keep it funny cuz that's the
most important thing when you're buying

211
00:12:55.448 --> 00:12:57.966
a domain, keep it funny or
interesting to yourself.

212
00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:01.742
Answering a few questions
that were in the chat.

213
00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:04.502
What does not authoritative
mean on the nslookup,

214
00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:07.654
I had someone respond in
the chat with the correct answer.

215
00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.915
When it says not authoritative,

216
00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:12.067
it just means we're a nameserver that's
a nameserver that's related to the other

217
00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:15.012
nameserver, but we're not actually
the ones that own the records for this.

218
00:13:15.012 --> 00:13:18.624
So this is just what we're told from
another nameserver who was probably told

219
00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:22.695
from another nameserver, but we're not the
actual one that hold the actual records.

220
00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:24.132
So this may be incorrect, but

221
00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:26.844
this to the best of our
knowledge is the correct answer.
