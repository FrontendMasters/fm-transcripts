00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:05.147
So, let's talk about this is one that
is currently not in the TypeScript

2
00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:09.935
standard library of utility types,
but I will show it to you because

3
00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:15.066
it's one that I frequently make for
these cases that has served me well.

4
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:19.767
And if someone's got like, I have a better
way to do this, yo hit the chat app,

5
00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:20.347
I'm in.

6
00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:21.865
But I'll show it to you, I mean,

7
00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.541
cuz it's a utility type I'm
going to define it globally.

8
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.435
So, I'll go like global.d.ts.

9
00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:29.107
I'll put it up top just
to make it easier for

10
00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:30.976
when I push off some of
this code in a little bit.

11
00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:35.873
And what I will do is I'll have this type.

12
00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:41.119
And I call it RequireOnly which is kinda
like partial and pick mixed together.

13
00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:44.488
Which is like anything on this
type can be optional, but

14
00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:47.784
I have a few opinions on
things that I absolutely want,

15
00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:52.316
the TypeScript compiler to enforce in
my UI, that I am providing, right?

16
00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:56.663
And it feels dangerous to say,
will eliminate the need for

17
00:00:56.663 --> 00:01:02.090
a whole bunch of random unit tests of
you handing in all sorts of garbage.

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.707
You know those tests that are just like,
okay, what if I get this thing?

19
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:05.849
What if I get that thing, right?

20
00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.738
Having some of that confidence out of
the box is usually super powerful.

21
00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.825
So, really we care about
two things we want,

22
00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:16.088
what is the type that
we're basing this off of?

23
00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:18.583
And what are the properties
that you want to keep?

24
00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:21.744
So, I'm gonna say that again, cuz I'm
gonna use those letters in a second.

25
00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:26.620
What's the type that I'm basing this
off of and the pop up properties?

26
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.894
So, we'll say T is the type and
P is gonna be what the property I want is.

27
00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:36.436
But we do say that, yo,
don't give me garbage.

28
00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:41.179
It needs to be one of the keys
of that first one, right?

29
00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.679
So, it's got to be a key on that one and
that will kinda constrain it.

30
00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.281
So that's actually helpful for
me, where I will say,

31
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:50.385
could I write this by
hand on the other file?

32
00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:53.171
I absolutely could, I just don't want to.

33
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.900
Use pick, so
that's the same as if I was writing.

34
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.580
That you saw earlier in the other file.

35
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.797
And you also saw me write.

36
00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:10.267
It's basically combining these two so
I never have to think about it again.

37
00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.221
And partial, but I need to do
one other thing here, which is,

38
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.518
you'll see why in a second.

39
00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:25.086
I'm gonna do it first then I'll fix it.

40
00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.324
This would create a kind of
a weird type for me, and so far,

41
00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:29.810
it doesn't really know what to do
with the one that I wanna keep.

42
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.328
So I wanna do,
definitely want the one I want,

43
00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:37.583
the way that it was, and
then everything else, right?

44
00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:43.516
So then we will also omit
the one that we're looking for.

45
00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.611
And like I said,
you could write this by hand too.

46
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:50.357
If you just wanted to write
the type by hand, absolutely go for

47
00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:54.660
it but if this pattern is helpful for
you too, awesome.

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.140
And so, now I can say, all this type,
everything else is optional, but

49
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.062
these three or four, which has stopped me
from a lot of head scratching when I'm

50
00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:08.837
making these partial types and getting
ready to put stuff that I only have some

51
00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:11.435
of the data as I get
ready in that reducer.

52
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:13.640
Otherwise you find yourself
writing conditionals,

53
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.681
you find yourself then make sure you
have the test to those conditionals.

54
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:21.042
And yeah, right test but also if you
can get helped by your type system,

55
00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:23.016
you should absolutely do that.

56
00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:29.180
So now, I can just say for the rest of
my code base, This gives me basically

57
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.950
the same type you can kind of say that's
super helpful to look at, but it is.

58
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.930
Everything is optional but title,
so make sure we have that.

59
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.887
Everything else, do what you want.

60
00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:41.759
This gives me the flexibility later on my
code base that if I am doing stuff from

61
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.845
a user page, right?

62
00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:45.949
Cuz a lot of time stuff happens in a brand
new section but then it's another user,

63
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.147
then we should have it scoped.

64
00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:49.117
Or if they're already
doing it from a project,

65
00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:51.199
we might already have that information,
right?

66
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.332
And you find yourself having these more
cases where it's total partials or

67
00:03:55.332 --> 00:03:57.507
only wanting a type starts to bite you.

68
00:03:57.507 --> 00:04:01.187
So, super helpful for me,
I hope it's helpful for you.

69
00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:04.854
Ask
&gt;&gt; Does it work well with multiple fields

70
00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:06.591
you want to include?

71
00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:12.188
&gt;&gt; This one is set for one, I think I
could theoretically do more of them.

72
00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:15.670
Actually, no, because you should
be able to use a union, right?

73
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.875
&gt;&gt; I wonder how Moot will react to
our conflict resolution in that case.

74
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.622
&gt;&gt; You wanna find out together?

75
00:04:21.622 --> 00:04:22.676
All right, let's do it.

76
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.507
And we'll say that this one will take,

77
00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:42.932
you can almost put it back to the way
it was, so, just title and ID.

78
00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:46.021
Right?

79
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:49.120
So, it's not happy with me.

80
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.383
I gotta use union.

81
00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:52.963
It's happy with me again.

82
00:04:55.072 --> 00:05:02.267
And so, in this case, we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Sorry, what was the question?

83
00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:07.812
&gt;&gt; The question was could I put more
than one, like I did with title?

84
00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:11.103
Pretty sure that I can, but what I
don't wanna do is, say absolutely, and

85
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:12.737
then find out that I'm a liar to you.

86
00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:16.210
So I was like, we might as well
find out I'm a liar together.

87
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.403
And so, pull this in and
we'll say that We gotta say it set tight.

88
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:45.039
Yeah, works, yeah.

89
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.095
I was like, does that why I use it
that much and it doesn't do that?

90
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:52.038
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't expect to use the or
in generics portion.

91
00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:55.032
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could put a union in there.

92
00:05:55.032 --> 00:05:56.751
&gt;&gt; Could you flip back to the RequireOnly,
it was.

93
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:58.418
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

94
00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:03.350
&gt;&gt; One particular part of it.

95
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.133
So you're picking TP in the case
where the property on T is optional

96
00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:14.337
is the intention to mark it as required or
&gt;&gt; It would say the way it was.

97
00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:15.363
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

98
00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:17.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I want anything as it was.

99
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.293
Normally, I am only picking the ones
that would've been required.

100
00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:26.496
There is a required utility helper for

101
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:31.761
some reason needed to do that, I could get
&gt;&gt; And that's how I wrote it when we

102
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:36.250
were talking through it I was like, okay,
so we're gonna make these required and

103
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.370
I use that utility, and then I compared
it to yours, I was like, I wonder.

104
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.356
We're thinking about things
slightly differently.

105
00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:45.723
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this works as I intended.

106
00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:47.442
I think this probably works
as you intended, yeah.

107
00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:52.075
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool, awesome.

108
00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:53.012
Sweat, how will the final exam?

109
00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:57.316
All right, so now we've got that in place.

110
00:06:57.316 --> 00:07:02.579
We can create them what we don't have
right now is any way to show these and

111
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.807
again, if you really wanted
to you could just literally,

112
00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:09.761
this was a helpful way this made you sad.

113
00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:13.812
You can literally just write out the type
there's only four properties on this type,

114
00:07:13.812 --> 00:07:17.468
you can just make a new type where there
have question marks yes it is repeating

115
00:07:17.468 --> 00:07:18.439
yourself, right?

116
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:23.076
Yes, you're supposed to keep things dry
but also it's pretty explicit right, and

117
00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:26.420
sometimes clarity explicitly is
like better in a lot of cases
