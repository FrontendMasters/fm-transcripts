1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.400
We're doing a project with an interface
working creating an array of them.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.730
And more importantly is we're defining
ProjectState in the initialState.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.310
So, let us be about this.

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.170
Typically what I will do
when I'm approaching this.

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.920
For real,
is that I start with the interface.

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.703
So if I'm building a project from scratch.

7
00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:32.552
The first thing I do is I'll just scratch
out all the interfaces that I can

8
00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:35.920
think of for this particular project.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.350
So in this case, interface project
I am going to extend base entity.

10
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.400
And this is why we kind of do this.

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.500
Let me expand this out a bit.

12
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.392
And we're going to fly through this so
title, string,

13
00:00:55.392 --> 00:01:01.590
description string I'm going to add
something in here just for fun.

14
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.130
This might not have even
been in the solution.

15
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.570
Let me check real quick.

16
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.440
I don't think it is but
I feel like it should have been.

17
00:01:12.174 --> 00:01:18.280
Good this completed that's
what I was going to do.

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.319
So I guess my past self
realized that hey projects you

19
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.270
should be able to describe
if they are done or not.

20
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.447
So here we have title description and
completed.

21
00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:35.584
Now, before we go further,
just stop mentally in your mind and

22
00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:40.050
think of what format form of look
like if you're working with this.

23
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.527
So, Title, input field, description,

24
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:49.617
maybe a text area like if you wanted
to allow, your more chatty co workers.

25
00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:54.980
Or clients or
customers to really describe this project.

26
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.560
And then, completed because it's Boolean.

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080
What is that typically going to be?

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.670
Well, Checkbox typically it's either on or
it's off.

29
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.826
So with that said,

30
00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:13.048
we are going to create two projects,

31
00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:19.656
super project and
this is gonna have an id one.

32
00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:23.913
Title, super project

33
00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:29.738
description is going to be this

34
00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:34.900
is awesome and completed.

35
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.688
Is going to be false.

36
00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:43.190
Because we love working on it so
much, we just don't want it to end.

37
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.690
Now.

38
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.230
We'll call this one hell project.

39
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.870
I think everybody here probably just
immediately thought of a project,

40
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.670
they just like, transposed on top of this.

41
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.460
I said hell project.

42
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.989
They're like, I know one of those.

43
00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.314
And so in their mind they've mentally
filled that in I'm seeing some heads

44
00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.330
going on the chat.

45
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.070
So clearly I'm not the only one who
has been on that kind of project.

46
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.190
We'll call this help project on Earth.

47
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.052
I'm imagining my mom's going to just
pop out here at any point be like don't

48
00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:18.710
talk like that.

49
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.490
Just make it stop.

50
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.820
Completed.

51
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.940
I'm just gonna lie and
tell myself that it is.

52
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.740
Alright.

53
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.578
So this is just me speaking from my heart
to the hearts of all the developers around

54
00:03:39.578 --> 00:03:40.850
the world.

55
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.920
And we're gonna go projects.

56
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.795
So this is an array of projects, And

57
00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:53.024
we're just going to add in super Project,

58
00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.573
And help Project.

59
00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:01.640
So far, so good.

60
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.960
Now let's take this and flip it just a
little bit and turn it into future state.

61
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.432
So, what I will do here and for the sake
of kind of grouping this all together.

62
00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:19.440
I'm kind of keeping
the project stuff together and

63
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.150
the client stuff together, but.

64
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.190
General, what I will do is kind of group
my interfaces together, so interface.

65
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.890
We'll call this project's state.

66
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.820
And.

67
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.555
This is going to have projects and

68
00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:42.861
the reason why this is not
extending base entity is.

69
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:47.265
Because this is actually
representing a composition of

70
00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:50.570
entities that live like in the database.

71
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.409
So this is actually a composed
Essentially data structure that we are,

72
00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.073
we're basically defining here,
a project is an array of projects.

73
00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:10.659
And Current project is project.

74
00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.300
All right?

75
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.798
And then from here Const newproject.

76
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:29.510
Null, title, description,

77
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.555
and completed is false.

78
00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:35.014
Okay.

79
00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:39.859
Then what we'll do is let's create

80
00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:45.200
an instance of our initial state.

81
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.220
So const initial projects
state is project state.

82
00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.601
And this is going to have projects so
we're able to use that.

83
00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:10.140
And then current project is going to
be is it new project there we go.

84
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.070
All right.

85
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.128
We just dump the cell and
see if this word.

86
00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:23.118
Alright, as expected, and so now,

87
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:28.139
we have kind of from the backside,
worked into

88
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.780
defining or composite compositing objects.

89
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.750
In a way that we can define future step.

90
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:46.250
And then let me just show you something
interesting since we're here.

91
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.101
And I was not planning on doing this,

92
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:55.961
but what we could do is Do AppState and

93
00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:04.056
We could do something like this interface.

94
00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:11.581
AppState equals clients

95
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:19.657
State Which is clients,

96
00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:25.521
state and projects, state.

97
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:35.572
And so now I can define.

98
00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:39.626
My AppState, like this.

99
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:46.618
ClientState is initialClientState,

100
00:07:46.618 --> 00:07:54.251
projectsState is initialProjectstate.

101
00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:03.565
And so notice what we're doing
now is we're just taking objects.

102
00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:09.291
And we're just putting
them together in a way,

103
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:15.050
where you can now define we take objects.

104
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.116
We put them into collections.

105
00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:19.610
And we put them into state objects.

106
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.920
We put those or feature state objects,
we put those together.

107
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.950
And now we have application state.

108
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.430
And so we're just building
on these little bitty ideas.

109
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.740
Until they start to look like something.

110
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.670
&gt;&gt; It's wonderful.

111
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.540
This really helps me
understand how the NgRx works.

112
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.210
&gt;&gt; NgRx, we're not talking about NgRx.

113
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.797
&gt;&gt; Inducer [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Aah, you spoil the surprise [LAUGH].

114
00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:54.900
So The comment was that
this is really helpful.

115
00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:02.520
It is helping illuminate
how NGRS works well.

116
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:08.235
My response was NGRS who's
talking about NGRS or Redux,

117
00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:13.354
but those who are a student
Like this is where we're

118
00:09:13.354 --> 00:09:19.426
going with this is that we
are moving into building something

119
00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:24.450
that exists to provide
proper state management.

120
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.730
But we're doing it in a way
that is accessible to.

121
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.199
A five year old or ten year old like
we're doing this piece by piece by piece.

122
00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:41.030
I saw an eyebrow raised like a five
year old Well, I don't know.
