00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.110
I think at this point we probably
have a good idea of what i'm

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.548
hinting at in terms of
what we're building.

3
00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:11.690
Not a super surprise.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.707
We're just incrementally plodding along.

5
00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:19.886
And we are going somewhere with this.

6
00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:25.771
And so if I go and I look for,
I'm going to take my clients store and

7
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.306
I'm going to just move this down here.

8
00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:42.033
And I'm going to make
a couple changes to this.

9
00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.566
I'm going to add in a reducer property.

10
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:51.043
I'm going to reduce her parameter.

11
00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:56.520
And so when you create the store

12
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.733
it's also going to take

13
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:06.220
reducer this reducer equals.

14
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.399
And then from here,

15
00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.757
we're going to add in one more method and

16
00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:20.253
it's going to be dispatch.

17
00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:23.923
Which is going to take an action.

18
00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:27.067
And I can even strongly type this if I so
desire.

19
00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:32.825
And now this state equals this

20
00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:39.938
dot reducer this dot state action.

21
00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:45.104
Now, within this I'm going to

22
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:50.270
send in the clients reducer and

23
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.850
let's try something out.

24
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:04.442
So const I might have already done this.

25
00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:09.974
Let me see, I'm just gonna a client
equals and we're gonna go.

26
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.283
Clients store, select.

27
00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:19.710
Current client.

28
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.321
And I'm gonna save this, and
then I'm gonna go down here.

29
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.672
Let's just dump this out.

30
00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:37.652
And just resize this so we can see it.

31
00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:41.792
As expected,
we're getting the current client.

32
00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:43.270
So now let's go back up here.

33
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.082
And let's dispatch an action.

34
00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:55.192
So store dispatch.

35
00:02:56.418 --> 00:03:00.711
Hold on, client

36
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:05.931
store, dispatch.

37
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:10.356
And we're going to set in

38
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:14.790
a type of client, select

39
00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:24.730
And we're going to send in

40
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.954
a payload Of,

41
00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:37.974
Let me create a new client real quick.

42
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:41.699
Const.

43
00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.346
Who am I into right now?

44
00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:52.511
Well, [BLANK AUDIO]The

45
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:57.765
most unoriginal I totally

46
00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:01.595
got stage fright.

47
00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:06.293
Not really but[BLANK AUDIO]

48
00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:11.533
when your ID equals 1234 first

49
00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:16.419
name Shane Last name, though.

50
00:04:20.418 --> 00:04:25.958
Company is a non.

51
00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.819
All right.
So now I'm going to say I want

52
00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.176
to create a new client and so

53
00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:41.442
I did select let me do CLIENT_CREATE.

54
00:04:41.442 --> 00:04:42.740
There we go.

55
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.935
And I'm going to send in a new client and
then from here what I wanna do.

56
00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:55.282
Is I want to go All

57
00:04:55.282 --> 00:05:00.121
clients equals client

58
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:05.223
store select clients.

59
00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:07.663
I'm going to go ahead and save this.

60
00:05:07.663 --> 00:05:12.093
And I'm going to go down here and
we're going to trace this out.

61
00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:20.425
I really hope that when I
move this back that we have.
