00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.621
We can use streams to
sequence other streams.

2
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:10.761
And so we can use a stream to trigger
a stream and to shut down a stream.

3
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.445
This is an important concept.

4
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.351
It's very applicable to the DOM.

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:18.610
But it is also when you start
thinking about sequencing,

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.478
like asynchronous communication between
servers, this is also important.

7
00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:29.737
So let's look at this code right here and
let's segment it.

8
00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:33.918
So what I'm describing is drag and drop.

9
00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:38.790
So when you think of drag and drop, what
are kind of the three main points of that?

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.151
So mouse down, mouse move,
mouse up, down, over up.

11
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.341
And so these are the events
that we need to capture.

12
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:54.572
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're

13
00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:59.815
going to define two streams down and move.

14
00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:04.009
And so, for down, it's pretty simple.

15
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.432
We simply say, capture the mouse
down event, start a string.

16
00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:14.322
For our move this is a little bit
more intense because we're having

17
00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:16.341
to capture to some offset.

18
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:22.174
And so you'll notice here ironically
that we have this dollar parentheses.

19
00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:24.232
What is that?

20
00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:29.517
Well, it's jQuery,
like when you're calculating offset from

21
00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:35.184
an L like a relative offset,
like if I click on this particular point,

22
00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:40.682
what is the offset to its parent object,
and not the entire window?

23
00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:45.778
So for me, the best tool that I found for
that is jQuery.

24
00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:50.267
jQuery was very good at DOM selection.

25
00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:54.758
And those particular things when it
veered off into everything else,

26
00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:58.727
that's when I think jQuery did
a Fonzie and jumped the shark.

27
00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:03.368
But all we're doing here is
we're taking the mouse event and

28
00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:06.471
converting it into an x, y coordinate.

29
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:12.089
And now,
this is where it gets interesting.

30
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:17.557
So we're saying down and
then we're hitting the switch map.

31
00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:19.933
So we know what map does.

32
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:23.262
It takes one thing and
it turns it into another.

33
00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:25.151
So what do we think switch map does?

34
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:33.303
Well, it essentially maps its output
by switching to a new stream.

35
00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:40.180
So what is going into the rest of
the stream underneath a switch map,

36
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.776
what is the stream that
we're dealing with?

37
00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:46.904
It's this.

38
00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:51.768
So how this works is we're saying on

39
00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:56.633
the downstream start the stream but

40
00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:02.974
then immediately switch
to the mouse stream.

41
00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:11.400
Until you have your upstream.

42
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.525
And so this is a really
elegant way to sequence and

43
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:22.025
communicate a very natural
interaction down stream

44
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:26.903
switch to the move stream until and
upstream.

45
00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:32.034
And so in one line of code or
two lines of code,

46
00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:37.167
we've done a really good
job of capturing and

47
00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:44.327
sequencing this stream of user
events as it pertains to drag and

48
00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:49.076
drop, which looks like this right here.

49
00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:50.639
Pretty simple.

50
00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.713
[SOUND] We're able to just drag it
around until I let the mouse up and

51
00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:59.264
down the Stream starting.

52
00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.478
So you can see here even it's
kinda jumping on my mouse a bit.

53
00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:04.446
Well, I have to fiddle
with kinda that offset.

54
00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:08.034
But I think we had this idea
that when my mouse is down and

55
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:12.094
I'm dragging it's cool the minute
I went up the stream stop.

56
00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:17.953
So down, switch to move until up.
