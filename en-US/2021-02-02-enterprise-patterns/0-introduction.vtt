00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.923
Welcome to Enterprise Patterns,
featuring TypeScript and

2
00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:09.348
what we're gonna do today is,
we're gonna hang out and

3
00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm gonna show you the patterns,
more importantly,

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.974
the mental models that I use to
program enterprise applications.

5
00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:23.093
And so
this is a little bit off script, but

6
00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:28.360
this is probably out of
all the courses I've done.

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.212
I am the most excited about this,
because in the course of this workshop,

8
00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:40.530
I'm going to attempt to take
everyone from ground zero.

9
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.913
And incrementally built in such a way
that when we're finished, that we will

10
00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:52.780
have arrived at the most complex type of
programming that I'm doing right now.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.872
And when we talk about Enterprise
applications and Enterprise patterns,

12
00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:05.360
I think the fallacy is a lot of
individuals start to think of complexity.

13
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.198
That we're going to introduce complex
things to help us do more complex things.

14
00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:17.637
But in reality, when you look at patterns,

15
00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:23.880
patterns exist to eliminate complexity.

16
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.258
And so,
as a person progresses in a skill set,

17
00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:34.940
they start to build on their techniques,
build, build, build.

18
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.364
And then at some point,

19
00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:41.065
they start to realize that there's
these patterns that exist, that they're

20
00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:46.100
starting to see repeated across a couple
of different domains or context.

21
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.710
And then eventually, they start to
reduce everything into some core

22
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.570
fundamental principles,
that they use over and over.

23
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.646
And so this is my attempt to
share the things that for me,

24
00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:05.154
are for programming for 20 years,
that I honestly believe

25
00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:11.418
,that I could write down everything
that I know about programming,

26
00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:16.220
and I do as a programmer
on a single piece of paper.

27
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.068
And so this could be flawlessly ambitious,

28
00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:25.090
but I do believe very much
that it will be helpful.

29
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.130
And so here's the Agenda.

30
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.640
We're gonna talk about
managing complexity.

31
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.090
We're gonna talk about local complexity,

32
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.510
which I will refer to as
kind of micro complexity.

33
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.050
And I'm going to introduce
the axis of evil and so on.

34
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.895
I've talked about this before, but

35
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:45.490
we're gonna walk through this
in a very specific fashion.

36
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.780
From there, we're gonna talk
about feature complexity or

37
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.360
what I would call mezzo complexity.

38
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.025
And I'm gonna To introduce
the four elements of programming.

39
00:02:55.025 --> 00:03:00.164
And then, from there,
I'm going to talk about application

40
00:03:00.164 --> 00:03:04.515
complexity and
the fifth element of programming.

41
00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:11.010
And then kind of as a grand finale,
that we're going to talk about

42
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.816
how to take all of that and
talk about distributed complexity,

43
00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:21.800
which I believe that, when you talk
about enterprise applications at scale,

44
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.976
especially with the cloud,

45
00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:28.720
what you are looking at is
distributed complexity at scale.

46
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.330
And so this is where ultimately, I hope
to end up by the end of this workshop.

47
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.000
And so
there's some resources that I've prepared.

48
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.200
And, if you go to this repo,
then you can clone it and

49
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.400
we are going to work through this.

50
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.630
And in the read me,
it talks about how to get up and running.

51
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.296
The caveat I would say, is that,

52
00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:58.780
what I'm going to talk about,
is framework agnostic?

53
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.095
With that said, I'm going to use a few
angular bits to just kind of hold things

54
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:09.955
together and create some presentation
elements so that we can help make

55
00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:14.980
the points or illustrate these concepts
in a way that we can see it easier.

56
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.260
So, this is the repo for the course,
but [COUGH] I've also produced a few

57
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.850
stack blitz, that you can just hop in
if you don't want to download the repo.

58
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.930
So most of what we're doing today, you
can do just right inside of stack blitz.

59
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.179
So the first section we're gonna talk
about a refactoring example, you can

60
00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:44.030
go here, and then when we get to the fifth
element, I'll be talking about time.

61
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.410
You can also go to these links as well and
work through those along with me.

62
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.990
So I've done as much as I can to
keep the framework piece out of it.

63
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.270
Because I just want to
talk about programming.

64
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.945
And [COUGH] one other thing
worth mentioning is that,

65
00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:09.130
we're going to be using stack Blitz for
a lot of this in using TypeScript.

66
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.159
And so if you just go to stackblitz.com,
you can click on TypeScript and

67
00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.950
you can start a project and so
let me hope into the browser.

68
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.160
And i'll just illustrate
this one point real quick.

69
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.390
So we'll just go to stapplets.com and in
this case because I'm logged in, you can.

70
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.793
It's showing all my projects but
you can just click on TypeScript and

71
00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:33.420
we have a blank TypeScript project.

72
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.195
All right with that said
back in to the slides.

73
00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:42.843
And now [COUGH] let's start
at the beginning, and

74
00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:49.060
I'm going to set some context for
the narrative arc.

75
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.840
When I decided that I wanted to program,
I was incredibly enthusiastic.

76
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.420
And I remember that I decided
that I want to be a programmer.

77
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.160
Specifically, I wanted to
be a flashpro programmer.

78
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.396
We know how that turned out,
but with that said, I went and

79
00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:11.760
I found the best programmer I could find.

80
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.020
And I went to this person, I'm like,
I want you to teach me how to program.

81
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.195
And this individual was like, sure on,
I'd be happy to teach you to program and

82
00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:27.356
essentially, this, my mentor was like,
we're gonna do this and

83
00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:33.190
it felt a lot like I was painting fences,
and it didn't make a lot of sense.

84
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.900
And then my mentor was like,
well, let's do this for a while.

85
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.270
And I'm like, no like you don't
understand I want to program.

86
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.380
I wanna be a hacker and an elevator shaft,
doing really cool things.

87
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.290
I don't wanna do this.

88
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.104
And so in my mind,
[COUGH] when I thought of programming,

89
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:58.293
it was kind of that hacker Individually
that you see on Hollywood television,

90
00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:01.740
and that's what I thought programming was.

91
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.570
And this individual wisely said, no,

92
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.220
we're going to do these things and
they were very repetitious.

93
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.210
They were very mundane.

94
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.503
And then, at some point, it was like,

95
00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:17.560
we're going to do these things to decide
if it makes sense, it's gonna get weird.

96
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.020
Really weird.

97
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.482
And from there, I kind of I
still I didn't understand like,

98
00:07:25.482 --> 00:07:28.160
why am I doing these things and

99
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.194
the course of my arc in my
progression as a programmer is I

100
00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:38.250
found myself doing things
that didn't make sense but.

101
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:45.331
I realized that we do this thing
right here, these very intentional

102
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:50.300
practices and these mindful
practices when we programmer.

103
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.258
So if you go read clean code or a lot
of these old kind of perennial books on

104
00:07:55.258 --> 00:08:00.963
software engineering, there's a reason
why they talk about doing code katas And

105
00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:05.346
the reason why you do for
instance code kata is interesting they

106
00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:08.680
call it that is we do this for
moments like this.

107
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.977
There's going to be a time when
everything is breaking, falling apart and

108
00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:19.690
it's a high torque situation and
you're going to be very glad.

109
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.086
That you took the time to commit to
first principles in programming so

110
00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:28.620
that you can stand on
the beach if you will, or

111
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.992
in a low torque environment and
pick these skills up, so

112
00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:38.190
that when you get in situations like this,
it's muscle memory.

113
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.837
And so this is [COUGH] something one of my
favorite funded masters instructors will

114
00:08:42.837 --> 00:08:43.990
sentence.

115
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.070
He is the master for first principles and
really breaking things down to the core.

116
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:55.337
And philosophically, I completely
agree because you're going to run

117
00:08:55.337 --> 00:09:02.710
into these situations when you're going
to be extremely glad, that you did this.

118
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.105
And so, as we start on this course,

119
00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:10.636
in this workshop,
the course of the workshop,

120
00:09:10.636 --> 00:09:16.071
that we are going to start
with some very basic patterns,

121
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:20.060
we are going to start painting the fence.

122
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.590
We're going to wax the car.

123
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.347
And I realize that making Karate Kid
references that there is a contingent of

124
00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:33.010
viewers that may not even
know about this movie.

125
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:39.054
If you haven't seen it go check it out,
it's awesome, but If we focus on these and

126
00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:43.500
if you'll trust me to go through
these simplest examples.

127
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.633
And I know that there's going to
be some of us that are like look,

128
00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:50.220
I already know how to do this.

129
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.890
I know how to paint a fence,
I know how to wax a car.

130
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:59.120
But at some point, everything is
going to click, and it will connect.

131
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.420
And, I promise that we
are going somewhere.

132
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.980
It's not going to be here.

133
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.110
But, there is a very specific arc.

134
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.187
And what I believe more than anything,

135
00:10:09.187 --> 00:10:15.260
is that as you progress as an engineer,
that you start to reduce complexity.

136
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.824
To a very few patterns that
you use over and over and

137
00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:24.402
these are what I want to share with you,

138
00:10:24.402 --> 00:10:28.940
that has made me a very
effective developer.

139
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.252
After 20 years, I realized everything
that I can do, I can write

140
00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:38.190
on a single piece of paper, and this
is what we're here to talk about today.

141
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.230
Should you start in the repo or
in the stack blitz?

142
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.310
Personally, I like to work locally.

143
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.120
So I would start in the repo,
just pull it down.

144
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.806
But if for some reason you don't wanna do
that you can follow along in the stack

145
00:10:53.806 --> 00:10:58.150
blitz, so it's just a way to give
some individuals some more options.
