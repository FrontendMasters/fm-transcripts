1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.136
What I'm going to ask everybody to do
is to just adopt a beginner's mindset.

2
00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:14.389
And I want you for a moment to stop and

3
00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:22.983
imagine that you don't understand
how to program at all.

4
00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:28.725
This is where we are going to
approach feature complexity and

5
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:33.470
how we start to think
about code in general.

6
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.547
And so in that, I want to introduce
the four elements of programming.

7
00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:44.284
And this I would have to
say if I had to stop and

8
00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:48.930
think about what is the most
important thing that I've

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.687
realized after 20 years of programming,
this is it.

10
00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:58.007
This is my master thesis
on programming and so

11
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:03.236
carrying on with the Karate Kid theme,
as I stopped and

12
00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:07.671
I looked back, and
I've been programming for

13
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:13.860
20 years and I've written a lot,
a lot, a lot of code.

14
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.918
And quite frankly for
probably the first 10 years I was not very

15
00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:23.989
good at all and, it's not that I
wasn't good at all, as in bad.

16
00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.824
But I hadn't reached
a level of proficiency,

17
00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:32.930
that I would kind of expect
from a senior architect.

18
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.439
And I started looking at this arc,

19
00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.403
of myself programming and
how I learned things.

20
00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:48.700
And I realized that when I'm programming,

21
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.025
I'm essentially doing the same

22
00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:58.567
four things over and over.

23
00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:04.611
There are four things somebody said
when you program tell me what you do and

24
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:08.230
I would say it's four things, that's it.

25
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.511
I'm describing things, nouns,
and performing actions,

26
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.756
verbs, I'm making decisions,
conditions and

27
00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:21.700
then repeating the iteration, that's it.

28
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.516
When I program it's four things, nouns,

29
00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:33.362
verbs, conditions, and iterators.

30
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:39.109
You can take the most complex code
that I'm writing right now and

31
00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.814
by accomplishing, I would say the most
sophisticated large scale code and

32
00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:52.217
everything that I'm doing can be
distilled into these four elements.

33
00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:57.248
Nouns, verbs, or
data structures, functions,

34
00:02:57.248 --> 00:03:03.802
conditionals and iterators and
what's interesting about this,

35
00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:08.599
I arrived at this conclusion
as I was kind of going

36
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.812
on this rant with some
of my apprentices and

37
00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:17.843
I was wanting them,
to simplify their thinking and

38
00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.960
they were just making it way too complex.

39
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.624
In a bit of frustration I kind
of stamped my foot and I said,

40
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:31.149
everything that I'm asking you to do, in
fact, everything I know about programming.

41
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:36.710
I can write on a single piece of paper and
they're, really, challenge accepted,

42
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.236
go and in the process of articulating it,
this is where, I arrived at.

43
00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:46.114
These are, the four things,
that, I'm doing,

44
00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:51.111
now what's interesting is,
I quickly went down,

45
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:54.248
I wrote this, articulated it,

46
00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:59.029
that at the same time,
this lovely individual.

47
00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.153
I forget her name, off top my head but she
wrote a book salt, fat, heat and acid or

48
00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:06.628
might be salt, fat, acid, heat but
it's a great book on cooking.

49
00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:12.109
I think there seems to seem nosrat or
I'll think of in a second but if anybody

50
00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.112
knows that they can paste the link in but
she was talking about when she is cooking.

51
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:23.457
That there are four fundamental
things that you need

52
00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:29.288
to understand that if you understand salt,
fat, acid,

53
00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:36.830
heat that you can essentially be
effective in any kitchen in any context.

54
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.264
And there's a really good
like series on Netflix,

55
00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:45.809
she's amazing and highly check it out but

56
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:51.692
to me was kind of this vindication
of is it possible that this is true?

57
00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:55.930
And then salt, fat, acid he came out and
I'm, well, if it's for

58
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.600
cooking then certainly it can be for
programming.

59
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.125
Now, this is what's interesting
about this, again, we're going back

60
00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:10.293
to the beginners mindset because I
really want to start at nothing and

61
00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:15.211
I want to build up a foundation of
how we think about programming.

62
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:19.771
So I realized that I've
been doing these things

63
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.423
since I was a very, very small child.

64
00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:28.385
That as engineers,
the things that we use to write

65
00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:33.349
software in these techniques
we intuitively know

66
00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.957
as small children from
the moment we can talk,

67
00:05:37.957 --> 00:05:42.580
and carry on a conversation and
communicate.

68
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.126
The problem is that we haven't
trained ourselves to think in

69
00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:54.026
the level of precision required
to communicate that in code.

70
00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:57.733
But the things that we're doing and we're
doing every day without thinking about it,

71
00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.020
we've been doing for years.

72
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.149
Let me prove this with a thought exercise.

73
00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:09.312
Let's pretend that lunch is served,
and it's a healthy

74
00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:14.999
delicious lunch of donuts,
which is probably my favorite lunch.

75
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:20.156
And we have three trays of donuts,
we have a blue tray, a green tray, and

76
00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:25.670
a yellow tray, okay, everybody,
we can agree this what we're looking at.

77
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.676
Now, if I said to you,
or any small child, so

78
00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:36.609
imagine a five year old,
do you see those trays

79
00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:41.429
of donuts, okay,
do you see the green tray?

80
00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:45.749
On that tray,
find all the donuts that have

81
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:50.558
sprinkles on them,
then bring them back to me.

82
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.366
Is that confusing at all,
probably not, pretty straightforward.

83
00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:02.656
If you see the tray of donut trace, don't
go to the green tray find all the ones

84
00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:04.975
with sprinkles and bring them back to me.

85
00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:13.028
Now, what's interesting what I said
in just human possible language,

86
00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:17.260
you can also articulate that in code.

87
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.309
Trace.find, iterate over the tray,
If it's green, return it and

88
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:30.331
so now what you're seeing is
an iterator and a condition.

89
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:34.739
So I'm looking for the green tray then
I'm taking the selected tray with

90
00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:37.205
the donuts and I'm filtering through.

91
00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:38.812
So I'm iterating and

92
00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:44.800
I'm saying if this doughnut has sprinkles
put it in this new tray and return it.

93
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.208
And then child.fetch sprinkled doughnuts,

94
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:55.086
which by the way,
both my children have this method and

95
00:07:55.086 --> 00:08:01.362
they're very good at it,
100% code coverage but we look at this.

96
00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:07.345
And the statement here, it makes a lot of
sense, when we reframe it around nouns,

97
00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:12.637
verbs, conditions and iterators,
we realize we can express something

98
00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:17.760
that is very easy for
us to understand as human beings in code.

99
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.549
And so this is why I'm pulling us
back to this very foundation of,

100
00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:25.988
let's start ground zero.

101
00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:31.294
And let's build up on these concepts and
let's make something.
