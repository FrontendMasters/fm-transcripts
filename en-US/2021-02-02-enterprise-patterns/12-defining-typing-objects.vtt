00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's get into actually
building something.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.422
So what I want to do,
let me just step into the IDE,

3
00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:13.760
and we're going to start programming.

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.304
And so I'm gonna close this down and so

5
00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:25.643
right now we're running the micro app,

6
00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:30.920
but I'm going to spin up the meso app.

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.006
So we'll go here and we're gonna

8
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.366
go npm run serve:meso, and

9
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:46.460
you can do this from stacklets as well.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.430
This is nothing that I'm going
to do here is Angular specific.

11
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.352
And so within this, we have a very

12
00:00:57.352 --> 00:01:02.311
basic object that we are just porting out.

13
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:07.571
And let me just hop into my code,
and let's run this side by side.

14
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:20.910
And what I'm also going to do is,
I'm just gonna set this to false.

15
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.520
Let me just refresh this hopefully.

16
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.100
If I just save this, what I wanna do is I
want the sidebar to go away, and it's not.

17
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.420
I don't really care that much.

18
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.841
But, I'll figure that out in a moment.

19
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.780
That's why, I'm in the micro app.

20
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.002
So in the meso app,
back into the home component, or

21
00:01:55.002 --> 00:02:00.870
the app component rather,
I'm gonna set this to false.

22
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.600
We'll save this.

23
00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:10.679
There we go.
All right, so if you're running the app,

24
00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.789
this is what you should see,
if not you can do

25
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:19.820
everything right inside of Stacklets,
no problem.

26
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.205
All right, so within our application,
I'm gonna just put this side by side.

27
00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:27.190
Let's go over here.

28
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.075
Let's run the meso, all right.

29
00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:58.022
I'm going to delete everything in here,
well,

30
00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:01.908
there's nothing in here or not much.

31
00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:07.990
And let's start from the beginning.

32
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.550
So I'm just gonna kind of jump in here and
we're gonna start building this out.

33
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.070
And so you can see here,
it's just an empty object.

34
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.410
And so as you start to type this out,

35
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.573
all we're gonna do is we're
just going to dump this out.

36
00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:32.325
So, within this, let's define a client.

37
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:37.506
And we'll just call this client and

38
00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:41.630
we'll give it an id of 1.

39
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.550
First name is, Peter, I really quite like,

40
00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:59.890
This, and
we'll go with company is Acme, Inc.

41
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.363
Now what I can do here is I can
just go and, I can assign this,

42
00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:13.600
so whatever, I'm just basically whatever
Tango is, I'm just dumping it out.

43
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.633
And we're seeing this here.

44
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:20.730
Now, what we can do is
let's strongly type this.

45
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.526
So we're gonna go interface, Client and

46
00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:32.474
we're gonna go firstName is a string,

47
00:04:32.474 --> 00:04:37.160
lastName is also a string, and

48
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.420
company is a string.

49
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.672
Now, from here,
one thing that I have started doing is,

50
00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:50.702
Typically, what I'll do is I

51
00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:57.143
will create a BaseEntity interface,

52
00:04:57.143 --> 00:05:04.610
and I'll set an id on this to string or
null.

53
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.264
And I would recommend if
you're setting IDs and

54
00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:11.639
you're creating that interface, I would
set it to a string, never a number,

55
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.303
because you have 9 digits as a number, you
have 26 plus 9 if you do it as a string.

56
00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:18.890
So you just get more options.

57
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.980
And then from here,
extends BaseEntity, and so

58
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.466
what you can also do is have essentially
a contract invoke another contract,

59
00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:36.466
which is what's happening here, so
I'm gonna say Peter is of type client.

60
00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:39.669
We'll dump this out.

61
00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.458
Now, notice I'm gonna save this and

62
00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:48.012
it's compiling okay, but

63
00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:53.360
we're getting an error in the IDE.

64
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.639
So this is a really, really nice
safety net that in loosely typed or

65
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.275
non typed JavaScript that I got
burnt by this all the time.

66
00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:08.564
So this is strongly typed data
structures is just a nice little safety

67
00:06:08.564 --> 00:06:13.774
net that allows you to kind of proceed and
kind of catch it on the way.

68
00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:21.120
So when I see these red wiggly squiggly
lines, it's like something's wrong.

69
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.546
And so what am I missing?

70
00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:26.664
Well, it's telling me,
by the way, auto sense, or

71
00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:31.310
auto suggest in an IDE for
JavaScript is amazing.

72
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.100
Every time it happens and it works,
I pour champagne out on the ground.

73
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.550
So let me do another one.

74
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:45.150
We'll just go john, Client.

75
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.261
This is also a client and

76
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:52.778
we'll go id 2, firstName John.

77
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.496
Company is not available.

78
00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:03.665
All right, so now what we can do is we can

79
00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:09.777
create a collection or
an array to hold those,

80
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:14.510
so clients is an array of clients.

81
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:21.270
And so we're just saying this square
brackets are a shorthand for array, and

82
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.300
we're saying that this has, or
it is an array of client objects.

83
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.438
And then from here,
we can go peter and john.

84
00:07:31.438 --> 00:07:36.374
And what we should be
able to do from here,

85
00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:40.070
clients save, here we go.

86
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.603
So at this point, if you've been
programming for more than a couple weeks,

87
00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:50.540
we've done something that I'm
certain you've done this before.
