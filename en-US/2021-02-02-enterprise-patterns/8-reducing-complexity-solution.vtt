00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.640
Let's see the solution for this exercise.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.787
So, I'm gonna hop into the code and

3
00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:16.230
I'm going to start to
Fix this monstrosity.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.960
Now, what I'm going to do as well,
just as a reference.

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm going to look at the test.

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.245
So I've gone ahead and I've kind
of written test that should work,

7
00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:35.704
which in a way gives you an indication or

8
00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:41.330
a hint of what your code should look like.

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.030
And so you can see here
just off right on the gate.

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.631
You can see that we are looking for
update widgets,

11
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:53.804
get total price,
add widget update widget and

12
00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:59.460
we have a pretty good idea
of what we are looking for.

13
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.720
So from here, let's go ahead and
start to extract this.

14
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.650
So, what we need to do here
is we'll go update widget.

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.667
So this will be one method and

16
00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:25.552
then we'll do delete widget.

17
00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.290
And we're gonna go create widget.

18
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.890
And then I believe as you can see here
I already got this wrong, add widget.

19
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.578
And there's one more I'm looking for
get total price.

20
00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:49.121
Add widget, get total price,

21
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:52.965
Excel and then from here,

22
00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:57.506
what we can do is we can just copy

23
00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:02.860
this out and we can paste this in.

24
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.602
Now, what I'm gonna do is
a little bit of a kind of

25
00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:13.041
a mental thing is that in
a method it's not always bad but

26
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:18.599
when you find yourself
referencing this dot something,

27
00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:26.830
just stop and check and see if you can
possibly extract that out to a parameter.

28
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.980
And so in this case I can,
so I don't need this.

29
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.670
Instead, what I need to do is
I need to go widgets, widget.

30
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.336
All right, and so now this is a fairly
pure function that takes a collection and

31
00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:45.970
return something and it's going to
do the same thing every single time.

32
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.610
And from here,
what we'll do is we're just going to go

33
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.310
return this dot delete widget,
and we'll go widgets,

34
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.990
widget and so this is going
to obviously break initially.

35
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.970
But you can see here it's asking for
widget.

36
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.310
So let's update.

37
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.800
Well, let's do these methods first and
then we'll go through and continue.

38
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.860
I'm kind of coming from the bottom up,
but you could also go from the top down.

39
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.763
So from here to update,
we're going to copy this right here.

40
00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:26.809
And We'll

41
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:31.500
pass in widgets and widget.

42
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.000
There we go.

43
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.700
Clean this up.

44
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.295
And now let's go to the next one.

45
00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:47.314
And I can delete this
instead of the return,

46
00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:54.270
return this dot update widget,
widgets, widget.

47
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.438
And from here, one more.

48
00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:06.976
And this one is a little
funny in the sense of we're

49
00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:11.540
faking that we're pulling from a database.

50
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.028
And so we're having to kind
of hard code or not hardcore,

51
00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:19.050
but generate a UUID for it.

52
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.548
And so
this is why you are seeing this little

53
00:04:24.548 --> 00:04:29.950
bit of gymnastics here, all right?

54
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.789
And so now we have three methods that it
takes widgets and it takes a widget and

55
00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.860
then it essentially performs that function
and returns a new widgets collections.

56
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.460
By the way,
these are immutable operations.

57
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.640
We'll talk about these later.

58
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.270
But I just wanted to point that out.

59
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.407
And so from here, return this dot

60
00:04:55.407 --> 00:05:00.331
add widget, widget, widget.

61
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:04.093
Okay, now let's go.

62
00:05:04.093 --> 00:05:09.746
Mode, widgets So

63
00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:13.740
we're gonna type this like so.

64
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.210
And I believe mode is a string.

65
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.950
There we go.

66
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.550
And so
now we are getting rid of mode here.

67
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.839
And let's also do this last one here

68
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:45.132
Which will take just widgets.

69
00:05:57.888 --> 00:05:59.372
All right.

70
00:05:59.372 --> 00:06:01.738
So I've kind of broken it out but

71
00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:06.745
I still have the single responsibility
principle violation here.

72
00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:11.730
And so let's see if I have any hints
in here about what is going on.

73
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.530
So here we have it, update widgets.

74
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.688
So let me go back to here and we're going

75
00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:27.083
to create a new method okay,
widgets which takes

76
00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:36.320
Mode widgets and a widget.

77
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.200
And I suppose I could have just
renamed this one up here that,

78
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.850
I wanted to show us
actually moving this out.

79
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.470
Oops, I'll paste this in here.

80
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.200
And then let's just pick this up.

81
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.550
And we'll go here.

82
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:03.888
So now we'll say this widgets
equals this update widgets.

83
00:07:03.888 --> 00:07:09.309
Mode, widgets, widget,

84
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:16.998
Widgets.

85
00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:17.550
There we go.

86
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.337
And so
just to walk through this real quick,

87
00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:25.817
I think I've done everything correctly.

88
00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:34.010
Other than I'm missing a mock widget.

89
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.175
No problem.
You can copy this here, but

90
00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:42.310
let's actually let's look at the code.

91
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.040
Let's run the test.

92
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.660
I think we might have
one little tiny issue.

93
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.800
But we can check that.

94
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.040
So notice in the recalculate
total that I've extracted

95
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.620
all of that functionality
out into two methods.

96
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.270
And then I've taken the nested logic.

97
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.621
I've extracted those out
into standalone methods.

98
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:12.834
And then from there, I've abstracted or
extracted the mode from internal state or

99
00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:19.720
hidden state to a parameter that we
provide via dependency injection.

100
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.340
So let me save this.

101
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.920
And let's go into the command line.

102
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.069
And let's run this.

103
00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:35.880
And let me real quick,
let me make this bigger, there we go.

104
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.574
So let's run this and see what happens.

105
00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:47.018
One failed, so right here,

106
00:08:47.018 --> 00:08:51.810
we need to make this
a probably a mock widget.

107
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.960
So let's hop back in our code.

108
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.830
I thought that was going to happen.

109
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.108
Let's see if we can fix this.

110
00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:04.745
I'm just going to copy this.

111
00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:07.451
So we have a mock widget.

112
00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:09.236
Where is this angry?

113
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.235
We'll just go here.

114
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.813
So I've just defined a mock widget.

115
00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:30.850
So this is just me getting
this test working.

116
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.846
A small little hiccup and
it's because I have strongly typed

117
00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.039
This, all right.

118
00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:50.997
I'm not seeing any more.

119
00:09:50.997 --> 00:09:52.285
Let me set this right here.

120
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.120
Save this.

121
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.362
And so all I did is before I had
not typed that as a widget and

122
00:10:05.362 --> 00:10:09.048
the tests were able to pass but
since I went ahead and

123
00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:13.030
strongly typed it then it's
got a little angry at me.

124
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.270
So back here,
let's see if we can get this working.

125
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.458
Every time I run unitest I start making
deals with God like if this just passed

126
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:28.440
I'll never eat another carbohydrate again,
I promise to be good.

127
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.267
But looks like I did eat pizza for
lunch, but I'm glad my test pass.

128
00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.668
All right.
