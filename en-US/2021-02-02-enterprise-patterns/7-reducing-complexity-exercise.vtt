00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.614
Let's move into a challenge and
I'll set the challenge and

2
00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:09.620
then we can take a break,
come back and I will solve it.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.780
So the challenge is this.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.904
In the Repu, if you downloaded it,
navigate to this component,

5
00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:26.026
and what you want to do
is refactor the service,

6
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.630
so that the test in the spec pass.

7
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.650
You can validate this by
running this command here.

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.339
Now, if you did knock down the Repu or
download the Repu, you can go to

9
00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.880
the stack Blitz and just refactor it,
you're not going to be able to test it.

10
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.070
But when I go over the solution, you'll
be able to compare your work with that.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.427
So this is kind of a double bonus day that
not only are we going to refactor it,

12
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.220
but we're going to do it in
the context of unit tests.
