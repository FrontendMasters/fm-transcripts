00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.066
Open up your input.component
file in the code,

2
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:12.037
capture the searchControl output and

3
00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:16.240
input it into the queryString.

4
00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:22.711
Then what I want you to
do is map the output,

5
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:29.082
tall uppercase letters and
if you're feeling super ambitious.

6
00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:33.371
Then you could reverse the letters or

7
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.803
you could even URL encode the output.

8
00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.216
So we go into the code real quick and

9
00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:46.278
you may have to close your eyes and
delete the code,

10
00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:52.190
as I may have put it in here,
but in the examples form input.

11
00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.216
Quick, we go in here, just delete it and

12
00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:05.958
then put it back together, so
it's in here, but on your honor.

13
00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.582
Let's just delete this and
let's just do a quick five

14
00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:15.531
minute break where we solve
this particular challenge.

15
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:19.955
So we'll do a couple of little
micro challenges here, and

16
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.770
then we will move on so.

17
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.974
Within the practical examples,
open up input component,

18
00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:33.647
got it, and then capture your search
control and put it into a query string.

19
00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:37.955
So, think about that,
just put your thinking caps on,

20
00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.256
input it into a query string.

21
00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.770
Well we know what that is,
we know what final input is,

22
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.187
think about initial output,
how would you do that?

23
00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:50.422
And then think about how
you would transform it into

24
00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:55.657
all uppercase letters,
how you would reverse it,

25
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.445
and then how you would URL encode it.
