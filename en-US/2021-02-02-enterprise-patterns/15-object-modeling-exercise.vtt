00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.223
What I want you to do is I want
you to create an object that

2
00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:07.910
represents a client project.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.850
And then add some appropriate
properties to your new project.

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.281
So typically for me,

5
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.860
I would just default if I'm just stubbing
something out to title and description.

6
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.067
Create an interface that
represents your project model and

7
00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:30.140
then create an array of project objects.

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.383
Now, from here,
this is where this gets important,

9
00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:38.970
is that I want you to create
an interface to represent project state.

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.030
And initial state object that
implements the project state interface.
