00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.550
We understand that we live
in a world of objects.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.858
We also understand that we can
do things with these objects,

3
00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:14.520
we can manipulate them that
objects themselves can do things.

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.010
And so whereas we were talking about
nouns, let's talk about verbs.

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.570
So time to wax the car.

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.279
We have a function and
what this does is it takes state and

7
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.248
it takes an object and, so
it takes really two objects,

8
00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:36.720
and then it just returns another object.

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.513
And so we can think of a function
is that it's just a unit

10
00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:46.110
that we give it something and
we get something back.

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.172
Now, what I want to show here is this is
kind of your classic s5ish method and

12
00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:59.120
going forward,
we're going to be using fat arrows.

13
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.222
So, this is what this looks like,
all we've done is we've just taken

14
00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:09.500
the function piece, dropped it off and
put a fat arrow on the other side.

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.520
That's the simplest way to convert it.

16
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.504
Now what we have is
the ability to not only

17
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:21.635
call a method and
how to do something and so

18
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:27.220
in this case,
select client is very simple.

19
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.338
It's just taking two objects and
returning a new object.

20
00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:35.759
And from here,
we're able to call that method and

21
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.812
it does something more importantly,
is that we're able to call that method and

22
00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:48.416
have the result capture that,
and store that somewhere else.

23
00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:52.880
And so, this is just a very simple,
I think,

24
00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.750
almost obvious kind of tenant about
methods, is that you can call them.

25
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.738
But a lot of times you wanna structure
your code in a way that you can

26
00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.019
call it and store the result.

27
00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.706
The reason being is that when you
can store when you have a method

28
00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:16.686
that was turned something,
you can test the return or

29
00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:21.990
you can write an assertion on
the result of that function.

30
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.903
And so this is why for me, typically I
prefer methods that I pass something in,

31
00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:31.816
I get something out that I have a clear
contract with that method versus methods

32
00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:36.220
that you just call in and something
happens you don't know what it is.

33
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.578
There are times like that, but
more often than not Is when you can,

34
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:46.565
not all the time but when you could have
a method that actually does something and

35
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:48.890
then returns a value.

36
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.680
That is a much easier method to test.

37
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.465
So what we can do here,
is we can define a store, so

38
00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:05.735
think of this is just an object
that is keeping track of

39
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:11.060
the clients and the current client.

40
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.454
And so you could imagine
this would be maybe a place

41
00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:21.220
that our initial client state
may exist at some point.

42
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.886
And so what we can do now based on this,
is we can find the client store and

43
00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:31.608
then we can start to manipulate
it in the sense of we can say,

44
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:34.450
I want to create a new client store.

45
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.730
What is that?

46
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.886
Well, it's an object,
we are saying I want to create a new

47
00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:48.470
object that represents the store
in which I'm storing my clients.

48
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.668
Then I want this store to do things and so

49
00:03:52.668 --> 00:04:00.950
now we were going from data structures
with nouns to nouns with verbs.

50
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.046
And so we're saying I want to create this
noun and then once I have this noun or

51
00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:09.334
this data structure, which is nothing
more than when you instantiate a class,

52
00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:13.950
it returns an object, which is
nothing more than a data structure.

53
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.672
Some of those properties are methods that
you can then invoke and so in this case,

54
00:04:19.672 --> 00:04:25.058
clientstore.load putting the clients
in their clients store dot select or

55
00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:27.490
selecting a client.

56
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.804
And in this case, we're also

57
00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:37.481
creating a new client, so

58
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:43.008
going up to the clients section

59
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:47.915
here class clients store.

60
00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:53.193
And what we can do is we
can have clients we can

61
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:58.758
have a current client and
then what we can do and

62
00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:04.182
so this is just a transition
step we're going

63
00:05:04.182 --> 00:05:12.316
to clean this up in a little bit is
that it's going to take clients and

64
00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:19.720
we're just going to say this
clients equals clients.

65
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.735
And what I'm going to
say here is this is also

66
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:29.887
an array of clients and
it doesn't like the,

67
00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:36.950
fact that I have clients here and
then I'm setting it in here.

68
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.530
So let me go new clients like so and

69
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.583
I'm going to do a create
method new client,

70
00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:53.144
which is also a client and then I'm going

71
00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:59.209
to do something that is not awesome, well.

72
00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:08.059
It'll be fine, so we're gonna go
this clients equals this clients and

73
00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:14.270
so we'll talk about this particular
operator a little bit later.

74
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.939
But basically, I'm just saying,
create a new array and

75
00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:23.229
put the old clients and
then this new client in here.

76
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.934
Did forget one thing, so
load and we'll go select we'll,

77
00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:36.980
send in a client object, And notice
everything I'm doing up to this point,

78
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.400
I'm just defining essentially verbs,
and I'm attaching it to this instance.

79
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.106
And then from here, I'll just assign this

80
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:51.650
current client to the new client,
all right.

81
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.615
Now let's instantiate this client

82
00:06:56.615 --> 00:07:01.412
store equals new clients store and

83
00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:05.549
then let's do this, now, so

84
00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:09.860
really drive this point home.

85
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:18.367
I'm gonna set we'll save this And

86
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:23.298
notice that I've

87
00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:28.700
instantiated the class, but I haven't done
anything yet, so it's an empty object.

88
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.816
But now when I go clients door and
I say load,

89
00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:39.225
and then I pass in clients,
let's save this,

90
00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:46.520
Notice what's happening to the instance
of the client store that I've created.

91
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.876
Well, it's an object and so
I'm just adding stuff to it.

92
00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:55.275
Clients store select and

93
00:07:55.275 --> 00:08:00.159
let's go with Peter,

94
00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:06.850
all right, let's save this.

95
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.270
And so now we have an object and we have
methods that allows us to manipulate this.

96
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.280
So I could do the create a new one but
I think we are pretty solid on this.
