00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.178
What I would like everybody to do
is to create a project store class.

2
00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:07.679
And a state property to the class,

3
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.490
add a constructor that
accepts the state parameter.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.669
And it gets state method,
a select method and

5
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.440
then instantiate the project store
class with the initial state object.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.041
Call select on the class to
get the project's collection.
