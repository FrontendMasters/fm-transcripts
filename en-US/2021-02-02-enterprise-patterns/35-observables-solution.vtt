1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.902
Challenge here is that we
want to basically wire

2
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:09.301
up to the search control and
do some stuff.

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.630
[LAUGH] All right, let's do it.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.360
Now, the first thing we're gonna do,
we're gonna do engine in it.

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.150
That's not important.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.926
And now, what we need to do is

7
00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:30.304
we need to ask ourselves,

8
00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:35.294
where is the initial output?

9
00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:38.670
And so in this case, it's search control.

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.600
And I do apologize.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560
This is a little bit of an angular thing.

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.988
But one of the reasons why I
like angular is because not

13
00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:51.770
because it's angular,
I think it's cool enough.

14
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.730
But they've embraced a lot of
things that I really like.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.183
And so in this case, its value changes and

16
00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:07.436
what this returns is let me see
if you can see, right here.

17
00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:12.184
So on reactive forms, that when the value

18
00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:17.483
changes it is emitting
an observable stream.

19
00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:23.267
So, angular in this case
has a lot of this reactive

20
00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:28.240
functionality baked into the framework.

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.220
So now we have our observable stream.

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.772
So this is our initial output.

23
00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:39.228
And from here,

24
00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:46.373
Let's do our final input.

25
00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:53.512
We'll take this query and we're just
gonna say this query string equals query.

26
00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.580
Final input, so hopefully this
makes sense up to this point.

27
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.786
I'm gonna save this and
let's see what happens.

28
00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.650
So I'll go down here form input.

29
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.992
And if I'm half the programmer that
I think I am, I'll be able to type

30
00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:20.110
something in and lo and behold,
it's going to show up on the page.

31
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.410
So i feel pretty good.

32
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.690
It's a really good Thursday.

33
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.480
From here, now let's stack this in.

34
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.020
So we're gonna pipe and
let's do something.

35
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.870
We'll go map, we'll take the query and
you know what?

36
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.270
Let's just yolo,
I'm gonna go straight to the reverse.

37
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.570
And so we're going to return query.

38
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.483
Why did I do this?

39
00:02:53.483 --> 00:02:57.720
Split, which turns an array,
reverse, join.

40
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.283
[LAUGH] By the way,
I would just like to point out

41
00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:07.260
I'm still just, it's nouns and verbs.

42
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.681
All right, so I think what's happening
is I'm splitting on the strings,

43
00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:10.890
which turns an array.

44
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.170
I'm reversing the array and
I'm joining it back together.

45
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.630
Let's see.

46
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.586
We'll go here.

47
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:32.543
Maybe I'll do that one more time,
just to ensure that

48
00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:37.068
everybody is sufficiently
impressed with that.

49
00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:44.114
What we can also do is, From here,

50
00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:49.563
I can map again,
I can really do this kind of in any order.

51
00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:56.345
Let's go query to upper case.

52
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.818
Let's save this.

53
00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:05.860
And we'll go back here.

54
00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.852
And I realized this is kind
of a little nonsensical but

55
00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:24.560
what I wanna point out here
is that we are piping data.

56
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.510
In this case our input through
a stream and on the other end,

57
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.523
it's coming out in just
the way that we want.

58
00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:33.470
Which is fantastic.

59
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.540
What we can also do while I'll
leave that it for that right now.

60
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.632
Let me do one more.

61
00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:46.070
I'll take this one off,
I'll take both of these off.

62
00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:53.273
Query,

63
00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:04.094
I totally forgot how to do this.

64
00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:07.289
Is there a single method?

65
00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:14.164
So if somebody knows how to URL encode,
then feel free to hop in and

66
00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:19.290
save my life here so
I don't have to look this up.

67
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.270
Fine.

68
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.840
I'll look it up.

69
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.560
I'm gonna see this one time and I'm just
gonna be like, duh, that doesn't help.

70
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.428
Let's do this.

71
00:05:32.428 --> 00:05:35.234
JavaScript.

72
00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.210
All yeah.

73
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.470
Encode URI.

74
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.180
That's probably what I wanted.

75
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.390
All right.

76
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.497
Let's go back into our code.

77
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:49.987
And let's see.

78
00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:50.863
I'm hopeful.

79
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.589
[LAUGH] Yeah.

80
00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:07.326
And, This other stuff is spaces,

81
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:10.346
I don't know what else gets encoded,
but here we go.

82
00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:11.830
Tada.

83
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.012
So now just imagine, like this is actually
useful to where you put in something

84
00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:22.400
you need to actually convert it into
a URL encoded string in real time.

85
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.170
Well, you're welcome.

86
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.160
You can totally do that for
money and I approve.
