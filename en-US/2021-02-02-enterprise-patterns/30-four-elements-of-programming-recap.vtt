00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.260
What I've basically done and by we,
is that starting at nothing,

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.090
we have essentially built
a version of Redux.

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.773
Like this is not too far off, I've
actually used a variation of this when I'm

4
00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:27.054
just simulating, essentially
state management while I am, or

5
00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:34.730
I'm testing something out and I just used
it so Redux is a pattern is very simple.

6
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.998
This is why I think Redux is so

7
00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:42.910
amazing is because I could have hand
wrote this in less than 10 minutes.

8
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.910
If we were not in the middle of
a conversation about how to do it.

9
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.620
I wasn't trying to trick everybody for as
long as possible about what we were up to.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.984
We have taken an incredibly simple pattern

11
00:00:56.984 --> 00:01:01.600
that somebody could write in 10 minutes.

12
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.540
And we're using this pattern
to manage state its scale.

13
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.340
I have uses on very large fortune.

14
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.474
One hundred companies,
like this pattern works.

15
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:22.480
So.
In terms of state management.

16
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.174
We have just now arrived at one of
the most important patterns for

17
00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:32.070
state management that I can think of.

18
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.420
There's variations of it.

19
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.553
But when it comes to managing state,
control flow, and code volume this,

20
00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:49.360
I just can't think of anything
that is more succinct and elegant.

21
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.346
Than this particular pattern, not only
that, is that in the course of like,

22
00:01:56.346 --> 00:02:02.480
let's talk about programming in
the most basic, simplest terms.

23
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.291
We have incrementally put together and

24
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:16.880
assembled a state management library
that we could use to do almost anything.

25
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.835
And so, this is where, at the beginning
of the day I said we're gonna wax off,

26
00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:24.820
we're gonna wax off,
we're gonna paint the fence.

27
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.374
Because when you understand how Redux and

28
00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:35.358
NGR x in these patterns work,
then it's a lot easier to

29
00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:41.220
effectively implement
them in your projects.

30
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.979
And if you actually went and took the time
to click through the source code.

31
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.266
You would find that
there's actually not a lot

32
00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:57.910
to the source code on these
particular libraries.

33
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.070
And so, for me,
this is where I get really excited.

34
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.930
That when I say when I am
programming I'm doing for things.

35
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.560
Nouns, I'm describing things.

36
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.350
I'm doing things verbs.

37
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.343
I'm making decisions, and
I'm iterating over those, so

38
00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:23.069
I'm doing something more than once.

39
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.528
That in its simplest possible form,
we're able to take these ideas and

40
00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:38.396
build an incredibly powerful
a central state management pattern or

41
00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:43.576
a library that we can use and
so we finally got to this

42
00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:49.840
point we can see here that
we're creating with store.

43
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.340
We're able to update the store
by dispatching an action.

44
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.620
And then we're able to select state
off that store and surface it.

45
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.770
So with that said.

46
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.940
Kind of this conclusion to
the four elements of programming.

47
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.222
Does anybody have any questions about
what I have done, up to this point?

48
00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:19.940
And congratulations, everybody just wrote
Redux from scratch, which I think is cool.

49
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.711
&gt;&gt; That was amazing.

50
00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

51
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.010
The question was, that was amazing.

52
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.796
That was amazing.

53
00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:32.710
Just kidding.

54
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.330
Thank you very much.

55
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.692
High five, every time that I do this,
people are like, my goodness,

56
00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.680
they just kind of lean back.

57
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.430
Are you serious?

58
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.780
Like, we're doing this.

59
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.030
And then it's like just give me two,
three hours.

60
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.113
And we're actually gonna
build something cool and

61
00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:51.870
in this case like this is something
that is helpful and useful.
