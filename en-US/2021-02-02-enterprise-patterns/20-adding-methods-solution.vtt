00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.770
Let's get into the solution for
this challenge.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.996
So, the idea was to create a ProjectStore
class, at a state property,

3
00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:16.340
a constructor with a state parameter,
getState method, select method.

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.850
instantiate the ProjectStore
with the initialState object.

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.620
And then call select on the class
to get the project's collection.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.180
All right, so with that said,
let me refresh this.

7
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.206
Make sure that this is still running,

8
00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:41.770
and let me get my code next to this.

9
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.734
So we'll just pause temporarily,
and let's get everything situated.

10
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.300
All right, perfect.

11
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.049
And then from here,
we'll hop into the mobile application and

12
00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.670
I'm gonna go into the home component.ts
which is what we're working on.

13
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.714
And I think we are good to go.

14
00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:19.209
There we go.

15
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.040
All right, and
I'm just gonna zoom this out just a bit.

16
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.065
And, so we are going to build essentially

17
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:34.250
a version of the ProjectsStore.

18
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.140
So, I'm gonna go down here
,and let's build this out.

19
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.490
So we'll go class, ProjectsStore.

20
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.606
And this is going to have a property
of state which is going to be of

21
00:01:56.606 --> 00:02:02.419
ProjectsState, and
constructor, that takes state.

22
00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:11.543
The state = state and

23
00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:16.810
that is spelt incorrectly.

24
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.070
Constructor, there we go.

25
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.074
And then from here,

26
00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:27.234
we need to then add in a select method

27
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:33.600
which takes a key, which is a string.

28
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.248
And then from here we're going to return

29
00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:43.450
the value of whatever key this may be,
okay?

30
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.260
And I believe I have one more method.

31
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.960
Let me check here.

32
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.150
GetState, so getState,

33
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.661
all this does is this
returns ProjectState,

34
00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:02.295
return this.state, okay.

35
00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:05.370
And I believe this is correct.

36
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.938
So now what we will do is I'm
going to instantiate this,

37
00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:15.557
const projectsStore =new ProjectsStore and

38
00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:22.910
we gonna send in initial ProjectState.

39
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.919
And from here, let's go ahead and

40
00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.759
let's just get currentProjects

41
00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.640
= projectsStore, select.

42
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.960
And we're gonna pass in a key of,
Projects.

43
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.637
And then let's just,
Trace this out so const, there we go.

44
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:55.512
And I would be a mess if I
did not have my IDE giving me

45
00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:59.670
these helpful little hints as I program.

46
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.900
I am human and I am fallible.

47
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.760
So I'm gonna save this and
let's see what we have here.

48
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.530
All right, so
now we're returning the projects.

49
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.195
If I switch this to current project,

50
00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:19.992
my variable doesn't make sense,
but it should update and

51
00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:24.030
you should see just this empty project.
