00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.570
The reason why you define your objects and

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.166
you spend time data modelling is so

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:13.632
that you can then understand and
define your state.

4
00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:19.330
Which state is nothing
more than an object.

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.735
Especially when you do it properly.

6
00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:21.809
So your state,

7
00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:27.192
your application under the hood is
nothing more than a large data structure.

8
00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:30.240
When something goes wrong
in your application,

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.222
it's because the underlying data
structure, the state of your application,

10
00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:39.482
is not matching up with the things
that you're trying to do with it.

11
00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:45.075
But start to think about state
in an application is nothing

12
00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:49.990
more than a data structure,
it's just an object.

13
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.320
So let's go back to the slides and
let's start to define state.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.890
So we can say what is in state for
a feature?

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.108
Well, I would imagine you
could have all the clients and

16
00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.750
then you might have a current client.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.010
And then from there you might
have a new or empty client.

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.350
And then you could define
some initial state.

19
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.973
So, we're gonna do a challenge
here pretty quick, but

20
00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:30.843
I'm going to do this piece and
then we'll do the challenge.

21
00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:35.803
So, just I've been talking about
these these objects we've been

22
00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:38.993
going around this but It's really easy for

23
00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:44.680
us to think about objects when we're
talking about a single client object.

24
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.501
But when we start thinking
about like feature state,

25
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:54.913
depending on your level of I
think maturity is a developer,

26
00:01:54.913 --> 00:01:58.110
that can be kind of an overwhelming thing.

27
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.461
And so if you start at target about
feature state at the top, but

28
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:06.870
people oftentimes forget is
that at the bottom of this.

29
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.264
All we're talking about,
is data structures and objects and nouns.

30
00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:18.179
And so with that said,
let me build some future state.

31
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:22.743
So interface,

32
00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:27.660
clients state.

33
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.312
What would we expect this to have?,
well obviously clients

34
00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.850
And a currentClient.

35
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.082
There's any number of things we could
put in here, but for the sake of this,

36
00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:45.148
we're going to put a single client.

37
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.405
And then from here,
let me also define a new client and so

38
00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:57.854
we're just going to initiate this
with an empty client equals and

39
00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:03.405
we'll type this And ID is no

40
00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:12.026
First name is empty string
last name is empty string and

41
00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.710
company is empty string.

42
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.783
All right, so now we have this new client.

43
00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:26.904
And let's go ahead and
let's create some initial state.

44
00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:34.610
We're going to go with.

45
00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:42.114
Const initial

46
00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:54.202
Which is clients Equals just
dragging this out just a bit.

47
00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:55.692
I'll put it back in a moment.

48
00:03:55.692 --> 00:03:56.924
So what dow e expect with this?

49
00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.570
Well, it's telling us.

50
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.873
We'll go with client.

51
00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:11.019
And what we have here, we can do
something interesting with type script,

52
00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.974
if you're just using regular
ES5 is that you would

53
00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:21.182
say this clients property,
is this clients object.

54
00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:26.806
Now with es6 and above because they're
the same we can just condensed that.

55
00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:35.356
So this is a really handy way
to just say its clients and

56
00:04:35.356 --> 00:04:40.296
we're going to set the Initial

57
00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:45.508
feedback I spelt that wrong.

58
00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:48.049
Right, current client.

59
00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:55.252
Thank you IntelliSense, there we go.

60
00:04:55.252 --> 00:05:02.590
Let me just save this And
let's check this out.

61
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.301
So we have our clients which is Peter and
John and our current client is no,
