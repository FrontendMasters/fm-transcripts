WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.410
So we've got a policy set.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.730
If we go over, I think a lot of us
are seeing an access denied, right?

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.810
One of the things to verify is yeah,
but what happens if you do index.html?

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.524
And it shows up, right?

5
00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:18.830
Now, I watched previous
versions of this course.

6
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.260
And I do know that
sometimes I make mistakes.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.779
Because there's one I was
watching it was like,

8
00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.410
Steve talked about checking that
checkbox and then didn't, right?

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.293
Which I understand was added in post
editing but as I'm reviewing my own,

10
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:34.060
could have told me.

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.415
I'm pretty sure we set that default route
object in CloudFront and we all have

12
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.705
the same issue, so I'm wanting to say
that it's not a you issue or me issue.

13
00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.547
We're not gonna talk about
who's probably to blame here.

14
00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:48.402
Let's talk about how to go
fix it because in my notes,

15
00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:53.044
the next line is, make sure you
check this again, just in case.

16
00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:56.250
One thing to point out here,
is this enabled?

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.038
This means your CloudFront
distribution is good to go.

18
00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:03.568
So remember I was talking a little
bit about finding the emotional

19
00:01:03.568 --> 00:01:06.533
patients sometimes, which is enabled and

20
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.421
nothing works,
you probably safe to go fix something.

21
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:15.532
If it's still says deploying and
it doesn't work, you're not allowed

22
00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:20.660
to start checking more boxes and
adjusting stuff until it gets to green.

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.590
It might still, that might solve your
problem, that might be the right answer.

24
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.000
But you're made no promises
until that's green again.

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040
All right, so we'll go in here.

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.687
And let's figure out,
yeah, default route object.

27
00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:34.904
I might have made the Boo Boo this time.

28
00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:40.390
Let's see what happens if we get rid of,
yeah, file name, index.html.

29
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.122
There are some places where
it demands the slash,

30
00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:48.140
some places where it refuses the slash.

31
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.110
I would love to tell you that I've
memorized all of them, I haven't.

32
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.773
So this is to show you,
if we go back to distributions real quick,

33
00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:58.390
you can see that is deploying.

34
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.890
This sometimes will also, if you've made
a major change, be going gray as well.

35
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.810
Let's go ahead,
sometimes it will still work at all,

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710
it just means it hasn't
distributed everywhere just yet.

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.584
So let's go ahead and, Go to the route.

38
00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:15.830
So that solves the problem.

39
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.940
If you had a slash beforehand,
I'll take the blame on that one.

40
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.920
But there's a reason I
had a note in here too.

41
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.390
So I'm not taking all the blame,
I'll just take this time.

42
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.924
But we do have another
error which is intentional,

43
00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:34.550
which we have that client
side routing issue again.

44
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.880
The chat was like, is it okay?

45
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.850
I'm like, it's okay.

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.840
If you think about it,
this one makes sense.

47
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.350
This one, makes sense is a strong word.

48
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.143
This one checks out at least
a little bit which is our

49
00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:50.937
static website hosting was
doing the work for us and

50
00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:55.750
we now say CloudFront,
you're in charge of this.

51
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.240
So we're not using
the static website hosting.

52
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.633
We should go turn that off and

53
00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:03.070
turn off the public access to get
that bucket completely locked down.

54
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.946
And this is the subtle difference
between you paste it in that URL and

55
00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:08.653
you selected the S3 bucket.

56
00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:12.588
When you paste it in the URL, it was
just sending everything along to that

57
00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:16.320
web address just like when
we visited it ourselves.

58
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.090
The S3 bucket is actually just
directly accessing that bucket.

59
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.850
So it's not using any of those static
website hosting features anymore.

60
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.900
So we're going to finish up our
OAI extravaganza of happiness.

61
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.349
We're gonna go turn off
the static website hosting,

62
00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.192
lock down that bucket and
be done with this.

63
00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:37.313
All right.

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.974
At this point I have decided that
I was just gonna open up a tab for

65
00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:47.436
each of the different views, rather than
jumping back and forth for my own sanity.

66
00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:50.673
So we'll go in here,
we will edit this again,

67
00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:53.993
we'll block all public access,
because yes,

68
00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:59.700
now the general public does not have
a public access, but CloudFront does.

69
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550
CloudFront is publicly accessible.

70
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.070
We've just moved the problem
[LAUGH] down the road a little bit.

71
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.550
So hit save changes.

72
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.705
And this is like,

73
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:12.941
it's one of those things where you know
that there's a chance that you might take

74
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:17.889
down production if the UI makes you type
in the word confirm before you do it.

75
00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.890
[LAUGH] All right?

76
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.650
So do that, but since we already slammed
into an access denied and effectively shut

77
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.354
down production for a moment, [LAUGH] we
could be somewhat confident in this case.

78
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:37.857
So we go back to properties, And we'll
turn off that static website hosting.

79
00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:49.077
That's still not gonna work because we
have not reimplemented the routing.

80
00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:52.591
But our website is still up, right?

81
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:53.091
Awesome.
