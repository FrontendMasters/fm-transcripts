1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.646
So, I got to the parts where I put
in all my personal information and

2
00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.380
my credit card and all those fun things.

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.015
And gone through the kind of
tail end of the signup process,

4
00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.208
you can choose your support level.

5
00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.519
I think for
the most part we're in this as a team, so

6
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.678
we can go with the basic support.

7
00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:22.897
If you wanna spend over $15,000 a month
you can also get conch hair style service,

8
00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.019
that's a choice.

9
00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.132
But I think that generally speaking,
basic support has never failed me.

10
00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:35.110
Awesome, and here is my kind of
congratulations piece as well.

11
00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:42.341
And one of the first things you'll
notice is we have two kinds of users.

12
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:47.687
We have a root user, and
then IM user, right?

13
00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:51.898
Right now we only have a root account,
and you can even look at it.

14
00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:55.626
Account owner, the performance test and
unrestricted access, right?

15
00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.499
That is the only kind of
account that we have right now.

16
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.612
But we should probably seek to not
have that kind of account, right?

17
00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:09.887
It's very much like if you use
a Unix based operating system,

18
00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:15.376
one does not go around as the root
user and do whatever they want.

19
00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:18.949
One usually makes at least a user
to has to sudo to use the really

20
00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:20.404
destructive commands.

21
00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:24.735
Or if they are incredibly responsible,
then they will make one that has no access

22
00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:28.505
and switch into even an administrator
user when they have to do stuff.

23
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.441
So, we're going to at least
take that first step and

24
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.454
go from our root user and
make it administrator user.

25
00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:38.942
When we start creating additional
roles like for our CICD process,

26
00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:43.441
maybe we'll make a third user,
when I say maybe I mean definitely.

27
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:48.047
Will make a third user that has
only access to put files in

28
00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:50.404
a specific bucket, right?

29
00:01:50.404 --> 00:01:53.325
Or just create an invalidation
on CloudFront.

30
00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:54.779
So on and so forth, right?

31
00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.710
Generally speaking, we wanna use
the principle of least privilege or

32
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.255
the principle of least access to create
additional users for different things.

33
00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:08.443
If this project you're studying right now,
turns into being a large company,

34
00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:13.103
you might also for various different
humans at your company, be cool.

35
00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:16.548
You can deploy the app you
work on to production,

36
00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:20.592
you can't do this other app,
so on and so forth, right?

37
00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:24.317
But step one is we'd like to
stop being a root user and

38
00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:26.951
start being some other kind of user.

39
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.437
So, let's get that set up.

40
00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:39.140
I like the number of things trying
to help me fill in my password.

41
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.221
That's a fun one.

42
00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:54.069
Awesome.

43
00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.723
So, this is kind of the beginnings
of everything that we need.

44
00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:03.019
You might, if you've logged in at all
even from another account, you might see

45
00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.207
recently visited services here cuz
mostly they are stored in local storage.

46
00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:10.621
So, if you have used this
browser in another account,

47
00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:15.524
don't be weirded out because they are in
your browser not because somebody has

48
00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:20.152
logged into this account in the few
seconds when you made it and right now.

49
00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:23.402
So, with that,
the easiest way to get around,

50
00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:26.264
you could for instance, go to services.

51
00:03:26.264 --> 00:03:29.622
And you can see that there are many
categories, and you could try to navigate

52
00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:32.893
through all of them hit on all services
if you want to stress yourself out.

53
00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:36.745
There are like hundreds of AWS services.

54
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:41.830
Or you use this fun bar up here and
you can go ahead and

55
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.333
type in, let's say for our case, billing.

56
00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.698
Because the question we
got in the very beginning,

57
00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:50.354
of how much is this going to cost me?

58
00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:52.918
Ideally not that much.

59
00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:58.093
I did tell one fib, it will recurringly
cost you 50 cent if you choose to register

60
00:03:58.093 --> 00:04:03.129
a domain that costs money, right, but
there's no requirement that you do so.

61
00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.112
You might choose not to,
you might already have a domain, for

62
00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:10.328
those of us who buy domains and
they have an idea and

63
00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:14.862
just have tons of domain sitting
around that is also In option as well.

64
00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:19.462
But what we want to do is
should anything happen where we

65
00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:24.462
might go over a certain threshold,
we would at least like to

66
00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:28.671
get notified about it before it happens,
right?

67
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:34.081
So, one of the first
things we're gonna do for

68
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:40.485
ourselves is set up some
alerting around our billing.

69
00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:44.099
So, that we'll go into, first we're
going to billing preferences here.

70
00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.768
And we definitely want to receive
free to usage alerts, right?

71
00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:53.768
So, if anything we're using
we've blown past the free tier,

72
00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:56.949
then we'd like to get
an email about that as well.

73
00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.952
And so, you can also get all sorts of
other ways to get billing alerts and

74
00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:02.440
stuff along those lines.

75
00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:13.318
Save that as well.

76
00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.780
And with that,
we're gonna go into budgets.

77
00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:22.492
And we'll go ahead and
we'll create a budget.

78
00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:27.385
You don't have a lot of
choices in the very beginning.

79
00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:29.773
So, this is basically, and to be clear,

80
00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:33.067
there's a bunch of different
kinds of budgets, right?

81
00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:36.860
The one that we are most concerned about
is the only one we have access to.

82
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.720
So, the one we're most concerned
about at this stage of our very

83
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.331
new seed company is cost, right?

84
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:50.030
So, we want to go ahead and
make sure that we have a cost budget,

85
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.810
so we'll pick that and we will select next

86
00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.994
Awesome, so you can say during what
period you wanna be known about.

87
00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:04.513
Do you wanna be notified whether it's
a daily budget or monthly budget or

88
00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:05.781
quarterly budget?

89
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.744
I'm gonna say monthly is fine for me, and
started immediately and my expected month,

90
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:13.125
it doesn't know my last month cost
because this account is as you all saw.

91
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:17.176
So that I'm at the same place
as you a minutes old account, so

92
00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.967
we'll go ahead, I'm gonna say $10.

93
00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:23.418
One of the things that just to keep in
mind, if you choose to buy a domain,

94
00:06:23.418 --> 00:06:25.070
it's probably about 12 bucks.

95
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.872
So, you will get an alert
immediately upon that moment, but

96
00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:33.275
that will also verify
to you that it works.

97
00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:39.612
So, you can choose 20, you can choose 10,
I'm gonna choose 10 for our purposes.

98
00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:44.246
You can also figure out where you
wanna scope that budget, again,

99
00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:49.131
these are really great if you already
have something in production and

100
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.633
you generally know the shape of it.

101
00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:55.584
Right now,
we wanna say if it passes 10, 20,

102
00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:59.075
what have you, I just want to know, right?

103
00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:01.965
And it is kinda on you to
be on top of that, right?

104
00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:07.096
Cuz you think about,
you might personally be like listen,

105
00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:10.184
after 20 bucks I'm out, right?

106
00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:13.851
But what is Amazon's choice at that point,
shut down your site.

107
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.310
There are other people who are like,

108
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.046
cool I had a spike in traffic
cuz our product went viral.

109
00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.092
Accidentally they had a budget.

110
00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:26.034
So, it's on you to kind of step in
there upon receiving that notification.

111
00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:31.707
So, whatever the threshold is,
you need to figure that out for yourself.

112
00:07:31.707 --> 00:07:33.055
I'm gonna call it budget.

113
00:07:35.698 --> 00:07:38.783
Awesome, so
I've got that budget threshold created.

114
00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:42.647
You can also I believe, you can set it for
different thresholds and

115
00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:44.165
stuff along those lines.

116
00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:47.655
You'd be like, cool when you've
gotten 75-to 80% of that budget.

117
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:52.430
So, it's not like,
you've blown past it, too bad,

118
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.737
you can get different alerts
along the way, as well.

119
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:58.970
All right, so now at least, if for

120
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.821
some reason someone gets into a root
account and gets untethered access and

121
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:08.142
everything, well at least get
a notification before it gets bad.

122
00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:14.821
But it'd be more helpful kinda making
sure that doesn't happen, right?

123
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:17.870
And there are a bunch of
ways that we can do this.
