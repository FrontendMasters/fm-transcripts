WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.082
So we saw policies a little bit before and
we saw for our user,

2
00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:09.977
remember administrator had
access to everything right.

3
00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:15.440
So users can have policies and what they
have access and they're allowed to do.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.100
Also resources can have policies as well.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.387
So if we think about this, well,

6
00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:27.560
what would we want kind of a public bucket
hosting a website to be able to do?

7
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.200
Well, people should be able to read to it.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.443
Should they be able to put nude and
different JavaScript files in said bucket?

9
00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:38.869
No, no,
they should not be able to do that.

10
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.560
So we wanna set up a policy where
you can read from the bucket.

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.082
You cannot write from the bucket,

12
00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:47.405
you can not delete my precious precious
Java scripts that I work so hard on.

13
00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.116
You can only read but anyone,

14
00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:53.713
anyone on the internet can read these as
well should be what we want in this case.

15
00:00:53.713 --> 00:01:00.052
Let's go ahead and
see what a policy looks like a little bit.

16
00:01:00.052 --> 00:01:05.846
We'll go into a bucket and
there are a bunch of options here.

17
00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.648
Now I can upload stuff
directly to my bucket.

18
00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:15.342
I can create folders and get different
URLs from it so on and so forth.

19
00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.655
We'll go in to permissions first.

20
00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.753
We've got all from before.

21
00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:23.728
We also have the bucket policy.

22
00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:27.049
This is we're gonna say like
you can read from the bucket.

23
00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.035
You can't do anything else.

24
00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:31.328
So go here we'll edit.

25
00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:34.411
There's a bunch of
different ways to do this.

26
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.718
You can just type it in as JSON.

27
00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:41.809
There is also,
Let's see where it is on the screen.

28
00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:47.438
They have a tool I think it's in here,
policy generator.

29
00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:49.917
We can like fill out
a bunch of stuff as well.

30
00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:53.716
And it will kind of give you
some JSON to paste in there.

31
00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:56.463
This is kind of like what we saw
with that administrator though.

32
00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:57.749
If you remember,

33
00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.563
the version is not necessarily like
when did you make this policy?

34
00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:05.505
So you're like,
I'm gonna update that today's date.

35
00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:11.010
Now this is like, what have AWS
schemas that this adheres to.

36
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.415
And you can see that this is pretty stable
content that we're looking at right now.

37
00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:21.477
Because this is their kind of like
spec as of, October 17th 2012.

38
00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:25.773
So that's the version
then a set of statements.

39
00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:29.578
The SSID is just some kind of identifier.

40
00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:35.585
It's almost like the tag, right you can
think of is some way to kind of name it.

41
00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:44.100
The principal is who effect
is either allow or deny.

42
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.730
The action is what should
they be able to do?

43
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.200
And the resources, what should
they be able to do it, too, right?

44
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.699
So for instance, we might say you can read
files from the super awesome click bucket.

45
00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.718
Who can do it?

46
00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:00.494
I mean anyone, right?

47
00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:06.946
So anyone should be able to read
files from that particular bucket.

48
00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:11.668
So we can go and
let's try the policy generator first.

49
00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:13.418
Here we are type of policy.

50
00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:17.271
I've got a few options for me.

51
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:20.456
A S3 bucket policy seems
to be the best right.

52
00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:26.685
Who should be able to do it star for
basically anyone and then select actions.

53
00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.119
As you can see this is
a very long drop down list.

54
00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:35.956
As we kind of mentioned before, the files
in an s3 bucket are called objects.

55
00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:38.471
So we basically want allow them too.

56
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:43.591
We want to be able to Let them
get an object out of the bucket.

57
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:47.713
And I haven't defined it I was gonna
say command F is your friend here.

58
00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:51.443
But we've got to get object
who can do it anyone.

59
00:03:51.443 --> 00:03:55.504
And then we do need to
tell them what bucket.

60
00:03:55.504 --> 00:04:02.691
And all Amazon resources have an Amazon
resource number for what service.

61
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.359
In this case,
we want to say the bucket name.

62
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.191
And you can say, hey, this user or
anyone can only get one

63
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:15.237
particular file, or
we can say all of the files in a bucket.

64
00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:17.406
So in our case,
we'll grab this piece right here.

65
00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:25.451
I'll paste it in, and
I'm gonna put in the name of my bucket.

66
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:44.694
There is also in the guide for this, in
the repo, there is literally a version of

67
00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:47.763
this policy that you can also
just copy and paste as well.

68
00:04:47.763 --> 00:04:52.046
But this is useful if you don't
know exactly what you want.

69
00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:54.943
So this will go ahead and
it will make a policy for us.

70
00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:57.637
I can copy it bring it back over.

71
00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:08.295
There's also a way to do it in here
where you can kinda see the faculty just

72
00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:10.087
a different way of looking at it.

73
00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:12.758
It doesn't generate you
the whole policy all the time.

74
00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:20.667
Unexpected error occurred.

75
00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:25.391
It actually does not
apply to any resources in

76
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.130
the statement after do slash star.

77
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.482
Let's make that a little.

78
00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:37.640
I'll show you a completed
policy in a second.

79
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.827
Cool, so let's look at like just as a kind
of simpler version of that real quick.

80
00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:46.258
This is effectively what we're going for.

81
00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:49.348
Just kind of the minimum in there.

82
00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:54.318
You can have the statement ID, anything
along those lines, but allow everyone for

83
00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:58.020
an s3 to get an object for
whatever the name of your bucket is.

84
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.398
That's the bespoke part just for
you, right?

85
00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:05.410
That's where you and I will travel
down different roads together.

86
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.700
But everything in that bucket.

87
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.133
So we have the permission
set up on our bucket.

88
00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:15.014
We have secured our bucket so
you can read files from it.

89
00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:19.458
We should probably deal with
the next requisite problem,

90
00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.730
which is there's nothing in this bucket.

91
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.086
[LAUGH] All right so, we probably
want to do something around that.

92
00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:30.188
So what we're starting out with,

93
00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:33.891
we will deploy that little react
application at some point.

94
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.268
That's got a lot of files, it makes like
a main dot js and that's got a stamp.

95
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:40.714
And then, there's a whole bunch of
other files as a favicon of all things.

96
00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:43.287
I don't have time for that just yet.

97
00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:47.639
We are going to visit
a special place in my heart,

98
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.673
which is we're going to
upload an HTML file to

99
00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:56.790
the internet by hand to put
it onto the internet, right?

100
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.121
Which is how I put things on the internet
as a youth, and arguably, up until

101
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:07.723
2014 because I worked at a company that
still wanted to do that at the time.

102
00:07:07.723 --> 00:07:11.432
So with that, we will upload something.

103
00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:17.112
Now in the notes, there is an HTML
file that's empty that you can use.

104
00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.589
You can whip one up in your
text editor real quick.

105
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:24.403
You can grab literally,
anything at this point, I happen to have,

106
00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:26.772
like an index that HTML that's.

107
00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:32.120
It's in the notes, I have that index, that
HTML on my desktop, but any file will do.

108
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.343
So go ahead, we'll hit add files.

109
00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:39.072
And let me grab that index.html.

110
00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:45.798
And I will upload it, great.

111
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:52.891
You can set special stuff in here but
like everything's pretty much ready to go.

112
00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:59.189
And here's index dot HTML file
succeeded I can close this and

113
00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:05.267
now my bucket has a file in it I go
ahead not quite sure, what happened.

114
00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:06.958
So I click that, so
let's find out together.

115
00:08:10.714 --> 00:08:14.717
And there it is on the Internet
with this lovely domain.

116
00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:20.767
End name
S3.Amazon.aws.com/superawesome.click/inde-

117
00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:26.493
x.html please go visit my site,
please like and subscribe.

118
00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:31.383
We've gotten a thing onto the internet,
there's a lot of work to be done here.

119
00:08:31.383 --> 00:08:35.664
A few more kind of pieces
involved as well which is,

120
00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:41.256
it's not even like at this point
you have to have the index.html.

121
00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:44.245
We probably don't get a super
helpful error message.

122
00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:46.956
If we spell that out wrong.

123
00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:50.541
Nope, access denied, so on and so forth.

124
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.734
So yes, we have put a file
on the internet using AWS,

125
00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:57.158
we could theoretically declare
victory at this point.

126
00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:01.298
But there's a whole bunch of problems
with this that I will multiple times

127
00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:02.174
enumerate on.

128
00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.828
But like, we can already see a few
places where we can do better here,

129
00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.602
just in chart in terms of the URL.

130
00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:11.280
The process in which we get something
up here, so on and so forth.

131
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.550
Let's go back and deal with one of those.

132
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.743
For starters, in this case,

133
00:09:17.743 --> 00:09:22.320
we will go deal with some of
the other fun things that we can do.

134
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.522
So we scroll down we see
those intelligent tearing

135
00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:30.336
configurations we don't need those
access logs cloud trail data events.

136
00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:35.128
Event notifications what we want to
do is find static website hosting

137
00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:38.031
that seems like something useful for us.

138
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:43.564
We would like to host a static website and
we mean static website in the like,

139
00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:49.022
quote unquote jam sack thing which is
like most of the, web applications.

140
00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:52.249
I've deployed our static
assets are calling API.

141
00:09:52.249 --> 00:09:55.911
So they are they themselves are not the
files are static, the assets are static.

142
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.614
And then they call bunch API's and
then JavaScript takes over in this case.

143
00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:01.381
So go ahead, we'll hit at it.

144
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.754
And we'll go ahead and
we will enable that.

145
00:10:04.754 --> 00:10:07.767
So hosts a static website that seems good.

146
00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:11.825
This is interesting index
document an error document.

147
00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:15.451
So this is if they go
directly to the domain,

148
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:18.889
like what file should we show them right?

149
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:22.537
And we're going to kind of have this
work the way that the web works,

150
00:10:22.537 --> 00:10:26.387
which is if you just go to a directory,
you should get the index.html.

151
00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:39.218
And optionally, instead of that really
cute access denied XML that you saw,

152
00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:45.408
we could also send them another
HTML page that is everything.

153
00:10:45.408 --> 00:10:47.057
Sorry you've hit the wrong page.

154
00:10:47.057 --> 00:10:49.870
And you show them a cute dog or
a meme or something.

155
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.270
Thing what have you in there as well.

156
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:59.027
There is an erudite Shanelle in the repo
in the public directory that you can use,

157
00:10:59.027 --> 00:11:03.612
just leave that as it is for now,
we can have all of that in place.

158
00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:05.010
Hit save changes.

159
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:12.109
Awesome, so that is in place we can
kind of go down, verify that's enabled.

160
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:16.549
And you can see you've got a,
I guess better domain, right?

161
00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:22.929
It's not a subdirectory of AWS amazon.com,
right.

162
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:24.803
It is this wonderful domain.

163
00:11:24.803 --> 00:11:30.377
In right here and
it is not secured a super awesome click

164
00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:36.191
dot s3 website dot dash US East
one dot Amazon AWS COMM but

165
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:43.728
it is a full domain on the internet,
right and exists for these purposes.

166
00:11:43.728 --> 00:11:46.939
Our next goal is it is great and

167
00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:52.334
wonderful to just upload
files by going into a UI,

168
00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:56.196
clicking upload and finding them.

169
00:11:56.196 --> 00:11:59.257
There's a few ways we
can make this better.

170
00:11:59.257 --> 00:12:00.625
And we already alluded to this.

171
00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:02.922
One is, if I need to do multiple files,

172
00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:07.321
I think you probably select multiple
ones in your given operating system.

173
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:13.110
But there's probably a lot
of tricks around doing this.

174
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.618
It'd be great if we had a way to
kind of from a command line so

175
00:12:17.618 --> 00:12:22.959
we can automate it, be able to go
ahead and take an entire directory.

176
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.672
And first from our local machines,
put it up into S3 and

177
00:12:26.672 --> 00:12:30.938
eventually we'll actually have
GitHub do this for us, right?

178
00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:36.005
So one of the things that we're gonna
wanna grab here is the good old

179
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:41.723
AWS CLI and you can find the instructions
I'll share them in a moment here.

180
00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:45.018
Open another tab,
you can go download it for

181
00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:48.499
your operating system of
choice I am on Mac OS.

182
00:12:48.499 --> 00:12:49.681
So that's the one I have.

183
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:55.202
But if you need the Windows installer and
the Linux installer, so on and so forth.

184
00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:58.772
So you're going to go ahead and
you're going to install this and

185
00:12:58.772 --> 00:13:03.215
some of these because again, I don't
really feel like sharing my private key.

186
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.474
We're going to kind of
take as an exercise,

187
00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:09.026
which is once you have it installed for
your given operating system.

188
00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:12.717
What you're going to do is you're
going to type AWS configure.

189
00:13:12.717 --> 00:13:16.882
Now hopefully you either when we said
show me that secret key at the very

190
00:13:16.882 --> 00:13:19.919
beginning of the story,
you copied it somewhere or

191
00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:23.254
you downloaded that CSV,
either one of those are fine.

192
00:13:23.254 --> 00:13:27.247
Again, I will remind you that just for
us all be on the same page.

193
00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:32.557
We're going to go with US East
one as our region of choice.

194
00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:35.621
And default output format I chose JSON.

195
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.796
It's kind of up to you.

196
00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:39.078
If you find yourself
with multiple accounts.

197
00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:43.470
There is this .aws/credentials
that it will set up.

198
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.810
That might be slightly
different on Windows,

199
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.770
as to where exactly it is where you can
have one for your main account like this,

200
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.193
we'll set up our default account for
us if you have other accounts.

201
00:13:53.193 --> 00:13:58.303
If you already have the AWS command
line tools installed, you might choose

202
00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:03.024
to just set up like a side,
an additional account for this workshop.

203
00:14:03.024 --> 00:14:05.247
So that is one option if you're like,
I have it,

204
00:14:05.247 --> 00:14:08.304
but it's like my company thing and
I don't really know what to do.

205
00:14:08.304 --> 00:14:10.163
This is a second option for you as well.

206
00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:13.478
But if this is your first time,
you can ignore this.

207
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:19.873
If you just do AWS configure, pop in your
AWS access key pop in that secret key and

208
00:14:19.873 --> 00:14:24.075
once we have all that in place
then we will go ahead and

209
00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:27.628
look at how to upload
our cool application.
