1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.950
So let's talk a little bit
about route 53 in this case.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.828
Route 53 which despite me having
looking up where route 53 is

3
00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:10.823
in the US multiple times.

4
00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:16.202
So that I can make some kind of comment
at this exact moment I've since

5
00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:21.690
forgotten where it is,
is basically their DNS service, right?

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.530
And route 53 has a lot of really
cool features most of which we

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.590
don't need in this case.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.494
It has stuff like, cool you can have
your servers hosted multiple places and

9
00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:35.849
it will detect if one goes down and
doesn't pass a health check and

10
00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:38.510
route all the traffic to another server.

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.182
Or if one is slower from a given place it
will route it to the faster one so on and

12
00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:44.270
so forth.

13
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.740
We need it for registering a domain name.

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.130
If you have a domain name somewhere
else you can use that you do need to

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.297
probably tell route 53
about it at some point.

16
00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:56.047
One of the reasons though,

17
00:00:56.047 --> 00:01:01.145
if you are going to get a new domain name
that I would recommend doing route 53 is

18
00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:06.110
hooking it up to some of the other Amazon
stuff is incredibly simple, right?

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.938
If you host it somewhere else and

20
00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:11.280
like it's going to be
a little bit trickier, right?

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.412
There are guides on how to point it route
53 and then get the rest of that for

22
00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:18.037
free that's kind of
somewhat outside the scope

23
00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:21.009
of this because each one
will be slightly different.

24
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.944
But I'm gonna go ahead and register
a domain with route 53 in this case.

25
00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:29.438
This is a totally optional part if you
don't want to do it, you don't have to.

26
00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:32.358
I'm gonna do it for
anyone that needs to, right,

27
00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:36.736
or wants to but if you just want to use
whatever the CloudFront domain that we

28
00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:39.970
get towards the end of
the workshop is totally fine.

29
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.986
You won't miss out on anything
except some ridiculous

30
00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:49.028
domain name as I live shop for
domain names.

31
00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:52.540
Awesome whenever you try to get a.com.

32
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.262
We'll go ahead and say what's a dot cheap

33
00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.075
Not too cheap,
too cheap to pay for a dot cheap.

34
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.340
I'm not paying $30 for a domain name.

35
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.760
Dot click, where's dot click?

36
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.360
Yeah three, yeah,
dot click is three bucks.

37
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360
We're gonna do that.

38
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.730
So we'll go ahead and
say super awesome dot.

39
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.414
Nope don't put that space
in there autocomplete.

40
00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.571
Awesome and put that in my cart
on pay $3 for this domain name.

41
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.410
I'm gonna pause for a moment in
case you're doing this with me.

42
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150
I've done this now multiple times.

43
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.592
And every time I put it in the cart, and

44
00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:47.580
I look for
the button to buy the domain name.

45
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.570
Yeah, some of you are like,
I don't see the button.

46
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.220
Don't scroll.

47
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.120
You got to scroll all the way down and
it's underneath.

48
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.203
The rest of the options have once
you could have put in your cart,

49
00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:00.240
it lives down there.

50
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.930
It doesn't matter how many
times I've done this.

51
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.329
I literally just now was like,
where's the button, and

52
00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.180
then I remembered how
angry I get this moment.

53
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.730
Cool, at that point you will put
in your registering contact.

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.424
So I'm also going to we're going
to cut to a break in a second and

55
00:03:16.424 --> 00:03:18.460
I'm going to fill this piece out.

56
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.871
So I've registered it,

57
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:24.115
the one thing I want to point out is
theoretically I have received an email.

58
00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:27.882
I have 15 days to verify that email
if not they will suspend it and

59
00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:32.471
they are reminding me that a suspended
domain is not available on the Internet,

60
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:37.170
which is my understanding of what would
happen if you suspended a domain.

61
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.310
So if you right now want to go check,
you can go absolutely do that.

62
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.471
I'm not.
I live dangerously also,

63
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.170
I'm not super invested in this.

64
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.074
So you can see domain
registration is in progress.

65
00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:52.722
So that is good we will
kind of let that cook for

66
00:03:52.722 --> 00:03:57.111
a little bit it's like a cooking show
where you put something in the oven for

67
00:03:57.111 --> 00:04:01.450
a little bit and maybe there's an already
done Turkey somewhere as well.

68
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.204
We'll let that cook and
we'll go back to setting up our S3 bucket.

69
00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:07.069
So with that, we'll say S3,

70
00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:19.551
One thing that we don't have to really
worry about now because S3 is global is

71
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:24.022
there are certain things that like for
instance some of the lambda edge

72
00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:28.679
stuff that we're gonna talk about that
is only available in US East one.

73
00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:31.353
So I'm going to kind of
point that out now and

74
00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:34.330
remind later we're still
not at that point yet.

75
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.079
But right now at this moment
in Minneapolis, Minnesota,

76
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:43.052
I guess closest to US East Two, Denver
gets me closer to US West so it's real,

77
00:04:43.052 --> 00:04:46.610
real hit or
miss where we make those decisions.

78
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.740
But be in US East one for
this workshop is probably the easiest.

79
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.201
Otherwise you might have to sometimes
jump over to US East one for things.

80
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:56.420
So I will kind of point
that out at some point.

81
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.950
But, S3 is global in this case, so we
don't necessarily need to worry about it.

82
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.610
Let's go ahead.

83
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.144
We have two buttons that we can click,
for creating a bucket,

84
00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:06.570
whichever one makes you happier.

85
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.811
For me personally, the orange one makes
me happier, so I'm gonna click that one,

86
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:17.770
and we're gonna give it a name and
superawesome.click.

87
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.400
And here's my first opportunity
to put this in the right region.

88
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.350
So I'm gonna go put it in US East one.

89
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.589
Like I said, it's not a total requirement,
generally speaking, if for some reason,

90
00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.542
like let's say this was a bucket that you
were doing a bunch of data analytics, and

91
00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.330
you needed to use it as a data lake.

92
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.320
So you could process stuff from your local
machines or something along those lines,

93
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.300
you might choose a region closest to you.

94
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.187
It doesn't always have to be US East one,

95
00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:49.135
just to make sure we're all on the same
page, both on the live stream and

96
00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:54.120
recording and in the room,
let's all just get in the same region.

97
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.801
And let's make that US East one for
some reasons.

98
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.951
Not all Amazon features
are available in all the regions but

99
00:05:59.951 --> 00:06:02.600
US East one almost always
gets everything first.

100
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.060
So it's make sense to just pick that
one as our default in this case.

101
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.670
All right, we don't seek to choose an
existing bucket to copy our settings from.

102
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.560
That should be obvious why the reason
because we don't have one.

103
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.581
Okay, so then ACLs for
specific objects, access control lists,

104
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:27.490
we're gonna go with the recommended
option here, which is don't do it.

105
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.252
This is going to be a controversial
section that we're going to have to,

106
00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:35.362
we're gonna turn on and
off at different points in our lives.

107
00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.280
This is blocked all public
access settings for the bucket.

108
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.369
At various times,

109
00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:46.079
there weren't as much rules around this
as why people ended up with the public

110
00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.656
buckets sometimes are also I've heard
stories where there was an outage.

111
00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:55.230
Somebody made the bucket public real
quick to go ahead and fix something.

112
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.409
Then the outage was over.

113
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.110
The bucket was still public, right?

114
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.310
So, but it's tricky for us, right?

115
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.514
We want to put a webpage on the Internet
people to look at publicly, right?

116
00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:15.937
So for us at this moment we're going to
turn it off because we don't have all

117
00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:21.725
the pieces we need to kind of do the kind
of wiring through AWS around this stuff.

118
00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:26.524
So we're going to turn it off for
now you can see that they are very,

119
00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:32.405
very strict about this, we will add
some policies stuff along those lines.

120
00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:35.309
But for now,
that is going to be the case and

121
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:40.485
we'll talk about different things that
we can do at various points as well.

122
00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:46.265
Okay, we talked about bucket
versioning earlier in the slides.

123
00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:51.134
This was again if you wanna keep every
previous version we have get where we

124
00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:53.500
can go back to previous versions.

125
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.778
Also, in the case of the react app that
I have webpack is going to stamp each

126
00:07:57.778 --> 00:07:58.800
version.

127
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.980
And so the same way I told you that, I
don't delete the previous generated files.

128
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.636
It's kinda like I have my own versioning,
right, in my eyes.

129
00:08:07.636 --> 00:08:12.019
But if you were storing things where
you might need all the previous

130
00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:16.540
versions of whatever their data was,
you can turn versioning on.

131
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.360
It does incur a cost because
it's just more storage, right?

132
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.508
So we're gonna keep that disabled and

133
00:08:24.508 --> 00:08:27.710
we'll have the tags we're
not gonna be using them.

134
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.424
We again also don't need
server side encryption and

135
00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:32.898
advanced settings we
don't need that either.

136
00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:43.181
And with that I have my first bucket.
