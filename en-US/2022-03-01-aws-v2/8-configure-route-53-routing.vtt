1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.020
We've done a few pieces of the puzzle,
right?

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.710
Where we registered a domain name, maybe,
we've uploaded some stuff to the Internet.

3
00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:12.170
We should bring them together, right?

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.650
And be able to use them both.

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.200
So instead of the very delightful
URL that we currently for

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.160
our site, we can have a less bad one.

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.172
Again, no requirement
that you bought a domain,

8
00:00:28.172 --> 00:00:32.290
but let's take a look at
what that might look like.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.637
So, we'll head into Router 53.

10
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:46.038
And so we can go to our registered
domains to this point, and

11
00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:52.010
I got superawesome.click, and
it is currently set to auto renew.

12
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.985
I'm gonna turn that off now,

13
00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:59.230
because otherwise I can tell you
what will happen a year from now.

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.037
But if you picked a domain that
wasn't just for example purposes, and

15
00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:08.530
you want to continue using it,
you do not have to unclick that.

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.608
You might also see a very angry,

17
00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:16.520
alert saying that your
domain might be suspended.

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.709
We talked about this,

19
00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.539
that when I drew your attention to
that little line after we registered.

20
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.960
It was, we're gonna send you an email,
you should click the link in there.

21
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.043
If you did not, there's now a very angry,

22
00:01:29.043 --> 00:01:33.085
alert that is showing up
probably over here somewhere.

23
00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:39.520
But, I did so,
I do not presently see that.

24
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.640
All right, cool.

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.022
So we can go in to, manage DNS,
which is this middle button right here.

26
00:01:49.332 --> 00:01:50.118
Right?

27
00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:55.846
And we can go ahead and
we can click on it, and let's hit edit.

28
00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:03.016
So you can see we've got
some basic descriptions, and

29
00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:06.058
stuff along those lines
not much to do in there.

30
00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:10.767
Go ahead and also view the details, you
would think that like edit is the place

31
00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.970
where you edit the information on where,
it shows.

32
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.992
We can see there's
nothing really in there,

33
00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:22.650
it's actually view details we've got right
now, the NS record and the SOA record.

34
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.130
We wanna do is,
pointed towards the rest S3 bucket.

35
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.869
In AWS, you actually have an addition to
some of the more normal ones like your MX

36
00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.930
record, so on and so forth.

37
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.659
You have the ability to alias
it to another Amazon resource,

38
00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.130
which is one of the reasons
why doing it in Router 53.

39
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.900
It's just a little bit easier than
pointing it, and getting it setting up all

40
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.800
that stuff to resolve to the bucket,
where this small little switch over here.

41
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.861
Hover over for a second,
we can flip that and

42
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:55.290
there's a lot less options in this case.

43
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.991
So now we can go ahead, and
we have a record type where,

44
00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:06.670
let's see we have, we can alias it to
another record in this hosted zone.

45
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.010
Or alias to S3 website endpoint well,
we have an S3 bucket.

46
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.440
We did flip on the static website
hosting says, seems like our best bet.

47
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.556
We choose a region, if for
some reason you did not choose us-east-1,

48
00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.730
just keep note of that at this moment.

49
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.940
I believe I did choose us-east-1,
and then we should see our site.

50
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.370
So you should have that fall in place and
then, hit create records and

51
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.530
that should go ahead and
create you an A record for your S3 bucket.

52
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.786
So now you should,
maybe not instantaneously,

53
00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:51.040
so if you got really excited you went
over there it's not working yet.

54
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.427
Cuz DNS takes time, DNS is like replicated
over like hundreds of servers around

55
00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:57.730
the world, it might take a second or two.

56
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.930
So, we're gonna do something else before I
immediately go over, and declare victory.

57
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.188
We're gonna go and register the SSL cert,

58
00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:07.140
because that was also gonna
take a few seconds as well.

59
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.240
So we'll do that by the time, that we pull
that train gets pulled into the station.

60
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.866
The DNS should have propagated for
our domain, but

61
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:23.726
we'll see awesome, so go this is yet
another Amazon tool, right?

62
00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:28.085
So, we're gonna go from Route 53
to the Amazon certificate manager.

63
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.040
Start insert.

64
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:42.784
Cool, so now we've got that we're gonna
click on this request a certificate

65
00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:43.350
button.

66
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.142
This is allowing us to have HTTPS traffic,
in addition to HTTP, add a whole,

67
00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:52.420
not secure thing on our list of
things that we need to solve for.

68
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.500
This is the kind of next way for us to
start checking off boxes on that list.

69
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.709
So go ahead and superawesome.

70
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.397
Nope awesome.click clock click,

71
00:05:08.397 --> 00:05:14.788
I'm going to add another
one which is gonna be www.

72
00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:25.284
Cool, so there's a bunch of ways for
it to do this now,

73
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:30.280
you can either have DNS validation or
email validation.

74
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.154
A DNS validation basically just puts
a little note on the actual DNS record

75
00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:37.523
to say, I can prove that I own this.

76
00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:42.470
Because, I put the little secret that
you asked for on the DNS record.

77
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.029
If you are doing this through RouteR 53,

78
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.410
this is pretty easy because they
will basically do it all for you.

79
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.750
You just kinda have to like Greenlight,
all the steps along the way.

80
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.301
So cool go DNS validation, otherwise
there was an email for version as well.

81
00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:10.620
All right, let's now see,
we hit request let's there it is.

82
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.025
I had to hit refresh before it showed up,
so

83
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:18.290
we can hit that scope,
click on this one for a second.

84
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.154
So this is pending validation now,

85
00:06:21.154 --> 00:06:25.454
you might think to yourself,
okay, I wait, right?

86
00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:28.663
This seems the screen is
telling you to do no,

87
00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:32.495
you do not wait because you
will wait a very long time.

88
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:36.320
What you need to do is see,
where it says create records in Router 53.

89
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.281
As we mentioned, they're gonna say hey,
we're gonna go check to see

90
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:44.940
if these like special secrets,
are on the DNS registration, right?

91
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.870
And so even that last page, I had to
refresh, it's like a pending validation,

92
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.890
a lot of things take time.

93
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.740
This case, it does take time, but there's
also an action that you need to take that

94
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.940
if you don't take,
it will just never happen.

95
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.550
And that's why, we're together today.

96
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.440
So otherwise,

97
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.028
you will learn this the hard way,
like I did over the course of three days.

98
00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:12.943
Cuz, yeah, 10 minutes grace 30 minutes,
okay, maybe three hours possibly.

99
00:07:12.943 --> 00:07:18.396
The next day it start to get suspicious,
but you go through the cycle,

100
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.921
at first you blame yourself but
now awesome.

101
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.607
So now, I've successfully created the DNS
records, and now, at this point I

102
00:07:26.607 --> 00:07:31.158
should now go ahead and wait a little bit,
and everything should be, okay.

103
00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:35.837
But, yeah, there's not really a great
sign around that at first, right?

104
00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:41.404
So, while that happens,
we should be able to check let's see super

105
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:51.490
Now, that was the full one
autocomplete failed me.

106
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.020
All right, so
I don't have this SSL cert just yet,

107
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.440
because we just kick that off but you
can now see, I can go to my domain name.

108
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.110
And it is showing up, right?

109
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.525
As my superawesome.click
website with all my ipsums, and

110
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.310
my one picture of the Beatles.

111
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.884
So we have all of that in place,

112
00:08:12.884 --> 00:08:15.720
we still have the problem that
we saw before though, right?

113
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.067
I went to slash notes slash cupcake,

114
00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:21.970
strong URL,
superawesome.click/ notes/ cupcake.

115
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:28.730
I'm into it, and then if I go hit refresh,
we get that 404 not found.

116
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.559
Which makes sense,

117
00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.900
because that key does not actually
exist in that S3 bucket, right?

118
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.192
It feels like something is broken,
it's not really broken,

119
00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:40.270
it's just not what we want it.

120
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.520
So we need to address that.

121
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.855
The first one or two ways that we go
about it are not going to feel good,

122
00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:51.198
but we don't really have
a lot of great options.

123
00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:54.821
Towards the end we will figure
out some ways to go about this,

124
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.035
you have ways you could handle this.

125
00:08:57.035 --> 00:09:01.526
You could theoretically, if you had
a kind of either a framework that

126
00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:06.571
supported like SSR or a separate way
to build your site, you could be, okay.

127
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.520
We've got the general entry
point like index.html and then,

128
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.420
we kinda build a static version of site.

129
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.518
And we SSR in, and then the client
side code, yeah, that's great and

130
00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:18.101
there are frameworks that do that, right?

131
00:09:18.101 --> 00:09:21.442
Something like next or spelt kit or
something like that might,

132
00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:22.773
do something like that.

133
00:09:22.773 --> 00:09:25.743
The other option is being like listen,

134
00:09:25.743 --> 00:09:30.435
no matter what they put at the end,
send them to index.html.

135
00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:32.001
And load up my client side app, and

136
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:35.200
let the client side router figure
out to show them a 404 page or not.

137
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.413
This will theoretically work,
it does involve you playing

138
00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:46.570
a little bit fast and
loose with HTTP status codes, right?

139
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.314
Because you're gonna say, listen wherever
they go, bring them to HT.html, and

140
00:09:51.314 --> 00:09:53.600
we'll figure it out later.

141
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.033
Which puts you in the precarious
situation of saying,

142
00:09:57.033 --> 00:09:59.953
either almost everything is a 200, okay.

143
00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:04.414
Or 400 don't mean anything for
a forest don't mean anything now,

144
00:10:04.414 --> 00:10:09.111
if that makes you uneasy we will get
there, we will fix it towards the end.

145
00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:12.614
But we are going to live with discomfort
for a little bit, and just figure out,

146
00:10:12.614 --> 00:10:13.954
how to mostly get it working.

147
00:10:13.954 --> 00:10:18.821
And then improve,
upon our solution as time goes on,

148
00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:23.157
so let's go ahead and
let's get that in place.

149
00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:28.048
So for this we're gonna go back to S3,
that's fine because we're waiting for

150
00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:30.827
our certificate to cook
a little bit anyway.

151
00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:45.937
We'll go over to our bucket, and
we've got a few different options here.

152
00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:51.881
Well, lets go over to properties and
down the bottom, we've got that.

153
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.457
Bucket hosting, so we have that
Index.html, we have the issue where,

154
00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.420
an error where should they go.

155
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.330
Now we talked about it.

156
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.610
So easiest way to do that right now, to
get everything working just on S3 alone.

157
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.794
Would be to say,
let's react Router handle all this, right?

158
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:12.350
If it is a place they can go great,
if not a place fine that too.

159
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.832
So we can just put that in there, again,

160
00:11:15.832 --> 00:11:19.140
we will swap it out for
a better solution in a little bit.

161
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.070
But, that will work for now.

162
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.328
So now, no matter what, they will we
go back to our page, and we refresh,

163
00:11:28.328 --> 00:11:33.470
we'll actually get the client side
routing working as, we expected it.

164
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.550
It will be a little squirrely
in the network, right?

165
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.210
You can see it's technically a 404,
because it missed the S3 bucket.

166
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.542
But, the page that we showed them
loaded up the client side app, and

167
00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:46.600
did the right thing.

168
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.601
Again, suboptimal and we will make
it more better as time goes on,

169
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:54.860
but that is a piece of it.
