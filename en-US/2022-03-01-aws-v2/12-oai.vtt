00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
One of those points about CloudFront
is that it will stop things from going

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.750
to your s3 bucket, so that theoretically
you're not paying for the requests.

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.310
I think when we did the version of
course a few years ago, yeah, but

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.926
you're serving this stuff,
so on and so forth.

5
00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:21.236
There is a new feature in CloudFront
called origin access identity, but

6
00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:24.997
it is basically saying, hey,
S3 bucket, I'm cloud front.

7
00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:29.865
I'm gonna get stuff out of here,
nobody else is allowed to,

8
00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:33.785
all right, and it will go ahead and
do it for you.

9
00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:39.635
And so that way we can actually go back
to locking down the bucket completely,

10
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:43.603
but also have cloud front
have access to the bucket.

11
00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:48.138
So CloudFront can pull stuff out
of s3 bucket, nobody else can,

12
00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:52.852
thereby making sure as few requests
get to that bucket as possible.

13
00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.594
So we're gonna go ahead and

14
00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:58.950
we're going to basically lock
down the bucket, turn this on.

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.437
Now the one thing I will warn you as
we kind of get into this section is,

16
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:06.240
because everything is distributed and
because it has to propagate.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.419
Some of this stuff takes time, right, so

18
00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:11.794
we might end up in a situation we
try something it doesn't work.

19
00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:16.474
We have to adjust it,
some of it is issue, it's a little bit of

20
00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:21.170
a fine art to develop the spiritual
apparatus to understand.

21
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.041
Is my hunch that it's not working
cuz I messed up a setting,

22
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.594
cuz messing up the smallest
setting will bring it down.

23
00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:32.770
Or do I just need to be
a teensy bit more patient, so

24
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.901
we'll figure that out as a team.

25
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.345
But also, I'm sure through
the magic of video editing,

26
00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:43.030
if you're watching this later, it might
seem like stuff moves a lot faster.

27
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.110
So kind of is also a mental note,
if you're watching the recorded version of

28
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.569
this that some of the stuff you do
need to kind of give it a second.

29
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.890
It is phenomenally faster
than it was a few years ago.

30
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.501
A few years ago,
we were talking more like 5 to 10 minutes,

31
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.400
now it's closer to 30 to 60 seconds for
most things.

32
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.630
But you just have to be mentally
prepared for that as well.

33
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.879
So before, the way we had was working
with our CloudFront can wrap anything,

34
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.289
it can wrap an s3 bucket,
that's totally cool.

35
00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.811
It can take your API endpoints that
are hosted, either on an Amazon EC two

36
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:21.127
instance, API gateway,
your own data centers, so on and so forth.

37
00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:24.802
You can just point out something,
it'll pass through CloudFront and

38
00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:27.238
CloudFront will do all that caching,
right?

39
00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:30.689
But we can't have it work in
the s3 bucket as well, so

40
00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.081
we were just using the website
that we were hosting.

41
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.789
We can also, we can switch it to
that bucket, right, like I said,

42
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.390
just clicking on this
from the drop down menu.

43
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.160
I think we were joking during one of
the breaks, there are still blog posts out

44
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.594
there saying, whatever you do,
don't pick that unless you do this.

45
00:02:47.594 --> 00:02:52.305
So we know that's the base one,
and that'll work and

46
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:57.445
then we can turn on this,
give it access to the s3 bucket.

47
00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:01.049
Because what happened, what used to
happen previously is you just pick that.

48
00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.547
But it didn't have all of that kinda
principle of least privilege and stuff

49
00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:08.339
like that, it was a cool, I can't get
anything, I can get you an error message.

50
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.393
Thank you, CloudFront, that was very
helpful of you, I'm really glad.

51
00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:17.498
So here we can say, okay,
use this bucket and

52
00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:22.050
then we will restrict
access only to CloudFront.

53
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.489
So we can go ahead, we can use what
user effectively that's going to create,

54
00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.800
it's not really a full IM user,
it's a origin access identity.

55
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.390
Hit Create for new one,
have got that in place.

56
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.962
Now I'm gonna warn you, ideally,

57
00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:48.860
you would just wanna CloudFront
update the buckets access policy.

58
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.233
I've done this a few times, 50% of the
time it works every time, so we'll hit it.

59
00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:58.856
I'm gonna hit Save.

60
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:08.814
And I did not get an error message,
now you notice the pause in my voice,

61
00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.390
did anyone get an error message?

62
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.278
So some people got an error message,
not everyone, all right,

63
00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:17.080
let's talk about what to do.

64
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.096
It'd be great if we all consistently
got the error message or

65
00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:24.498
no one got the error message,
but let's go for it.

66
00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:28.786
You can even see that
when I tried to do it and

67
00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:33.204
it failed, I was ready with a meme, right?

68
00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:37.521
I was ready with a Thanos reference,
so we can kind of go in and

69
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:42.196
what we'll do is we'll look at
the policy that we need to create.

70
00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:48.380
And then we'll go ahead and apply it in
the case that it didn't work previously.

71
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.526
So this is not much different than

72
00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:57.570
the policy that we set earlier, right?

73
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.900
Before, we said,
anything or anyone rather,

74
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.680
was allowed to get things
out of the bucket, right?

75
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.552
When CloudFront made that OAI,

76
00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:16.142
it made some kind of identifier for
it, right?

77
00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:20.743
And so all that we're going to do is we're
going to go back over to our bucket and

78
00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:22.009
we're going to say.

79
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.434
Okay, instead of anyone, only this one,

80
00:05:25.434 --> 00:05:31.060
only user can access the bucket,
this user happens to be cloudfront.

81
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.479
And cloudfront will then be able to
access the bucket and nobody else will,

82
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.740
which means if you want our sweet,
sweet JavaScripts.

83
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.760
You have to go through
CloudFront to get it.

84
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.822
Now one thing that I will point out,
again,

85
00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:51.346
I don't it does not bring
me joy is if you look,

86
00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:55.990
go back at this,
that starts with an A, right?

87
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.178
You go back to CloudFront and
you see, this is the, yeah,

88
00:06:00.178 --> 00:06:04.062
this is this,
that's your CloudFront distribution ID.

89
00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:08.790
That is not your origin access
identity ID, to find that,

90
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.520
just go over here to the sidebar
to origin access identities.

91
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.590
That is the one you are looking for.

92
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.594
It is the different set of random letters
and numbers that start with an A,

93
00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:23.189
they're roughly the same length and
all caps.

94
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.766
[LAUGH] Use the previous one,
that is the wrong one, ask me how I know.

95
00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:33.103
Don't ask me how I know cuz a lot
of anger in the answer, right?

96
00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:36.950
But this is the value that you want, and

97
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.496
I'll give everyone a second to go do that,
but

98
00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:45.244
what we wanna do is grab this, right?

99
00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:47.351
And you can head back into S3.

100
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:55.984
Go find your bucket.

101
00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:03.921
Go to permissions,
find your policy, in my case,

102
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.222
I still need to come in here and
delete the everyone one anyway.

103
00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:12.612
So you should join me here anyway,
and basically,

104
00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:16.298
if it failed at putting it in there for
you.

105
00:07:16.298 --> 00:07:20.728
You can either replace
this star with this but

106
00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:26.092
your identifier, or
if you got it put in there for you,

107
00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:32.110
then you can delete
the everyone has access piece.

108
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.008
I will leave these here for now, they're
identical other than the fact that this

109
00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:42.160
one is saying, CloudFront has access,
this one saying, everyone has access.

110
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.699
So what we wanna do is we
want to delete this one,

111
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:50.129
we want to keep this one or
add this one if we didn't have it.

112
00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:55.543
There's a version of that in
the course notes as well, doesn't,

113
00:07:55.543 --> 00:08:00.973
it's just it's usually like it's
auto generating them for you.

114
00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:03.959
You can also give them cute names like,

115
00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:07.610
you can make the sad
cloud fronts OAI access.

116
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.819
That's a really good name, [LAUGH] too,
not super helpful, but yeah.

117
00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:15.691
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was interesting to me that
it had the very specific string, and

118
00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:17.602
then just do for the auto generate?

119
00:08:17.602 --> 00:08:19.474
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's completely arbitrary,

120
00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:21.820
I would name it something
that makes you happy.
