WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.071
The other part that we might want to have
is right now superawesome.clickworks.

2
00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:09.860
But if they go to www.superawesome click,
it will not work, right?.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.590
And so we probably should handle for that
I you can argue who goes to www.anymore.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.930
I'm not having that argument with you.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.795
I'm just going to fix the issue, because
I'm not I agree with you, but like,

6
00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:24.270
I'm just trying my best
not to break the web here.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.730
So let's go ahead and set that up.

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.933
So the way we're going to do this is
Amazon supports the ability to have

9
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:37.210
you do create a bucket that just
redirects to another bucket.

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.890
So basically, if we've got
a mapping of a given static website

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.571
hosting at this URL for
this bucket we theoretically could have

12
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:51.801
a domain www dot that's why we got
the SSL cert for that as well before.

13
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.540
That goes to the routes to the bucket and
route 53.

14
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.860
That then just serves the same
assets as our main bucket.

15
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.004
We don't have to deploy out
to two different buckets,

16
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:04.324
maybe have two different versions of the
same assets or anything along those lines.

17
00:01:04.324 --> 00:01:08.629
In one bucket, the second bucket
that points to that bucket, and

18
00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:11.555
then the two domain
names a bear subdomain.

19
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.883
Just super awesome.clique and

20
00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:19.340
www.superawesome.click all end
up at the same set of files.

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.670
So let's, let's make that happen.

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
So we're gonna go back into s3 buckets.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490
We will the larger set of buckets here,
and

24
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.710
we're going to create another bucket Good.

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.251
This one is gonna be called
www.superawesome.click.

26
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:38.595
We'll keep it in the same region.

27
00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:42.330
Okay, awesome.

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.099
We'll just leave everything,
the default for now.

29
00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:51.220
&gt;&gt; Do we need to do allow public access?

30
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.450
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily for this one I
don't think we'll find out together.

31
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.392
I think when I haven't
redirect will be fine but

32
00:01:57.392 --> 00:02:02.247
if we find out that it's not that, will be
the thing when you tell me about it and

33
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.401
I go it's fine and I'm like yeah.

34
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.930
So we've got that in
place let's go down to

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.341
properties We'll go to
the static website hosting.

36
00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.469
Redirect request to an object and so
at this point, we will go in here and

37
00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.172
we'll redirect it back to our main bucket.

38
00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:24.873
I guess you could technically
send it to a hostname as well,

39
00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:27.991
but we'll do it was a kind
of one in the same for us.

40
00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.440
Awesome.

41
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.140
So, now we've got www.

42
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.580
And we've also got the ability
to set that second bucket up.

43
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.744
Now, if we just go to this raw bucket,
let's find out the answer to your question

44
00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:51.710
while we're in here In here,
scroll to the bottom of properties.

45
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.210
Let's click this link.

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.178
Okay, it does just right on redirect
them right to a regular bucket.

47
00:02:56.178 --> 00:03:01.344
So we did not need to turn on public
access, like I thought, however, it's

48
00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:07.230
not wired up to do WWW dot because that's
not something we set up in DNS, right.

49
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.356
So we need to do now is basically I'll
kind of leave this as an exercise for

50
00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:12.990
you can do together as well.

51
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.638
To kind of just go in the same process for

52
00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:20.470
setting up the regular route, we just
need to set up for the www as well.

53
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.221
So we go back in To route 53

54
00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:34.124
Go to our domains

55
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.748
Manage DNS, we hit Edit.

56
00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:47.699
Pop quiz see if we listened before, and

57
00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:52.729
it doesn't do anything we
need to view details and

58
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:57.070
we will create a record, this will be www.

59
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.456
Yeah, now clearly you can
have different ones for

60
00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:06.993
your blog everything like that it
will alias it to an S3 website

61
00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:12.224
endpoint in US East one or
wherever to www.superawesome.

62
00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:16.872
To not click it's the only one that
shows up because the other one is

63
00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:21.527
taken by the other alias it's not
that smart that I read our minds.

64
00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:26.182
Sweet so now we have that set up as
well we saw that too Super awesome click

65
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:30.683
worked, and so now that might take
a second if you immediately go to it

66
00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:32.980
probably doesn't work.

67
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.703
Let's find out not necessarily
because it didn't work.

68
00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:44.108
It does that was fast.

69
00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:48.378
It's already in place and awesome.

70
00:04:48.378 --> 00:04:53.306
So now we are both superawesome.click and
www.super.awesome.com and

71
00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:58.560
clearly any other thing that you wanted to
do, you could set up and make it happen
