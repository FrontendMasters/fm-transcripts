WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.508
Back to CloudFront., So,

2
00:00:03.508 --> 00:00:08.142
you can take a lucky guess where we
can implement some bad error page

3
00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:13.291
dancing that we have a CloudFront,
it's in this one called error pages.

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.847
This is kinda cool because we get a lot
more options than we had previously.

5
00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:26.053
So here we can choose a whole
bevy of different error codes,

6
00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:29.820
and what we wanna do in given cases,
right?

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
How long do you wanna cache that for, and
do you wanna customize the error response?

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.100
Well, we do.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.689
Do for now found, you can redirect
them basically anywhere in this case,

10
00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.310
and choose your status code.

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.616
So before, if you remember, when we
went to s3, we'd given the page but

12
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:49.223
we'd count it as a 404.

13
00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:52.391
And then I told you like first we're
gonna treat everything as a 404, and

14
00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:54.916
then second,
we're going to treat nothing as a 404, and

15
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:58.700
then eventually we'll treat only
things that should be 404 as 404s.

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.090
We're on the second phase
of our journey together.

17
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.450
We're gonna break the web
in a different way.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.280
And I want to be real clear.

19
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.150
This is how a lot of sites do it.

20
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.616
And, the solution that we're
eventually going to get to, so

21
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.371
I'm gonna set that to index HTML,
which is gonna serve my JavaScript,

22
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.143
whatever client Side Routing,
take care of stuff.

23
00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:25.081
I'm gonna say this okay.

24
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.357
And this is what a lot of
client side applications do.

25
00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:33.083
And the solution that will
eventually end up in is me and

26
00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:40.630
one of my co workers got into a fight
because he's like you're breaking the web.

27
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.037
You should use that remote thing that
we used to do like five, six years ago,

28
00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.230
where for client side routes,
it was a hashtag.

29
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.760
And then the rest of the route,
like Twitter had it for a while.

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.330
He's like,
we should use hash routes everywhere.

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.850
And I as a person with dignity,
said, I'm not doing that.

32
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.225
And then we went at it for
like three hours on a Friday night,

33
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.400
we eventually get to the final solution.

34
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.070
So, that's a fun story.

35
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.185
And this one needs the slash.

36
00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:08.610
The last one,
the default route object, no slash.

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.127
Response page path needs a slash.

38
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.359
I would love to tell you eventually
remember all these things but

39
00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.435
clearly as you saw I did not.

40
00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:21.745
&gt;&gt; Quick question with the disabling
the static website hosting.

41
00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.545
Do we also wanna disable it for
the www bucket?

42
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.542
&gt;&gt; That will just redirect.

43
00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:29.281
Should, yeah.

44
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:30.465
&gt;&gt; It don't matter either way.

45
00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:31.100
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

46
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.569
Let's find out.

47
00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.708
&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I also think that the www is now going

48
00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.201
directly to CloudFront.

49
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:38.831
&gt;&gt; Sure.

50
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:42.352
&gt;&gt; Right, so that bucket now is
useful in some cases, right?

51
00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:45.640
Like, there is no necessity
that you have to use s3.

52
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.710
If you use CloudFront.

53
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.291
There is no necessity that you
have to use clustering to use s3.

54
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.418
So some of these things like, If you use
the whole solution, you might slice and

55
00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:55.342
dice it in slightly different ways.

56
00:02:55.342 --> 00:03:00.110
But I'm pretty sure our
www is also good to go.

57
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.560
And it's also secured.

58
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.598
One thing to note is there
was a minute there earlier,

59
00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:09.739
where I was not going to
redirect it from HTTP to HTTPS.

60
00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.605
That was simply DNS catching up.

61
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:15.645
I opened it in Chrome that didn't
have the same DNS cache, it was fine.

62
00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:20.299
The browser just was confused
that were wildly changing our

63
00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.780
deployment structures in
our time together, awesome.

64
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.720
So we've got that in place.

65
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.750
All right, and so

66
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.820
we should have our client side routes
let's just verify that as well.

67
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.205
Nope, but that one's unclear if
that's because it hasn't deployed yet

68
00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:44.825
or not So we'll go check that one again in
a second, and find out did we mess up, or

69
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.452
do things just take a while.

70
00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:49.130
So if I go to my distributions,
it's still declined.

71
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.990
So I can't we not, we cannot confirm that,
we have messed anything up yet.

72
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.850
But, we'll go just check to make sure.

73
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.844
Error pages, I've got the 404s,
going to index HTML with a 200.

74
00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.180
I'm gonna assume it's just
deploying at this exact moment.

75
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.037
So, one of the things I promised you
was I was gonna look into why my

76
00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:13.300
client side routes weren't working.

77
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.125
And, it's almost as if I can't read,
which is, if we look at the error,

78
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680
The error says, Access Denied.

79
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.797
Now, I'm using Safari in this case
just to keep the account simple,

80
00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:35.650
but we all know the 404
is not Access denied.

81
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.560
44 is not found, 403 is Access denied.

82
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.350
And I have only dealt with
the edge case of a 404.

83
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.420
So everything works.

84
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.880
It's the human that's problematic.

85
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.870
So, we can go ahead and
fix that real quick.

86
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.284
We've got the 404, I'm gonna keep
them because that's still a fair,

87
00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:58.820
irresponsible, create another custom one.

88
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.683
Like in my notes is like,
also make one 4o4 or 3 I was like,

89
00:05:01.683 --> 00:05:02.870
I don't need to do that.

90
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.424
Got up we need to give it
that page path as well.

91
00:05:14.207 --> 00:05:17.130
We'll send them over to this one
has to have the slash, remember.

92
00:05:23.102 --> 00:05:26.790
The saving grace is once you get this
all set up, you mostly leave it forever.

93
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.628
So, that makes you feel better.

94
00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:32.977
All right, so now if we look,
we're deploying it again, but

95
00:05:32.977 --> 00:05:38.180
I'm gonna, okay, there's no reason,
we'll check on it a little bit.

96
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.700
We'll put it back in the oven.

97
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.116
I was suspicious that going that quickly
with the error response was gonna work but

98
00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:46.590
we'll find out together.
