00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.042
This repo, AWS for
frontend has a very like simple react demo

2
00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:08.930
app that we're just going
to use to deploy it.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.074
It's got some client side routes.

4
00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:16.348
The normal stuff that you might see as
well as kind of all the things that we're

5
00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:21.561
gonna talk about with some pictures in
a lot of cases with arrows and kind of.

6
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.361
Everything I'm ging to say is
also written out as well, so

7
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:30.092
you can kind of follow along both as
I'm going through it as well as kind of

8
00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.640
refer to this stuff later as well.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
We're using some of the least
expensive parts of AWS, right?

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.740
They are ways to run yourself up.

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.369
A hefty bill in AWS but typically, s3 and

12
00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:50.060
CloudFront are not a ways to do it.

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.536
Even at full cost like I believe
the CloudFront functions,

14
00:00:55.536 --> 00:01:00.245
I think after you blow through
the free tier is three

15
00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:05.520
quarters of a penny for
10,000 requests, right?

16
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.672
And stuff along those lines.

17
00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:11.391
But there is also a kind of
free tier that you get for

18
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:17.148
your first year in AWS which is going to
cover a lot of what we're gonna need for

19
00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:22.108
now, we care mostly about these
first three I just threw a few other

20
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:26.680
ones in there because they
might be of interest.

21
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.367
To some of us which is you get about
five gigabytes of storage on s3,

22
00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:34.574
there's some joke in there about how
the like size of your average client side

23
00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.210
application keeps growing.

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.150
Probably not to five gigs.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.680
So right.

26
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm also gonna keep that in mind too
because there are certain choices

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.040
that I'm going to make where I will
explain my thinking around them,

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.120
but you might philosophically
make a different choice, for

29
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.110
instance I'll kind of
give you one of them now.

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.056
When I build a new version of the
application, index that HQL is fresh, but

31
00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:04.001
all of the JavaScript and
CSS files are fingerprinted,

32
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.072
I don't remove the old ones
cuz like one time in 2017,

33
00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:12.520
somebody accidentally deleted the wrong
JavaScript files and took down production.

34
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.700
For once, it was not me.

35
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.840
Normally when production goes down,
it's my fault.

36
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.941
But so those are reasons that
you might choose that that does

37
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:23.650
not fit with your just, general aesthetic.

38
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.210
And that is totally fine.

39
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.090
That is just my choice.

40
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.214
Cloudfront we get one terabyte of data
transfer people pulling down the cached

41
00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:33.380
versions of our site.

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.810
So that is part of also why.

43
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.250
And some of these also have like
a monthly amount of free usage as well.

44
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.686
It's usually like only once you're over
and we expel stuff from the cache and

45
00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:48.200
Cloudfront you get 1000
invalidations a month.

46
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.661
So a question I got a lot of times was
like what happens if we go past that?

47
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:54.454
One, it's like pennies and

48
00:02:54.454 --> 00:02:59.248
two if we're deploying more than
1000 times a month I'm okay, right?

49
00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:01.563
My team will pay for those pennies.

50
00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:05.731
So, yeah just kind of things to
kind of think about their ways.

51
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:10.075
They're always to kind of calculate this,
but like I said sometimes you don't really

52
00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:13.962
know and usually your biggest bills
are from boobers not from the paved path.

53
00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:19.278
But like I said for the technologies
that we will we'll be using

54
00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:26.320
today a lot of them are definitely some of
the safer for your wallet in these casese.

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.002
That said even if you're using the free
tier AWS is not going to let you

56
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.117
sign up without a credit card.

57
00:03:33.117 --> 00:03:36.472
Part of the reason for that is yes,
in case you do run up a big bill,

58
00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:39.278
the other part having worked
at SAS companies before,

59
00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:43.548
which is if you give people access to your
infrastructure, and you don't make them

60
00:03:43.548 --> 00:03:46.847
give you a credit card,
they will use it for bad things, right?

61
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.464
So a lot of cases like some of that is
just fraud prevention stuff as well.

62
00:03:53.464 --> 00:03:58.595
So with that we're going to go through
the process of setting up an account.

63
00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:00.655
I have some of
the screenshots here as well.

64
00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:06.989
I'm gonna go through it with you but
at some point we will kind of take a break

65
00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.435
as I do the fun part of putting in
my phone number and my credit card
