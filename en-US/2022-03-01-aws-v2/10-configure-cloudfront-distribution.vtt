WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.296
Our regular domain is better, we're in
the process of having an SSL in place.

2
00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:09.626
We kind of fixed the client
side routing issue half x,

3
00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.678
we'll go get ourselves half credit for
that one.

4
00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:20.616
And now we have the issue where it's still
located my case and In Virginia, right?

5
00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:24.026
Not too bad, but
like the further you get from Virginia,

6
00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:25.812
the worse it's going to get.

7
00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:30.140
So the way that we will solve for that is
using a little thing called CloudFront.

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.632
We'll talk about that one together.

9
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.712
We're gonna set up CloudFront,

10
00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:41.762
CloudFront takes a little bit because,
like mentioned before,

11
00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:46.828
it's setting up your assets
on a CDN around the world.

12
00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:51.871
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna go
through and set it up for a little bit.

13
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.927
Then we'll talk about and explain that,
while it's baking, and that will

14
00:00:56.927 --> 00:01:02.390
then allow us to hopefully by the time I'm
done talking, it should be ready to go.

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.596
So the steps that we're gonna do together,
I'm just gonna kind of call them out,

16
00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:08.119
is we're gonna create a new
CloudFront distribution, right?

17
00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.772
A distribution is just a CloudFront setup.

18
00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:15.657
If S3 is buckets,
then CloudFront is distributions, right?

19
00:01:15.657 --> 00:01:19.664
So we're distributing your app around
the world, it's a CloudFront distribution.

20
00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:22.478
We are gonna point it at
our static website on S3,

21
00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.429
we'll add in those domain names.

22
00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.485
We'll set up the GCP and
brought lien of our applications,

23
00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:29.207
will set a default route object.

24
00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:33.248
Basically set a point to the S3 bucket
you will now talk to CloudFront.

25
00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:37.608
While that is all cooking, we will kind of
get a little bit more into what CloudFront

26
00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:41.308
is and why we did all of that, but
let's start the process in our case.

27
00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:44.729
So we'll head over to CloudFront,

28
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.298
back in the console,
we'll find CloudFront.

29
00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:52.541
There's also Cloud Nine, cloud
formation which is like templates for

30
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:53.467
a lot of this stuff.

31
00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:57.934
CloudWatch, which is your logs,

32
00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:02.254
Cloud Nine, which is an editor.

33
00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:07.225
It's great, everything's great, so
let's get this set up, let's go ahead and

34
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:10.073
we'll create a new
CloudFront distribution.

35
00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:14.519
So the origin domain,
we're gonna start by,

36
00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.763
it feels really tempting to
pick one of these If you do,

37
00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:23.300
it will break quietly and silently.

38
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.567
Now there's a way to get these
working in a little bit, but

39
00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:31.748
right now without actually
pointing out the S3 bucket,

40
00:02:31.748 --> 00:02:35.421
We wanna point to the actual
website that we have.

41
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.409
But yeah, usually like yeah,
I'm gonna click one of these,

42
00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.028
it's not gonna be a great scene.

43
00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:43.334
So there's a way to eventually get
this working in a little bit, but

44
00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.011
we're gonna have to do some
additional steps as well.

45
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:51.008
And we'll actually solve for another
problem as we handle that, but for now,

46
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.581
go back into that bucket actually for
a second, so S3.

47
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.818
And we'll find, superawesome.click,
into the properties.

48
00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.757
We want this version of the URL.

49
00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:13.366
So CloudFront is gonna point at that URL,
like I said,

50
00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.746
if you pick that one from the list,
it won't work.

51
00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.940
A lot of this stuff with S3 and
CloudFront is like oral history, so

52
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.094
there's a lot of places that will
say you can never get it to work.

53
00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:27.142
If you picked from that list,
it's technically not true anymore,

54
00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:32.480
we'll cover how to make it work, but right
now it's definitely still true, so, yeah.

55
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.736
So it's one of those things you guys,
to be careful what you read,

56
00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:40.847
some of the stuff like most things,
so we'll paste in that URL.

57
00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:45.067
And you can see that it mostly
figured out where it's going,

58
00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:47.154
we have that kind of in place.

59
00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:50.306
So you can basically add any custom
headers we don't really need at

60
00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:50.929
this point.

61
00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.864
Origin shield is even more protection,
origin shield we talked about CloudFront.

62
00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:58.295
I'll kind of mentioned a little bit more,

63
00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:04.127
we'll make sure even fewer things
make it to the actual source, right?

64
00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:07.986
It's usually helpful to protect
load from your actual servers, for

65
00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:11.910
the case of S3 buckets, it's maybe
not the most important thing, so

66
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.854
we're gonna skip it just for now.

67
00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:18.081
Scrolling down a little bit more,
we've got the path pattern,

68
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:21.770
we basically want the same basic setup for
most things.

69
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.979
I'll show you how to add
special cases like no,

70
00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.473
I want my images to have a different
cache policy than my JavaScript files.

71
00:04:27.473 --> 00:04:32.120
You can do all that right now, we just
don't have enough to care just yet.

72
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.312
It used to be that the settings for this,

73
00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:37.668
you had to change a whole bunch
to actually do the right thing.

74
00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:44.114
The nice part about the modern day
setup of CloudFront is that like,

75
00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:48.425
the good choices are mostly in place for
you.

76
00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:50.705
So yeah,
we would like to compress objects,

77
00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:53.832
like cool if you can Jesup things and
use Brotli compression.

78
00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:57.493
Please do, right, don't make me opt
into that I would like that please.

79
00:04:57.493 --> 00:05:03.252
The one we are gonna change which
is if they go to HTTP colon slash,

80
00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:06.625
just move them over to HTTPS, right?

81
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:11.192
So have that in place allowed methods,
this one for our cases,

82
00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:13.184
getting head is just fine.

83
00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:16.642
However, you could put CloudFront in front
of an API, as well, which point you would

84
00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:19.444
might want to let POST requests
through and stuff along those lines.

85
00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.896
So this one would just putting
the static assets there,

86
00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:27.826
they're just gonna get our lovely web
pages and load them into their browsers.

87
00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:31.655
We'll go with the recommended
cache policy,

88
00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:36.474
we will spend more than enough
time in this section later.

89
00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:41.239
Going through, use all the edge locations
versus US only North America and

90
00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:44.424
Europe, yeah,
you can pick different regions.

91
00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:49.115
Some of this might have to do with
those ads on YouTube videos and

92
00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:52.223
podcasts for VPN where you can get stuff.

93
00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:57.192
Also different legal requirements on where
you can and cannot have data so on and

94
00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:57.867
so forth.

95
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:00.474
But for our cases like, yeah,

96
00:06:00.474 --> 00:06:06.005
we want the best possible
performance alternative domain name.

97
00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:09.197
We do want to set that up and

98
00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:14.569
we're gonna add in superawesome.click or

99
00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.504
in your case your own and you guessed it,

100
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:23.297
www.superawesome.click.

101
00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:30.100
So then we need to tell it where
the SSL HTTPS, all right, fingers crossed.

102
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.443
Hey, my cert is ready,
as we did it before.

103
00:06:35.443 --> 00:06:38.607
I would have been a real bummer if I got
this far like and now we have to stop,

104
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:39.645
go make a cert and wait.

105
00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:44.523
So the reason we made that certificate
before in the Amazon certificate

106
00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:48.442
manager is to have it ready to go now,
so that is in place.

107
00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:53.528
You'll notice if you don't see it,

108
00:06:53.528 --> 00:06:58.864
you might have to go regenerate it in
US East one, right, the little note here,

109
00:06:58.864 --> 00:07:04.144
which is certificate must be generated
in US East, North Virginia region 1.

110
00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:08.152
The reason for that is technically while
CloudFront is globally distributed,

111
00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:10.740
that is like technically
where CloudFront lives.

112
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.639
So all the CloudFront specific
stuff needs to be in US East 1,

113
00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.669
so if you had a US East 2 or a US West 2.

114
00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.234
Which is when I was like
doing it the other day, and

115
00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:24.546
then I had to do it a second time
because I forgot about that fact.

116
00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:28.241
You do need to just go through
the same process we did before,

117
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:33.394
we'll give you a little time, a little bit
to just regenerate the cert in US East 1.

118
00:07:33.394 --> 00:07:39.617
Going on, I want to support HTTP/2, which
we'll talk about in a second as well.

119
00:07:39.617 --> 00:07:44.959
And then the default route object in
this case is gonna be slash index.HTML,

120
00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:48.097
right, just as it was
when we set it up in S3.

121
00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:54.511
Go ahead and
we will create that distribution, and

122
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:59.216
while we're at it,
we are going to change the route 53 for

123
00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:04.878
now pointing to the just the bucket,
to our CloudFront distribution.

124
00:08:19.884 --> 00:08:26.166
Registered domains, managed DNS,
remember we're gonna view the details.

125
00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:34.560
In this case we can go find it,
edit the record,

126
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.405
now alias instead to
a CloudFront distribution,

127
00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:42.419
that's gonna be in US East 1.

128
00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.579
Here's our very fancy name,
if you did not register domain name,

129
00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:49.042
obviously don't have to do this part.

130
00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:53.711
But this will likely be the domain
name that you'll be working with,

131
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.429
which is totally fine, and
we'll have that in place.

132
00:08:57.429 --> 00:08:59.311
And everything else
here seems really cool,

133
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:01.250
this is what I was talking
about before about.

134
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.092
If you had multiple servers, right, and

135
00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:05.257
you wanted to route it to
the one closest to them.

136
00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:07.237
They want the lowest latency so
on and so forth,

137
00:09:07.237 --> 00:09:10.271
we're using CloudFront which that
is literally what CloudFront does.

138
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:17.171
So we don't need that but kind of just
pointing out that was there All right,

139
00:09:17.171 --> 00:09:22.704
so now we are also
updating the DNS as well,

140
00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:28.563
let's go ahead and
do the same, for the www.

141
00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:35.674
So we will let that cook for
a little bit, in the meantime,

142
00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:37.620
let's talk a little bit about S3.
