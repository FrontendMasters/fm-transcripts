WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.537
That's where we are.

2
00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:06.620
And now we are gonna hop into
section five, technical writing.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.471
This first bit here is just we had
a bunch of stuff on communication.

4
00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:14.246
How does that apply to
specifically technical writing?

5
00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:18.666
Everything I told you before
generally applies to meetings,

6
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:24.113
public speaking, writing emails,
writing memos, writing slide decks.

7
00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:29.833
Here I'm going to be focused on the act
of actually mostly just writing docs,

8
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.100
but this could apply to
slide decks as well.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.301
And I say that as well because when
I was at Microsoft, everything,

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.158
everything was a slide deck.

11
00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:40.974
We didn't write very many Word docs.

12
00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.545
We generally, even when we weren't
gonna present it to anybody,

13
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.984
we wrote it in a slide deck and
sent it to them.

14
00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:47.745
That was just the culture.

15
00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:51.910
And then I got to Stripe, and Stripe
almost has a rule against slide decks.

16
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.286
So everything was a doc,
we would get into meetings and

17
00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:58.865
we would look at docs together.

18
00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.677
I mean they're both extremes,
that spectrum.

19
00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:05.108
I think I prefer the docs personally
because I was really good at going

20
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:08.479
through, I actually bought an iPad just so
I could sit on my couch and

21
00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.624
read docs, there's so many docs to read.

22
00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:13.862
I got a lot of context
really quickly with that.

23
00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:16.958
But from a visual perspective,
it's lacking, right?

24
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.137
Because putting things into a slide
deck gets people in a visual mindset and

25
00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:25.264
this will put like a lot of visual aids
in there, which I think is helpful.

26
00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:27.725
So, I don't know, it's a trade-off.

27
00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:29.005
Both of them have their downfalls.

28
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.403
Snowflake is a good mix of both.

29
00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:33.182
So I think that actually works out fairly

30
00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.916
well
&gt;&gt; Do you have an opinion about

31
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:43.338
[CROSSTALK] well, scope it out [LAUGH] And
if you're Edward Tufte, this one's easy.

32
00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:48.707
But is there a format that you prefer or
you'd recommend, culturally there's

33
00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:53.929
preferred formats, but long forms are not
going to go into slides very well.

34
00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.062
And documents are not going
to encourage terseness.

35
00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:01.833
Do you did you have a set of practices to
help yourself you know, keep the format

36
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:05.902
from infringing the information
that you wanted to communicate?

37
00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:08.853
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good question.

38
00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:13.134
I mean, my high-level principle,
is I just want to get stuff done.

39
00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:17.264
I'm really excited to build things,
and I'm really not excited to

40
00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:20.898
spend time arguing about things
that I think I'm right on.

41
00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:24.029
Particularly with, if I feel like I'm
going to something that I'm not going to

42
00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:26.503
learn something, I kind of go in
there like a bull and just say,

43
00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:29.242
either we're going to do this or
I'm going to go around you, right?

44
00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:30.597
[LAUGH] So given that,

45
00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:35.501
I generally cater strongly to the audience
that I'm going to be speaking to.

46
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.475
And so, executives do really
well with slide decks, right?

47
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:43.563
Architects love documents.

48
00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:47.157
And so I kind of try to cater my
communication to the audience.

49
00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:51.454
It's just kind of like I'm very
much a pragmatist in the sense of,

50
00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.677
I don't care how I get it done, but

51
00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:58.396
I'm just going to get it done because
I'm really excited to get it done.

52
00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:01.600
If you'd asked me like just purely
on preference, I like writing docs,

53
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.762
I think I'm better at it.

54
00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:06.368
I think I write better, and
I still use a lot of visuals on my doc.

55
00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:10.984
So I'll actually have sections on
diagramming here of how I think you

56
00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:14.499
can make your docs more
appealing to a visual crowd.

57
00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.601
I think that is probably
the best way to do it.

58
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.678
I love the format of having
a one-pager proposal for

59
00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:26.497
something, having maybe
a six-pager ish product spec, and

60
00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.741
then if you need something having a 15,

61
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:35.140
20 pager technical analysis,
architecting kind of doc, right?

62
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.708
And that kind of minimum context,
medium context, massive context.

63
00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:43.479
I think that kind of information
hierarchy works really well.

64
00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.652
If I was running a company,
that's generally how I would do it.

65
00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:48.922
Whoever proposes it writes the one-pager.

66
00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:55.303
Whoever PMs it writes the 6 pager and
whoever architects writes the 20-pager.

67
00:03:55.303 --> 00:04:00.073
And sometimes in there,
if gathering a company around

68
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:05.372
a slide deck makes sense,
I will use that tool when I need it.

69
00:04:05.372 --> 00:04:08.995
But you have to kind of think of these
docs not in terms of just when I'm going

70
00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:10.318
to be presenting to it, but

71
00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:13.900
it's actually your ability to influence
people when you're not there.

72
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.473
So if you write a really good doc and

73
00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:17.642
it gets sent on to someone
that you don't know,

74
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.566
that's you extending your influence beyond
just your immediate ring of influence.

75
00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:26.072
That artifact carries power beyond you.

76
00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:30.383
Now some of you are at startups and beyond
you is literally the person next to you.

77
00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:31.519
But me at Microsoft,

78
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:35.690
I found out people in totally disparate
parts of the organization were reading

79
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.752
my docs and they were basing their own
processes on stuff that I had written.

80
00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:40.273
I had no idea.

81
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:41.411
Right?

82
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.743
And so I was able to have influence
without even cognition, right,

83
00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:49.707
that's real power, almost,
no, I'm just kidding [LAUGH].

84
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:53.180
But it is,
it's cool to have that kind of influence.

85
00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.771
Okay I will say that I don't actually,
as much as I'm talking about writing,

86
00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:03.695
as much as I think about writing,
I actually don't really like it.

87
00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:05.764
It's not like I'm pumped to get up and
I'm like,

88
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.406
I'm gonna get into Google Docs today.

89
00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.647
I do not do that, right?

90
00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:12.859
And sometimes I even dread it sometimes,
right?

91
00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:16.775
But I do recognize that it is my lever for
influence.

92
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.562
So, I'm just gonna throw that out there.

93
00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:20.941
If you feel the same way,

94
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:24.225
I'm just validating that like
it can be okay to feel a little

95
00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:28.505
bit of dread at like, I'm going to
have to write another long doc today.

96
00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:29.364
But yeah, it is.

97
00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:31.960
It's by far your way to be most effective.

98
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.248
And like I'm saying, this is a PMing
course, but if you're in QA,

99
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:40.763
if you are in production, if you
are in Customer Service, if you're in

100
00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:45.431
customer service and like a bug keeps
happening to all of your customers,

101
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.458
write a doc about it and
send it to the engineering org, right?

102
00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:54.968
That's, your ability to change how
stuff happens over there, right?

103
00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:58.336
It's not enough to just talk about,
it's not enough to complain about it.

104
00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:04.210
Having it written down allows it
to be shared and shared again.

105
00:06:06.253 --> 00:06:08.373
Cool.

106
00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:13.700
So, who is reading your email,
memo, slide deck?

107
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.337
Think about it.

108
00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:17.035
Sometimes even write it.

109
00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:19.765
And this actually has been
really useful for me.

110
00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:22.018
I wrote a really long strategy doc.

111
00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:24.232
I was really proud of it and
I was writing it for

112
00:06:24.232 --> 00:06:27.099
internal people that were
already bought into my vision.

113
00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.387
And when I went to my boss and
we talked about it,

114
00:06:31.387 --> 00:06:37.618
this was several companies ago,
they were, why did you write this?

115
00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:40.566
Like none of this makes any sense to
like the CEO and stuff like that,

116
00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.166
I was like, that's because I
wasn't writing it for them.

117
00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.485
Like I was writing this for
internal stakeholders, and

118
00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:48.394
like having that discussion really
quickly realized that like,

119
00:06:48.394 --> 00:06:50.532
we had way different ideas
of what this doc was for.

120
00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:52.559
And the answer is we were both right.

121
00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.680
Both of those docs were super necessary.

122
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.905
But those mismatched expectations
meant that, the wrong doc got

123
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:01.138
written whenever we thought
the other doc was gonna get written.

124
00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:03.395
So the end result is that we
ended up writing another doc and

125
00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:04.556
then we had two docs, right?

126
00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:13.570
So getting that right, making sure that
you are matching your audience, critical.

127
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.702
Yeah.

128
00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:20.570
You write differently for internal
stakeholders versus external stakeholders.

129
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.017
I haven't said this anywhere in here, but

130
00:07:24.017 --> 00:07:29.679
like be really careful around initialisms,
acronyms, code names.

131
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:34.272
If you don't think it's going to be
obvious to everybody writing that doc,

132
00:07:34.272 --> 00:07:36.366
don't use it, just spell it out.

133
00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:39.505
One thing that Stripe did that
actually was every company has like,

134
00:07:39.505 --> 00:07:42.233
we have an acronym database where
you can look up anything, and

135
00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:44.157
it's never up to date, except Stripe's.

136
00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:49.197
Stripe did a really good job of keeping
all of theirs up to date, but it was so

137
00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:54.077
old and so long that every initialism
had at least four or five entries for

138
00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:58.961
as like, here's what CTA means,
and there was like nine entries.

139
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.943
So good luck figuring it out.

140
00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:05.849
In other words, you are driving
understanding, you are optimizing for

141
00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:10.603
the understanding of readers, not for
how fast you can write the doc.

142
00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:12.950
So always optimize for the reader.

143
00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.093
And I'm giving you a bunch of things here.

144
00:08:19.093 --> 00:08:22.308
Some docs are just written
to be shared quickly, right?

145
00:08:22.308 --> 00:08:25.674
Like if you're taking
minutes from a meeting,

146
00:08:25.674 --> 00:08:30.312
don't overthink it and
turn it into this wonderful bit of prose.

147
00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:31.030
Write quickly.

148
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.173
Some of those actually are optimized
to be written quickly, and are just,

149
00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:37.362
reminders of what stuff that happens.

150
00:08:37.362 --> 00:08:41.586
Or, if you're like writing like
a half-page email to that's just going to

151
00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:44.300
one of your colleagues,
write it fast, right?

152
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:50.760
Value your time with their time
in those particular cases.

153
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.577
So make sure you're focusing on a reader,

154
00:08:53.577 --> 00:08:58.276
therefore you don't underwrite and
therefore you don't overwrite,

155
00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:02.125
you want to be right there in
that sweet spot in the middle.

156
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:06.733
And like we're going to like we're
getting back in here to the say less, but

157
00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:11.485
let me just assure you that zero percent
of readers read every word in your doc or

158
00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.520
your email, or your slide deck.

159
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.256
0%.

160
00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:15.563
No one reads every word.

161
00:09:15.563 --> 00:09:17.284
Everybody skims.

162
00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:21.980
Really interested people like will pause
frequently on what they're skimming for,

163
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.216
but they're still skimming, and
uninterested people might open the doc and

164
00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:27.408
then close it again.

165
00:09:27.408 --> 00:09:29.102
Right?

166
00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:31.158
Nobody reads your entire doc.

167
00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:35.615
I venture to say you are not going to
read your entire doc later, right?

168
00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:40.666
So ruthlessly cut unnecessary stuff
from your doc because you run the risks

169
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:45.732
then of people skimming over the stuff
that you actually want them to read.

170
00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:49.551
I'll talk about how to anchor your doc
in different ways to get people to read

171
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:51.580
the parts that you want them to read, but

172
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.881
just recognize, you're basically
in a race against the clock.

173
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:57.869
And the clock is their attention span,
right?

174
00:09:57.869 --> 00:10:00.963
So make sure you are saying
the correct things and

175
00:10:00.963 --> 00:10:04.823
you're cutting out anything
that doesn't need to be read.

176
00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:08.711
Sometimes you have 15 seconds to talk
to your reader, sometimes you have

177
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:13.030
five minutes, extremely rarely do you have
more than five minutes to talk to your,

178
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.265
whoever's reading your particular doc.

179
00:10:15.265 --> 00:10:16.570
So, optimize for that.

180
00:10:21.338 --> 00:10:21.921
Yeah.

181
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.550
Rarely will it take
more than five minutes.

182
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.072
One to two minutes is
a pretty engaged reader.

183
00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:30.302
And, like, 30 seconds to a minute
is probably your average reader.

184
00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:31.194
They're going to skim.

185
00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.866
They're going to look for
stuff that's interesting to them.

186
00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.623
They'll read blurbs here and there.

187
00:10:34.623 --> 00:10:35.873
And then they are done.

188
00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:41.539
And reading another doc,
to reading another doc right?

189
00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:43.812
So respect their time.

190
00:10:43.812 --> 00:10:48.194
Every place I've gone I've had a couple of
like really trusted PMs that I work with

191
00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:51.179
or engineering managers or
engineers or whatever, and

192
00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:55.435
I've written some important doc,
very quickly I'll just send them like, and

193
00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:59.585
I'll ask specifically is like,
am I capturing what we're working on here?

194
00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:03.147
And I'll usually get pretty quick feedback
of like, do you agree with the content?

195
00:11:03.147 --> 00:11:04.619
Do you agree with how this is formatted?

196
00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:07.062
Does this communicate pretty well?

197
00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:11.872
And when you find those people that are
like, you both value what they think, and

198
00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:16.430
they will give you ruthless feedback,
worth their weight in gold, right?

199
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.925
Like I was,
I was talking about Maggie earlier.

200
00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:22.184
That's literally why I took Maggie
from Microsoft to Stripe with me,

201
00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:24.432
because she's phenomenal at that.

202
00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:28.786
She's probably one of the, she's probably
the best person at that that I know.

203
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:30.883
And I tried to take her to Snowflake,
didn't work.

204
00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:35.965
[LAUGH] So finding someone like that,
some sort of trusted partner for

205
00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:39.918
me, at Snowflake now it's
my engineering manager.

206
00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:44.231
I send everything to him quickly,
he once-overs it,

207
00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:47.061
my boss is really awesome at it too.

208
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:51.507
And getting some quick feedback on that.

209
00:11:51.507 --> 00:11:55.396
Having a culture of commenting
on docs is helpful as well.

210
00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:57.595
So like Snowflake is
really good about this.

211
00:11:57.595 --> 00:12:00.101
Everyone will just highlight something,
leave a comment in it.

212
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:04.601
And then there's always an appendix at
the bottom of every Snowflake doc of just

213
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.629
long-form comments from people.

214
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:11.687
That was new to me and
I actually quite liked that.

215
00:12:11.687 --> 00:12:15.604
So in order to get that kind of feedback
from other people and get useful feedback

216
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:19.539
and thoughtful feedback from people,
you need to be a useful partner for them.

217
00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:23.443
So, that's sort of some sort
of reciprocation there so

218
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.694
getting some sort of eye for it.

219
00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:28.568
And really that really involves
moving beyond yourself and

220
00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:32.303
not saying things just to say things
because we all know people that say things

221
00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:34.328
just to hear the sound of their own voice.

222
00:12:34.328 --> 00:12:40.746
But actually trying to give them concrete
steps to accomplishing their goals,

223
00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:46.603
that's the mark of a good editor or
a good comment or feedback provider.

224
00:12:46.603 --> 00:12:52.159
So those two things I think will
yield good feedback quickly.
