1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.382
So, like documents that
we've been talking about.

2
00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:06.024
Some documents,
don't need a lot of editing and

3
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.998
can be sent relatively rough
draft first try, right?

4
00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:13.120
And some documents are so
important that need multiple editors and

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.958
multiple weeks of revisions and
multiple people to sign off.

6
00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.150
This is the same exact principles
applied to meeting prep.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.970
There are some meetings that you
can just walk into where the last

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.080
step before you enter the conference
room or click your Zoom button.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.359
You can just think of,
what do I want from this?

10
00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.460
What are we gonna talk about?

11
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.445
Cool, right, and that 15 seconds of
thinking you can just kind of set your

12
00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:41.260
intention and you can kind of give
yourself a rough agenda in your brain.

13
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.920
And then you go into the meeting and
that's great.

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.721
One on ones recurring meetings where
you're just kind of updating status and

15
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.010
stuff like that or
kind of meetings like that.

16
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.230
There are other meetings, like the one
I was telling you about before,

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.530
where you should be thinking about it the
month before you get into that meeting.

18
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.810
And you should have multiple
people look at your slide deck.

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.060
You should have multiple people look
at your agenda and your timeboxing.

20
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.189
You should have talked to every person
that's gonna be in that meeting so

21
00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.299
that nothing surprises you.

22
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.550
So that's the spectrum here, right,

23
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.630
most meetings are gonna fall
somewhat in the middle.

24
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.130
So, first thing is set your intention.

25
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.890
This is your meeting.

26
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.900
What do you want out of it?

27
00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.562
Sometimes that can just
be context sharing.

28
00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.047
I'm gonna say if your intention
is just context sharing,

29
00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:37.158
maybe go one step further.

30
00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:42.058
Just think of, okay, I am gonna share this
context with someone because I want them

31
00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:46.686
to do this and wanting them to continue
to do whatever they're doing is valid.

32
00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:50.379
But just make sure that that is your
intention when you enter that room.

33
00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.337
But typically it's gonna be something
like, I'm sharing all these metrics about

34
00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:57.050
your service because I want
you to improve your service or

35
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.720
change what your service does, right?

36
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.123
And just going in with that, intention
will allow you to hone your message, what

37
00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:08.610
slides you show them, what metrics you
show them, who you invite to the meeting.

38
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.326
All those things are gonna come
first by setting your intention and

39
00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:19.169
also thinking about who
is in the invite list.

40
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.750
We have a habit of just
inviting everyone to a meeting.

41
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.740
One, you frequently
are wasting their time, right?

42
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.970
And frequently they
don't have to be there.

43
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.060
And having people that don't need to be
there can often derail meetings, right?

44
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.246
So being intentional about your
invite list can also be helpful.

45
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:45.456
Okay, so set your intention.

46
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:49.193
The agenda, I know a lot of us self
included, don't like to think through

47
00:02:49.193 --> 00:02:52.950
things to thorough, well, I don't
know how long things are gonna take.

48
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.590
It's like software estimating but
for time in meetings, right?

49
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.821
It's really hard to estimate
how long is the topic gonna go?

50
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.820
Cuz you don't know if you're
gonna go on tangents.

51
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.130
You don't know how long people
are gonna ask questions for.

52
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.330
Or, you don't know how long
things are gonna go for.

53
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.926
And so sometimes it's easier to think,
well, I'm just not gonna plan for

54
00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:13.280
this because this seems silly and
hard, right?

55
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.786
I'm still gonna say every
meeting that you go to,

56
00:03:17.786 --> 00:03:22.840
even if it's just in your head, you
should have some sort of agenda, right?

57
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.909
We're gonna talk about this,
we're gonna talk about this and

58
00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.167
when we're done with that,
we're gonna either close the meeting or,

59
00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.196
go off into whatever
tangents that we find.

60
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:35.673
But having some agenda in there
just helps keep people on topic.

61
00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.224
If you don't have a written agenda,
written agenda is always preferable, but

62
00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:46.350
if you don't, I always verbalize
at the beginning of my meetings.

63
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.830
I have planned to talk about X,
Y, and Z today.

64
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.132
Let's make sure we get through all of it,
right?

65
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.166
And what's really,

66
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.504
really useful about that one phrase
at the beginning of the meeting?

67
00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:00.552
Is that if you get a third of
the way through the meeting,

68
00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:03.309
and you have three topics to discuss,

69
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:08.760
you have a very pre-shared bought off on,
okay, we're at time for this.

70
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.281
We gotta move on if we're gonna cover
everything, because otherwise you're

71
00:04:13.281 --> 00:04:16.852
only ever gonna cover the first
thing on your agenda, right?

72
00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:19.139
So having that is a bit
of a superpower for

73
00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.776
allowing you to move
the conversation along.

74
00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:26.960
Helps keep everyone on task and
helps keep yourself on task.

75
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.450
So yeah, just make sure you
have an agenda, somewhat.

76
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.320
A really good place,
at least just a personal tip from me.

77
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.685
If I don't have a written agenda in
some sort of doc that I'm sending out,

78
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.860
I'll just put it in the invite, right?

79
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.138
Hey, this is this meeting.

80
00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:48.260
We're gonna talk about this this week,
blah, right?

81
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.983
And that, anything that you can pre-share
with people that are coming to a meeting

82
00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:55.299
is helpful because if someone else is
coming in with like an agenda topic.

83
00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.303
It helps you get that information before
you start the meeting, which is helpful.

84
00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:03.210
Okay, timeboxing.

85
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.510
So, once you're on the upper side of this
spectrum of how important this meeting is.

86
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.780
Timeboxing goes from someone optional
to becoming extremely important.

87
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.042
If you're going into
an important meeting and

88
00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.710
you have not thought about time boxes for
your agenda,

89
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.530
you are not doing yourself and
everyone in that room is service, right?

90
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.370
So you're gonna come in is I have X,
Y and Z.

91
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.290
We're talking about this for 10 minutes,
we're talking about this for

92
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.040
40 minutes and we're talking
about this for 10 minutes, right?

93
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.160
Just do it.

94
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.340
It's okay that you don't hit the time box.

95
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.330
It's okay for you to throw
the time boxes out the window.

96
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.283
If you're on some tangent and it's,

97
00:05:43.283 --> 00:05:47.087
actually this is really more important
than topic Z at the end, let's cut it.

98
00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:52.490
We'll make a new meeting,
let's pull on the thread here.

99
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.790
That's totally fine.

100
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.695
This is an instrument that if it actually
is important that you talk about Z, and

101
00:05:57.695 --> 00:05:58.700
Y is going too long.

102
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.751
It's, hey everyone,
we're at time for this topic.

103
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.410
We gotta keep going.

104
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.440
The other thing is I'll say is frontload
your meetings with what you wanna

105
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.158
talk about.

106
00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:15.395
Don't worry about some narrative
structure, worry about what's important.

107
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:19.544
So I'll put my topic at the beginning
even if it's five minutes and

108
00:06:19.544 --> 00:06:23.186
timebox there but
make sure your points get across first.

109
00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:25.286
And then other people's points go,

110
00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:29.160
as you can tell I'm very selfish
when it comes to my agenda, right?

111
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.450
Which is fine, because I'm
the most important person here.

112
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.646
So, I mean, whatever I just care
about getting my stuff done and

113
00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:41.992
then I'll also be helpful to other people,
I guess.

114
00:06:44.127 --> 00:06:48.218
Don't be afraid to interrupt people,
if they are going over and

115
00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:49.822
dominating the topics.

116
00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:55.128
I've interrupted CEOs before, I've
interrupted people from other companies

117
00:06:55.128 --> 00:07:00.755
before, hey, we're at time here, wrap up
your thought, we gotta move on, right?

118
00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:05.470
And I've got in trouble for
it and I don't care, right,

119
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.609
cuz that's just someone
running an agenda well.

120
00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:13.928
99 actually, I'm gonna say 999
times out of 1000, everyone's been,

121
00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:17.140
okay, yeah, cool let's move on, right?

122
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.320
Because they're all in the same boat.

123
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.844
Everyone hates meetings the same way,
right?

124
00:07:22.844 --> 00:07:25.336
And I've seen junior PMs interrupt.

125
00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:29.668
I've seen a junior PM interrupt Satya
Nadella in the middle of a meeting and

126
00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:32.368
Satya respect the hell out of it,
so, right?

127
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:35.206
If that junior PM can get up there and
do that, so can you.

128
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:42.840
All right, pet peeve here,
I hate decision by committee meetings.

129
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.036
They're one of my least favorite
things where someone comes in is,

130
00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:47.500
here's a bunch of context.

131
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.176
All right, everyone, let's argue
about what the best solution is,

132
00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:53.062
because usually it's one person.

133
00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:56.192
Usually the person actually does have a
secret decision that they've already made,

134
00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:58.140
and they're gonna try and guide you to it.

135
00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.450
That's annoying.

136
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.031
And then usually there's another person in
the room that has their own opinion about

137
00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:05.590
it and
they just dominate the conversation.

138
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.260
And usually you go end up
with one of those two things.

139
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:14.860
So here is my invitation to, is come in
with a decision made, is here's context.

140
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.100
I wanna do this fight me, right?

141
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.377
That is a way better meeting because
then everyone talks about, okay,

142
00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:24.317
here's why we think your stuff is good or
or you'll end up with,

143
00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:26.840
actually we think this other
solution is really good.

144
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.427
And you'll get a bunch of good reasons
of why yours is insufficient and

145
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.163
or why the other one is a better solution.

146
00:08:34.163 --> 00:08:38.430
But come in with the decisions made and
then discuss it from there.

147
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.259
Because otherwise you end up with
these weird solutions sometimes that

148
00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:45.180
you agreed upon just because someone's
gonna dominate the conversation.

149
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.950
And you just lose control the meeting,
right?

150
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.210
So, come in with a decision made
that's my invitation to you.

151
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.617
I've seen a lot of success from that.

152
00:08:56.617 --> 00:08:59.852
I don't remember where actually I heard
I think it came from some company.

153
00:08:59.852 --> 00:09:02.795
I wanna say it was from the Shopify
blog or something like that.

154
00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:06.860
It's, hey, we do all of our meetings
this way, my gosh, it's so much better.

155
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.133
So I wholesale adopted that.

156
00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:10.950
&gt;&gt; What if the decision
that you made was wrong.

157
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:18.501
How do you eventually
kind of resolve that?

158
00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:21.055
&gt;&gt; I mean, I have a mantra that
I tell myself all the time.

159
00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:24.070
It's, I am an idiot and
I'm learning things all the time, right?

160
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.619
So if you come in with
better things about it,

161
00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:29.110
I have no attachment to
any of my solutions.

162
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.290
So if you come in and you present a bunch
of stuff to me and you convince me,

163
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.500
I am very prepared, it's like,
my gosh, that's so much better.

164
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.910
Let's run with that, right?

165
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.197
So I guess it's just having
the humility and the adaptability and

166
00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:45.400
the recognition that every
one is an idiot, right?

167
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.613
That helps you get over
that really quickly.

168
00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:50.291
Am I answering your question?

169
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:53.268
&gt;&gt; I was like, what if the decision
that you made in this meeting,

170
00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:55.583
everybody agrees that
your option's the best.

171
00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:57.434
A month, two months down the line,

172
00:09:57.434 --> 00:10:00.789
it becomes apparent that maybe
this wasn't the best decision.

173
00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:05.446
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's just sorry, go ahead
&gt;&gt; No, I was gonna say,

174
00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:09.978
do reach back out to the group and
say, perhaps I jumped the gun and

175
00:10:09.978 --> 00:10:12.793
was wrong or do you just forget about it?

176
00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:14.560
What would you do?

177
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just bury everything and
do the wrong thing.

178
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.715
That's what I would say.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

179
00:10:18.715 --> 00:10:20.305
&gt;&gt; No, I'm just kidding.

180
00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:25.357
No, having a culture of
experimentation is critical, right?

181
00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.714
Because it means that you're
gonna try a lot of things and

182
00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:29.840
a lot of stuff is not gonna work.

183
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.990
And having that fail fast
mentality is awesome.

184
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.502
And that culture of learning,
the growth mindset, right?

185
00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:43.480
Of we're not attached to egos here.

186
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.050
We're attached to finding the best thing.

187
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.510
So in those kind of situations,
I have no problem.

188
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.203
Generally, I just don't
point fingers at all,

189
00:10:50.203 --> 00:10:51.990
I don't really care who
came up with the solution.

190
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.638
We all went with it, so it's all of our
fault, right, whether it came from me or

191
00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:57.840
from someone else, you agreed to it.

192
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.621
Who's the bigger idiot the leader or

193
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:03.253
the follower I would say they're both
idiots it doesn't matter, right?

194
00:11:03.253 --> 00:11:07.895
So I would just send an email is, hey we
went with this we found this is better

195
00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:10.474
let's have a chat if that's necessary or

196
00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:15.064
we're just gonna go with the thing
that we actually found is much better.

197
00:11:15.064 --> 00:11:15.941
Does that answer your question?

198
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:16.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

199
00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.301
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; I just was wondering personal

200
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:18.955
philosophy.

201
00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:24.474
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, just doesn't matter to me,
I just like doing the best thing, right?

202
00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.341
I like looking for the best thing.

203
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:30.837
&gt;&gt; I think some organizations are more
open to failures than others.

204
00:11:30.837 --> 00:11:35.408
We're depending on the importance or
I don't know-

205
00:11:35.408 --> 00:11:36.458
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

206
00:11:38.883 --> 00:11:42.801
I think my personal philosophy just
wouldn't last very long in those

207
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:43.550
solutions.

208
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.940
If I was, this is my project and
Brian's name is strongly attached to it.

209
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.656
And if I came back to him and I was, hey,

210
00:11:49.656 --> 00:11:52.480
my solution is actually a really
bad idea and we found that out.

211
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.350
And they're, okay, I guess you're fired.

212
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.019
I'd be, cool.

213
00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:57.787
Where's the severance, right?

214
00:11:57.787 --> 00:12:00.914
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's that, I'll see you all later,

215
00:12:00.914 --> 00:12:01.426
right?

216
00:12:01.426 --> 00:12:03.680
I just wouldn't last very long.

217
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.857
I'm not gonna be a good fit
in that kind of culture.

218
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:09.111
And I'm gonna argue it I think.

219
00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.885
First of all, I know a lot of
cultures are like that and secondly,

220
00:12:11.885 --> 00:12:13.505
I just wouldn't last very long in it.

221
00:12:17.442 --> 00:12:21.679
I'm not the best person to talk
about how to play Game of Thrones or

222
00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:26.090
game of rolling chairs as I
like to call it kinda politics.

223
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.756
I'm great at working around people, but

224
00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:35.956
I'm not great at
the corporate intrigue of how

225
00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:40.906
do I get credit for
bad things kind of thing?

226
00:12:40.906 --> 00:12:42.605
And I was gonna, it is a bad thing and

227
00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:45.779
there are people that are really
good at it I don't wanna play it and

228
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:49.259
I don't have to play it, right,
I can just find somewhere else to work.

229
00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:58.229
To slide deck or to not slide deck,
that's a really cultural thing.

230
00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:03.523
At Microsoft, everything was a slide deck
and at Stripe nothing was a slide deck,

231
00:13:03.523 --> 00:13:07.070
and at Snowflake,
sometimes things are slide decks.

232
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.924
So it's gonna be kind of
based on where you are and

233
00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:14.029
how much there is an expectation of it.

234
00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.833
At Stripe I still had slide
decks from time to time and

235
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:21.378
I would keep them, it does help to keep
discussions focused around a thing, right?

236
00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:24.510
Because there's something they
can literally just point at it's,

237
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.431
all right, people, it's on the screen,
pay attention to it.

238
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:30.740
If you have visuals, that's great.

239
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.640
And it is an artifact afterwards that
you get to share with people, right?

240
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.510
It's like the doc that you can send around
after the meeting, before the meeting,

241
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.012
that people can kind of read through
it and get prepared for the meeting.

242
00:13:39.012 --> 00:13:41.723
I mean, Iwas talking about that monthly
meeting that I had at Microsoft.

243
00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:45.211
My favorite thing about it is I would
usually send that slide deck out like

244
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:47.842
three or four days beforehand
to that vice president,

245
00:13:47.842 --> 00:13:50.640
the vice president that was gonna read it.

246
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.796
And most of those meetings actually, I
would come in and it's, all right, Scott,

247
00:13:54.796 --> 00:13:57.830
you read the deck,
what do you wanna talk about, right?

248
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.324
And I wouldn't actually even
go through the slide deck.

249
00:13:59.324 --> 00:14:01.661
He's, all right,
can we skip to this topic and

250
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.290
we would just jump straight to the one.

251
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.141
And the kind of implicit agreement is,
if we didn't talk about it,

252
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:08.350
he signed off on it, right?

253
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:14.292
So, I really appreciated him for
doing that, and

254
00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:18.850
it's something that you can
build an expectation of.

255
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.779
And a really easy way to do that, you can
build a culture that at least around your

256
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:23.922
meetings is you'd walk in the deck and
it's, all right,

257
00:14:23.922 --> 00:14:25.310
who read the slide deck, right?

258
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.651
And kind of put a little
accountability on it, and

259
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:30.950
if they know that they're gonna
get asked that every week.

260
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.277
And some people are gonna say yes and
some people are gonna say no,

261
00:14:33.277 --> 00:14:36.410
eventually everyone's gonna start reading
or they're gonna stop showing up.

262
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.791
Both those are okay by me, right?

263
00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:44.548
But then you can come in as,
all right, what questions do you have?

264
00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:48.265
What do you wanna talk about, particularly
when you have a long slide deck and

265
00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:50.622
a short meeting,
it becomes really essential.

266
00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:54.902
But sending things out beforehand actually
becomes a big lever of kind of controlling

267
00:14:54.902 --> 00:14:56.039
your conversations.

268
00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:03.816
Cool, just some very basic
things about slide decks,

269
00:15:03.816 --> 00:15:08.424
I've done a lot of public
speaking as I'm presently doing.

270
00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:12.967
But I've spoken at probably a hundred
conferences at this point and

271
00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:15.607
30 or so countries around the world.

272
00:15:15.607 --> 00:15:19.212
It was literally my job for Microsoft for
a while to speak at conferences.

273
00:15:19.212 --> 00:15:24.553
So I have a lot of experience
of making a lot of slide decks,

274
00:15:24.553 --> 00:15:27.720
keep the novellas off the slides.

275
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.910
No one wants to read whole
entire paragraphs around it.

276
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.612
If you really want to put something
right that put it in the notes and

277
00:15:33.612 --> 00:15:34.926
let people read it afterwards.

278
00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:38.701
But you wanna keep the focus off
the sides and usually on you.

279
00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:45.270
So use visuals that tell stories or
help keep people on target.

280
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.758
And then just sentences and short phrases,
that kind of spur discussions.

281
00:15:50.758 --> 00:15:51.990
That's really it.

282
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.330
I like to throw some humor in there
that's just kind of my speaking style.

283
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.101
Some would call it unprofessional but
who cares, right?

284
00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:04.839
It's gonna be up to you it can be up
to the culture who you're presenting

285
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:05.352
to, right?

286
00:16:05.352 --> 00:16:11.180
I was presenting at The bank of Iceland or
one of the banks in Iceland.

287
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.815
It was a long Icelandic name that I
definitely would not be able to pronounce

288
00:16:15.815 --> 00:16:17.170
or reproduce.

289
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.739
It was a large bank in Iceland.

290
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:22.005
And I went in there with a bunch of jokes
in my slides and someone came in after me.

291
00:16:22.005 --> 00:16:25.010
Was, no one ever talks like that here.

292
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.949
I was, do I need to change my slides?

293
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:27.207
No, we'd love it.

294
00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:32.920
[LAUGH] So keep it contextual.

295
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.462
I'm usually not the best at that.

296
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:42.240
When there's 20 plus people in
the meeting, that's where I'll be,

297
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.846
I probably need a slide deck to
keep this kind of thing reined in.

298
00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:48.424
It's also nice too,
you can put your time boxing.

299
00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:51.713
Hey, we have 15 minutes on this
item then we gotta move on.

300
00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:58.126
It's just a good visual cue for that, but
in general I want my focus on people and

301
00:16:58.126 --> 00:17:02.550
not on slides, so
that's kind of my thoughts on that.

302
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.120
But lean into whatever your style is.

303
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.066
Some people are awesome at slide decks and

304
00:17:08.066 --> 00:17:10.130
need a slide deck to
keep everything going.

305
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.667
If that's you, do it,
I have no problem with it.

306
00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:16.924
Some people just wanna get up there and
stand up comedy for a half hour,

307
00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:20.040
I can use a beer too if
you're gonna do that though.
