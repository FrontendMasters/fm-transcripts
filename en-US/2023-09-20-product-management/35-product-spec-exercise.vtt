00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.421
You get to write your own product spec
using all the things I've taught you up to

2
00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:06.260
this point.

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.673
I would say the best thing you could do
here is write something that pertains to

4
00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:12.510
your work, right?

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.512
If you have something already
that you are thinking about,

6
00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:17.260
like I wanna do this, do it.

7
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.760
Do that.

8
00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:24.649
So whether that can be a personal project,
maybe you can be proposing that

9
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.600
I wanna build a, I don't know, fantasy
football tracker or something like that.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.869
I don't know, making stuff up here or

11
00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:38.260
snowboard route tracker or
something of that nature.

12
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.319
Or if you're doing something at work
that like you're about to embark on this

13
00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.780
project and you wanna work on it,
write a product spec for it.

14
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.992
This is best because then you get
to utilize your domain knowledge,

15
00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:51.285
which I think is usually helpful because
that's what you're gonna be doing with

16
00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:52.700
your product specs in the future.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.044
If you're really blanking on ideas,
I wrote down a few of them here,

18
00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:02.701
feel free to take these,
modify them or write another one.

19
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.092
So as an ESPN fantasy sports app user,

20
00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:10.113
I wanna be able to click on a player's
name and instantly see them playing live.

21
00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:14.457
As a user of Zoom, I wanna integrate
my Spotify so I can play music for

22
00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:16.300
everyone on the video call.

23
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.518
And as an open source
project maintainer of Github,

24
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:23.249
I want to be able to assign
dollar amount bounties to issues,

25
00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:28.244
then pay someone who actually fulfills
those issues directly inside of Github.

26
00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.310
Feel free to get creative.

27
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.440
You don't have to do
any one of these here.

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.676
This was just mostly here for
you to get started.

29
00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:41.560
So what did you learn?

30
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.380
Did anyone have any interesting
insights typing into the product specs?

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.440
Or is this just an exercise in futility
and we're just one step closer to death.

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.211
&gt;&gt; Every time I approach a product spec,

33
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:02.920
I'm surprised at how little of my idea
gets on the page in the first draft.

34
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.620
And maybe it is almost a great way for
me, personally, to screw up finishing it.

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.978
Because I'm always surprised
at how the essentials

36
00:02:12.978 --> 00:02:16.860
don't seem to get
communicated the first time.

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.913
&gt;&gt; I think a way that I
help with that is here.

38
00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.951
Writing these two first helps
me quite a bit, the goals and

39
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:27.308
the non goals and
the problem statement, and

40
00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:30.240
writing explicitly what I
expect my user stories to be.

41
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.202
Cuz that, at least for me, if I'm
capturing problems my users have and

42
00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm capturing ways to alleviate
problems that my users are facing,

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.380
if I get nothing else out of this
I was like, here's a problem,

44
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.130
here's how we're choosing
to solve their problem.

45
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.665
Usually I tend to capture the part that I,

46
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.080
that the essence of
what I'm looking to do.

47
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.579
And everything else is just mechanical of
how do we go about solving the problem.

48
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.640
Normally I don't really care how
we go about solving the problem,

49
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.240
I just care that we solve the problem.

50
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.365
I'm not a particular person
that's married to my ideas,

51
00:03:10.365 --> 00:03:14.710
like I've said multiple times during
the course of this course, I'm an idiot.

52
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.678
I know that and
I fully well lean into it, right?

53
00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:23.162
And so if I'm wrong and I know it,
it means I've learned something and

54
00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:24.919
I'm super into that idea.

55
00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.540
&gt;&gt; I think there's some option for
like tenability.

56
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.409
Cuz I think a lot of the ideas that
you're generating probably could be new,

57
00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.730
I don't know.

58
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.745
Do you, do you ever think about that or
when you.

59
00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:38.090
&gt;&gt; Can you rephrase that?

60
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.685
Like a potentiality,
like if you're coming up with a new idea,

61
00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:45.418
do you talk to legal about like-
&gt;&gt; This is something that's completely-

62
00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:46.088
&gt;&gt; I got you.

63
00:03:46.088 --> 00:03:50.240
&gt;&gt; We're doing here and could potentially
make even more money somehow from?

64
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft was really big on that.

65
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.800
They give you an award if
you get something patented.

66
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.126
Actually I think snowflake does it too.

67
00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.532
They have pushed that less on me.

68
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:04.130
But now I talk to legal all the time.

69
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.966
So I would imagine that by involving legal
really early in your product process,

70
00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:11.750
I do it just for liability and
stuff like that.

71
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.177
And generally, the stuff that I'm doing,
I like to push what the terms of service

72
00:04:17.177 --> 00:04:19.360
allows us to do, and
they kind of like rein me in.

73
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.920
It's kind of a process, but

74
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.470
I would hope by those people seeing those
things at those time that they'd be like,

75
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.040
hey, is there you might have
something cool and new here.

76
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.770
Maybe we should talk about that.

77
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.100
That's gonna vary a lot by company.

78
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.810
I know IBM loves that stuff, right?

79
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.375
They just eat that stuff up.

80
00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:43.730
And they, I think IBM year over year
gets the most patents issued to them.

81
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.390
Something like that, which is wild to me.

82
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.361
So, yeah, not something I've
thought about, but particularly for

83
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:51.940
companies that that's a big emphasis.

84
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.850
So I think it's a great idea.

85
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.980
&gt;&gt; Do you capture like resource
costs in your product spec?

86
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.301
Like, is it gonna be like 20 developers
for a year or 100 developers for

87
00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.980
five years or three months or whatever?

88
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.509
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

89
00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.143
&gt;&gt; Is that one of those technical-
&gt;&gt; I would probably capture that

90
00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:13.179
in timeline, you could probably
read timelines and resourcing

91
00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:17.976
here because those are generally
correlated to each other fairly closely.

92
00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:22.576
It's a good call cuz for
the most part I don't capture that but

93
00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:27.350
that's because I only have so
many resources myself, right?

94
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.280
And people know that I'm only managing
two engineering teams right now.

95
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.735
And so I'm not really getting too many
questions about who's resourcing what.

96
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:39.229
It's kind of my engineering managers call,
but I would capture this in like person

97
00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.000
hours or person months or
whatever you would want.

98
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.600
This would be a good place to do it.

99
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.649
And if that was a pertinent question,
which frequently it isn't for me, but

100
00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:54.000
if it was a pertinent question to you,
then yes, I would answer that.

101
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.690
That stripe was a bigger question for me
because I manage so many teams, but yeah.
