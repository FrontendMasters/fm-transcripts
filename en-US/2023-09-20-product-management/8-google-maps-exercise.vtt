1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.580
So here's your exercise.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.599
You are the product manager
of Google Maps, and

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:10.748
are given the director to make it easy to
order food on the Google Maps interface.

4
00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:13.104
So the user story is gonna look like this.

5
00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:16.842
As an end user of Google Maps,
I want to be able to search for local

6
00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.717
restaurants and order food from there,
directly from the Google Maps interface.

7
00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:27.163
Okay, I want you over the next little
bit to list out all the stakeholders

8
00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:31.459
that you think are involved
in this particular feature.

9
00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:36.329
And what you're kind of trading off
between all these different products, or

10
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.226
of these stakeholders if you were to
implement some sort of feature like this.

11
00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:44.584
You can do this in VS Code,

12
00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:47.359
that's probably what I would do
it in cuz I used to work on it.

13
00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.182
So I'm obsessed, or
you can just do it on Google Docs.

14
00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:55.248
Great trick is if you just do docs.new.

15
00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:59.292
It takes you to a brand new Google Doc.

16
00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.114
So that's your exercise.

17
00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:02.016
We'll come back, and

18
00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.768
we'll talk a little bit about it,
but we already did it a little bit,

19
00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:07.920
so we'll go move pretty fast through
the exercise and get on to the next thing.

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
But I think it's just a good exercise in
like, how do we think about stakeholders?

21
00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:19.756
So hopefully,
this was a fun exercise for you.

22
00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:22.403
We can just chat about this out loud and

23
00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:25.731
let me know if you have
different ideas than me.

24
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:29.407
But other than the normal kind
of stakeholders that we're

25
00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:32.035
talking about in the previous exercise,

26
00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:36.629
I would certainly view delivery people
as a unique stakeholder in this.

27
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.740
What's their experience like?

28
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.439
What is the ordering merchant like?

29
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.079
And then you have to consider
the stakeholders inside the restaurant to

30
00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.807
the liner records,
how are they getting their tickets?

31
00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.331
How are they acknowledging their tickets?

32
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.005
How are they saying that they're done?

33
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.667
How are they communicating problems?

34
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.764
You have to worry about your
customer's support in there.

35
00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:00.697
These are all product stakeholders that
have surface area into your application,

36
00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:01.940
and you need to consider.

37
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.459
And so if you're making it easier for
customer support,

38
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.892
are you messing with delivery people?

39
00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:11.934
Are you messing with end users,
like the delivery people?

40
00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:15.298
Those are all kind of people
that I'm thinking about.

41
00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:20.077
I mean, you need to think about people
that are looking at Google Maps that

42
00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.093
are not looking for delivery.

43
00:02:22.093 --> 00:02:24.141
So if you're putting that very front and
center,

44
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:27.530
you're gonna be annoying a lot of people
that don't want that right now, right?

45
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.691
So you need to make it findable but
not annoying.

46
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:35.628
And sometimes that can be
fundamentally at odds, right?

47
00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:39.825
So the other thing that I think
it's really hard with these kind of

48
00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.957
Swiss Army knife kind of products
is what is your point, right?

49
00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:50.410
So if you pull up a listing for a Google
Maps kind of business, what is your point?

50
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.173
And the answer is,

51
00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:54.094
we don't actually know until you
start showing us your intent, right?

52
00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:55.484
So if you're scrolling down,
are you looking for

53
00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:56.654
the hours, are you trying to order food?

54
00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:57.673
Are you trying to make a reservation?

55
00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:00.514
Are you trying to see if the reviews
are good, the reviews are bad?

56
00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.900
Are you trying to leave a review?

57
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.707
Are you a business owner
trying to dispute a review?

58
00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:10.371
There's so many stakeholders there that
making this kind of listing look good and

59
00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:16.135
be useful for so many people ends up being
a really, really, really hard problem.

60
00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:20.109
So I intentionally chose
Google Maps because they

61
00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.525
specifically have that problem, right?

62
00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:25.160
My project with Streamlit, I mean,

63
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.499
even Streamlit has some of
that problem sometimes.

64
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.609
We have developers and
data scientists, and

65
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.173
those are two very different
demographics of people.

66
00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:39.524
They share some,
both of them probably write Python?

67
00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:43.521
So one of them was like one's use Git and
pylints, and Flake8, and Black, and

68
00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:46.384
one of them's like,
I don't know what any of those are,

69
00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:48.370
please just let me write code, right?

70
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.305
Or please just give me the data.

71
00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:53.721
So I do struggle with
this somewhat as well.

72
00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:56.636
You kind of have to account for
all these different personas and

73
00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:59.113
these different stakeholders
in your application.

74
00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:02.444
So any questions about that?

75
00:04:02.444 --> 00:04:06.025
Any interesting insights anyone had
when doing this exercise for themselves?

76
00:04:09.953 --> 00:04:13.265
&gt;&gt; I think the issue that I ran into,
sorry, was you order something and

77
00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:17.623
it's not available, and you don't find out
until later, and that's really annoying.

78
00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:19.250
Cuz I'm like, well,
this is what I wanted, and

79
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.298
you're now calling me telling
me that it's not available.

80
00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:22.248
&gt;&gt; After 20 minutes, right?

81
00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:23.357
&gt;&gt; After 20 minutes-
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I'm

82
00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:23.939
here, about ready to punch someone.

83
00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:27.920
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] 20 minutes ago, and I'm
still hungry now, and what do I do then?

84
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.717
&gt;&gt; Well, and so here's a problem that
like, who is that customer going to blame?

85
00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:38.290
&gt;&gt; I'll probably blame the restaurant
cuz it's the most convenient option.

86
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.606
&gt;&gt; But is that the right person to blame?

87
00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:44.381
Or is it Google for not making that
more obvious to them immediately so

88
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:47.516
that they could say,
we actually don't have that.

89
00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:49.885
And is there one right
answer to that question?

90
00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:52.463
&gt;&gt; I don't think the right average
consumer is gonna think about that.

91
00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:56.912
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're gonna blame
probably all of you, right?

92
00:04:56.912 --> 00:05:00.179
And likely probably Google cuz that's the
interface that they have is like, well,

93
00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.354
I did this with Google and
Google didn't make it right.

94
00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:04.227
F you, Google, right?

95
00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:09.551
&gt;&gt; I took a similar note regarding
menu option availability.

96
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.771
Like if you have daily specials,

97
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:17.339
are you manually entering that through
some management interface on Google Maps.

98
00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.956
Or is there some automation
tooling built into Google Maps for

99
00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:25.876
restaurant owners to manage
those sorts of things?

100
00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:31.218
And if you ran out of the soup of the day,
how do you notify

101
00:05:31.218 --> 00:05:37.953
Google to update that menu item's
availability for users of Google?

102
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:42.919
There's a lot of COGS that need to
stay linked and turning together for

103
00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.536
that pull operation to be a success.

104
00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:47.631
&gt;&gt; That's where my brain went on this,
right?

105
00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:50.967
What is the operational
procedure in place for

106
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:54.998
this from the business and
then also from the consumer?

107
00:05:54.998 --> 00:05:57.726
If I tip, where is the tip going?

108
00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:00.072
To who, and how is it getting there, etc?

109
00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:02.724
But then to your point with 86,
the cheesecake,

110
00:06:02.724 --> 00:06:04.892
how do I know that the cheesecake is 86?

111
00:06:04.892 --> 00:06:06.077
&gt;&gt; Right.

112
00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:09.967
&gt;&gt; Yep, this is exactly what I
want you to get out of this,

113
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:14.379
is like, okay, I need to think
about everyone this affects.

114
00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.657
And I need to figure out who's
getting something good and

115
00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:21.693
who's getting something bad, and
then weigh those kind of impacts.

116
00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:26.589
Cuz as Google, am I willing to say,
hey, restaurants,

117
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:30.569
you need to keep your listings up-to-date?

118
00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.859
That actually might be a pretty
reasonable ask of you to make of them.

119
00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:37.308
But like, hey, we're gonna send you an
order, and we're gonna send it late, and

120
00:06:37.308 --> 00:06:37.997
all of a sudden,

121
00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.172
you're gonna figure out that you
actually don't have any of these things.

122
00:06:41.172 --> 00:06:44.166
And now, by the way,
you have to call the customer, right?

123
00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:47.302
That would be a very bad stakeholder
management there because you would

124
00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:50.766
really piss off the businesses as well
as pissing off your customers, right?

125
00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.641
So it just sucks.

126
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.253
&gt;&gt; Something I found interesting,
it's related,

127
00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:59.611
is who suffers long-term from this, right?

128
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:02.742
This great example of,
we run out of a product,

129
00:07:02.742 --> 00:07:05.807
who's likely to get
repeat business on this?

130
00:07:05.807 --> 00:07:06.942
It's Google.

131
00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:10.565
Whether or
not they didn't deliver this service,

132
00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:14.198
they have a huge footprint
of services to deliver.

133
00:07:14.198 --> 00:07:19.312
And so your consumer who Google
causes business X a problem, well,

134
00:07:19.312 --> 00:07:24.339
business X deals with the fallout
because Google can just redirect

135
00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:28.448
their user's attention somewhere else
&gt;&gt; Or more sponsored listings.

136
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.083
&gt;&gt; Yes,-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

137
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:30.044
&gt;&gt; More sponsored listings.

138
00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:34.675
And this is, I mean,
literally a privileged position

139
00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:38.309
that Google has put
itself in as a company.

140
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:42.296
And the thing that I found most
interesting was you have highly

141
00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:44.911
competitive stakeholder groups here.

142
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:49.206
Because your C-suite is not caring much
who goes out of business as long as

143
00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:52.755
there's somebody to direct
business to that they can skim.

144
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:57.486
&gt;&gt; Right, well, and that's only
scalable to such a certain point,

145
00:07:57.486 --> 00:08:02.059
because eventually,
you're gonna have open revolt, right?

146
00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:05.378
Also, the restaurants are gonna
come together and say, okay,

147
00:08:05.378 --> 00:08:09.078
you're screwing all of us, none of
us are gonna list on your platform.

148
00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:11.340
It's tons of bad press cycles.

149
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.708
You can only take so many withdrawals from
that system before the system fights back.

150
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:22.889
And I'm gonna argue,
I think it's unethical as well, right?

151
00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:26.921
And that's a lens that you should
consider in all of these things, is like,

152
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:30.266
am I acting ethically towards
all of my stakeholders, right?

153
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.767
&gt;&gt; Brian, this is related but
kinda tangent.

154
00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:38.253
In this situation,
if you were working on this,

155
00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:42.938
when are you bringing in empathy and
thought for accessibility?

156
00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:47.892
&gt;&gt; That's a good question,
it's certainly a stakeholder, right?

157
00:08:47.892 --> 00:08:52.809
Someone's gonna be accessing
your site that has either

158
00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:57.109
a temporary or
permanent kind of capabilities.

159
00:08:57.109 --> 00:09:01.647
So a good example of that is when I'm
holding my son, right, I only have,

160
00:09:01.647 --> 00:09:04.812
at best,
one hand to work with something, right?

161
00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:07.893
Or someone that just doesn't have
a right arm altogether would have

162
00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:09.254
the same sort of capability.

163
00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:12.504
How are we providing for all of them?

164
00:09:12.504 --> 00:09:16.872
Ideally, Microsoft is awesome about this,
is they have an accessibility team that

165
00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:21.250
you just bring in and say, hey, what kind
of special considerations do I have here?

166
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.219
Another example of this is I've worked
on a product called the Stripe Shell,

167
00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:28.520
which I can show you, stripe.sh.

168
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.040
If you go to stripe.sh, it actually opens
a little console directly in your browser,

169
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.276
where you can do CLI commands
directly against the Stripe CLI, but

170
00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:39.423
in your browser.

171
00:09:39.423 --> 00:09:41.024
How do you make that accessible?

172
00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:46.719
I don't know the ins and
outs of accessibility of terminals, right?

173
00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:49.660
So we just hired a consultant, right?

174
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.190
Really early on, I was like, this is
gonna be a really sticky problem, and so

175
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.947
we didn't have it by launch.

176
00:09:55.947 --> 00:09:59.731
I don't even know if actually still
has it, to be honest with you.

177
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.647
It's something I pushed for quite a bit.

178
00:10:01.647 --> 00:10:05.464
But at least us having a plan, so when we
launched, there was a bunch of people who

179
00:10:05.464 --> 00:10:09.693
said like, this is zero accessible, and I
was like, we know, and we're really sorry.

180
00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:13.972
We wanted to make sure it worked
before we invested a lot into this

181
00:10:13.972 --> 00:10:15.723
accessibility project.

182
00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:18.705
We have a consultant,
she's been hired, she's ready to go,

183
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.184
we just haven't started yet.

184
00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:24.143
And that was enough to
avoid the bad press cycle.

185
00:10:24.143 --> 00:10:28.403
So early when possible, and
especially if you have resources at hand,

186
00:10:28.403 --> 00:10:31.395
make sure you're really
good friends with them.

187
00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:35.573
Otherwise, sometimes it's
just got to be do your best.

188
00:10:35.573 --> 00:10:40.234
Some companies just don't
emphasize it enough, I don't know,

189
00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:44.315
that's probably my realistic
answer to that question.
