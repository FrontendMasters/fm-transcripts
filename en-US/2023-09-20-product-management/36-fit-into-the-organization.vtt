00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.002
It wouldn't be a Brain Holt course I
didn't put XKCD somewhere in this,

2
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:07.650
my favorite comic.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.014
Estimating timings,
estimating when stuff is gonna get done,

4
00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:16.204
it's all hard, we're all bad at it.

5
00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:21.182
And like this cartoon really resonates
with me it was basically like, okay,

6
00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:23.719
I am trying to do some estimation here.

7
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:25.153
Here's the special, everyone says, like,

8
00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:27.335
think about how much time it's gonna
take and then double it, right?

9
00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:28.560
And this is just making fun of that.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.046
I was like, yeah, and

11
00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.594
then you end up wasting a ton of time
trying to think about it, right?

12
00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:35.985
Anyway, I thought it was pretty funny.

13
00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.433
Everyone gets it wrong.

14
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:43.509
So don't feel bad about that, rather
than try and guess the magic secret,

15
00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:47.326
because humans are really bad at
estimating time just in general, and

16
00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.935
particularly when it
comes to packets of work.

17
00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:55.538
And particularly when it comes
to multiple people doing things.

18
00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:58.765
And particularly when it comes to, you're
gonna have stuff that's gonna come up in

19
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:01.502
the middle, and new priorities, and
new fires, and stuff like that.

20
00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.770
So, you can never predict it.

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.669
So just build a certain amount
of unpredictability into it.

22
00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:13.764
Assume that all of your timelines
are always going to change.

23
00:01:13.764 --> 00:01:17.881
And then just have good process
around communicating delays.

24
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.939
There was a reason that I chose a delay
for the project that we talked about for

25
00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.215
most of these courses.

26
00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:27.366
Because a lot of times our technical
communication is around timelines, right,

27
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.690
because those are the things that
slide around the most, right.

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.816
My product specs generally do not
change like the problem statements.

29
00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:35.461
The goals and non goals do not change.

30
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.484
The metrics do not change.

31
00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:42.040
The timelines change wildly,
throughout the process of a project.

32
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.246
So, all of that said how do you plan for
something so uncertain?

33
00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:51.325
How do you make it like a not
a nonsensical event, right?

34
00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:55.707
That's what I'm gonna try and
help you come to today.

35
00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:59.695
So, I'm very biased around planning for
quarters.

36
00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:04.273
All of my jobs have been around quarters,
Netflix did it, LinkedIn,

37
00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:08.478
Microsoft, Stripe,
Snowflake basically it was just Reddit.

38
00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:13.236
Reddit didn't really care about quarters
but Reddit didn't really care about much

39
00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:16.602
of anything so
it's probably unsurprising to most of you.

40
00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.106
I'm gonna talk about things
centered around quarters.

41
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.722
You might, there are some
companies that plan in half years,

42
00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.734
there's some companies
that plan by the year,

43
00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:26.323
there's some companies that
really only go month to month.

44
00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:28.539
And there's some startups that are really
only worried about a sprint at

45
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.059
a time, right?

46
00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.609
So, I'm happy for
you to kind of adjust this.

47
00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.481
I'm just expressing to you my bias that

48
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:39.409
quarters is generally how
I think about everything.

49
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.551
So yeah, that snowflake were very based
around the fiscal quarter, which for us,

50
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.637
fiscal year starts in February, right?

51
00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:46.922
So everything's off by month.

52
00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:50.568
My brain melts around that but it's fine.

53
00:02:52.754 --> 00:02:56.345
First of all, yeah, well,
we'll talk about the spin first.

54
00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:58.989
Fit into your organization.

55
00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.854
Don't try and
reinvent the wheel every single time,

56
00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:05.492
it's better to be aligned than for
you to have the perfect process.

57
00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:09.736
So if you go into an organization and
they're planned by fiscal quarters and

58
00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:13.405
so February is a really hard month for
you then just do it, right?

59
00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:16.488
Unless you have some great
efficiency gain to do there,

60
00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.910
I'm not into idealistically
changing things for like that.

61
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.225
But that just means go around ask people,
how should we plan?

62
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.032
How should we get it done?

63
00:03:25.032 --> 00:03:31.170
Some organizations,
Google famously, when you plan for

64
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.815
a quarter you plan for
more work than you can get done.

65
00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:42.288
And I'm gonna say most organizations
work on this sort of system where,

66
00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:48.043
hey, we're gonna plan ten tasks and
we only really intend to finish eight.

67
00:03:48.043 --> 00:03:51.835
And at Google, they say if you
get all of your tasks done,

68
00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.733
you didn't plan it enough.

69
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:58.062
I like that planning because it means
that, well, if I get all eight of them

70
00:03:58.062 --> 00:04:02.006
done and I got another sprint left,
I'll do the ninth one, right?

71
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:05.111
And I already have a prioritized
list of things to get done.

72
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:10.332
There are other organizations that
like to say, if it's on your plan,

73
00:04:10.332 --> 00:04:15.031
your roadmap for that quarter,
you are guaranteed to the rest of

74
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:20.535
organization unless something changes,
I'm gonna get all of this done.

75
00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:24.755
The advantage to that is that now when
I look at everyone else's roadmap,

76
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:28.428
I can say I can pretty well guarantee,
most of this is gonna get,

77
00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:30.145
all of this is gonna get done.

78
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:34.725
It gives you some dependability when you
look around the organization that these

79
00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:39.050
people are being fairly conservative
with their planning motion, right?

80
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.331
So, I guess that's like how
conservative are you in your planning?

81
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:50.770
So, I prefer the more aggressive,
let's try and, put 70% on there or

82
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.719
100% on there and
we'll only get 70% done, or

83
00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.455
put 100% on there and aim to get
100% done, that's kind of up to you.

84
00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:03.425
When I have it the way that
it's more conservative,

85
00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:06.731
generally what I will do is I
will make like a larger plan and

86
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.789
then I will only put on my
roadmap the committed part.

87
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.456
But I still have a larger roadmap behind
it, because that's how I think, right?

88
00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.746
I think in a much more
longer term than that.

89
00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:20.557
What if your org doesn't plan?

90
00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:22.751
You should start planning.

91
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:28.028
I know a lot of start ups say, hey, we're
just super agile and we're just ready for,

92
00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:33.104
we're doing daily sprints, and things
like that, it's bull, don't do that.

93
00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:37.711
Every organization that has any sort of
alignment to drive should have some sort

94
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:38.270
of plan.

95
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.812
They should have a little bit of
a roadmap, they should have some idea and

96
00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:44.947
alignment where everyone says,
like, here's a group of tasks

97
00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:48.392
that we hope to accomplish in X amount
of time and we're gonna go at it.

98
00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:51.598
And everyone's like, yep,
we're gonna do those things.

99
00:05:51.598 --> 00:05:56.495
There's a lot of alignment and
power and a company coming together and

100
00:05:56.495 --> 00:06:00.313
saying, this is our collective
plan to get work done.

101
00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:03.866
It drives alignment from the perspective
of, if your customer service reps know

102
00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:07.574
that, then they can start telling people
it's like, hey, we know this is broken,

103
00:06:07.574 --> 00:06:09.577
it's on the roadmap and
we're gonna fix it.

104
00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.373
Your sales team knows when to
start selling something and

105
00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:14.419
when to start to deemphasize something.

106
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.617
Your marketing team can
get ahead of the curve and

107
00:06:16.617 --> 00:06:20.169
start marketing things like before your
launches and get people on your apps.

108
00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.138
And your engineering team knows that like,
hey, we got two things here that

109
00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:28.436
we have to do, this one's higher on the
roadmap, we're gonna do this one first.

110
00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:32.141
Shared prioritization of those things
is critical to drive alignment across

111
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.056
an organization.

112
00:06:33.056 --> 00:06:36.984
So, if you are a two person startup,
you should plan.

113
00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:42.891
If you're a one person startup, you should
plan, that's non negotiable in my book.

114
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.152
Like if I met a startup founder is like,
hey, we don't plan here.

115
00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:46.710
I'd be like, hey,
I don't work here, right?

116
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.872
Like I'm not gonna deal with that.

117
00:06:50.872 --> 00:06:56.262
Okay, that was another Brian Holt rant for
you.

118
00:06:56.262 --> 00:07:00.135
Yeah, and this is actually
probably a big one here is like,

119
00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:05.338
without some sort of plan, you tend to
suffer very strongly from recency bias.

120
00:07:05.338 --> 00:07:09.209
That like something that just happened to
you, tends to be the most important to you

121
00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:13.027
or something that you just learned about
tends to become really important to you,

122
00:07:13.027 --> 00:07:13.884
really quickly.

123
00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:17.817
I'm trynna think of an example of this,
like, I don't know, maybe you went into

124
00:07:17.817 --> 00:07:21.426
a customer meeting with someone that
you viewed as an important customer.

125
00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:25.251
Like, hey, we want this feature and you're
gonna come out of that meeting and for

126
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:28.910
like a week, that's gonna be really
important to you because you just heard it

127
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.082
from somebody even if it wasn't
the most important thing, right?

128
00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:36.276
So this kind of inoculates you against
that kind of recency bias as like, hey,

129
00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:39.900
about a month ago, we sat down and
we looked at all of this stuff, and

130
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.336
this range like ninth or
wasn't on our plan.

131
00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:46.598
You can adjust the plan, it might be
really important, but that requires you to

132
00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:50.177
be intentional, and being intentional
is what this is all about.

133
00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:57.786
&gt;&gt; Or in the case of a small company, CEO
driven development tends to happen a lot.

134
00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:59.647
&gt;&gt; You don't know anything about that.

135
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:04.923
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You have a great idea,

136
00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:10.225
and so now it's like,
we're at the stage we're at, it's like,

137
00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:15.259
I have to file it away as an idea and
I have a list of tons of ideas.

138
00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:20.658
So, when it's time to plan there's lots
of documentation to go off of versus

139
00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:25.889
in the early stages like, well,
I think this is the most important thing,

140
00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:29.816
but that changes frequently
versus the more long term.

141
00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:34.228
&gt;&gt; Totally, and I love that because
then it forces the CEO to go

142
00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:38.032
through the same process
as everyone else is like.

143
00:08:38.032 --> 00:08:42.004
And it could be the best idea, and like
it is the CEO's call to say like, hey,

144
00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:45.672
I actually do think this is really
important, but it forces the CEO to be

145
00:08:45.672 --> 00:08:49.651
really intentional about what bets
they're making rather than being like,

146
00:08:49.651 --> 00:08:54.038
I woke up today and I chose violence, so
I'm gonna go burn down the roadmap, right?

147
00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:54.650
So.
