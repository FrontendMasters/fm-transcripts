1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.142
Okay, so planning exercise.

2
00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:11.305
You are the product manager of
a direct consumer e-bike company,

3
00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:14.071
something like VanMoof, Cowboy or

4
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.760
Veloretti, they're fancy,
like Tesla of e-bikes.

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.382
And if you're at VanMoof,
you are lucky if you're still employed.

6
00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:24.730
They just declared bankruptcy
since I wrote this.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.920
So people use your bikes for exercising,
commuting, joy-riding, racing.

8
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.470
Some of them use it for
multiple reasons so

9
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.860
they can have different
personas on the same bike.

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.382
So you can imagine someone's like,
I like to go to the velodrome and

11
00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.740
race on the weekends, but
I also use this to commute to work.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.640
I don't know why have the velodrome
on an e-bike, a chair could do it.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.770
You don't have an exact
idea of who's doing what.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.080
So you have to use your judgment
on which one is most important.

15
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.441
You have a user base of 500,000
users who own one of your bicycles.

16
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.550
You have available to work on
your project eight, engineers.

17
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.481
And you are planning for the next quarter,
and here are the projects that you and

18
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.550
your team have come up with.

19
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.533
Right now, your company's growth is on all
up growth, and specifically the commuters

20
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.590
demographic is the one that you've
identified for most growth.

21
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.332
Here are your unprioritized tasks here.

22
00:01:18.332 --> 00:01:21.345
Make your bikes inherently
integrate with Strava,

23
00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:24.500
which we talked about as
a biking exercise kind of app.

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.871
Redesign the on-boarding flow to help
people understand their bikes better,

25
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:31.438
a common customer complaint.

26
00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:35.520
A special racing mode that tracks
laps better on circular tracks.

27
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.020
Implement dark mode for
users commuting home in the dark.

28
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.639
Add child mode that locks the screen until
a user unlocks it to prevent kids from

29
00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.630
messing with it.

30
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.835
This caused an accident last month and
it made the news, so

31
00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:49.010
it's a bad news cycle for you.

32
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.860
Implement caching for
improved website loads.

33
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.160
We are unsure of how much this will
actually affect web performance.

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.642
Open source a library on your team
wrote for making API requests and

35
00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.268
automatically caching them.

36
00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:04.277
Create an open API for

37
00:02:04.277 --> 00:02:07.599
users to be able to write their own
integrations with their e-bikes.

38
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.347
Fix a weird time zone bug that only
affects users in Arizona where it displays

39
00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:13.059
incorrect time for one day a year.

40
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.423
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; If you know anything about time zones

41
00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:18.924
in Arizona, that's a real thing.

42
00:02:18.924 --> 00:02:22.472
And using retargeting information you
get from ad vendors to show potential

43
00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:26.200
customers who land on your homepage the
exact model that they saw on Instagram.

44
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.898
So I want you to create a prioritized
roadmap for the next quarter.

45
00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:32.834
Add your cut line.

46
00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:36.338
Where the information is unclear, like how
many racers there are versus commuters,

47
00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:39.451
use a product sense to what you to intuit
what you think it actually would be in

48
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.149
the real world.

49
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.454
And do some research on general
demographics if you need to, cool.

50
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.904
So, I'm not gonna write these
down too much for you, but

51
00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.740
I'll tell you the bets I would make here.

52
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.264
So I intentionally set up
some of these problems so

53
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.950
that some of these are gonna seem
roughly of equal value to you.

54
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.103
And I wanted you to kinda
struggle a little bit with,

55
00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:12.850
what do I really think is gonna be
a more effective solution here?

56
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.980
I wanted you to make some bets
with yourself in your head.

57
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.652
So it's actually useful for you to kind of
like, okay, I have this, I have this, and

58
00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:23.310
I think they're roughly
the same prioritization.

59
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.474
Maybe you looked at the RISE method to see
if this one might be a little bit more

60
00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:28.230
impactful than that one.

61
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.624
But even then you were kind of in
your head making some bet as like,

62
00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:34.230
this is high impact and
this kind of demographic.

63
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.230
You're just assigning numbers
to what your bets are, right?

64
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.940
So let me tell you where I got with this.

65
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.531
This retargeting one down here for
people seeing the same bike,

66
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:50.138
I would say that's probably a pretty
good one for growth, right?

67
00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:52.147
So I'm gonna rank that one pretty high.

68
00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:56.847
Let's see what else here.

69
00:03:56.847 --> 00:04:00.694
Dark mode for commuters,d seems like that
would be a good one and bad news cycles,

70
00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:01.661
where's that one?

71
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.543
&gt;&gt; Right below.

72
00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that's gonna be really bad for growth.

73
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.762
Because if people are saying, like, hey,
this kills kids or something like that,

74
00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:10.467
right, you really don't
wanna be in those ones.

75
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:15.693
So that was gonna be probably number one,
number two, or something like that,

76
00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:22.296
and, Yeah, redesign the onboarding
flow if that's a customer complaint,

77
00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:25.430
right, cuz you want to have some
stickiness to your platform menu.

78
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.546
The more they can engage
with the bike properly,

79
00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:32.200
the more likely they
are gonna stick to it.

80
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.006
Onboarding ends up being way more
important than people ever think it's

81
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:35.514
going to be.

82
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.718
So those ones that kind of identified
that were all up growth and

83
00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:46.735
the commuters, and then yeah,
just mostly growth to be honest with you.

84
00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.945
We were timezone bug in Arizona.

85
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:49.855
Sorry, Arizona.

86
00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:50.675
I don't care.

87
00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:51.575
I don't care about you.

88
00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:53.295
I don't care about Phoenix.

89
00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.195
I don't care.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

90
00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.157
&gt;&gt; So, deal with your time bug,

91
00:04:57.157 --> 00:04:59.363
wear a watch, I don't care you.

92
00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:04.450
Open API, I mean, this would probably be
something that I put on my backlog and

93
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.250
leave it there forever, LAUGH] just
not the most important thing to me.

94
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.927
It is cool to create like an open
source ecosystem that can drive

95
00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:16.940
adoption down the road, but not today.

96
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.844
Open source library, unless I'm struggling
to hire developers, I'm gonna say no,

97
00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:23.376
bottom.

98
00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:27.771
Implement cash, the confidence on
this would be really low MRI score,

99
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.890
and I would say that probably
falls beneath the 50% threshold.

100
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.585
So I might just either
delete the ticket or

101
00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:39.989
ask the engineer to come back with a more
concrete proposal or with better numbers.

102
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.110
Special racing mode,
way below the cut line.

103
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.790
This one probably would be right near my
cut line, might even be my cut line thing.

104
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.640
It's gonna serve your power users.

105
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.981
But there's enough non power
users that are gonna like,

106
00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:00.248
I wanna track my statistics and share it
with my friend that there's kind of some

107
00:06:00.248 --> 00:06:03.350
growth mechanism and
social myths built into that.

108
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.281
For example,
I know Peloton supports Strava and

109
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.880
that's actually been more successful
than they expect with it.

110
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.712
So, I might lean in a little bit more into
that, but that would be a cool one to put,

111
00:06:11.712 --> 00:06:15.491
here's my cut line and someone could say,
actually Strava's a good idea,

112
00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:18.650
maybe we'll give you two more
engineers to work on that, yeah.

113
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.707
&gt;&gt; Curiosity question really, I very
much agree with your Ranking of take

114
00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:29.960
on the higher friction items that would
help general users leave the platform.

115
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.401
But say the Strava, we know that that's
maybe a really good driver of new users or

116
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:40.670
something or like we see the peloton
had a surprise success with it.

117
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.103
How would you factor in those
external data points into,

118
00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:48.392
you've discussed a little bit with
where to move it on the cut line, but

119
00:06:48.392 --> 00:06:52.690
is there something definitive that
would move that item up or down?

120
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this would be a perfect
place for customer research.

121
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.680
Go talk to a lot of your
existing customers.

122
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.263
Go talk to people that are in your target
demographic that don't own your bike and

123
00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:03.820
say, where are you with Strava?

124
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.115
And I would probably talk specifically
to some Strava usersl like, hey you're

125
00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:14.480
on Strava would this help you get onto
my bike platform if you we had this.

126
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.140
I'm gonna imagine just my intuition of
having done this stuff a bunch of time,

127
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.189
a bunch of them we're gonna say,
I track it on my phone anyway, so

128
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:23.220
I don't care, right?

129
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.654
There's gonna be some demographic
of people who's like,

130
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:29.460
if this doesn't have Strava, I'm gonna
burn your company to the ground, right?

131
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.180
And so, in the interest of human life,
you might wanna support it.

132
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.590
But, this would be one that
I would strongly follow.

133
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.280
It's probably an eventually do and
it's probably not a soon due.

134
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.355
And maybe one of your engineers
have a hack where we could do it or

135
00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:47.110
something like that.

136
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.743
But certainly,
it would be customer research,

137
00:07:49.743 --> 00:07:52.066
would be my answer to your question there.

138
00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:57.640
I mean,
it's the same thing here with special.

139
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.130
I know we said deprioritize racing here.

140
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.460
But maybe some users would
be super into racing.

141
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.809
There's a bunch of people that
buy Porsches for track mode and

142
00:08:07.809 --> 00:08:09.940
don't even know where their
closest track is, right?

143
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.040
So you might be surprised by
some of these answers, right?

144
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.003
Some of the things that drive adoption
that you wouldn't expect, right?
