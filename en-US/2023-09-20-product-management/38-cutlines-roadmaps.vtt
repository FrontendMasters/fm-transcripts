00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.180
Ooh, this is a good one.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:01.806
The cutline.

3
00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:09.960
The cutline is basically,
I have scheduled for work these things.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.390
Here is my cutline of stuff that I
would work on if I had more resourcing.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.200
So, I have projects A through F.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.048
I was like, but if you gave me more
engineers or gave me more time,

7
00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:29.562
more blah, I could accomplish this,
this, this and this.

8
00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.180
And this is where I stick my like,
I wanna work on this.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.249
I would like I would bet big on this, but

10
00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:39.888
I don't have time or
staffing to work on it at.

11
00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:42.000
Why is this useful to do?

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.875
One, it just expresses
intentions at the very least.

13
00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:48.100
It's like, I can't work on this now, but
maybe next quarter I can work on this.

14
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.930
But what's actually more powerful about
this is, I've had this happen to me,

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.244
someone will come to me and say,
I also think this is really cool, and

16
00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.031
I also think this is very important.

17
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:01.270
Here's more staff or don't work on this,
work on this, right?

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.901
And I get buy in from teams around me or,
hey,

19
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.504
the sister team is similar enough
that they can take on the work

20
00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:12.110
that you're wanting to do or they can take
work from you so you can work on this.

21
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.370
It's a powerful tool to communicate.

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.632
I wish I could be working on this,
maybe we should talk about it.

23
00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:22.893
So I use this to a lot of advantage to
get the things done that I actually wanna

24
00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:23.510
get done.

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.753
And I do that every roadmap.

26
00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.120
Here's my cut line,
here's stuff I want to work on.

27
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.290
It's very, very helpful.

28
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.247
This is a mistake that I
consistently keep doing.

29
00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:42.230
[LAUGH] By the time it makes it onto your
roadmap, it should already be researched.

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.210
To take that a step further by
the time it gets on your roadmap,

31
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.758
you probably should have a product spec.

32
00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:54.291
Ideally, most of the time, you should
have a product spec before it's on your

33
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.893
roadmap, which is to say, you should be
thinking about what's going on to your

34
00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:02.900
next roadmap pretty much as soon as
you finish the previous roadmap.

35
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.508
Why?

36
00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:09.244
One, if you plan for work,
this is basically the thing that

37
00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:12.860
is the artifact that you're gonna hand
to your engineering partner and said,

38
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.090
here's what we're gonna work on for
the next three months.

39
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.461
And if you have large open questions
on that, you can end up with idle

40
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:22.610
engineers which is the cardinal
sin here of planning, right?

41
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.118
If you end up with an engineer, is like
I am done with my previous task and

42
00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:29.820
I have nothing to do, you as the product
manager have failed them, right?

43
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.250
Now generally I have a couple
of things and the wings always.

44
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.704
So that if an engineering is sitting idle,
it's like, you're idle, here's a bunch of

45
00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:42.230
cool stuff I'm excited about, right,
and I have it ready for them.

46
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.075
But that almost never happens to me cuz
I'm usually pretty good about making

47
00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.754
sure that everything that's on my
roadmap is actionable and workable.

48
00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:53.650
Very rarely do I run out of time for,
or run out of stuff for engineers to do.

49
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.889
But that's because
frequently I follow this.

50
00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.114
And the times that I don't follow this,

51
00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.000
I'm pretty sure that I
don't have blockers there.

52
00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:11.040
Yeah, please research things.

53
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.478
Please have them almost ready for

54
00:03:14.478 --> 00:03:19.032
work by the time it makes
it on your roadmap.

55
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.148
Yeah, because what has happened where
this can bite you in the butt is like,

56
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:25.960
you'll put something on your roadmap and
you'll find out it's actually impossible.

57
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.697
We wanna do this thing and
then we realize, no,

58
00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:33.153
we have this hard dependency on this thing
and we simply cannot accomplish that.

59
00:03:33.153 --> 00:03:35.250
That has happened to me before.

60
00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:41.955
Cool, questions here?

61
00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:48.719
&gt;&gt; You could change depending
on organizational needs or

62
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.398
regulatory needs or something to,
&gt;&gt; Your road map?

63
00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.140
&gt;&gt; What's that?

64
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.650
&gt;&gt; Your road map?

65
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think.

66
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.593
&gt;&gt; I did say roadmaps should never change,

67
00:03:57.593 --> 00:03:59.754
in fact they absolutely should change,
right?

68
00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:05.346
So absolutely if a seismic event in your
industry happens then it causes a shift,

69
00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:08.637
that'll happen,
your company will get sold,

70
00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:12.111
that's gonna change it or
you'll have layoffs.

71
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:17.273
That was my big challenge at stripe is
we had layoffs in the middle of when

72
00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:22.104
I was working there and
I had to literally half my roadmap, right?

73
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:26.784
I couldn't just leave it
unchanged It's a living document,

74
00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:30.489
you should definitely modify it as you
need to and communicate as like, hey,

75
00:04:30.489 --> 00:04:34.091
we were planning on doing this,
X changed, we're gonna do this instead.

76
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:37.129
We have delays here, we're not gonna
be able to accomplish this in time or

77
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.660
we're ahead of schedule here, we can work
on this sooner, all those kind of things.

78
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.233
But having big blocks of work
suddenly get removed from it,

79
00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:50.025
that's unnecessary change, right?

80
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:53.220
What we're describing right now,
like regulation, necessary change.

81
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.126
We have no control over that, right?

82
00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:58.836
But you didn't research this enough and
it's on your roadmap,

83
00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:00.494
that one's on you, right?

84
00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:03.990
Unnecessary trash.
