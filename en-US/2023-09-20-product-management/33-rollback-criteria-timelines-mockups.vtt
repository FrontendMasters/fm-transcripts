1
00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.353
So rollback criteria.

2
00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:04.568
This is strongly tied into metrics.

3
00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:07.434
I'll typically identify this is
the core metric of the project.

4
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:13.698
If we don't affect it in these ways,
in this time frame, then we will rollback.

5
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:19.773
In other words this is,
when do we stop trying?

6
00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:25.153
Now usually what I have is,
we expect to affect these

7
00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:30.535
metrics if we see low utilization,
low uptake, and

8
00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:36.675
we see our metrics not moving
in the way that we want them to.

9
00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:41.263
Then in three months on this stage,
we'll get together we'll have a chat,

10
00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:45.724
see if we can pivot some way and
improve or change the experiment some way.

11
00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.163
And then after six months, if we haven't
affected it in the way that we want to,

12
00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.229
we'll cancel the project and
we'll rip out the code.

13
00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.638
That's generally my process.

14
00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.856
I try and
give us a checkpoint to try and fix it.

15
00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:04.083
Now, if you say that I'm going to
rollback, one, have a time-frame,

16
00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:07.796
and two,
schedule the meeting right away, right?

17
00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:11.068
So if you launch a project and you say,
if this isn't working in six months,

18
00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:12.107
we're not gonna do it.

19
00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:14.393
If you do not put that
on everyone's calendar,

20
00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:17.091
you're all gonna forget about it,
I promise, right?

21
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.081
No one's thinking that far in advance.

22
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.276
I am literally just thinking
about my next meeting and

23
00:01:22.276 --> 00:01:24.697
I have nothing else in my brain, right?

24
00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:27.023
Everyone's the same way.

25
00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:30.856
So use your calendar
there to keep you honest.

26
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:35.372
It also helps you identify how
to unravel a project, right?

27
00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:39.591
What do I have to do to move this out?

28
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:44.426
Some of these are gonna be called trap
door decisions, not a term I came up with,

29
00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:47.326
but it's basically a one-ways door, right?

30
00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:50.348
If we do this project we're going
through a door and we cannot go back.

31
00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.208
And it's good to just talk
about that there, right?

32
00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.719
We're gonna sign a ten-year contract
if we go through this door.

33
00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.224
But we can't under sign the contract,
right?

34
00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:00.559
We're kinda stuck in
this world after this.

35
00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:03.217
That would be a trap door decision, right?

36
00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:06.817
Or we're gonna build a new thing
totally on top of ChatGPT and

37
00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:09.015
we're signing a contract for that.

38
00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:13.124
And if we get a year down the line,
while everything we've built is on top of

39
00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:17.120
ChatGPT, it's really hard for us,
or very expensive for us to switch.

40
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.628
Those are kind of things that we have
to say, we can't really rollback here,

41
00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:25.948
this is a bit of a trap door,
things like that.

42
00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:32.457
So, And
sometimes it's good to just acknowledge

43
00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:36.905
that even if we don't see uptake on
this feature or uptake on our metrics,

44
00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:41.306
we still think this is a good idea,
we're gonna keep it around, right?

45
00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:45.075
I'm trying to think of what
would be a good example of that.

46
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.463
Let's say you have a project to move from

47
00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:58.592
Heroku onto Google Kubernetes Engine.

48
00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:04.320
You could say in here, our goal is
to lower our time to first paint and

49
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.053
time to first interactive for our website.

50
00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:11.992
And even if we don't necessarily meet
that metric with our first migration,

51
00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:13.699
we still think we wanna be on GKE.

52
00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.930
So we're not gonna rollback even if
we don't meet these metrics at first.

53
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.548
We're still gonna keep moving forward
because we think this is a future bet that

54
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:22.114
we wanna keep going with, right?

55
00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.617
Another good place to identify
those kind of decisions.

56
00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:31.295
Okay, this one's for
all the executives out there, when?

57
00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:32.093
When am I gonna see it?

58
00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:33.545
When is it gonna get done?

59
00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.248
If you don't know, guess, right?

60
00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:40.042
And just say, hopefully you have a good
product process in place that says, hey,

61
00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.276
we're two months into this project.

62
00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:45.540
We had a four-month goal,
we're gonna slow down.

63
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.302
And a way to communicate that, but

64
00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:53.548
here you should just guess where
you think things are gonna land.

65
00:03:53.548 --> 00:03:55.880
And obviously you should work with your
engineering partners to figure out what

66
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.172
that is, Okay?

67
00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:03.592
Designs and mocks, and
we'll go over this a little bit,

68
00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.954
actually kind of here in just a second.

69
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.741
So let's say you're designing
a new sign-up process for

70
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:13.590
your particular project.

71
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.465
You should just go try it.

72
00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:18.531
Go try and
design what you're proposing here.

73
00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:22.082
Anything that you can go to
visually represent to people,

74
00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:24.841
this is what I'm trying to tell you,
right?

75
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:28.457
I do this all the time, and
they're terrible, right?

76
00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:30.870
All I do is I go and I browser hack.

77
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.818
Buttons in, and I change button colors
here, and I Photoshop things in, and

78
00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:36.970
I'll draw on it.

79
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.958
But anything I can to do to represent,
this is the anticipated UX flow

80
00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:46.436
of where I wanna go,
just drives home your point so much more.

81
00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:47.253
So I'll show you on the next page.

82
00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.253
I actually did one for you.

83
00:04:50.253 --> 00:04:51.782
Don't make these perfect.

84
00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:54.440
Don't spend a lot of time on these, right?

85
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.619
What you wanna do is communicate
your point and nothing more.

86
00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.111
Things don't have to be centered.

87
00:04:58.111 --> 00:04:59.800
They don't have to be the right color.

88
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.049
They just have to communicate,

89
00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.329
these are the kind of things
that I anticipate happening.

90
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:08.171
So I use emojis, I use Photoshop,
I use macOS Preview.

91
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.293
I'm scrappy as hell with it.

92
00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:11.814
I'll literally design it
on a piece of paper and

93
00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:15.289
take a picture of that piece of paper and
put it on Google, right?

94
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.504
All those things apply here.

95
00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:22.289
I use Google Drawing all the time for
this kind of stuff.

96
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.952
If I need a little bit more fidelity,
I'll go with Balsamiq,

97
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:31.499
which is another program that
lets you wireframe things.

98
00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:34.066
But usually, that's even too much
fidelity for what I'm talking about.

99
00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:38.568
I'm talking about be real scrappy with
this and be really fast about it.

100
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.681
If I can't make my point in Google
Drawing, I will go try it in Balsamiq.

101
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:46.971
Or I'll just go to the designer and have
them help me get something done really

102
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.678
fast, cuz I'm not very fast at designing,
so.

103
00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:54.523
When do we take my crappy mocks and
turn them into high fidelity,

104
00:05:54.523 --> 00:05:58.036
or even wireframes, or
something like that?

105
00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:01.081
Let me give you a kind of
a multifaceted answer there.

106
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:07.151
One, I'm gonna say, it depends on how
important the designs are to the decision.

107
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:09.965
Cuz when I'm making these product specs,

108
00:06:09.965 --> 00:06:13.490
it's before we've approved them for
work, right?

109
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.449
So I need to make the products spec.

110
00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.568
We take that to a group.

111
00:06:16.568 --> 00:06:21.252
In my company we call that
a product review or a UI review.

112
00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:24.820
Strike call them something else,
Microsoft call them something else.

113
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.192
But some bodies like,
here is a product spec,

114
00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:31.310
everyone's read it, yea or nay, right?

115
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.583
So generally before anything
gets to that point,

116
00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:40.783
it's just the crappy specs that
I have put together myself.

117
00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:45.781
Unless those designs are critical
to me communicating the point of

118
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:47.396
what the project is.

119
00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:50.781
In which case I'll ask for wireframes, or

120
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:54.740
at the very most I'll ask for
low fidelity mocks.

121
00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.088
Which is something that a designer would
do, but a designer would do fast, right?

122
00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:03.644
I would never ask them for polished high
fidelity mocks until we're actually gonna

123
00:07:03.644 --> 00:07:06.930
go to press,
we're actually gonna build something.

124
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.534
So Figmas generally are for
low or high-fi, or

125
00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:16.379
high-fi [LAUGH],
low fidelity or high fidelity.

126
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.170
But it'll depend on the project, right?

127
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.873
Generally I wait until after
it's been approved and

128
00:07:22.873 --> 00:07:25.093
then I'll ask the designers to work on it.

129
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:30.265
But I usually have constraints in how
much design time I get from my designers.

130
00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:33.557
So I try not to bug them
until I really need them.

131
00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:36.922
If I had more design free time,
I might ask them for more things.

132
00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:40.992
Once those designs are done, I would say,
delete all of your crappy designs and

133
00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:43.747
just link to the Figma doc or
whatever that is as well.

134
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.701
Technical concerns and
outstanding questions.

135
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.198
If I have what I call big rocks,
this is what I'll put here.

136
00:07:54.198 --> 00:08:01.266
So, hey, we're proposing this project,
and I don't know if x is possible, right?

137
00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:06.368
So I'm proposing that we're gonna do
this sort of video processing for

138
00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:12.081
our app, but I don't know if Amazon Web
Services thing works for this, right?

139
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:14.794
Now typically I would say just
go find out if it works for it.

140
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.547
But maybe you have some of
those unanswered questions.

141
00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:21.352
Or I have this dependency on
a sister team and they're unable yet

142
00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:24.464
to commit to me that this
is what they can do, right?

143
00:08:24.464 --> 00:08:28.296
Here's where you list those almost
existential threats to this project.

144
00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:31.443
You describe risk here, essentially.

145
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.558
These are useful because people
can then read the doc and

146
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.758
say, I have your answer, or
I can help you find out, or

147
00:08:39.758 --> 00:08:43.159
here's additional context that
you may not have had, right?

148
00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.715
I do not go in and
solve the little rocks here, right?

149
00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:51.130
Paper cuts or things that I'm
positive I can work around or

150
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.649
things I'm sure enough I can work around.

151
00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:58.544
So don't make this a trillion lines long
of every reason that this can't work,

152
00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.309
or could possibly not work.

153
00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:04.389
Because you're gonna end up
convincing a bunch of people

154
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:09.151
that your product spec is bad,
which is not what you want, right?

155
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.875
This is another thing
where you can basically,

156
00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:15.835
people are gonna come to you and
say, hey, did you think about this?

157
00:09:15.835 --> 00:09:18.765
And you have a bit of inoculation
theory here where you can say,

158
00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:21.705
hey, check out my doc is actually
already at the bottom there.

159
00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:23.597
I already thought about that.

160
00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:30.459
Okay, Appendix, I end up just putting
a lot of other stuff in here like,

161
00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:32.856
here's graphs that justify the project.
