1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.516
Okay, metrics, let's do an exercise.

2
00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.392
So, for each of the following,

3
00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:13.686
identify what metrics you would
track as part of that project.

4
00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:15.641
So just give me a list.

5
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.714
I try and put at least one or two.

6
00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:21.421
Generally, not more than like four or
five for a project,

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:25.031
otherwise you're like kind of spidering
off into some interesting things.

8
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:26.696
But just like top level things,

9
00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:30.213
here's ways that we can measure
that this is getting engaged with,

10
00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:34.529
that this is worth supporting, that this
is something that we wanna keep doing, or

11
00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:38.122
is this something that we wanna roll
back and not do anymore, right?

12
00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:40.110
Those are the metrics that
I generally try and seek.

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.659
So as part of those checked metrics,
what company wide or

14
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:52.955
organizational wide metrics would you
affect for those all up companies?

15
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:57.491
Okay, so building a better
designed Add to Cart process for

16
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.770
Nike where recommends related products.

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.413
So I'm sure many of you've seen,
you add this thing to your cart and

18
00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:08.596
then it recommends this other thing,
right?

19
00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:12.200
That's kinda the thing
I'm getting at there.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.626
A product to improve music
recommendations by Spotify.

21
00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:20.391
When I say improve, I mostly mean
that I listen to this one song,

22
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:25.245
the song ends, and then you know
how it keeps playing another song

23
00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:28.001
if you run out of things to listen to.

24
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:32.010
Making that recommendation more closely
match what we think the user actually

25
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.050
wants to listen to.

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.358
That's what I mean by that.

27
00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:40.016
Okay, detecting stored credit cards
expiring and preemptively asking users for

28
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:41.348
a new one for Delta Airlines.

29
00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:48.033
This is definitely not something
that just happened to me [LAUGH].

30
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.749
Adding a share to Facebook button for
completing a bike ride on Strava if you're

31
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.974
not familiar with Strava,
it's like an exercise tracker, right?

32
00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:58.550
So you can track your run or track
your bike ride or something like that.

33
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.838
They used to be our neighbors when
I worked at Reddit, fun fact.

34
00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:07.221
And adding the ability to
sign into a PlayStation,

35
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.849
any PlayStation,
by with just a QR code on your phone.

36
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:20.596
So, let's go through these one by one and
see what you all thought about this.

37
00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:24.165
Certainly, one of the things that I
would track as an e-commerce website,

38
00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:27.141
having worked on e-commerce
websites is average order size.

39
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.222
Generally you wanna sell more items,
right?

40
00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:34.750
And so that would be one that I
would expect this a ladder up to and

41
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.579
then just revenue in general, right?

42
00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.091
As part of it,
you would track how successful this was,

43
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:45.220
are people adding it and
I would also check abandon rate, right?

44
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.243
Because whenever you add extra steps
to a checkout process people abandon,

45
00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.922
it's just always how it works, right?

46
00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.832
And so
if you're having more cart abandonment and

47
00:02:55.832 --> 00:03:00.142
too much cart abandonment, then you
would want to abandon this project.

48
00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:04.653
But if you're raising your average order
size or average amount of items and just

49
00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:09.651
seeing successfully, we recommended this,
they added this, you might wanna keep it.

50
00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:13.783
You can certainly check the customer
satisfaction of this as well.

51
00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:18.288
How annoying am I when I asked you,
do you wanna add this also to your cart?

52
00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:20.611
I hate when Uber Eats does it, right?

53
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:23.502
It's like, please take that away from me.

54
00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.288
Let me have some sort of
thing to take that off.

55
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:30.595
The day it does definitely lower
my satisfaction with Uber Eats.

56
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:32.816
Yeah, and I said revenue.

57
00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:36.195
You might be recommending things
that are more profitable to you.

58
00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:37.844
I don't really like that.

59
00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:42.210
I think I'd rather recommend to someone
what I actually think that they want.

60
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.464
In general on the person says,
I want to match my user's intent.

61
00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:49.763
My user wants this, I want to try and
give it to them rather than trying to say,

62
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.555
hey, your intent is this,
but my intent is this.

63
00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:54.000
I try and put theirs above mine.

64
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.856
I'm sure there are people out there
that would disagree with that,

65
00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:01.590
but they can be wrong, that's fine.

66
00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:07.213
A product to improve music
recommendations by Spotify.

67
00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:11.069
I'm sure one of their top level
metrics is engagement, right?

68
00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.212
How long are people listening to music?

69
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.987
So that's what I would expect
them to be tracking with this is

70
00:04:17.987 --> 00:04:22.219
if they're listening to a song and
then it just let it keep playing.

71
00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:27.280
Are they adding more time or are they
just been listening to something else?.

72
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.566
Anyway, I'd be tracking that.

73
00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:30.867
I probably be tracking.

74
00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.769
I'm sure they have some metric around like

75
00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:37.979
A time where they suspect someone is
not actually there listening to it.

76
00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.694
If I left my car playing it for
some reason and left and

77
00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:44.734
no one's listening to it, I probably
wouldn't be trying to drive those up.

78
00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:47.549
I don't know how you would track that,
but if you were Spotify,

79
00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:49.491
you could probably try and
figure that out.

80
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:53.040
Netflix actually worked very hard
to figure out that sort of thing.

81
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.029
Because if they're
listening to those music,

82
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.875
Spotify is paying royalties on it, right?

83
00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.090
So you don't wanna drive
things up unnecessarily.

84
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.121
User retention, right?

85
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:05.322
Actually a big reason why I stick with
Spotify over Apple Music personally is

86
00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:07.623
that Spotify gives me much
better recommendations and

87
00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:10.924
I end up finding out about level a lot
of music through Spotify recommendations

88
00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:13.046
because they're just better
at it in my opinion.

89
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.568
So retention would be one
that I would look at on that.

90
00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:24.872
And I think a strong metric that you could
look at to say that we're doing betters.

91
00:05:24.872 --> 00:05:27.691
They're playing this song,
we recommend this song, and

92
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.083
then if they follow some path based
off of that song, that they went and

93
00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:34.788
listened to another artist buy it,
another song that was in a similar vein.

94
00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:38.123
Whatever way we can attribute it is,
we showed them this, and

95
00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:41.213
we got some measure from them
that they liked it, right?

96
00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:43.728
That would probably be
my project metric of,

97
00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:47.444
I'm looking to see if people like
what I'm recommending to them.

98
00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:50.037
Because that will correlate as
well to their satisfaction, right?

99
00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:53.290
Okay, detecting store credit cards.

100
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.245
I think my top level metrics I'd be
looking for here is just success,

101
00:05:58.245 --> 00:06:04.324
successful checkouts, that would be one
that Delta would track as a whole company.

102
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:09.208
And then one that I would be looking for
for the project is successfully charged

103
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:13.577
stored credit cards that came from
previously expired ones, right?

104
00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:16.907
I book so many flights, but
every time I go to Delta,

105
00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:21.929
I just expect them to have the right
credit card and it's gonna work that time.

106
00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:23.198
And so I got really frustrated.

107
00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:24.926
Why is this not working?

108
00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.869
He's it has an old credit card.

109
00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.384
So that was my rant on that.

110
00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:33.124
But yeah, revenue lifetime value
of a customer that's another one

111
00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:35.794
that you'd probably look at as well.

112
00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:40.708
And then maybe some sort of
abandonment around like we

113
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:45.838
asked you to open the email and
then do nothing about it,

114
00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:50.550
probably means we're annoying you but
who knows?

115
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.700
Share to Facebook button for
Strava, I'd be looking for

116
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.399
referrals and
specifically social referrals.

117
00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.267
So how many people are tracking
back to something like this?

118
00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:04.232
If they're a Strava user,
I'd probably be looking for high fives.

119
00:07:04.232 --> 00:07:07.860
Or you can encourage your users, or
comment or something like that to say,

120
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.684
hey, we're driving social
engagement on the platform,

121
00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:13.004
which makes the platform more sticky,
right?

122
00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:16.755
So that would be one if they're
signed in and if they're signed out,

123
00:07:16.755 --> 00:07:21.352
how many sign-ups are we getting
from these referrals to Facebook?

124
00:07:21.352 --> 00:07:22.719
Maybe some impressions.

125
00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.478
I mean,
I guess impressions are useful as well, so

126
00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:29.715
I'd probably be really interested in
those because I imagine I've told you,

127
00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:33.906
some of you today probably found out
about Strava for the first time, right?

128
00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:36.828
So they're not a totally ubiquitous brand.

129
00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:42.441
So adding a share button to Facebook from
Strava, the things that I'd probably

130
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:47.409
be most interested in this would
be social referral traffic, right?

131
00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.283
People that are actually clicking on it,

132
00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:52.131
just to prove that we're not
just spamming Facebook, right?

133
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:56.202
I'd also be looking at how many people are
actually clicking the share to Facebook

134
00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:57.092
button, right?

135
00:07:57.092 --> 00:08:00.468
Cuz if no one's clicking it,
then what's the point of that feature?

136
00:08:00.468 --> 00:08:03.711
Maintaining social integrations is
a pain in the butt as someone that's

137
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:04.303
had to do it.

138
00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:07.077
If you don't have to, you don't want to.

139
00:08:07.077 --> 00:08:08.122
So that would be one.

140
00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:10.288
I would be looking for
people that are referred back to,

141
00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:12.003
are they signing up if they're logged out?

142
00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:15.799
Are they interacting in some other
way if they've signed in, so

143
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:18.417
some sort of like high fives or
commenting.

144
00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:19.907
That would be good just for

145
00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:23.242
social engagement which makes
our platform more sticky.

146
00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:27.715
And then impressions are also very
interesting as well because that drives

147
00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:28.856
brand awareness.

148
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:33.733
Not everyone is aware of what Strava is as
a brand, so driving people to the site is

149
00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:38.213
gonna drive awareness and eventually
that might lead to them signing up.

150
00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:43.971
Okay, and last one,
ability to sign into a PlayStation.

151
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:48.422
I would just be looking for
time to sign in, right?

152
00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:51.836
Cuz I imagine a lot of people
don't wanna put their username and

153
00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:53.843
password in with their controller.

154
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:58.899
So successful signings would be good and
then time to sign in so you can correlate,

155
00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.858
we have more signings, and
people are successfully doing it and

156
00:09:02.858 --> 00:09:07.796
spending less time doing it because it's
not one of the more fun parts about it.

157
00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:12.553
If I was the PM of that, the other thing I
might be more interested in is driving as

158
00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:16.316
like a bet that I go to my friend's house,
my friend has FIFA and

159
00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:18.383
we're gonna play FIFA together.

160
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:21.297
Typically I would just
pick up a controller and

161
00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:26.392
not sign in because I don't wanna be
bothered with that whole sign-in process.

162
00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:29.966
But if you made it really easy for
me to just scan a QR code,

163
00:09:29.966 --> 00:09:35.110
I'd be much more apt as like, all right,
let me bring all of my stats over with me.

164
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:40.570
And then let's make this personal that we
can track our record against each other,

165
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.119
right?

166
00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:44.720
And so I would scan that with
the hypothesis as the product managers,

167
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.075
having data on where people
are traveling is probably useful and

168
00:09:48.075 --> 00:09:51.949
knowing who's playing couch co-op
against each other would be useful.

169
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:55.738
And you can end up with some really
interesting recommendations like, hey,

170
00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:58.021
we saw you play PlayStation
with this friend.

171
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.150
Do you know that you
two might like playing?

172
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.767
I don't know FIFA street together or
something like that.

173
00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:08.095
And so you get this new vector of useful
data to talk to your customers about where

174
00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:10.563
you can offer them useful recommendations.

175
00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:15.257
I'm always looking for those kind of
synergistic overlaps between me and

176
00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:16.248
my customers.

177
00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.302
I want you to do this.

178
00:10:17.302 --> 00:10:19.838
You also wanna do
something that's similar.

179
00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:23.824
Let's find the Venn diagram of what's
good for you and what's good for

180
00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.029
my company, right?

181
00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:28.383
Those are the things I get to feel really
awesome about the job I'm doing as

182
00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:31.357
opposed to, how can I trick you
into doing things that are good for

183
00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:33.705
the company that's not
super detrimental to you.

184
00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:36.581
I don't like those kinds of overlaps.

185
00:10:36.581 --> 00:10:41.173
&gt;&gt; What we've discussed here is
essentially a blend of data that I can

186
00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:45.929
collect on people who are using my
platform or service that they may or

187
00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:50.448
may not be aware of and
then information that they can provide me.

188
00:10:50.448 --> 00:10:53.674
Is there a way you think
about the balance or

189
00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:57.002
which type of information should go after?

190
00:10:57.002 --> 00:11:02.764
And there's plenty of these ethically
dubious circumstances where a little

191
00:11:02.764 --> 00:11:08.347
bit of privacy invasion which would
probably be a great benefit to users but

192
00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:12.798
there's other concerns over
those data being collected.

193
00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:15.789
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,
it's something I think a lot about.

194
00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:19.274
Let's start with just
the absolute base level,

195
00:11:19.274 --> 00:11:22.936
you got to comply with probably with GDPR,
right?

196
00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:27.228
Your users have to be able to know
what's being collected on them, and

197
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.011
they need to be able to be forgotten,
right?

198
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:34.274
That's just like the baseline
legal aspect of it.

199
00:11:34.274 --> 00:11:38.719
My personal philosophy on this is, one,
data is a liability a lot of the time.

200
00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:43.308
So what you know about a data can also
be exfiltrated about that data, and

201
00:11:43.308 --> 00:11:48.124
so you wanna be cautious to keep things
that are directly pertinent to things

202
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.171
that you intend to use, right?

203
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:52.960
So don't collect.

204
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.386
Nike doesn't need to know my age,
for example, when I'm buying shoes.

205
00:11:56.386 --> 00:11:58.571
So they should not collect my age, right?

206
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.128
Things of that nature where don't
collect data that you don't need for

207
00:12:02.128 --> 00:12:03.440
some particular reason.

208
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.040
I don't know,
maybe Nike does need my age, but

209
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.225
hopefully you're drawing
the conclusion there of like,

210
00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:13.385
maybe McDonald's doesn't need to know
my age when I order a cheeseburger.

211
00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:15.272
So that's number one.

212
00:12:15.272 --> 00:12:19.582
Number two,
I generally try to keep to informed

213
00:12:19.582 --> 00:12:24.646
consent that you know that you
are giving me this data and

214
00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:30.280
at the very least of like
strongly implicit consent, right?

215
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.754
So if I told you it's like, hey,

216
00:12:31.754 --> 00:12:34.930
I took this data that you wouldn't
be particularly surprised by that.

217
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.911
Let me try to give you
two examples of this.

218
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:41.397
So using that PlayStation 1, where you
log in with a QR code on your friend's

219
00:12:41.397 --> 00:12:46.299
PlayStation, you are probably unsurprised
that PlayStation correlate is like two

220
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:49.210
PlayStation accounts played together,
right?

221
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.811
That is not gonna be super surprising and
I was like, hey, we think that you two

222
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:58.518
might know each other if you are on the
same couch playing the same PlayStation.

223
00:12:58.518 --> 00:13:02.658
Now you might not have said, I'm okay with
you gathering that data, but you're not

224
00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:06.644
particularly surprised, it's data you
actively gave by scanning the QR code.

225
00:13:06.644 --> 00:13:07.640
I feel okay about that.

226
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.274
I think it's okay to
gather that sort of data.

227
00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:14.101
Now how would you feel about, you went and
played on that PlayStation and

228
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:18.495
then later a different friend when played
on the same PlayStation without you there

229
00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:19.389
and all sudden.

230
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:21.525
I can still correlate, you were there and

231
00:13:21.525 --> 00:13:24.280
this different person was
there at a different time.

232
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.237
That feels a little ethically dubious to
me to say, we're gonna correlate that.

233
00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:31.974
We think that you also probably
know each other just based on that

234
00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:33.228
fact alone, right?

235
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:34.079
Maybe it's a bit less so

236
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.516
of like, you played with this person and
I played with that person.

237
00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:40.727
We can probably correlate that there
might be some sorta social graph there.

238
00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:43.909
Just like LinkedIn recommends to use, hey,
you probably know these people because you

239
00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:46.282
were there at the same time and
you have all the same connections.

240
00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:49.266
That feels okay to me as well.

241
00:13:49.266 --> 00:13:53.134
Let me draw one too that I
found particularly disturbing.

242
00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:57.891
I'm a Gmail user,
like probably most of you.

243
00:13:57.891 --> 00:14:04.995
And I found a screen within Gmail, is like
here's everything you've ever bought.

244
00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:09.399
And I was like whoa, I did not feel okay
with you reading all of my emails and

245
00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:12.328
pulling out all of
the things that I've bought.

246
00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:14.912
And then I found out they'll show you,

247
00:14:14.912 --> 00:14:20.175
here's all the ads we recommended to based
on the things that are in your inbox.

248
00:14:20.175 --> 00:14:22.526
And I was like,
I'm very okay with you not or

249
00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:25.973
not okay with you providing that
email to a third party, right?

250
00:14:25.973 --> 00:14:29.102
Or even to your ad server, right?

251
00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:34.483
Now, I posted it on Twitter and obviously
got very much both sides of why you're

252
00:14:34.483 --> 00:14:39.482
using a free product, you are the product
haha, I hate that, by the way.

253
00:14:39.482 --> 00:14:42.753
Never told me that because
then I won't be your friend.

254
00:14:42.753 --> 00:14:46.493
Yes, I know that free products or
whatever.

255
00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:50.626
But I still think it's on the provider
of the service to have informed consent

256
00:14:50.626 --> 00:14:51.207
tonight.

257
00:14:51.207 --> 00:14:54.354
That was a thing that when
I found out about it,

258
00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:59.301
I was very surprised by it and
I would not have consented to that, right?

259
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:03.763
So that's where I draw that line of, don't
gather that data if that user would have

260
00:15:03.763 --> 00:15:06.458
been surprised that you
have gathered that data.

261
00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:11.525
Another example is, if you go to Nike and
you buy shin guards for soccer,

262
00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:16.344
It's probably okay that Nike buckets
me into a soccer mailing list,

263
00:15:16.344 --> 00:15:20.270
assuming that I gave permission
to be on a mailing list.

264
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.883
It makes sense that you buy soccer gear,

265
00:15:21.883 --> 00:15:23.741
you probably wanna know
about soccer things.

266
00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:28.108
That kind of derivative based on
information, or actually, sorry,

267
00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:31.966
I'm probably going too long on this,
but last example here.

268
00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:35.137
When I was at Reddit, the way that
we advertised to you on Reddit is,

269
00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:37.487
what subreddits you have subscribed to,
right?

270
00:15:37.487 --> 00:15:42.834
So if you subscribe to the soccer
subreddit, you're gonna see soccer ads.

271
00:15:42.834 --> 00:15:47.617
That felt really okay to me because you
have given Reddit that information and

272
00:15:47.617 --> 00:15:51.750
we're not pulling that from third
parties or anything like that.

273
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:57.232
We're just using it based on what
information you have chosen to give us.

274
00:15:57.232 --> 00:15:59.222
So a lot of ethics tied up in this.

275
00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:01.320
A lot of law tied up in this.

276
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.118
I'm going to invite you to try and
act both legally and ethically.

277
00:16:07.118 --> 00:16:08.873
It's a hard problem.
