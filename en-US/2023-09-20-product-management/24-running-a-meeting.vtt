00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.534
I think I talked to quite
a little bit about this, but

2
00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:03.930
let's go ahead and do this.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.980
I talked a lot about meeting prep,
which is I'm gonna say 90% of the battle

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
because if you haven't done that first and
you get into the meeting, good luck.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.880
How are your improv skills, right?

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.490
And the more nervous you are about this,
the more prep you should do.

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.341
Because if you get in there and

8
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:31.159
you get flustered then you kind
of just like you lose the room.

9
00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.809
So on the space, and this is what I
like some of the most Meek product

10
00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.960
managers I've seen just used some basic
tactics to kind of own the space,

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.971
but make sure that you're not
just like the timekeeper.

12
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.830
The person with a stopwatch in
the corner kind of keeping things going.

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.824
You wanna make sure that everyone
acknowledges that you are the person there

14
00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:54.272
that is owning the space and
that you are running the meeting.

15
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:58.390
And that's just generally by saying like,
hey, we got this agenda today.

16
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm gonna keep us on track where possible.

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.518
And this is, now we're getting
into my personal preferences.

18
00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:05.362
Instead of passing it off to someone else,

19
00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.080
I generally like to be
the person speaking.

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.770
That lets me control the message still.

21
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.966
And I'm just trying to talk about like,
if you wanna get something done,

22
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:19.340
the more you can own that space, the more
likely you are to accomplish your goals.

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.871
Not always possible, sometimes you're if
someone's gonna show a big demo off and

24
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.350
you don't know how to do it,
obviously don't.

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.149
Do it right?

26
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.963
But yeah,

27
00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:32.583
a good rule of thumb is to not pass off
the presentation if you can avoid it.

28
00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.109
Make sure the person that
helps you prepare is credited.

29
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.657
I'm not telling you to take credit
from anybody there's none of this is

30
00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:38.339
about any of that.

31
00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:43.205
This is just if you
are owning the conversation,

32
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:47.851
you get to all the words
that are said the room.

33
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.183
So I say soft rule there.

34
00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:52.420
Well, no hard rule on the space.

35
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.880
Soft rule is don't pass it
off if you don't have to.

36
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.080
Good tangents and bad tangents.

37
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.080
Make sure if I mean meetings,
get derailed all the time.

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.240
I'm giving you all these rules of lhow
to not do it, it's still gonna happen.

39
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.510
It's still happening,
it happened to me this week, right?

40
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.582
And it's something that I'm very conscious
of, but there are good tangents,

41
00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:16.150
there are bad tangents.

42
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.960
I'm not gonna tell you how to judge that.

43
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.090
You will generally know
yourself as I wanna go here.

44
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.470
I don't wanna go here, but
when you identify it's a bad tangent.

45
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.414
Generally say that you
can say things like, hey,

46
00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:29.500
we have things left in the agenda.

47
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.140
Can we start an email about this?

48
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.188
People will respect you more if you
actually follow through on whatever

49
00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.670
you're saying.

50
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.129
If you're gonna say, let's start
an email about this, start the email.

51
00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.559
Or you can just say, hey,

52
00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.070
we don't have time in our agenda
today about to talk about this.

53
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.232
If you are interested in talking about
this, can you set up some time with me or

54
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:52.560
with a person to talk about that?

55
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.498
And then you put the ball
back in their court,

56
00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:57.516
I guarantee you they'll never do it
because no one ever does, right?

57
00:02:57.516 --> 00:03:00.020
But if you own the action item,
follow up on the action item.

58
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.640
If you don't own the action item,
then it's not your problem.

59
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.469
People will respect you more if you follow
up on what you say you're gonna do.

60
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.770
I said this before, but I'll say it again.

61
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.200
Don't be afraid to interrupt anyone.

62
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.549
I've very rarely got some pushback saying,
like, hey,

63
00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.421
I actually do wanna talk about this,
in which case,

64
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.360
if it's at this point, it becomes
basically a power dynamic, right?

65
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.390
Can they tell you to do that?

66
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.680
And can you tell them, no,
I actually wanna move on?

67
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.269
I will let you be the decision
maker about that.

68
00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.560
But I'll say it just never,
it almost never happens to me.

69
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.270
Generally, people are pretty respectful,
like, yeah, cool, we do need to move on.

70
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.635
I'm gonna throw this in here,
this came from my MBA,

71
00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:48.760
when we were talking about persuasion,
there's a thing called inoculation theory.

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.120
It looks like I messed up my link here.

73
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.778
I'll fix that by the time
this gets recorded, but

74
00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:58.080
if you click IT here,
I think this is just the Wikipedia page.

75
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.301
It's the idea that if you know
someone's going to try and

76
00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:04.831
pull your argument apart
in a particular way.

77
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:08.736
If you go through it first before
they get to bring it up first,

78
00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:13.467
just the social psychology of that means
that they tend to believe you first

79
00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:16.264
because you got to it
first before they did.

80
00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:20.699
It's a tactic that you don't really wanna
use too frequently because frequently it

81
00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.210
just never gets brought up.

82
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.920
You have a bunch of ideas of what could
happen and you're wrong about much of it.

83
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.395
But when you know what's really gonna
happen, it can be a useful tool of saying

84
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:35.060
like, hey, I know this person is gonna try
and pull me apart in this particular way.

85
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.688
Let me tell you why this is
actually an interesting what,

86
00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:40.994
here's a different way of thinking
about that when you get to it first.

87
00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:42.948
People tend to believe you over them.

88
00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:47.845
I'm careful of applying
too much psychology and

89
00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:53.030
psychological warfare in my meetings is
not generally the thing I'm trying to do.

90
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.129
I'm generally trying to get to
the correct decision, and so

91
00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.161
if someone is right, I want to let them
be right, and I want to learn from that.

92
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:03.220
But sometimes you just know,
this person is stuck on this thing, and

93
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.244
they're gonna bring it up again,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

94
00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:09.091
Let's talk about it before they get there,
it'll help.

95
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.121
One of the first things my persuasion
teacher said in our class is,

96
00:05:17.121 --> 00:05:22.600
I'm not here to get to teach you
how to tap people into bad deals.

97
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.273
I'm here to talk you into or
show you how to get good deals and

98
00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:29.623
I generally believe in that.

99
00:05:29.623 --> 00:05:32.420
I want a good deal I don't wanna be right.

100
00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:41.414
So I'll let you think more about that.

101
00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:45.986
So we didn't talk about anchoring and
a bunch of stuff like I'm not here for

102
00:05:45.986 --> 00:05:49.325
hardcore negotiations,
that's just not what I am and

103
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:51.447
not what you want to learn from me.
