1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.500
Using that same formatting exercises
memo that we have back on this page.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.350
So everything's starting down be here.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.750
I want you to go and create
an executive summary, a bluff, TLDR.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.038
Basically like a little blurb that if
someone read it and they agreed with it,

5
00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.839
they could just skip reading
the rest of this entire doc, right?

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.422
So give you a bit of time and
you can press pause on the video and

7
00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:29.358
then come back here after you're done and
we'll talk about it.

8
00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:33.976
The other thing to try is I want you to
at least try writing yourself once I find

9
00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:38.307
it's useful for people to kind of
take large amounts of information and

10
00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:40.680
crystallize it down to your point.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.930
That's what the entire
exercise of this is for.

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.819
But then try putting it into some
sort of no chat CPT or barred or

13
00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.870
something like that and
see what they give you back as well.

14
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.712
Then you can kind of compare and
contrast you can see that AI is useful but

15
00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:57.184
also it's probably not gonna
get you 100% of the way there.

16
00:00:57.184 --> 00:00:59.813
It's gonna get you like 80,
90% of that, and

17
00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:04.292
then you're gonna have to use your squishy
human meat to get it all the way to 100%.

18
00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:15.323
We are gonna take this formatting access
and we're gonna write a TLDR about it.

19
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:16.680
What is the point here?

20
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.290
So okay, before you might ask what
the point is like who's reading this?

21
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.495
Well, if you remember up here at the top,

22
00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:24.080
it says that is the lead
senior leadership team.

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.470
Let's pretend that's six people.

24
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.960
The CEO, the CPO, the CTO, VP of this,
VP of that and your mother.

25
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.869
I don't know whoever the last one is,
that's the other last person there.

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.160
Okay, and
then we're gonna write a update for them.

27
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.278
So, we set up here that our point
is the project is going well but

28
00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:49.099
it is behind schedule and you wanted
to you want to communicate the delay,

29
00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.540
but how it's not that big of a delay.

30
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.658
So that's really what we
want to call out here is,

31
00:01:55.658 --> 00:02:00.930
there is a delay in the project, it's
because we discovered new user research.

32
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.989
The project will still be delivered
two weeks behind on this date.

33
00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:09.841
That's essentially what I
would put in the bluff.

34
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.476
So that anyone reading is like it's
delayed, this is why it's delayed,

35
00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.550
this is when you can expect results.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.789
And I think most senior leaders would be,
great,

37
00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.670
that's what I wanted to hear, right?

38
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.382
And then if they want to get more context
of why, what the moving pieces are,

39
00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:28.200
who can I talk to about this,
how can I dive deeper?

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.107
The rest of the memo is there for
that, but the bluff gets mostly there.

41
00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.624
So how did this go for you?

42
00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:39.070
Is that close to what
most of you landed on?

43
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.464
Is that close to a chatGPT told you to do.

44
00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:47.801
&gt;&gt; It maybe was the user
didn't help me that way.

45
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.417
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

46
00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:54.113
You'll find like the prompt
engineering here, and

47
00:02:54.113 --> 00:02:58.233
there is [INAUDIBLE] course on
how to prompt engineer well.

48
00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:03.021
But really driving in to the point
helps chat GPT get to the point that

49
00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:04.543
you want to get it to.

50
00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:08.579
And it's almost to the point
where write the bluff yourself,

51
00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.360
to get to give you the bluff
that you want, right?

52
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.397
At which point, what are you doing?

53
00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:14.220
That I don't know?

54
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.091
It's actually kind of interesting,
I did use ChatGPT for

55
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.870
this course to write all
the SEO functionality of this.

56
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.430
So let me show you.

57
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.340
I'm quite proud of this.

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.130
So I'm going to show you anyway.

59
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.799
If you look down here in the head,
and there's this description,

60
00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.330
I'll make this bigger for you.

61
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.350
But we don't need all the rules right now,
just make that smaller.

62
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.119
So you can see here all this stuff,
I actually had chatGPT right the summaries

63
00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.708
which is the ones that have
passed us to Google, right?

64
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:48.564
These are the ones that Google
would show underneath it, and

65
00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:50.250
it's what Google uses to index it.

66
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.744
And so I actually wrote into this
project the ability to go through and

67
00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:57.380
write all of these descriptions cuz
I hate writing [LAUGH] them, right?

68
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.867
And I didn't even really
care how good they were, but

69
00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.340
these actually ended up being pretty good,
right?

70
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.569
And you can see here also these keywords.

71
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.408
These ones, which ones?

72
00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:12.460
Keywords, these ones were all
pulled out by chat GPT as well.

73
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.741
And I can show you here,

74
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:23.644
I am not that talented with

75
00:04:26.593 --> 00:04:28.811
It's not going to be in here,
it's going to be the next core starter.

76
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:31.070
I'm not that talented with AI.

77
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.250
It's not something I use
consistently every day.

78
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.690
And there's people that are much better
that are able to get much better results.

79
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.721
I think Scott Moss,
another teacher here on front of masters,

80
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.710
is leagues a bit better than me at it.

81
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.054
But I'll show you the prompt here that I
was able to get fairly useful descriptions

82
00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:51.039
out of this, It's here,

83
00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.427
this is not great to read.

84
00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.291
I do have it open.

85
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.927
So I can open get prompt,
this is what I wrote here.

86
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:12.486
So, I mean, this is obviously working for
trying to get it to rank well in Google,

87
00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:15.097
but you could easily modify
something like this and

88
00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:19.311
giving it a bit more context is like,
hey, you're writing this for executives.

89
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:21.430
They want to understand this at a glance.

90
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.360
How would you use this?

91
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.019
Using as plain language as possible so
that it's, you know, very easy to read and

92
00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:27.800
very direct to the point.

93
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.268
And any like tidbits and tips that you can
give the agent here will bode well for

94
00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:33.730
however your prompt is.

95
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.089
So you can see here, I wrote all more
English than the content that are then

96
00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:42.898
the summary actually expected was and
that's gonna be pretty typical, right?

97
00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:46.900
So yeah Justin.

98
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.797
&gt;&gt; Just a piggyback on that.

99
00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:53.397
Yeah Scott moss does have just
updated his full stack Next.js

100
00:05:53.397 --> 00:05:58.360
course that incorporates AI and
some prompt engineering into it.

101
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.478
And then also Max Firtman just has
released a course on, first Look,

102
00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:07.022
ChatGPT API for web developers that kinda
looks at using the API in general if

103
00:06:07.022 --> 00:06:10.460
people wanna see a little
bit more how to use that.

104
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.160
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Very applicable to product management it

105
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.478
is coming for our jobs.

106
00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:16.782
I'm just kidding, I mean, maybe but

107
00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:21.758
right now I think it's more help than harm
to the product management profession.
