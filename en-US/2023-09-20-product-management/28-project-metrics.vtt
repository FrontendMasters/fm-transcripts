1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.666
So we now have team metrics, which
ladder up into organizational metrics,

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:11.242
and you should have project metrics
that ladder up into your team metrics,

3
00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:15.420
that then ladder up into
your organizational metrics.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.015
Any project that you undertake
should affect your metrics, and

5
00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:23.685
I don't feel super
controversial in saying that.

6
00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:24.907
I mean, here's a good example.

7
00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:26.851
One of my projects was like,

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.555
I just have to recruit cuz I have
positions open and I gotta fill them.

9
00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:35.110
You can argue that eventually
that's gonna affect signups and

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.268
time to retention in all of these,
because if I have more people working,

11
00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:42.439
at least it means all my
projects can go faster, right?

12
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:47.757
So that would be one of them, but anything
that I work on should affect my metrics or

13
00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.858
I should change what my
metrics are measuring.

14
00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:54.192
And I don't really feel like
I need to caveat that at all,

15
00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:56.567
I think that's pretty unexceptional.

16
00:00:56.567 --> 00:01:01.256
If you're doing things at work
that don't affect your metrics,

17
00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.508
then you're not accomplishing your goals.

18
00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:08.397
So we'll get into this once we get
into writing product specs, but

19
00:01:08.397 --> 00:01:12.438
all of your projects is like,
here are my personal project metrics.

20
00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.224
So I don't know, what's a good one here?

21
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:21.738
Let's say I'm writing a quiz that asks
you, what are your favorite movies?

22
00:01:21.738 --> 00:01:26.626
And so you say, I don't know,
I like Fight Club and

23
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:33.237
I like Gladiator and I like the Matrix,
I'm a basic white guy [LAUGH].

24
00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:39.223
I like all those movies and I am a basic
white guy, so that stands to reason.

25
00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:44.207
I could make one of my metrics on there,
how many questions answered, how many

26
00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:49.206
people have signed up based on this quiz,
how many people gave me their email?

27
00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:55.411
All of those various different things
that are very specific project metrics.

28
00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.835
And that's fine,
we should track all those.

29
00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:03.975
I should have a little mini dashboard of
all these various different things that

30
00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:04.851
I'm tracking.

31
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:09.376
But keep in mind that ultimately, all
those project metrics are eventually going

32
00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:13.127
to ladder up into how many people
signed up for the process, right?

33
00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:16.607
It's also probably going to
adversely affect my bounce rate,

34
00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.692
right, which we set up here
was probably a team metric,

35
00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:23.502
because the more clicks you have
on anything, 100% of the time,

36
00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:27.134
you are going to get less people
that are gonna finish it, right?

37
00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:30.451
So it's okay to trade those off,
but be explicit like,

38
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:34.192
we expect bounce rate to go down,
we expect signups to go up, or

39
00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:37.954
we expect retention to go up,
or something like that, right?

40
00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:43.742
But the key here is, my project
metrics are designed specifically to

41
00:02:43.742 --> 00:02:47.582
measure things that then ladder
up into my team metrics,

42
00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:51.582
which then in turn ladder up
into organizational metrics.

43
00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:54.844
Does this hierarchy make sense?

44
00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:58.753
Cool, All right,

45
00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:02.787
another bone to pick, this is my favorite
part of coming on Frontend Masters.

46
00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:06.585
I just get to rant about
stuff that bothers me, and

47
00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.397
you all have to listen to me, [LAUGH].

48
00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:13.017
Let's talk about CSAT.

49
00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:16.642
It's a lazy metric sometimes.

50
00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:19.664
People will say like, notice up here,
I didn't even talk about customer

51
00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:22.017
satisfaction at all, but
that's what CSAT is, right?

52
00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:26.316
How satisfied are people on my project?

53
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.233
It is something that you should track, it
is something that you should be interested

54
00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:35.886
in, you should have surveys and
things like, hey, how was that experience?

55
00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:36.946
What do you think about it?

56
00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:39.157
Do you have feedback for us?

57
00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:43.693
But it's a relative metric,
as opposed to something signups,

58
00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:45.796
that's empirical, right?

59
00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:50.865
We know exactly how many people signed
up for our service and we know people

60
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:55.958
on iOS are more likely to sign up than
people on TVs, for example, right?

61
00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.061
Those are pretty apples to
apples kind of comparisons,

62
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:03.296
a signup is a signup is a signup, and
a dollar is a dollar is a dollar, right?

63
00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:06.418
So, it doesn't matter, it's like,
if I can push you to iOS because I know

64
00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:08.913
you're gonna sign up on that,
I'm gonna do that, right?

65
00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:13.262
CSAT, it's a relative metric in that
it's relative to itself, right?

66
00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:18.069
So I'm gonna give you some examples here,
is like,

67
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:24.540
if I asked you what was your CSAT on
the signup and the billing process?

68
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.825
People don't like giving you money, and so

69
00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:30.904
they're gonna give it a fairly relative
score because the action that you're

70
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:35.200
asking them to participate in is just
not a fun action, it's necessary, right?

71
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.926
But it's like how was your
experience in giving me money?

72
00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:42.066
They're gonna be like, two,
I don't know, it wasn't bad, but

73
00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:43.987
I didn't wanna give you money, right?

74
00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:47.560
As opposed to, what's your experience I'm
watching this brand new episode of this

75
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.375
really cool show?

76
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.564
It's like, yeah, ten out of ten,
loved it, right?

77
00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:52.348
So if you look at those metrics and

78
00:04:52.348 --> 00:04:57.132
you think that you're comparing apples to
apples like, well, watching awesome show,

79
00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:00.149
ten out of ten, billing team,
you're a 2 out of 10.

80
00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:03.068
Billing team,
you're not doing great, right?

81
00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:05.842
So filling out forms is never fun.

82
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:07.302
The best you can hope for

83
00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:11.913
is not painful when you're kind of in
these not fun sort of things, right?

84
00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:18.196
Whereas the team watching the show,
if it's not,, I love this product so

85
00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:24.800
much I just wanna explode from happiness,
that team is objectively failing.

86
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.017
To your point,
how do you evaluate what's good?

87
00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:33.874
First of all, it's just hard, that's why
I kinda rant on CSAT a little bit, right?

88
00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:39.303
But it is relative, like if you have a 2
out of a 10, and also when you get 2.1,

89
00:05:39.303 --> 00:05:44.754
it means like, okay, people were less
hateful towards this, that's positive.

90
00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:50.072
They are slightly less remised to
give me money, I like that, right?

91
00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:52.666
So, one, use it as a relative metric,

92
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:57.558
measure your baseline of where we
are today and then try not to slide back.

93
00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:01.153
That's generally the best advice
I can give you about CSAT.

94
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:05.139
The other thing that I'll tell you that
a different PM told me is pair it with

95
00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.433
another metric that's closely related.

96
00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:12.783
So in billings, it would be like
successful updating of billing

97
00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:17.947
information or
successful accrual of payment information.

98
00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:22.811
That is also really useful, it's like,
all right, we are raising how many

99
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:26.620
people are successful at this and
we are not lowering CSAT.

100
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.297
That's actually a really
useful insight of like, hey,

101
00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:31.994
we got better at this without
making people hate it more.

102
00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:35.634
Cuz if you got way better at it, but
you're also making people really upset,

103
00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:39.224
you probably actually didn't really
help your product that much, right?

104
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:41.412
So pair CSAT with something,

105
00:06:41.412 --> 00:06:45.531
that's actually a super useful
way of looking at CSAT.

106
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.475
And actually to your point
of Europe versus the US,

107
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:52.246
this is my favorite example of that,
the exact same phenomenon.

108
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:57.321
I used to manage seven SDKs across
various different languages.

109
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.802
Java developers are just salty people,
I don't know what's wrong,

110
00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:02.342
they just don't like things.

111
00:07:02.342 --> 00:07:06.247
I was like, hey, here's a really useful
way to interact with our services,

112
00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:09.429
is like, yeah, but we don't like it,
we don't like you, and

113
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.293
we don't like SDKs, and maybe we
don't like Java, I don't know, right?

114
00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:18.085
But it was always, always super low,
despite the fact that it was a really

115
00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:22.980
well crafted SDK, we spent a lot of
time getting that Java SDK really good.

116
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.222
Whereas the Node.js one,

117
00:07:24.222 --> 00:07:27.786
they were definitely the one that we
focused on the least, and they're like,

118
00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:31.296
this is awesome, we love SDKs,
ten out of ten, but it's seriously broken.

119
00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:37.285
It's like, I know, but everything else in
Node is broken too, so it's fine, right?

120
00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:40.026
So you can't even compare them
across things like that, right?

121
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:44.376
So this is why CSAT is a bit of a problem.

122
00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.476
It can be a top level metric for you,

123
00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:49.557
just make sure you're
treating it appropriately,

124
00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:54.328
pairing it with something else, and
looking at it as a relative metric, right?

125
00:07:54.328 --> 00:08:01.086
So, Yeah, track it but
like recognize the weaknesses of it.

126
00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:04.863
And I am not telling you to not track it,
you should definitely track it.

127
00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:09.834
It's useful to see particularly as in a
relative like, what is our CSAT over time?

128
00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:13.155
Usually that's how you're gonna look
at CSAT and on a graph of like,

129
00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:14.599
what has happened over time?

130
00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:17.523
Because being nine out of ten stars,

131
00:08:17.523 --> 00:08:21.495
that can either be awesome or
that could be awful.

132
00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:24.840
Actually I think a perfect
example of this is Uber and Lyft.

133
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.446
If you're not over a 4.3 on Uber and
Lyft, they kick you off the platform,

134
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:31.741
because they expect every person to
get five stars every single time.

135
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:33.751
That's why your Lyft driver asks,
please rate me,

136
00:08:33.751 --> 00:08:36.447
is because if they don't get those
five stars, they get kicked off and

137
00:08:36.447 --> 00:08:38.382
you're literally affecting
their livelihood.

138
00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:43.083
So also be very careful when you give
those people low ratings cuz it actually

139
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:47.057
can directly affect their ability
to feed themselves, right?

140
00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:50.843
So the worst I do is I generally don't
rate people as they were actually

141
00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:52.010
dangerous, right?

142
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.549
So in that case ,4.3 out of 5,
most of us would be like, yeah,

143
00:08:55.549 --> 00:08:57.592
that seems like a pretty good number.

144
00:08:57.592 --> 00:09:04.024
If you are 4.4 on Lyft,
you are in danger of being fired, right?

145
00:09:04.024 --> 00:09:06.311
&gt;&gt; I feel like there's inflation in those.

146
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:06.941
&gt;&gt; There is,

147
00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:11.362
there's an expectation that we rate
everything five out of five, right?

148
00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:12.498
Yeah.

149
00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:15.772
&gt;&gt; Well, this is kind of a follow-up
question just to formalize it.

150
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:21.351
We were talking about it's just
a built-in method to inflate a metric.

151
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:25.029
Coming from education and health care,
you see this done all the time,

152
00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:28.707
where you just pick a number, and
one year, that's the right number,

153
00:09:28.707 --> 00:09:31.981
the next year, it's too low,
the next year, it's too high.

154
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:36.311
But it's like we've just blinded
ourselves to the actual conversation.

155
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:41.264
But what it is is you're kinda seeing just
a self-adjustment to some arbitrary pin

156
00:09:41.264 --> 00:09:41.981
in the map.

157
00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:47.690
How do you approach that, because
software, you have to introduce and

158
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.985
manage the lifecycle of a lot
more of these over time?

159
00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:56.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [COUGH] it's, one,
trying not to move the goalposts or

160
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.337
be being explicit when
the goalposts have been moved, and

161
00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:04.310
then having better metrics, right?

162
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.825
A signup is a signup is a signup,

163
00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:08.355
that's why a signup is
a really good metric to track.

164
00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:13.166
That's why none of my projects
are raised CSAT, none of them, right?

165
00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:17.783
It's do this metric and
hope we don't affect CSAT in adverse ways,

166
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.489
almost always, right?

167
00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.127
Sometimes it's like, hey,
people don't like our docs,

168
00:10:22.127 --> 00:10:24.946
we probably should figure out how
to raise the CSAT on our docs.

169
00:10:24.946 --> 00:10:30.807
But even then, that's page views or time
to complete intent or something like that.

170
00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:35.722
It's usually that's the metric first,
and then we track the talent of CSAT.

171
00:10:35.722 --> 00:10:40.213
Actually, and another good point about
CSAT, it takes a really long time for

172
00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:43.266
you to do something and
then CSAT to change, right?

173
00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:46.954
That metric moves pretty slowly because,
let's say,

174
00:10:46.954 --> 00:10:49.708
we're talking about docs here, right?

175
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:54.356
So if I have bad docs, right, and
I have one out of ten on my doc score, and

176
00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:58.854
then I do something and I change it,
and all of a sudden, really good,

177
00:10:58.854 --> 00:11:03.459
all those people are gonna still be
coming back and expecting bad docs.

178
00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:07.302
And if you ask them again after
the change, they're gonna be like, well,

179
00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:10.962
it was bad before, I assume it's
still bad now, one of ten, right, or

180
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.868
two out of 10, because this one was okay,
but it used to be really bad too.

181
00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:18.970
It's gonna take some time to get a bunch
of new people in there that are not jaded

182
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.345
and to also convert some
of the jaded people.

183
00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:24.679
And there's also just still gonna be a lot
of jaded people because it used to be

184
00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:25.309
bad, right?

185
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.208
So that over time is
gonna move really slowly.

186
00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:34.127
It's a tail indicator of actually how
you're doing on those sorts of things.

187
00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:37.063
So that's why it's,
you can look at on day one,

188
00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:40.500
I did this treatment and
I got this amount of signups, and

189
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.244
then on day two, I did this treatment and
I got this amount of signups, right?

190
00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:48.823
You can point out the difference to
those two, they're different, right?

191
00:11:48.823 --> 00:11:53.549
So just be really careful CSAT, that's my

192
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:58.518
entire spiel there for you
&gt;&gt; What about NPS?

193
00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Net Promoter Scores.

194
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.795
It's kinda the same thing,
it's basically the same.

195
00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:12.050
We tracked NPS really
carefully at Microsoft,

196
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.469
it was one of the big
things they did track.

197
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:21.132
That one aims to be a bit more
apples-to-apples of like,

198
00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:25.417
hey, NPS is this, Visual Studios is this.

199
00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:29.197
But VS Codes is always higher because it's
free, and people are like, I don't wanna

200
00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:32.684
pay for Visual Studio, everything else
is free, why do I have to pay for that?

201
00:12:32.684 --> 00:12:34.335
70 out of 100, right?

202
00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:38.158
I don't remember what the numbers were.

203
00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:42.351
But I kinda had the same feeling on it,
it's relative to the product itself.

204
00:12:42.351 --> 00:12:45.960
It is slightly more useful in comparing
some things to each other, but

205
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.755
I still view it as, pair it with
something that's gonna describe what's

206
00:12:49.755 --> 00:12:51.608
actually changing in the product.

207
00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:58.197
And try less to affect the NPS directly
and try and make the product better.

208
00:12:58.197 --> 00:12:59.819
That's hard.

209
00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:04.963
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the way I used NPS in the early
days of Frontend Masters was asking

210
00:13:04.963 --> 00:13:10.618
everyone, of course, and then if they
rated us a five or a six, we'd be like,

211
00:13:10.618 --> 00:13:15.807
what could we do to get a seven or
an eight, or if they rated us whatever.

212
00:13:15.807 --> 00:13:19.064
It was just like trying
to get two points up and

213
00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:24.137
asking them that follow-up question,
they gave amazing feedback.

214
00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:29.450
I had probably 5 or 700 conversations-
&gt;&gt; About that.

215
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.889
&gt;&gt; Just by asking them
one simple follow up,

216
00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:37.713
what can we do to get a nine or
a ten if they rated us eight?.

217
00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:41.264
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean your point there,
when gathering CSAT scores,

218
00:13:41.264 --> 00:13:45.654
it's usually good to give them freeform
feedback or some sort of feedback.

219
00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:50.532
Like you gave us a six out of seven or
whatever, and here's like,

220
00:13:50.532 --> 00:13:52.763
why did you give us the score?

221
00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:55.511
You will get frequently a lot
of really good feedback.

222
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:58.311
You will also get a lot
of garbage feedback.

223
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:02.348
A really good example of this is the docs
on Stripe in particular is like,

224
00:14:02.348 --> 00:14:06.269
all right, here's the docs,
what did you like about this docs page?

225
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:08.390
And people will be like,
I hated this docs page.

226
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.079
And why did you hate this docs page?

227
00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:13.065
And it's like,
Stripe withheld my payments, right?

228
00:14:13.065 --> 00:14:16.257
Or I got flagged for
fraudulent payments, which is like,

229
00:14:16.257 --> 00:14:18.742
that has nothing to do with our docs,
right?

230
00:14:18.742 --> 00:14:23.344
So some of those can end up being bad,
but the freeform feedback will

231
00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:28.267
frequently end up with, hey, I got
stuck on this portion of the doc, and

232
00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:31.448
it was really hard and
I did this and it worked.

233
00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:33.966
I would have wished that you would
have just called this out really soon.

234
00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:35.732
It's like, that's golden, right?

235
00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:39.528
And you can immediately act on
some of those like that, but yeah,

236
00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:43.617
customer feedback, it's extremely
important and also difficult.
