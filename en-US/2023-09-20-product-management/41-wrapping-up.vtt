00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.690
Congrats on finishing the course of
the complete intro to product management.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.770
There's a lot of talking.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.461
This was a very interesting course for
me to teach,

4
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:12.600
because it is what I have been doing for
the past five years.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.270
I've been less involved in
the day-to-day coding aspect of my job.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.127
I still code a lot in my own time and, as
part of writing demos and stuff like that,

7
00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:25.058
but less so in terms of like
shipping code on a day--t-o-day,

8
00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.783
but this has been
an awesome course to teach.

9
00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:31.338
It went really well, I was very surprised
about like I was worried that this would

10
00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:34.805
go too fast or too slow or something like
that, but I'm pretty happy about it.

11
00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:39.241
But I wanna restate here this
is a very Brian Holt take, and

12
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:44.147
my take very much was formed at
Microsoft Stripe and Snowflake.

13
00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:46.840
Don't get me wrong,
that's actually a really wide breadth.

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.320
They all pm very differently.

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.211
Like you'll see a lot more Snowflake
Google relatedness like those kinds of

16
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.929
cultures more marry each other.

17
00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.969
Microsoft is very much its own culture,

18
00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.490
and Stripe borrowed a lot from Facebook,
right?

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.090
So, like, they're all kind of all
over the place, which I've enjoyed.

20
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.541
Like I've enjoyed all the various
different aspects about it, and

21
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.400
I can tell you the pros and
cons of every one of them.

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.181
Just so you know, I did consult
quite a few PMs on this course, so

23
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.876
it is at least been looked at by
PMs from different Stripes and

24
00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:22.875
Stripes that was not intentional, but
it actually is literally true, it has been

25
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:28.179
looked at by Stripes to make sure I wasn't
too far off base from anyone's experience.

26
00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.711
And I did incorporate a bunch
of that feedback so, yeah,

27
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.464
some of this advice is the opposite
of what you should do, and

28
00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:38.280
you'll find that out
quickly when you do it.

29
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.541
But I wanted you to be exposed and

30
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.030
it's sometimes it's just
good to hear something.

31
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.060
So, no I don't wanna do that, right?

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.540
And actually have that moment of
intention to do something different.

33
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.370
But your experience is gonna vary.

34
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.247
This is a very many ways to do
this job correctly kinda thing and

35
00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:59.670
should match sorta your expectations and
your experience to get there.

36
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.980
But I promise you, I truly did my best.

37
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.579
I worked harder on this course than I have
on a course in a long time just because it

38
00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.130
is really important to me,
and I wanted to get it right.

39
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.560
So, hopefully, you enjoyed it, hopefully,
you learned a bit about being a PM.

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.052
I, hopefully, some of you I convinced
to be a PM, and also equally,

41
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:19.340
I hope I convinced some of
you to never be a PM, right?

42
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.170
Both of those are extremely valid
outcomes from this course, and

43
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.700
I hope that exposure kind of
helped you set you on your way.

44
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.550
If I made you more confused,
I don't know what to tell you.

45
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.550
I find that confusing.

46
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.208
So in any case,
I think all of these skills will

47
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:37.410
make you better in office environments.

48
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.602
Generally tech, cuz that's my exposure,
but I think this could be useful in banks,

49
00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:45.680
health care, anywhere that you have sort
of interpersonal, relationships where

50
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520
you're trying to push projects forward
I think all this kind of applies.

51
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.348
So, hope you enjoyed the class.

52
00:02:52.348 --> 00:02:55.865
Best of luck in your journey to
either towards product management or

53
00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:58.530
running away as fast as you can.

54
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.731
And yeah, if you enjoyed it,
let me know on on the Twitter spheres or

55
00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:05.786
anything like that, but
yeah, thanks so much.

56
00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:10.424
Thanks for attending.

57
00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:13.505
