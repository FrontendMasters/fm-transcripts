1
00:00:00.281 --> 00:00:05.279
One of the hardest parts about and this is
kind of just in general for being a PM and

2
00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.129
probably even just working in an office
environments is sometimes it's just

3
00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.938
really hard to get started.

4
00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:13.862
This is hard about writing docs.

5
00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:17.503
This is but particularly roadmaps that
this is where I really struggle with them,

6
00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:19.256
which is why I put this in this section.

7
00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:21.744
Where do I start?

8
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:26.679
And the answer is just, just start
[LAUGH] my secret hack to this and

9
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.180
like it's it works with
like doing courses and

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.331
writing course materials and
planning and writing product specs.

11
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:39.625
Generally when I'm thinking about my
roadmap, I have some idea in my head.

12
00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.995
I have one idea in my head that like I'm
really kind of just hyper focusing on.

13
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:48.150
And I just start there which is usually
in the middle somewhere, right?

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.615
Usually I have like one project
that I'm really excited about.

15
00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.206
And I'm really decided to just like,
get on this project.

16
00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:57.095
I will start my roadmap by just writing
out the projects that are that I'm

17
00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:57.937
pumped about.

18
00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:02.153
And pretty soon once I was like
unblocked from that, getting started,

19
00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:06.027
generally the rest of stuff for
me just kind of starts to flow out.

20
00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:08.238
So that, I don't know.

21
00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:11.613
I shared that tip just because
it really helps me and

22
00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:15.628
it's really applicable to me
when I'm in planning season.

23
00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:17.818
But just start and
start with what's in your head.

24
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:24.515
There's some catharsis in just getting
stuff out of your head and onto paper.

25
00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.898
And I'll also say I almost always
delete the first thing I write and

26
00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:29.417
that's really okay as well.

27
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:32.803
I'll write something down and then I'll
write the rest of the document and

28
00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:35.596
realize this is actually not
the format that I wanted from it or

29
00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.064
I thought of something better.

30
00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:38.536
I'm gonna delete that.

31
00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:43.545
But I think there's something probably
physiological about just typing and

32
00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:48.642
activating a different part of your brain
that gets stuff flowing out better.

33
00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:52.485
Yeah, you just wanna get
the wheels turned in there.

34
00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:56.835
This was another thing that
intimidates a lot of PMs.

35
00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.300
Most of your roadmap
isn't all of your ideas.

36
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.421
You are not expected to
be the all-idea person.

37
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:10.640
I dare say that at a certain organization
size most of the ideas shouldn't be yours.

38
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.700
It should be a reflection of
what your users are telling you,

39
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.060
what your metrics are telling you,
what your team is telling you,

40
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.373
what your customer facing
organization people are telling you.

41
00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:23.187
Some of them should be your ideas or
probably ideas.

42
00:02:23.187 --> 00:02:27.521
Some of them should be your bets, right
like I'm making a bet that I think ChatGPT

43
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:29.648
things probably here to stay, right?

44
00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:32.817
And so we're gonna do some stuff on that.

45
00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:38.888
But yeah being a PM doesn't mean
coming up with all the ideas.

46
00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:43.824
It does mean being the shepherd
of all the ideas, right?

47
00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:46.631
And generally it means,
you are taking other people's ideas and

48
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.538
then you become the owner of them and
then you have to develop them and

49
00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:50.878
go further with them, right?

50
00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:55.817
It does mean that but it doesn't
mean you are like having to write

51
00:02:55.817 --> 00:03:00.585
down all of the work that you're
gonna do from your own brain.

52
00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:05.461
So like I sat down with my recent
roadmap and I would say 50% of it for

53
00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:10.944
me was ongoing tasks just like ongoing
things that we were trying to get done.

54
00:03:10.944 --> 00:03:13.345
40% either came from my team or

55
00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:18.247
like my greater company organization and
just 10% came from me.

56
00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:22.613
Now, I think if you went back to like some
of the stuff I was doing like on VS Code.

57
00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:27.340
It was much higher me like I think I was
working on like 50% of stuff that came

58
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.932
from me.

59
00:03:27.932 --> 00:03:32.722
And I think at stripe it was
almost entirely stuff that

60
00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:35.813
had come from customers try to do.

61
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:41.109
I don't necessarily think I worked on any
like any big project that came from my

62
00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.436
brain and that doesn't make me sad at all.

63
00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:45.447
I don't care where the ideas come from.

64
00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:53.661
I care that they're good,
Follow the themes.

65
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.932
I like looking at my
colleagues roadmap and

66
00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:58.770
my greater organization not
like all of snowflake but

67
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.009
like in the smaller organize that I'm in
and then see what they're working on.

68
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.725
And if I have,
prior roughly equivalent priority stuff

69
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:11.046
to work on that aligns with their work.

70
00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:14.745
Some of those synergies can be helpful.

71
00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:16.513
Stripe did a really good job and

72
00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:20.322
actually snowflake does a good job
too of publishing as a company.

73
00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:24.157
Here are themes for this quarter
plan around these kinds of things.

74
00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:28.498
So if you have some of those,
those are good to follow.

75
00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:34.018
This one,
it sounds like a truism kind of is it But

76
00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:39.688
don't say things like
improve web performance.

77
00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:41.924
When are you done
improving web performance?

78
00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:43.674
When is that a done thing?

79
00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:44.850
It's never done, right?

80
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.532
It's a continually, you can always
make it 0.1 second faster, right?

81
00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:54.057
So don't say things that aren't
completable say that like swap

82
00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:56.022
out framework for a new framework.

83
00:04:56.022 --> 00:05:00.269
There's a point where that goes from
being not done to being done, right?

84
00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.682
Make them basically a fact that
can be proven or disproven or

85
00:05:04.682 --> 00:05:09.554
a binary statement that is like
this is either true or it is false.

86
00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:13.741
But it should be something
that you can check off that is

87
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:15.935
a completable Unit of work.

88
00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:20.863
&gt;&gt; When you talk about these completable
quantifiable units of work I've

89
00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:25.708
been given this advice as a contractor
consultant as well it's hard to

90
00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:29.980
get paid when you set
really generic criteria.

91
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.716
Is this of a similar intent that you want
to make sure that your product projects

92
00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:38.306
and the products that you're
trying to bring to completion

93
00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:40.558
are actually considered complete.

94
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:45.575
And you're trying to influence without
authority that you mentioned yesterday,

95
00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:47.447
would this be a practice of it?

96
00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:52.083
&gt;&gt; Right cuz what's gonna happen is you're
gonna get to the end of your quarter.

97
00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:55.010
Your goal was improve web performance.

98
00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.175
And maybe it's like, all right,
we used to take 5.1 and now we take 5.0.

99
00:06:00.175 --> 00:06:04.040
Great, good job everyone, right?

100
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.606
It's also just an infinite bucket of work,
right?

101
00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:09.110
And I don't like infinite bucket of work.

102
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.672
I wanna do something and get done.

103
00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:17.785
Sometimes, let's say that you have
identified that users are having an awful

104
00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:22.910
time on your website and it's because
it's very slow and you don't know why.

105
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.750
My suggestion there is timeboxing and say
we have a two week perf push, right, and

106
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.130
so we're gonna go do this for two weeks.

107
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.862
And either we're gonna discover
what it was and fix it or

108
00:06:33.862 --> 00:06:36.610
we'll come up with an actual
project at the end of that.

109
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.206
But that's what I would plan for.

110
00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:42.317
And that is a completable thing is like
for two weeks we did work on this and

111
00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:44.720
we started it and we finished it and
it's over, right?

112
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.950
But it helps for accountability to you.

113
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.466
It helps for

114
00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:53.640
other people in your organization to
know what you're actually working on.

115
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.066
And it's just good practice as well.

116
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.493
Yeah and honestly it's gonna be good for
your career where you can go back and say,

117
00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:14.919
here's projects that I work on instead
of saying, I improved web performance.

118
00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.622
You can say, here's a list of actual
concrete things that I was able to get

119
00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:18.580
done with my team.

120
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.780
The next one here is make long
projects have milestones.

121
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.756
Some of the projects you're gonna take
are year long projects, two year projects,

122
00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:26.820
three year projects.

123
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.607
You could have probably
even longer horizons too.

124
00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:34.244
When you have those things,
break those down into milestones that fit

125
00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:37.324
within whatever your
unit of measurement is.

126
00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.810
If it's a quarter, right?

127
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.446
Let's say I'm migrating from SWS to Azure
or something like that I would make every

128
00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:51.019
quarter, like in this quarter I expect to
accomplish this part of the migration.

129
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:54.620
It's gonna be databases and object caches.

130
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.797
Next one is compute layer,
next one is messaging buses and

131
00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:04.349
the last one is AI services or
something like that.

132
00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.038
So that way it's still,

133
00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:10.873
you still end up with completable
packets of work within your quarter.

134
00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:13.320
It makes it reportable,
it makes it alignable.

135
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.380
Those are all good things to have.

136
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.366
Because rather than having this same
thing on your timeline, on your roadmap

137
00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:25.672
every single time you'll end up with
completed projects, which is always good.

138
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:30.096
So break things down into completable
packets of work if they're too long to fit

139
00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:34.270
inside of a particular quarter or
half year or year or something like that.
