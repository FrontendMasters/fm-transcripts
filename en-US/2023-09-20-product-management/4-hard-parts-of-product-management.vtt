1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.341
Why you might wanna be a PM.

2
00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:06.066
So I'm gonna tell you what I like about
being a PM and what I don't like about

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:10.131
being a PM, and we'll start with
what's hard about being a PM.

4
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:15.392
If you do not like meetings and e-mail
like me, then you probably are gonna

5
00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:21.171
have trouble with part of your job because
a lot of your job is meetings and emails.

6
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.656
A good half of this course is going
to be about how do we do meetings and

7
00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:25.341
email well?

8
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.849
I'm not sorry that's a huge
part of what this job is.

9
00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.190
You might follow up with
a question as like,

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.923
why the hell are you a PM if you don't
like those two things is like one,

11
00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:40.133
I don't think anyone likes those things
and if you do, What is wrong with you?

12
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.511
[LAUGH] That's probably
strong language to say, but

13
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:49.586
I don't think anyone enjoys like
sitting in long meetings or

14
00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:54.079
having to write per my last
email in an email, right?

15
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.294
But generally like this is what it is,
coordination and communication.

16
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:06.391
And then this was actually
probably my biggest struggle with

17
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:09.878
moving from being
an engineer to being a PM.

18
00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:14.747
When I was a engineer, there's
a little sense of accomplishment that

19
00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:19.960
every time you say git add, git commit and
git push, that I did something.

20
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.978
I took a piece of work and
I did it, and then I pushed it, and

21
00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:28.488
then now I get to feel accomplishment
because the mechanically,

22
00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.851
I stamped my work as done and
sent it off, right?

23
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:37.577
And then I closed the ticket and
that happens frequently, right?

24
00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:43.278
As a PM or sorry, as an engineer,
I was committing work at least once a day,

25
00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:47.439
if not multiple times a day
that was a constant button,

26
00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.539
I got to press, you did it.

27
00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.122
You did it, you're working and
it feels good, and

28
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:56.269
that feeling of productivity is like if I
went a whole day without making a commit,

29
00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.149
I would feel unproductive, right?

30
00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.108
And that happened a lot, when I had
a heavy meeting day as an engineer,

31
00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:03.279
I would get to the end of it
like I did nothing today.

32
00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:10.181
What's hard about being a PM is
you have to find different ways of

33
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:11.571
feeling productive.

34
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:15.704
At least for me as an engineer, you don't
get a sense of accomplishment when you

35
00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:19.915
send an email, you don't get a sense of
accomplishment when you hold a meeting.

36
00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:25.893
All of those things, it's much squishier
in terms of when did I do something?

37
00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:27.948
When did I accomplish something?

38
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.758
When do I get to claim work is mine?

39
00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:32.933
These are all questions that
I really struggled with.

40
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:36.038
And for my first little bit as
a PM at Microsoft, I was like,

41
00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.663
I don't understand how to
feel good about my job.

42
00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:42.126
And so I had a PM mentor that helped me,

43
00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:46.356
my manager at Microsoft
helped me quite a bit.

44
00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:51.011
And honestly still sometimes
feels like I got a whole day of

45
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:55.955
like back to back meetings like
what did I even get done today.

46
00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:01.482
But when you start learning to recognize
when steps are being taken forward and

47
00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:04.997
in your work and
like okay we cleared this review,

48
00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:10.037
we got this doc approved, we finished
planning, we had a good sprint.

49
00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:14.750
We close to these issues,
I started to recognize those things and

50
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.047
okay, Brian, you can feel
a little good about that right.

51
00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:23.141
And actually that dovetails nicely
into the second part of this.

52
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.222
Whenever I shipped work,
I remember seeing,

53
00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:29.549
I shipped a new sign up experience for
Netflix TV.

54
00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.297
Where you could like sign up for
Netflix using your tv, and I gotta look at

55
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:37.307
that and I remember going and showing
my mom, I was like, mom, I built that.

56
00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:41.791
And I got to feel, it was really easy for
me to take that sense of

57
00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:47.426
accomplishment of like, look what I built,
I wrote the code that does that.

58
00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:51.160
Now, in retrospect, there was a PM that
defined that work, there was a project

59
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.897
manager that managed all of that, there
was a designer that designed that whole

60
00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:58.616
experience, there was a QA engineer that
went through and tested all of that.

61
00:03:58.616 --> 00:03:59.915
Did I mention that to my mom?

62
00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:05.910
No, of course not, I built it, right?

63
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.265
I don't know, but I never felt important
to me because I felt like I did enough of

64
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.028
that I can claim that as my work.

65
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:16.251
Now when I see things launched as a PM,
I'm much earlier in those cycles and

66
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:19.065
I do help them kind of see
him over the finish line,

67
00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:23.040
but most of the glut of my work came
at the beginning of those projects.

68
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.693
And so all the final work and do it like
a huge spike on this, to get everything

69
00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:32.234
defined to work and then it doesn't
get done for like another six months.

70
00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:35.424
And so when I look at that,
it barely feels mine anymore, right, and

71
00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:37.138
I know everything that went into it.

72
00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:40.649
I know how much work the designer went and
put into it, I know how much the QA.

73
00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:44.009
And so I had a hard time looking at and
saying,

74
00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.732
I did that because I know it wasn't me,
totally.

75
00:04:47.732 --> 00:04:51.734
So it took some time to rewire my
blank is to say, it's okay, Brian,

76
00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:54.977
to claim still that you did that and
that we did that, and

77
00:04:54.977 --> 00:04:57.889
it's okay to take some credit for
that yourself.

78
00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.902
But I also remember as a engineer
being really annoyed at PMs and

79
00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:05.931
saying look boss, look what I did,
and it's man, I did that.

80
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:09.259
You didn't write any code for
that so, I don't know.

81
00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.789
Taking credit for work was also hard for
me, but I also witnessed one of my

82
00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.158
coworkers at Microsoft, Sarah Drasner,
another teacher for front-end masters.

83
00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:22.757
She did a really good job of saying,
I did that and so did these people,

84
00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:23.800
they also did this.

85
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.239
And so sharing that credit publicly also
made me feel okay taking some credit for

86
00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.544
that work as well.

87
00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:35.848
So, I don't know,
you might not have an issue with that, but

88
00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:41.572
it was a struggle for
me after being an engineer for so long.

89
00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:45.216
This is one that I don't necessarily
struggle with as much, but

90
00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:50.019
I've definitely seen PM struggle with it,
so I'm gonna talk about it a little bit.

91
00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:54.356
What to do next as a PM can be very
unclear, you'll finish something and

92
00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:58.911
as an engineer you just go to the backlog
you pull some another ticket off and

93
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.821
you start working on it right.

94
00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:05.583
If you don't know what to do next as
an engineer your project manager probably

95
00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:07.429
effed up somewhere, right?

96
00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:11.144
As a PM, no one is really
telling you what to do next and

97
00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:13.630
what you do next is really up to you.

98
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.654
And it's an exercise in prioritization of,
how am I gonna spend my time?

99
00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:21.812
And what's hard is like you always
have too many things to do and

100
00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:24.742
also sometimes it feels like
you don't have enough to do.

101
00:06:24.742 --> 00:06:28.199
And that can simultaneously
live in your chest and

102
00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.758
give you an anxiety attack, right?

103
00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:36.145
So it's a balance of what
needs to be done now today,

104
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.088
what do I have to ship today?

105
00:06:39.088 --> 00:06:42.050
What am I gonna have to have done
within the next week or two?

106
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.347
And when do I have time to do
strategy work for a longer term and

107
00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:48.302
you have to do all of those.

108
00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:52.893
And if you don't actually hold yourself
to as I have to do strategy work for

109
00:06:52.893 --> 00:06:57.123
later you will never do it because
there's always enough to do now.

110
00:06:57.123 --> 00:07:03.177
So that can be very difficult for new PMs,
learning how to spend your time correctly,

111
00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:07.314
and learning what to do when
you finish something else..

112
00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:14.916
And I would say of all of these.

113
00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:20.707
If this is hard for you and
that's a very difficult thing to you

114
00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:25.473
might wanna consider not becoming
a PM because it never gets better.

115
00:07:25.473 --> 00:07:27.896
It's always kind of a struggle,
like, what am I going to do next.

116
00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:31.620
Its always exercises,
I have something on fire and

117
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.701
I have something on fire,
what fire is more important?

118
00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:39.683
And sometimes the answer is
like they're both important and

119
00:07:39.683 --> 00:07:44.929
they both have to be done and you still
gotta pick one, right, that can be hard.

120
00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:48.548
Okay, questions?

121
00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:50.851
Anything about that about
what's hard about being a PM?

122
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:54.743
Those are the four that I kind of fell to
talk about, but I'm sure there's more.

123
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:59.073
&gt;&gt; How do you balance advocating for
what's best for the product,

124
00:07:59.073 --> 00:08:01.007
the team, and the company?

125
00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:05.799
And if they're in conflict, what's the
communication like to the individuals that

126
00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:07.604
aren't gonna win that battle?

127
00:08:07.604 --> 00:08:09.846
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, it depends.

128
00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:16.344
[LAUGH] So, I mean, this is probably
another exercise in prioritization, right?

129
00:08:16.344 --> 00:08:20.223
So I would probably start asking myself,
cuz I could see myself with,

130
00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:24.761
this seems really important for me, this
seems really important for my team, and

131
00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:27.815
this seems really important
to the company as a whole.

132
00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:32.753
And I'd probably start trying to break it
down, what kind of impact am I gonna have

133
00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:35.903
versus how much effort am I
going to expend on this and

134
00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:40.502
do I have the resources to actually
accomplish what I'm trying to get done.

135
00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:44.151
If I would say typically when you
run into those kind of conflicts,

136
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:47.670
one of those clearly wins,
this is either gonna be huge impact or

137
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.648
this is gonna be way too expensive.

138
00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:52.427
And like those big bets
are still appropriate but

139
00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:55.831
you have to kind of know how to
marshal your social capital.

140
00:08:55.831 --> 00:09:00.509
When I say social capital, it's credit
that you have with your friends,

141
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:04.747
right, you do favors for
other people to make withdrawals later.

142
00:09:04.747 --> 00:09:09.059
I mean, it seems transactional and that's
because it's actually transactional but,

143
00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:15.836
Yes, some of those asks can be really
expensive on your sister teams and

144
00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:20.192
your organizations, and making sure
that you are doing the correct thing for

145
00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:23.295
all of those things because
all of them are important.

146
00:09:23.295 --> 00:09:26.167
So, yeah, generally try and
break it down and

147
00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:28.680
see which one is the cost versus impact.

148
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.903
And then if they're equal at that point,

149
00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:35.875
I probably err on the side
of a corporate team mind.

150
00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:42.050
I would say that's a very weak bias,
that I try not to get to that point.
