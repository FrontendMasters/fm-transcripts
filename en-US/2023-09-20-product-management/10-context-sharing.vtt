1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.219
My next point is shut up.

2
00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:08.756
[LAUGH] It's say less.

3
00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:13.191
And I'll start with well this blue
box down here, a big temptation and

4
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:17.177
this actually I think comes from
my engineering background and

5
00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:20.650
my schooling background is
to show your work, right?

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.453
Let me show you all of the things
that I did to get to here.

7
00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:26.858
It's, on one hand,
it can be credibility lending of,

8
00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.697
look at all the background I did in this,
but for the most part,

9
00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.479
it's self-aggrandizing, whether you
mean to be or not, where it's like,

10
00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.828
look at all the work I did,
look how important this is.

11
00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:40.330
Don't do that.

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.481
I actually don't care how you got there.

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:46.239
I hired you or I work with you
because I think you're an expert and

14
00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.293
a domain expert.

15
00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.251
Just tell me what you want me to know,
right?

16
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.442
Please say less, right?

17
00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.206
So now that you have an audience in
your mind that you're talking about,

18
00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:58.513
I'm talking to my team.

19
00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:00.753
I'm talking to a bunch
of product managers.

20
00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:02.710
I'm talking to customers.

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.248
I'm talking to developers.

22
00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:10.162
Think about the context that they need
the minimum viable set of context for

23
00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:15.154
them to get to the point that you can
actually start talking about your plan,

24
00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:17.354
or whatever you want out of them.

25
00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:23.314
So, here's a couple of very breakable
rules that I'm gonna throw at you.

26
00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:26.493
If an audience all knows something
that you're about to tell them,

27
00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:27.456
then don't say it.

28
00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:31.013
Why are you saying something that
everybody knows and has acknowledged and

29
00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:31.699
is okay with?

30
00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:35.497
You do not need to share
any of that context.

31
00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:38.437
There's some companies that love to say
like, well, what if someone in the future

32
00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:40.831
is gonna read this talk because I
didn't have time to ask somebody.

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.352
I don't know I'm not slowing
everybody down in that maybe

34
00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:48.864
someone new might read this someday, okay?

35
00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:53.995
If none of the audience knows something,
and is it's critical to your message,

36
00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:57.849
those are the things that you
need to set in context sharing.

37
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.789
So let me contact share and
contact sharing for a second here.

38
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.946
[LAUGH] Contact sharing is basically
the idea that you're gonna

39
00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:10.876
set enough context on whatever
you're about to tell them.

40
00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:16.001
Whatever your point is, whatever you
want them to do, it's enough of say,

41
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:20.184
okay, we're gonna migrate from
server less to Kubernetes.

42
00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:23.688
Let me tell you about what enough about
what server less is and what Kubernetes is

43
00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:27.271
so that you can understand I'm doing this
and I'm trading off for this, right?

44
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:32.135
And I want your sponsorship of this to
go forward with this particular project.

45
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.989
If you're talking to a bunch of a group
of engineers that have been working on

46
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.989
a serverless platform for 10 years.

47
00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.528
Has sever less been around that long?

48
00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:40.127
Probably.

49
00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.133
Anyway you don't have to tell
him what Serverless is, right?

50
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.221
Please don't tell them what Serverless
is cuz you're probably wrong and

51
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:48.132
they probably know better than you, right?

52
00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:51.847
But if you're talking to a bunch of
executives ,you probably need to tell them

53
00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:54.450
why this is different and
why it's important to them.

54
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.619
By the way, this can be really expensive
or doesn't scale the way you want to or

55
00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.320
it's unpredictable and
it scales to zero and blah, blah, blah.

56
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.658
All those terms probably
need definition for

57
00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:05.372
your leadership if it's
critical to your message.

58
00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:09.452
If they don't care about scaled to
zero means, then don't tell them.

59
00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:10.309
It's fine.

60
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.172
So that's what I'm talking about
when I'm saying context sharing.

61
00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:17.925
How much lead up in your doc do you
need before you actually get to

62
00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:21.788
what you're at or
in your meeting as well, right?

63
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:25.376
So yeah, the next rule here
is if some people know it and

64
00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:28.964
it's important to it,
you can give a short summary and

65
00:03:28.964 --> 00:03:32.948
then links are the most wonderful
thing in the entire world.

66
00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:37.160
It's like, hey, here's a two sentence
blurb about what Serverless is.

67
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.287
If you need more,
I wrote an entire treatise of this.

68
00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.053
Here's the dock.

69
00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.889
Click here and
then use that dock to send everybody.

70
00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.582
If you care to know more about here is
everything you've ever wanted to know.

71
00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:52.503
But I'm not gonna put it in my
critical path of getting you from,

72
00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:57.164
I don't know anything about this
to I agree with your point.

73
00:03:57.164 --> 00:04:01.851
And if context just isn't important
to your message, just leave it out.

74
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:03.626
Just don't share it.

75
00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.875
You don't have to say it.

76
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.605
If it cannot be left out because for

77
00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:11.601
some reason either someone thinks it's
important that it needs to be there, or

78
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.555
it's tangentially related to something
grander that it needs to be in there.

79
00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.775
I don't know,
whatever reason that you can think of,

80
00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:23.256
just use links, write a different doc,
get it out of the critical path, and

81
00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:27.265
send only the select few that need
to see it off into the wilderness.

82
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.954
So, say less.

83
00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.242
This is what I'm saying
when I'm saying less.

84
00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:37.493
I'm gonna tell you why I'm
gonna tell you say less.

85
00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:40.301
Hopefully, most of your just
nodding is like yeah, probably,

86
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:43.171
I wish people would say less than
these particular kinds of dogs.

87
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.467
But well, yeah, here's my example.

88
00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:47.085
Here's kind of what I was saying.

89
00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:50.516
If you're saying like,
we're moving off of Heroku and

90
00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:54.398
we're gonna be moved on to,
GKE, Google Kubernetes engine.

91
00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:57.772
Let's say we have two different meetings
one is gonna be with all the tech leaders

92
00:04:57.772 --> 00:04:59.919
and one is gonna be with
a bunch of product leaders.

93
00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.335
With the tech leaders you probably
don't need to explain what a dyno is,

94
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:05.631
you probably don't need
to explain what GKE is,

95
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:08.674
what pods are, what services are,
what's secret storage is.

96
00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.653
They probably know, they probably know
better than you, you can leave all

97
00:05:11.653 --> 00:05:14.583
that part out and just be very cursory
like, we're doing these things and

98
00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:17.204
this is our proposal and
get quickly into the technical details.

99
00:05:17.204 --> 00:05:21.677
Because that's probably what they want and
it's probably what you want, right?

100
00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:25.268
If you're sharing with product leaders,
you need to probably spend a decent amount

101
00:05:25.268 --> 00:05:28.367
more time telling them, this is
everything that we're talking about.

102
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:29.615
This is what a dino is.

103
00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:31.119
This is why it's really expensive.

104
00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.328
This is why salesforce doesn't
support Heroku anymore.

105
00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:35.832
RIP to the real one.

106
00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:40.472
And this is what Kubernetes is, right?

107
00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:42.223
And this is why we'd wanna be on there.

108
00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:45.391
And then you talk about big
product decisions of, okay,

109
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:49.747
we're doing this because this enables us
to scale it a cost or this enables us to

110
00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:53.907
do a bunch of other things that we wanted
to do that enables product things.

111
00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:56.039
And this is why we it affects users for
it again.

112
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.159
But you're gonna wanna be able
to root this and this affects,

113
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.361
these stakeholders and these users, maybe
it's the stakeholders that allows our

114
00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:05.655
dev team to move faster eventually, right?

115
00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:08.994
But do you understand what I'm
saying with context setting and

116
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.136
saying the least amount of important and

117
00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:14.478
make sure it's cater to the audience
that you're talking to?

118
00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.465
Okay, so why?

119
00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:22.391
Have you ever been in a meeting or
just got derailed on something so

120
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:26.167
pointlessly tangential
that you just wanna die?

121
00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:28.700
I'm not talking about
anything specific here.

122
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Like weekly, right?

123
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.246
It's a huge pet peeve of mine because
it's such a waste of time for so

124
00:06:38.246 --> 00:06:42.656
many people, myself included and
it's frequently because

125
00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:47.344
the product manager whoever's
running the meeting, went on.

126
00:06:47.344 --> 00:06:50.805
They expose themselves to this tangent and
then someone's like,

127
00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:54.741
I'll take that tangent I'm gonna run with
it and not give it back to you, right?

128
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.791
So if you reduce surface area you reduce
the ability of people to kind of take

129
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.315
these and
run these in different directions.

130
00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:03.331
It's the same thing with like docs, right?

131
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:05.026
if you do all this context setting and

132
00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:08.371
then you're talking about stuff
that's actually not really related.

133
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:13.267
If you start getting into like, what is
secret store in a doc to product leaders,

134
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.861
they're gonna might rabbit hole on that.

135
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:20.539
And there's like a 10,000 comment thread
on this one thing that's, no one caress.

136
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.118
I don't actually put it on HashiCorp.

137
00:07:22.118 --> 00:07:23.803
I don't care.
I don't care where the secrets are.

138
00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:25.310
All right, write it in the code.

139
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.078
I don't care.

140
00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:29.459
Now my problem,
it's security is problem, right?

141
00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:33.195
So that's what I'm saying was say less and
reducing surface area.

142
00:07:33.195 --> 00:07:35.009
It helps focus discussions.

143
00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.622
It helps keep people on task and moving
in alignment to the things that you want.

144
00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:43.079
I'm just saying all these things because
someday one of you is gonna be my coworker

145
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.946
and hopefully one of you
is going to do this.

146
00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:48.568
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I think you're always gonna have people

147
00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.927
that are gonna find context out of
nowhere and I'll pull it out and

148
00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:55.106
I'll steer the conversation in
some other direction that has

149
00:07:55.106 --> 00:07:57.942
nothing to do with what
you're trying to accomplish.

150
00:07:57.942 --> 00:07:58.890
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

151
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.536
&gt;&gt; Because people are the worst.

152
00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:01.536
&gt;&gt; They'll beat that horse.

153
00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:04.495
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
this is reducing your exposure to it.

154
00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:08.566
And that's kind of the point here, is you
do have people that are gonna be like that

155
00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:10.636
and they gonna do it
no matter what you do.

156
00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.941
And so,
there's nothing you can do to help that.

157
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:18.227
We'll talk about how to like rerail
meetings when we get to that section.

158
00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:21.808
But in these particular cases, you're
trying to help the people that wouldn't

159
00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:25.547
normally otherwise derail it get caught up
on a subject that's not really pertinent

160
00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.304
to what you're actually trying to do.

161
00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:38.715
This is another thing, that don't convince
people who don't need convincing, right?

162
00:08:38.715 --> 00:08:41.456
If you go into a meeting and there's
consensus already about what you're

163
00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:43.631
proposing, end the meeting and
get the hell out of there.

164
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:45.679
You already got what you wanted, right?

165
00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:48.497
There's some PMs that will try and
go in there and is like, well,

166
00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:51.384
I prepared all of this stuff,
I'm gonna tell you anyway, right?

167
00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:57.093
And it's just like, I did work, therefore
I don't feel fulfilled until I express it.

168
00:08:57.093 --> 00:08:58.775
It doesn't matter, right?

169
00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:03.093
If you already have consensus this
was actually no from a text of this

170
00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:06.731
course to several of my former and
current colleagues and

171
00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:11.845
one of them Brian Harrelson who's actually
the editor of the JavaScript spec.

172
00:09:11.845 --> 00:09:15.150
This is one that he really harped
on that I thought was really good.

173
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.036
When you see bits of consensus caught,
I was okay, we agree on that, and

174
00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:23.180
we agree on that, and then you start
putting bits of consensus together, and

175
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.929
then you end up with consensus.

176
00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:27.130
I thought that was brilliant.

177
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:33.103
But in particular with, once you see total
consensus, just call it save this is good.

178
00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:37.176
And if you can end it or if you can
move on to the next thing, right?

179
00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.992
But do not spend a bunch of time with
a bunch of things to convince people when

180
00:09:40.992 --> 00:09:43.129
you have already won the battle, right?

181
00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:45.738
Because what ends up happening and
I have seen this before,

182
00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:49.285
when you start trying to convince people
of something you start telling them is,

183
00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:52.749
well, here's the downside, but let me
explain to you why the upside is good.

184
00:09:52.749 --> 00:09:59.189
I didn't think about that downside before,
now I'm unconvinced of your point.

185
00:09:59.189 --> 00:10:01.787
Sometimes it can be useful
to kind of walk through it,

186
00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:06.028
frequently, it's pointless, and so you
shouldn't have done it in the first place.

187
00:10:06.028 --> 00:10:09.592
And that your faults for running
the meeting on the dock incorrectly.

188
00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:13.049
&gt;&gt; I feel like some of that could
be like CYA for the future, too.

189
00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:18.856
Cuz you gotta be like while we kind of
discussed this as a potential con, right?

190
00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:20.090
Though my approach.

191
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cover your butt,
cover your butt to CYA by the way.

192
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.296
&gt;&gt; What's that?

193
00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:28.007
&gt;&gt; Not everyone knows all the acronyms,
so CYA, is cover your butt.

194
00:10:28.007 --> 00:10:29.579
&gt;&gt; Come clear, cover your what?

195
00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:31.672
&gt;&gt; Your butt.

196
00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:35.467
&gt;&gt; You're basically indemnifying
yourself for the future and saying,

197
00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:39.194
well, I did discuss this and
you didn't say anything at the time, so

198
00:10:39.194 --> 00:10:42.040
I would assume that you kind
of took that as he as yes.

199
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.375
&gt;&gt; So what you're talking about
was essentially a variation of

200
00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:50.206
inoculation theory and
I have a slide on that as well.

201
00:10:50.206 --> 00:10:52.897
It frequently just doesn't come up, right?

202
00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:57.236
And so all exploring,
all the hypotheticals is rarely of use.

203
00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:59.728
Sometimes it's, frequently it's not.

204
00:10:59.728 --> 00:11:00.871
&gt;&gt; Got to know the context.

205
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:02.591
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it depends.
