1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.888
So we are on to communication, and we're
about to spend about half the rest of

2
00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:09.590
the course talking about communication,
because that is most of this job.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.760
I'm gonna talk about general
principles of communication.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.430
And then I'm gonna apply these principles
talked about here in communication and

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.394
technical writing.

6
00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:21.639
And then I'm gonna talk about them
in conjunction with the meetings

7
00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:25.400
cuz these principles here
apply to both of them.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.776
So I wanted to kinda get the general
ones out of the way first, and

9
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:28.710
then we'll apply them.

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.421
So people, you're probably unsurprised I'm
saying this again, but the most important

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:41.658
part about whatever communication you're
doing is who the hell is listening to you?

12
00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:45.087
And what are you trying to get them to do,
and

13
00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:48.070
what are you trying to get out of them?

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.031
So just whenever you're writing a doc,

15
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:56.354
the extremely first question is what
stakeholders am I looking at here?

16
00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:59.350
Who is going to be reading this?

17
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.077
Know your audience.

18
00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:05.163
The way you write a memo to be consumed at
a company with 10,000 people is going to

19
00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:08.914
be wildly different than an abbreviated
executive summary that you're gonna

20
00:01:08.914 --> 00:01:11.450
send to senior leadership of that company,
right?

21
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.870
So know who you're talking to and
know what you want from them.

22
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.370
Have a damn point.

23
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.630
I've read too many docs that
just have no point whatsoever.

24
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.930
It's like, why did I spend
a bunch of time reading this?

25
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.299
This is a bunch of context
that leads me nowhere.

26
00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:32.960
Sometimes, rarely, context sharing
can be the exact point of that.

27
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.449
But usually,
you're trying to inspire action or

28
00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.930
you're trying to inspire something
to get done from other people.

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.490
Being informational is typically
not enough, so be intentional.

30
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.891
You can want sponsorship of your project,
you can want investment,

31
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:53.884
you can want additional resources,
whatever that is, but just ask yourself,

32
00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:55.168
who am I talking to?

33
00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.413
Why am I talking to them, and
what am I trying to get out of them?

34
00:01:57.413 --> 00:01:59.552
What is success, and what is failure?

35
00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:05.284
So please, where possible,
be explicit of what you want,

36
00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:09.193
and where not possible to be explicit,
be tactical about it.

37
00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:09.872
Yeah, and

38
00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:14.632
lead your audience to the conclusion
that you are hoping to get out of them.

39
00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.593
And then sometimes I do find that there
are some opportunities for discovery, so

40
00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:25.973
I'll kind of put hooks in there for people
like, okay, I'm wondering if I tell you

41
00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:30.500
these kinds of things that I'm gonna get
inbound information that I'm looking for.

42
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.868
So you acquiring additional context
can also be a point of whatever

43
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:37.676
communication that you're engaging in.

44
00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:41.645
So an example I put in here is, we
are working on feature X, but we don't yet

45
00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:43.913
know what the technical problems are, and

46
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.321
then if you send that out as a draft
to a technical organization.

47
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:50.162
You better believe that all of
those folks in that organization

48
00:02:50.162 --> 00:02:53.591
are going to tell you exactly what's
technically wrong with your project,

49
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.449
cuz people love to tell you
what's wrong with things, right?

50
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.920
So highlighting points of uncertainty can
also lead to opportunities for discovery.

51
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.790
So people, people, people,
know your audience and

52
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.060
know who you're talking to, and
know what you want to get from them.

53
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.974
&gt;&gt; What, and maybe you'll get to this,
is your advice or your strategy for

54
00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:27.030
handling what eventually becomes
a kind of a recursive cycle?

55
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.969
Because we're gonna sit down and
we're gonna write our plan,

56
00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.521
we're gonna move forward
with that plan a little bit,

57
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:35.910
we'll definitely have to go back and
make edits, corrections.

58
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.380
Do you have a way of thinking about that?

59
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.244
Or somewhat, maybe put it tersely,
how do you got to press 80% complete,

60
00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:48.049
knowing that more than
that is probably too much?

61
00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:54.900
&gt;&gt; It depends [LAUGH].

62
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.176
&gt;&gt; I think that's a good answer.

63
00:03:56.176 --> 00:04:02.157
&gt;&gt; It's a sign of a good learning
organization, or to borrow the Microsoft

64
00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:08.390
terminology that I heard way too much,
a growth mindset, right?

65
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.740
If I never hear that again,
I'd be too soon.

66
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.083
To know that whatever your specifications
are or whatever your vision for

67
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:22.209
something deserves to be revised and
revised frequently.

68
00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:28.581
So having a culture of revision and
a culture of learning and

69
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:34.570
a culture of applying new
context to old ideas allows for

70
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.430
you to kind of have that
sort of flexibility.

71
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.158
I think software has gotten to a much
different place than it has years ago, and

72
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.175
I, unfortunately,

73
00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:47.920
only can speak in the context of software
cuz that's all I've ever worked on.

74
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.327
But we expect to kind of have
those revisions that we don't,

75
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:55.160
we're not sending things
off to the manufacturer.

76
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.067
It's a whole different process where you
have to be really sure about what you're

77
00:04:58.067 --> 00:04:59.299
doing before you send things off.

78
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.673
But having a single source
of truth helps that a lot.

79
00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:09.285
Rather than having ten documents
that all talk about the same thing,

80
00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:13.392
it's better to have one doc that is the
plan, and then a bunch of other docs that

81
00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:18.130
refer to the plan, and that you
continually modify the plan over time.

82
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.434
And having a good culture of marking docs
as deprecated as soon as they are not

83
00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:24.250
applicable anymore.

84
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.580
That was a big problem at Stripe,
because Stripe is such a writing culture.

85
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.130
Stripe writes everything down.

86
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.782
Sometimes you'd be looking at docs and it
was like, you would not know that this has

87
00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:37.927
actually been deprecated and
there was new thinking on it.

88
00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:42.451
They got better at it towards the end
of my tenure there, but, yeah,

89
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:47.532
kind of like the idea of a living document
is my best idea of how to handle that.

90
00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:52.210
Hopefully, that will get explored more
as we keep talking about it, too.
