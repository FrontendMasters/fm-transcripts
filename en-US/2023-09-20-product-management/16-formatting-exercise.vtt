1
00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:04.442
So I'm gonna put this Doc here,
and it starts here where it says,

2
00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.227
August 1 Status Update.

3
00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:11.190
So go ahead and copy and paste all of
this, into your favorite text editor.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.394
And again, docs.new if you wanna
just pop right into Google Docs,

5
00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:17.180
don't mind if you use Word.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.374
You could use markdown if you
really were bent on doing that, but

7
00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:26.359
I'm gonna suggest that you use a text
editor, or sorry, a word processor.

8
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.349
And feel free to modify a little
bit if you would like to, but for

9
00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:38.902
the most part, I'm trying to get you
to leave the content mostly intact and

10
00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:42.276
use formatting to communicate your points.

11
00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:46.927
So audience, senior leadership team for
a 5,000 person organization.

12
00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:51.502
They know the broad stroke of your
projects, but they need an update

13
00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:55.850
on the status of the project to be
able to close some sales deals.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.203
You're redoing the checkout float to
incorporate feedback from some UX

15
00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:00.925
research.

16
00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:05.381
You're moving from a three-page checkout
page to a streamlined one-page checkout.

17
00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:08.637
The project is going well, but
you are a bit behind schedule.

18
00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:12.561
And that's kind of the point that you're
trying to make here, is like, hey,

19
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:16.616
things are great, no one panic, we have
to move the deadlines back a little bit.

20
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.253
I'm sure none of you have ever been in
situations that sounds at all like this.

21
00:01:20.253 --> 00:01:25.573
So your point here as the readers is that,
we are behind schedule, we are not

22
00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:30.745
much behind schedule, so getting
both of those points across, useful.

23
00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:39.014
So let's slice and dice this.

24
00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:42.918
So I'm just gonna go into Google Docs,
I'm gonna use my amazing copying and

25
00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:43.711
paste skills.

26
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:46.345
That is also half of being a PM,
is copying and pasting.

27
00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:49.361
That doesn't change between
engineering and PMing

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.562
docs.new, and paste this business in here.

29
00:01:55.562 --> 00:02:00.771
So first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna make this a title, and

30
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:06.393
I'm gonna make this a heading, and
I'm gonna make this a heading.

31
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:10.113
This is all pretty clumped together.

32
00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:14.966
Again I'm optimizing very much for
readership here, so

33
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.629
I would typically make this
line spacing a bit higher.

34
00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.015
What is the line spacing?

35
00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:25.960
1.5's usually pretty good, I think that
makes it quite a bit more readable.

36
00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:32.583
And then I would probably use
some bolding here to just make

37
00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:37.467
sure that I'm communicating
the point here of what we are.

38
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:40.412
The UX team found some issues with
the cart moving the checkout button

39
00:02:40.412 --> 00:02:41.086
right to left.

40
00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:50.048
The redesigns are underway,
that feels pretty important

41
00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:58.189
So that might be something
you might bold there,

42
00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.530
you need to bold something
that lets them know.

43
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.266
Our project will miss,
I would probably bold that as well.

44
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.954
Yeah, you might even just unbold this,
and unbold that one down at the bottom.

45
00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:17.019
I mean, there's kinda a couple ways to,

46
00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.639
We're only two weeks behind,
yeah, maybe something like that.

47
00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.305
I might reorganize this, so this is
obviously down towards the bottom, right?

48
00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:35.963
So you might have to spend some time
rephrasing some of this just to say that

49
00:03:35.963 --> 00:03:40.155
we're gonna miss our end of the quarter
project, and we're only two weeks behind.

50
00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:44.159
Therefore some executive
reading this could say, okay,

51
00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.861
two more weeks, I can do that, right?

52
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:51.299
Or, my God, two weeks,
we sold a bunch of people on this,

53
00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.277
and now we're in a heap of trouble,
or something like that, yeah.

54
00:03:56.277 --> 00:04:02.193
&gt;&gt; On that point of two weeks,
how then would I interpret the comments,

55
00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:06.885
this one sentence earlier
that says it's four weeks,

56
00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.749
we have four weeks worth of work?

57
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:14.234
We're emphasizing two weeks,
but if I'm reading that,

58
00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:17.357
there's a claim that it has four weeks.

59
00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:21.877
&gt;&gt; I think when I was writing this, which,
at this point, you're just into what was

60
00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:25.300
Brian thinking while he was
drinking a beer and writing this?

61
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.344
Who knows, that Brian is dead to us now.

62
00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:31.322
[LAUGH] But,
&gt;&gt; I guess I've run into these where

63
00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:35.921
it's technically a four-week delay if we
had half the staff and things like that.

64
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.460
And it's important to communicate that
we're solving a longer problem in

65
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.033
a shorter time.

66
00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:40.881
&gt;&gt; Totally, and it's an intent thing and

67
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.127
you probably could clean
up a language here..

68
00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:45.835
I think my intent was
that there's we're still-

69
00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:46.736
&gt;&gt; Two weeks away.

70
00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:50.561
&gt;&gt; Yeah, instead of being four weeks away,
we're now six weeks away, right?

71
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.985
So there's a two-week delay to the project
that we already had anticipating four

72
00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.386
more weeks or whatever that was.

73
00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:56.401
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but

74
00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:01.456
however you chose to interpret that, as
long as you're emphasizing, we're a little

75
00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:05.905
bit behind, but we are behind, that's
what I was looking to get out of you.

76
00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:10.783
And I was trying to keep this from
overflowing into some big thing, right?

77
00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:12.902
&gt;&gt; I took the first paragraph out and

78
00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:17.214
I put the delay in the text
under that's of the changes, and

79
00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:22.683
I took that first paragraph out, cuz that
first paragraph, it seems like an excuse.

80
00:05:22.683 --> 00:05:25.617
We're maintaining good cadence,
I'm like, yeah, that's great, but

81
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.914
if there's a delay,
I think I'd want to know that first.

82
00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:31.439
&gt;&gt; Yep,
I actually think that's even better.

83
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.364
&gt;&gt; I started down a similar path,
because, yeah,

84
00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:40.246
the two paragraphs are sort of
two sides of the same coin, and

85
00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:46.470
there's a lot of detail that depending
on largely, I think, the culture and

86
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.251
your relationship with this particular
senior management audience.

87
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.312
They may or
may not care about some of that detail.

88
00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:59.506
So initially I started restructuring
it as a bulleted list,

89
00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:03.217
expecting there to be multiple
factors in the delay.

90
00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:06.765
But then as I read through more of
the content, found there was only one,

91
00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:10.155
I thought, I could probably fit
this in about three sentences.

92
00:06:10.155 --> 00:06:14.297
And the link to the research results,
if they care,

93
00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:18.546
here's why we're doing
the work that we're doing.

94
00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:24.230
And the bottom line is we're
gonna be missing our deadline

95
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.060
by two weeks, and period, send, [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Awesome, yeah,

96
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.061
I like that's, probably even better.

97
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:34.591
[COUGH] And it kind of events
in the context you invent for

98
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:36.903
yourself in this particular case.

99
00:06:36.903 --> 00:06:41.852
But again, I like that you're trying to
form some imaginary audience to send this

100
00:06:41.852 --> 00:06:45.452
to, right, cuz ultimately,
who's gonna be reading it?

101
00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:48.402
What do you want them to get out of it,
and what do you want them to do about it?

102
00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:51.596
Hey, we're two weeks behind,
please don't panic, right?

103
00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:54.649
Cuz if you're just like, hey, we're
behind, they're gonna be like, my God,

104
00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:55.647
I'm gonna panic, right?

105
00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:58.819
Or maybe like I said, maybe it is,
my God, we're two weeks behind and

106
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.733
we're gonna miss our sales deadline or
whatever that is, right?

107
00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:04.751
In this particular case, I just wanted
them to say, we're just a little

108
00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:07.827
bit behind, we are missing end of quarter,
we are only two weeks behind.
