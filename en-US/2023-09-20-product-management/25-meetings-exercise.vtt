1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.367
We're gonna have an exercise now.

2
00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:07.958
So same formatting,
this August one status update.

3
00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:12.470
I want you to make
a meeting agenda about it.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.209
You're gonna have 30 people in a room,
from a 5,000 person company,

5
00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:24.576
some of those 3010 will be executives,
including the VP of product and

6
00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:28.771
the CEO and they wanna understand
what the delay is about.

7
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.293
10 more technical stakeholders on
your project a few which are impacted

8
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:35.551
adversely by your delay, so
they're not gonna be pumped about it.

9
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.509
And they will be looking to kinda take
you to task a little bit about like,

10
00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:43.694
hey, why are you late and
we want this sooner.

11
00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:47.631
And the last 10 or your team members and
your designers ever talk about the design

12
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:51.457
process your UX researchers prepare to
talk about the new research needed, and

13
00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:55.080
the tech lead is ready to talk
about the development process.

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.250
The tone of the meeting you generally
anticipate to be tense, but

15
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.797
generally everyone just
wants to launch features.

16
00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:03.470
So no one's gonna be like out to get you,

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.256
they're just all worrying
about their piece of the pie.

18
00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.900
So I want you to write an agenda for this.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.380
I want you to write some time boxes for
it, and then just kinda take some notes

20
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.810
for yourself like what challenges
are you gonna expect and

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.299
how can you organize yourself to get
the maximum effect out of this meeting?

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.645
And again, your point is essentially
is like, we're late, but

23
00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:30.720
this is necessary and we're gonna end up
with a better thing if we delay two weeks.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.280
That's generally what your point is.

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.860
So you can feel free to
write about this one.

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.755
If you have a meeting that you like
are about to do at work, by all means,

27
00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:42.900
do the exact same exercise for
your meeting at work.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.950
This can be helpful for yourself as well.

29
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.237
But in the absence of that you can do
it about this formatting exercise.

30
00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.565
So I'm curious some of
your approaches to this.

31
00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:02.254
I am pretty wide with my time boxes, and

32
00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.770
I'm not gonna say anything
here is wrong or right.

33
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.510
I'm just gonna tell you
how I approach these.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.963
So I'm not down to like, okay, we're gonna
address this point, then this point,

35
00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:13.030
then this point.

36
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.533
I'm generally here,
probably like 15 minutes of me just

37
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:22.499
talking about this is the overall
summary of what's happening.

38
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.240
Do you have any questions about this?

39
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.810
Probably give me like another five to
15 minutes of discussion about that.

40
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.656
So, probably the first half would
just be me owning the meeting,

41
00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:38.650
talking about this is the process,
this is what we're gonna talk about.

42
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.993
Do you have questions about the delay?

43
00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:46.190
And then leaving those kinda like
informational towards the end.

44
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.750
Obviously, this is gonna
be those parts right there.

45
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.351
They're kinda like the carrot to move
the meeting along, is like, hey,

46
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:57.920
do you wanna see the new designs?

47
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.820
Do you wanna talk about
the development process?

48
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.236
So I probably give each one of
these people 10 minutes, give or

49
00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.530
take depending on what they wanted to do,
right?

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.110
Maybe the US researcher
doesn't need that much.

51
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.250
Maybe the designer needs more.

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.270
But I leave probably the last
half of the meeting.

53
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.550
It's hey,
here's the actual technical details here.

54
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.838
So, if I was gonna write this down,
30 minutes for me to talk about,

55
00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:28.270
break that down into two sections,
what happened and what's gonna happen.

56
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.096
And then 10 minutes for each one of
those specialists to come in and

57
00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:32.940
talk about whatever they wanna talk about.

58
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.837
So my general approach to that,

59
00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:39.890
I'm curious if anyone had any
sort of differing thoughts there.

60
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.350
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I'd be curious your opinion on this.

61
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.100
I broke it down similarly, but I put
it was essentially, here's the problem.

62
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.080
Here's what we're doing about it.

63
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.618
We have eight minutes for questions
right in the middle of the meeting and

64
00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:58.460
the tactic being that if the room
is gonna be times blow up,

65
00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.920
there's gonna be a problem.

66
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.554
You can say, yeah, with Pastor Tom, and

67
00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:06.995
then I get to run I get to be the runner
I get to filibuster it basically,

68
00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.560
[LAUGH] for the next half hour of,
here's what's next.

69
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.301
But essentially, to keep the meeting
from running out, I figured if there's

70
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.254
gonna be a little tension if other
folks are gonna have opinions.

71
00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:22.329
We could put that in the middle and

72
00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:27.230
we'd literally have times the damage
control it, [LAUGH] in the tail.

73
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.870
&gt;&gt; It's gonna depend on, do you think you
can corral those data into eight minutes?

74
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.600
It's gonna depend who it is culture,
your personality.

75
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.539
If I had done that in those Microsoft
media I would not have regained control

76
00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:42.487
of that meeting.

77
00:04:42.487 --> 00:04:46.540
I could see it kinda breaking down.

78
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.911
It's like all right, we have blocks of
time for questions, so if you're like,

79
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:53.036
all right, presentation, 10 minutes,
five minutes for questions and

80
00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:57.150
just say if you're missing this block,
there's another one coming after this.

81
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.670
So if someone's running over it's
all right, we gotta keep this going.

82
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.480
But especially eight minutes
seems pretty tight to me.

83
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.850
I don't know, your mileage may vary there.

84
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.657
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I agree with you at six and
one-half dozen another,

85
00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:14.880
it depends a lot on who and
what the dynamics are.

86
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.990
But I appreciate your comments.

87
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.820
I wouldn't propose that as
an ideal strategy by any means.

88
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.473
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I mean,

89
00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:23.410
it's a tough balance to walk there.

90
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.820
Yeah, Dustin.

91
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.500
&gt;&gt; Christine, the chat says, very similar,
left the questions to the last 15 minutes.

92
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.639
Otherwise, I thought they may ask
questions that were covered by

93
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.050
the specialists.

94
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

95
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.746
Totally I think that is a super
valid strategy and just saying, hey,

96
00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:42.990
keep your questions we
got them at the end.

97
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.322
That is generally a fairly effective
strategy depending on again,

98
00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:50.600
who is in the room and
how apt they are to interrupt.

99
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.381
I am kinda used to working with CEOs and
vice presidents that are willing

100
00:05:55.381 --> 00:06:00.254
to just come down the say, I don't
care we're gonna ask it now, [LAUGH].

101
00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:02.200
And you can,
[INAUDIBLE] some of those people.

102
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.506
The Jedi mind trick I like
to pull there at the end.

103
00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:11.586
So like, well, this is gonna happen the
design and this is gonna be like, hold on,

104
00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:15.284
I'm gonna cut your question off there cuz
we still have someone that's about to

105
00:06:15.284 --> 00:06:17.160
answer a lot of those questions.

106
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.914
And so a little trick there to say like,
we haven't talked about that yet,

107
00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:24.350
keep at it, and
then we're gonna talk about it at the end.

108
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.000
But I think both of those
are valid strategies.

109
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.644
I'd be happy with either one of those.
