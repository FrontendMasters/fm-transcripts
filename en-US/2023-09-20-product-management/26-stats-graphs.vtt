1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.824
That's meeting, that's all you ever
wanted to know about meetings,

2
00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:04.950
it's more than I ever wanted
to talk about meetings.

3
00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:11.119
So, let's talk a little bit about
metrics because I think metrics

4
00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.190
are really important
to product management.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.054
I am not a statistician, I am not going to
spend a lot of time talking about stats

6
00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:21.580
because I don't know a lot about stats.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.620
I know they're important and I get a lot
of people to do stats on my behalf.

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.540
And or I look a lot of dashboards.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.543
So I had never taken a stats course
until like seriously three months

10
00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:40.747
ago four months ago when I took my
first stats course as a part of my MBA.

11
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:43.634
Until then I had just consumed stats and

12
00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:48.369
not really actually,
been on the other side of producing them.

13
00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.822
So the first thing I to say is stats is
actually one of the most useful forms

14
00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:56.769
of mathematics to someone that
works in an office environment.

15
00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.426
Just because a lot of the stuff that
we do has to do with statistics.

16
00:01:01.426 --> 00:01:05.660
So I pulled out some things that I
think it's just generally useful for

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.688
a product manager to be aware of or
to think about.

18
00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:13.630
First of all, my master's program
borrowed heavily from this

19
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.970
book here called OpenStats.

20
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.141
I put in here there's
a couple of versions of this.

21
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:25.602
You can buy a paperback edition of it,
but it's also just free as a PDF.

22
00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:30.461
One of the cooler open-source projects, in
my opinion, a bunch of statisticians came

23
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:34.282
together and made a free stats book,
and they update it constantly.

24
00:01:34.282 --> 00:01:37.881
You can see that they're on the fourth
edition here of the OpenIntro to

25
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:38.618
statistics.

26
00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:43.126
And there is one that's actually,
more gauged towards software engineering,

27
00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:47.515
I believe it's an R, and R is a very
silly language that I don't like writing.

28
00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:51.389
So if you are a normal
Python JavaScript developer,

29
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.565
you're gonna find R fairly silly as well.

30
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:59.163
R is written by statisticians for
statisticians, therefore it does not feel

31
00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:03.351
C-like, and I think we all like
C-like languages for the most part.

32
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.431
So just be aware anyway.

33
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.329
Yeah, so you can see this is all in R.

34
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:12.819
In other words,

35
00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.924
unless you are really bent on learning R
maybe just stick to OpenIntro statistics.

36
00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:22.387
So I'm gonna say any moment that you spend
learning stats, it's gonna be useful to

37
00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:27.066
you, it's not a moment-wasted If it's not
required by any means, but it is useful.

38
00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:32.104
So I'm gonna just leave
a couple of things in here,

39
00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:35.187
I think sampling is something
that I found counterintuitive.

40
00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:38.922
But I found very interesting if you take
a truly random sample of a large group and

41
00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:42.626
the sample is large enough that you can
say it's representative of the whole.

42
00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:47.466
And why this is important something
like AB testing or talking to users and

43
00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:51.603
some of those things that if you
can get a large enough sample and

44
00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:54.043
you are not biasing your selection.

45
00:02:54.043 --> 00:02:57.052
So that for example, like talking
to your users, it is biased in

46
00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:00.900
the fact that you're you're biased in your
finding users that will talk to you and

47
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.160
that you have access to no matter
what that's still a biased sample.

48
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.577
It's still better than nothing,
probably question mark?

49
00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:12.979
But generally, if you can get
a truly random sample of your users,

50
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.815
you can say that that's representative.

51
00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:20.073
And therefore you can make inferences of
like, hey, so many of our users are using

52
00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.914
this browser and they're, these kind
of users and those kind of things.

53
00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:33.041
So, getting more information about who's
using my product sampling is critical.

54
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.452
Now, again, this is stats one on one,

55
00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:40.362
I'm sure all of your data scientists
are like, yeah, obviously dah, right?

56
00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:43.074
Just useful to me.

57
00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:47.787
P-values, I'm not gonna spend a ton of
time about this because I don't have

58
00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:49.236
a ton of depth here, and

59
00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:53.243
this is the most advanced stats
concept that I want to talk about.

60
00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:55.773
But a p-value basically is saying,

61
00:03:55.773 --> 00:04:00.998
lower p-values means these two things
are more closely correlated that you

62
00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:06.565
can think of it like that I think I spent
a bit of time crafting this sentence here.

63
00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:10.183
A more accurate way to state what
the p-value is is how likely that these

64
00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:14.349
statistics would happen if the things
we're measuring are totally uncorrelated

65
00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.154
to each other.

66
00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.187
Which is hard for me to conceptualize,

67
00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:20.142
which is why I came up with
this second sentence that lower

68
00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:23.798
p-value means the two things look
like they're really correlated.

69
00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:28.428
I don't wanna spend much more
time on it than that just because

70
00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:31.825
it's not actually
the point of this course.

71
00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.260
But a lot of people have arbitrarily
chosen the p-value of 0.05

72
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.840
which is otherwise 5%, it's like being the
threshold to call something statistically

73
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.057
significant, right?

74
00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:45.768
This comes into play, imagine you have an
AB test where, we talked about that with

75
00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:49.543
Netflix, on Netflix you have
a button that says, sign me up now.

76
00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:54.254
And a different button that says, just
click here for free Netflix, and you have

77
00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:59.537
a, you're in an AB test of showing 50% of
users this one, and 50% of users this one.

78
00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:05.555
And you end up with a result that
treatment be that you click here for

79
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:10.499
free Netflix is better for
that has a higher signup rate

80
00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:15.255
doesn't say the p-value was like 0.2,
right?

81
00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:18.869
You would call that statistically
insignificant in other words, this was

82
00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.787
random noise, and we actually can't make
a decision based on this experiment.

83
00:05:22.787 --> 00:05:28.112
Or if it had a p-value of 0.01,
you could say, actually, I've basically

84
00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:33.301
proven that this is the better treatment,
and we should definitely use this one.

85
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.060
That's what I wanted you
to get out of p-values, so

86
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.263
that you can read experiment results and
say, okay, this one's better or

87
00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:43.548
okay I actually can't take any
information back out of this.

88
00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:48.355
So like the p-value is 0.2 it's not
saying that it's the opposite it's not

89
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:53.305
saying that like treatment A was better
what it is saying is that this experiment

90
00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:58.772
was inconclusive So
it either means you need to retry your

91
00:05:58.772 --> 00:06:02.516
experiment under different constraints so
that you can tighten that p-value up, or

92
00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:06.067
it means that there actually just isn't
correlation between those two things.

93
00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.862
One of those buttons isn't gonna
do any better than the other one.

94
00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.777
And you can't prove it in this particular
experiment that you were doing.

95
00:06:15.973 --> 00:06:20.238
That make sense, is that enough nonsense
of Brian trying to explain statistics?

96
00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:24.996
Did I mostly get that right?

97
00:06:24.996 --> 00:06:26.152
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty good.

98
00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:26.824
&gt;&gt; Okay.

99
00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:31.210
&gt;&gt; The American Statistical Association
has published a single

100
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.433
consensus paper in its history,
and it is on the p-value.

101
00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:36.653
And it is worth looking up.

102
00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:37.294
&gt;&gt; Okay.

103
00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:41.044
&gt;&gt; Cuz it explains some of the confusion
around how it's been misused, well,

104
00:06:41.044 --> 00:06:44.528
I think you've done a great job
&gt;&gt; Okay, I appreciate that.

105
00:06:44.528 --> 00:06:48.722
I spent a lot of time crafting that
section because I don't wanna get this

106
00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:52.092
wrong because otherwise the chat
is gonna tear me apart and

107
00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:54.248
then Twitter is gonna tell me apart.

108
00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:58.353
It's happened before my computer science
class I there was Reddit threads about

109
00:06:58.353 --> 00:07:02.031
what Brian got wrong on the very first
time that I taught it that I fixed for

110
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.958
the current one.

111
00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.319
So go watch the current one to
think I think it's pretty good.

112
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.996
Okay a little bit about graphing,

113
00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:13.071
the first rule of fight club
is never use pie charts.

114
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:14.832
[LAUGH].

115
00:07:14.832 --> 00:07:19.503
The first rule is never use pie
charts ever, just hard pass.

116
00:07:19.503 --> 00:07:24.267
There is no good reason to
ever use a pie chart, okay?

117
00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:28.215
If you walk away with nothing else from
this course just never use a pie chart.

118
00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.183
You are already better pm
than some that I know.

119
00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:35.583
I'll tell you about why in just a second,
cuz everyone wants to use a pie chart.

120
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:40.514
Why do we use graphs,
why do we put graphs in anything?

121
00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:43.851
A lot of people put in graphs
as we talked about earlier,

122
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:47.689
which is like to show their work is like,
look at these numbers.

123
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:51.116
I don't care about your numbers
I don't even care about like,

124
00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.221
contextually showing me numbers
does nothing for me, so

125
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:56.954
don't just show me a graph
just to show me a graph.

126
00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:03.936
Graphs are for storytelling,
they are tools of storytelling.

127
00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:06.857
Numbers themselves are not
useful to show off,

128
00:08:06.857 --> 00:08:10.735
we use them to describe changes and
to identify needs, right?

129
00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:14.158
So what if you show me a graph you
better have a sentence underneath it or

130
00:08:14.158 --> 00:08:16.429
you're gonna you're
bound to tell m is like.

131
00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:22.005
Here is our signup graph of people signing
up or tenants on a line graph over-time.

132
00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:23.128
And there's a dip here,

133
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.457
let's talk about the dip or
let's talk about why this shut up., right?

134
00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:34.118
And you're using that as a as a tool
to tell me something about it, okay?

135
00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:38.723
So given that you wanna have
a graph that shows me your story,

136
00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:45.133
this is why pie charts are terrible, is
because they're awful at telling stories,

137
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:49.309
in other words,
they basically don't tell stories.

138
00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:53.639
So I put a little graphic here, this came
from the extreme presentation method,

139
00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:57.533
there's lots of things out there is like,
what do you wanna talk about?

140
00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:59.763
And so like,
do you wanna show relationships,

141
00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:02.904
do you wanna show distributions,
do you wanna show composition?

142
00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:04.268
Do you wanna show comparisons and

143
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:06.370
then like there's a bit of
a selection chart here.

144
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.364
So comparison, you wanna show it over
time and you wanna show a few periods,

145
00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:15.813
then a column chart would be good for
a single, a few categories, or

146
00:09:15.813 --> 00:09:19.506
a line chart would be good for
many categories, right?

147
00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:21.273
I actually went through this and

148
00:09:21.273 --> 00:09:25.074
was like this is actually a pretty
good selection methodology here.

149
00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:29.295
Generally, when I have numbers that I
wanna show in a graph, either I'll ask my

150
00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:33.085
data scientists, because to them
it's obvious which one you choose.

151
00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:36.165
Or I'll just Google it like
I have this kind of data,

152
00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:38.126
what kind of charts should I use?

153
00:09:38.126 --> 00:09:38.921
That'll help.

154
00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:42.308
And actually Tableau, if you've
ever used the Tableau software, and

155
00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:45.986
I know that that's somewhat a competitor
to what the thing that I work on now.

156
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:49.683
It's actually fairly good at generally
suggesting you have data that looks

157
00:09:49.683 --> 00:09:53.509
like this, you might consider these
kind of charts, that also helps as well.

158
00:09:55.647 --> 00:09:57.780
So tell a story with a graph, and

159
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.774
then choose the right graph to highlight
whatever story you're telling.

160
00:10:02.774 --> 00:10:06.931
Like a good one that I had to show
recently was cost, like I was showing

161
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.172
the COGS, and I can't remember what
COGS stands for, cost of goods?

162
00:10:11.172 --> 00:10:11.728
&gt;&gt; Sold.

163
00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:13.407
&gt;&gt; Sold, thank you.

164
00:10:13.407 --> 00:10:17.720
Which is basically like,
how much does it cost to run my service?

165
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.855
And we had one part of our spinner
that was ballooning, right?.

166
00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:24.448
So I showed it in a stacked bar chart.

167
00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:30.905
So basically, you could see over time that
like the spending was staying the same.

168
00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:33.698
And if you were just looking at
the total cost of our total COGS for

169
00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:35.819
my entire product,
it looks like we were flat and

170
00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:38.486
like good job cuz we were growing
users but not growing cost.

171
00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:41.751
We actually saw that our costs were going
down because we had done a lot of good

172
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:42.781
infrastructure work.

173
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:47.758
But we had one part of our service that
was ballooning at such a rate that it

174
00:10:47.758 --> 00:10:50.055
looked like it was flat, right?

175
00:10:50.055 --> 00:10:53.181
And so I was trying to say it
looks like we're doing a good job,

176
00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:55.056
we're actually doing an awful job.

177
00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:59.047
At some parts, we're doing a good job of
other things, but a stacked bar chart told

178
00:10:59.047 --> 00:11:03.097
that story really, really well because you
could see everything else shrinking and

179
00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:04.658
that one part growing, right?

180
00:11:04.658 --> 00:11:07.910
And stacked bar chart, you can see
that that's this one down here,

181
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.009
this is a stacked bar chart right
here the stacked column chart.

182
00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:19.311
So I've used lots of different
charts to tell stories,

183
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:24.984
so just select one that helps
you make that a bit bigger.

184
00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.601
Select one that helps you tell
the story that you wanna tell.
