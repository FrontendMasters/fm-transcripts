00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:04.727
Would it be fair to say
the messaging around this point

2
00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:07.913
falls in the frame of due diligence?

3
00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:10.996
It's not possible to be prepared for
everything.

4
00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.993
It's not possible to
think through every case.

5
00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:19.986
But I can come reasonably prepared, and
I can come prepared with more than I say.

6
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.265
So I have the ability to say no, well,

7
00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.293
we're not talking about
where secrets could start.

8
00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:29.788
We have some people who will talk to
us about that, so let's keep going.

9
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:34.324
That's almost more of a due
diligence practice to your projects,

10
00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:35.626
to your own goals.

11
00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:40.054
Then some sort of magic if
I'm understanding correctly.

12
00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:42.512
&gt;&gt; I mean you say my next point here,
right?

13
00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:47.238
Which is you prepare for 100% so
you can say 5%,coming into those

14
00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:52.056
meetings to prepared with all those
various different answers so that.

15
00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:56.116
My favorite tactic and all these things is
like, we are not talking about that now,

16
00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:58.562
here is the one sentence
answer to your question.

17
00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:03.829
If you need more, here is stack or
put time on my calendar, right?

18
00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.255
Because it shows that like, you are
prepared, you do know the answer to that

19
00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:12.005
and you do not want to derail what
you are talking about, right?

20
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.284
The one sentence answer and the
acknowledgement is like I understand you

21
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.804
here's your most of your answer
you need more come find me.

22
00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:23.495
Generally it was really successful for
me at Microsoft which was the most

23
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.051
contentious meeting culture
that I was a part of.

24
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.233
I don't mean that in the positive way.

25
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:31.322
There's just a lot of competing interests
at Microsoft cuz it's so big, right?

26
00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:34.434
This isn't another way for
me to harp on this point up here,

27
00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:37.735
which is that just because you
know the answer and you know, and

28
00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:40.370
like you did a bunch of work
to find out the answer.

29
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.836
You don't have to share that.

30
00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:47.587
Results will speak way longer or
way louder for your, like,

31
00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:52.819
how good you are as a PM than just
talking a lot in meetings, right?

32
00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.165
So, be aware that you're gonna do a bunch
of work to get ready for meetings or

33
00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:03.774
to get ready for docs that you're just
never gonna share with anybody, right?

34
00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:07.329
But you know the answer those questions
when they pop up like you're gonna

35
00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.063
be well prepared for those things.

36
00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:13.792
Last thing here is this is not
high school English class or

37
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:19.223
a secondary language school for
whatever country you're from.

38
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:24.177
In my high school English class I was very
encouraged to use a wide vocabulary to

39
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:29.583
have varied structures to have different
paragraphs to really engage with the pros,

40
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.123
right?

41
00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:35.381
And make people feel things because of
you know the pros I was writing, right?

42
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:40.314
Don't do that,
this is technical writing this is wildly

43
00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:45.775
different I don't need poetry
in mice product specs, right?

44
00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:50.824
Technical writing is an entirely different
skill set than what you know writing

45
00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:56.039
essays three SATs are you should use very
direct language, very plain language.

46
00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:01.002
Don't use acronyms that you don't have to,
don't use initialisms that you don't have

47
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.525
to, don't use just silly
vocabulary that's not pertinent.

48
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:10.644
Your goal here is to drive understanding
not to self-aggrandize, right?

49
00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:15.432
So it's a virtue to have
very easy to read writing.

50
00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:19.938
It's a virtue to have a appropriate
reading level of vocabulary for

51
00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:22.002
whoever you're speaking to.

52
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:27.725
These are all really good things and I'm
encouraging you to write plainer English.

53
00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:31.212
Try and use direct voice,
use less indirect voice,

54
00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:36.444
make your things actions that you are
following through on, make things goals

55
00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:41.612
are things that are true or false if
don't try and dry these Grant analogies.

56
00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:45.248
Analogies and metaphors are ,unless
they are driving understand them,

57
00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:47.005
just leave them out, right again,

58
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.482
this is me just picking a bone that
I've had with previous PMS before.

59
00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:53.817
It's like I feel I'm reading
like a novella, right?

60
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.402
And there's like a beginning
middle middle and end, right?

61
00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:01.176
And anyway, don't do that I don't I don't
need a romance story in my product spec or

62
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:04.066
maybe I do I guess I'd be entertaining so
if you're

63
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:08.414
gonna do it at least make it entertaining
&gt;&gt; How do you go about giving feedback

64
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.782
to maybe one of your peers or your co
workers That is breaking a Brian rule.

65
00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:15.848
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just tell them as
you're making breaking Brian rules.

66
00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:17.382
&gt;&gt; So that's it, you got it.

67
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:21.544
&gt;&gt; Move on.

68
00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:22.727
&gt;&gt; That could be a whole course in itself.

69
00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:27.593
It's like how do you influence peers?

70
00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.162
It depends, right?

71
00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:33.490
It's a tricky balanced to strike.

72
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.350
Because it's very easy to go
cross over from here's honest,

73
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.958
earnest feedback that I'm trying to
help you with to I feel attacked and

74
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:49.958
you're attacking the way that I pm which
is attacking me as a human, right?

75
00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:56.256
So it's gonna be I try in general like,
if I feel like I can influence someone and

76
00:04:56.256 --> 00:05:02.087
help them to like, be better either to
themselves or to me or work better.

77
00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:05.773
I will engage in that kind of behavior and
if I just know it's gonna fall on deaf

78
00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:09.574
ears I'm just I'm spending social capital
for no reason I just don't give it to

79
00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.979
honestly, that might be
too honest of an answer.

80
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.685
Hopefully snowflakes not watching this.

81
00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:18.461
No, I try and give feedback to people that
I think will will take it and use it,

82
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:21.787
and I try and
do it in a way that that's useful to them.

83
00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:25.633
So and that's going to be highly
contextual to whomever you're giving that

84
00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.360
feedback to.

85
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.955
But I have given feedback to to us,

86
00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:30.824
particularly a junior PM that I
used to work with, I was like.

87
00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:33.725
Your technical writing is too flowery,
right?

88
00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:37.071
You're using too many,
this feels like an essay to me.

89
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:38.601
Just tell me what you want from me and

90
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:41.052
use a quarter of the language
that you're doing it with.

91
00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:45.463
And she did, and it was awesome,
and she's fantastic PM now.

92
00:05:45.463 --> 00:05:50.648
Still what she was anyway, but
her writing was much better to read.

93
00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:55.523
&gt;&gt; Have you, do you find yourself in
circumstances where you have to get

94
00:05:55.523 --> 00:06:01.338
technical material or technical writing
from engineers or other folks outside?

95
00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:02.787
How do you manage that?

96
00:06:02.787 --> 00:06:04.332
I'll put myself on the table.

97
00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:09.940
Most common feedback I get is, this is
terse, but it has way too much math in it.

98
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.931
So two pages is too short 'cause
it should be five or 10, right?

99
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:20.788
Because it's dense, that doesn't work
any better than long descriptions.

100
00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:24.444
But when you are working with
folks who don't regularly

101
00:06:24.444 --> 00:06:26.944
communicate with the outside world.

102
00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:28.208
How do you approach that?

103
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:29.524
&gt;&gt; I just keep them
locked in the basement.

104
00:06:29.524 --> 00:06:30.524
Yeah, well, I don't let out.

105
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:31.628
&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.

106
00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:34.196
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].
[INAUDIBLE].

107
00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:40.061
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have done this before is
particularly with technical architects

108
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:45.169
that are like you know on Mount Olympus
right that l are communing

109
00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.775
with the gods of the cosmos of like
how do I organize containers right?

110
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:51.658
[COUGH] And

111
00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:57.401
I just harp on them continually
is like who are you writing to?

112
00:06:57.401 --> 00:07:00.953
And if you gave me a doc full of math and
I'm, this is not for me.

113
00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.694
You did not write a bunch of math for
me or

114
00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:08.361
you don't know me whether it's one
of the two things there right.

115
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.112
You are writing down something so
that I can understand something and

116
00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:12.069
I am not getting there.

117
00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.962
And so I'm gonna ask you
continually is like write this for

118
00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:18.674
me what am I getting out of this, right?

119
00:07:18.674 --> 00:07:23.264
And I'll just keep sending it back to us
I don't get it, until eventually they're

120
00:07:23.264 --> 00:07:27.673
gonna write something is like what I'm
trying to tell you here's enough math.

121
00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:31.474
That's written in such a way
that it's understandable, and

122
00:07:31.474 --> 00:07:36.225
here's what that actually means to
you.That usually ends up with something

123
00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:38.214
understandable in the middle.

124
00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:42.637
&gt;&gt; More of an editing process,
you have to be actively engaged.

125
00:07:42.637 --> 00:07:44.486
&gt;&gt; I'm just letting him know,
I'm an idiot.

126
00:07:44.486 --> 00:07:46.321
Please speak to the idiots, right?

127
00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:51.934
Don't speak to the smart person behind
the idiots, talk to the idiot, right?

128
00:07:51.934 --> 00:07:56.269
So, audience, it's just reminding
them over and over and over again,

129
00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:58.059
it's like, who is this for?

130
00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:01.446
Yeah.

131
00:08:01.446 --> 00:08:06.050
And like, I told you, I think I told many
of you, I'm a college dropout, right?

132
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.734
So the only class I think I
reference frequently, and I hate it,

133
00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:14.238
because it was like my least favorite
class in college was technical writing,

134
00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:15.826
but I, use it all the time.

135
00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:20.340
It's so important to being a good PM,
your power as a PM is in your ability

136
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.633
to communicate, to drive understanding,
and to drive alignment.

137
00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:29.005
And so unfortunately,
the advice I have to give all of you and

138
00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:34.519
I don't want to, is that a technical
writing course will serve you so well.

139
00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.814
Even reading a book,
reading a blog post, but

140
00:08:37.814 --> 00:08:42.799
really focusing in is how can I improve
my ability to communicate makes

141
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.021
you a powerful contributor
at your company.

142
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:50.700
My ability, when I was at Microsoft to
move the company like this trillion

143
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.547
dollar company, was my ability
to write slide decks because

144
00:08:54.547 --> 00:08:57.280
everything's a slide deck at Microsoft.

145
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.865
That's how I was able to, like make
hundreds of millions of dollars for

146
00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:02.730
Microsoft, which is cool, right?

147
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.104
It's cool to say that,

148
00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:08.157
like, I pointed out, like, I worked
on that and I got that through and

149
00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:12.861
it was this stock that I wrote that got a
bunch of people working on the same thing.

150
00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:15.268
So do that.

151
00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:16.438
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:20.759
I truly am.
