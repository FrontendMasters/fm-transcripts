1
00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:03.124
So, what is the product manager then?

2
00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:07.762
A product manager manages product,
full stop the end,

3
00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:10.438
we can just go home now, right?

4
00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:14.228
No, I would say the primary
job of a product manager,

5
00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:19.030
if I'm just gonna like try and
make some really broad strokes here,

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.750
is determining what the team works on.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.021
And that's gonna be via strategy,

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:30.106
that's gonna be via writing product specs,
meetings, those kind of things.

9
00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:34.913
And they just kind of figure out
how to marshal the resources that

10
00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:39.898
are available towards projects
that gonna be the highest impact,

11
00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:42.849
to move the company's goals forward.

12
00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:45.435
It involves what you're working on now,
right?

13
00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:49.388
So that's gonna be like going to the stand
ups and the sprint meetings, and

14
00:00:49.388 --> 00:00:53.994
the backlog grooming and things like that,
and kind of helping with prioritization.

15
00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:57.506
Prioritization is a massive part
of being a product manager,

16
00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:01.433
it's a lot of research of like what
are we soon going to be working on?

17
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.599
What's soon going to be important to us?

18
00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:06.816
There's some longer term like
vision things as well, of like,

19
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.494
what's way down on the horizon?

20
00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:13.230
Are we heading in the direction
that we as a company wanna go?

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.522
And then I've mentioned this a bunch of
times but it also just feels gaps, right?

22
00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:21.346
If you don't have a marketing manager,
if you don't have a project manager,

23
00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:25.731
if you don't have a designer,
if your team needs an extra developer for

24
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:28.895
the sprint,
I've done all of those things as a PM.

25
00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.291
Yeah, and
I like this list here that I came up with.

26
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.908
So, some of it is going to be your
ideas of stuff that you work on, but

27
00:01:38.908 --> 00:01:41.827
I would say most of the things
that my team actually ends

28
00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.684
up working on either came
from the engineering team,

29
00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:49.230
came from customers with something in
the backlog from someone else, right?

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.932
So you do work on your own ideas, and you
do make your own bets of things like, hey,

31
00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:57.220
I think this is gonna be a cool thing, we
should probably try and get ahead of this.

32
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.570
But it's also organizing ideas from your
greater network of ideas available to you.

33
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.166
It's then taking those ideas and
prioritizing them, as like,

34
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.630
we're gonna work on this first.

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.160
This is important, we have to ship this,
we don't have to ship this.

36
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.660
This is a nice to have.

37
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.712
If you know as a PM if anything's
nice to have means you're never gonna

38
00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:17.800
have it, right?

39
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.434
That's just how that works,
cuz there's always something pressing.

40
00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:28.130
You create plans and roadmaps of
the near future and the short term.

41
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.560
Generally, that manifests as quarters.

42
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.760
I would say most product
managers think in quarters.

43
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.788
In fact,
today is the first day of my quarter for

44
00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:39.610
me, because Snowflake is off by a month.

45
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.930
It's incredibly annoying.

46
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.430
I miss being on the normal quarters of
January and April so on, and so forth.

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.980
But here we are, you align your own
team's goals to the company's goals.

48
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.033
So for me, I work on a Python
open source library, but

49
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:03.630
I still have to ladder up my ideas to
what Snowflake is working on, right?

50
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.590
So it's kind of keeping
those things in alignment.

51
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.780
And then the fifth thing is just whatever
you have to do to get things done.

52
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.346
That's kind of my vision of what a PM is.

53
00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:15.714
And I'm sure if you ask 10 PMs,

54
00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:20.458
you're gonna get 11 different
ideas of what a PM actually does.

55
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:25.307
So, that's my general list, and
I think I'm probably within rounding

56
00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:28.893
errors of what most people
would say of what a PM does.

57
00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:34.303
Questions, concerns, profanities?

58
00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:38.323
&gt;&gt; Have you run into any friction,
and if so,

59
00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:43.685
how did you resolve said
friction when your team's goals

60
00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:49.278
don't align with those of
the organization or peer teams?

61
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:57.120
&gt;&gt; So, those are two very different
things, and it's a good question.

62
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.600
So, let's do the first one which is, what
do I do when my team's goals don't align

63
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.890
with my organization's goals,
usually means I'm wrong, right?

64
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.891
Because you work for that company,

65
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.831
the company has a vision
of where it's trying to go.

66
00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:14.681
And if your team is going this way and
the rest of the company is going that way,

67
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:18.177
you need to have some serious answers
of why you're running this way,

68
00:04:18.177 --> 00:04:20.742
because you don't want
product teams doing that.

69
00:04:20.742 --> 00:04:24.341
This is actually, in my opinion,
one of Stripe's biggest problems and

70
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:26.410
I love working at Stripe.

71
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.530
But it's a little bit of product anarchy
there, which is why they have 17 products,

72
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.270
and they're all awesome, but they
don't work together super well, right?

73
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.573
And it's because they have a bunch of
teams going slightly different directions,

74
00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:40.530
now that they're reading that in,
they're working on it.

75
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.381
That's an acknowledgement that I've
had for a long time, and I think from

76
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:47.020
the outside you probably can't tell Cuz
Stripe is still an awesome product, right?

77
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.616
But it couldn't be better, right?

78
00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:52.054
And I was also in the muck with them and
frustrated and whatever.

79
00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:55.445
You learn to criticize your
own company in special ways.

80
00:04:55.445 --> 00:05:01.564
So, generally, your revision needs to
align with the organizational vision, and

81
00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:07.789
if you don't align with that you shouldn't
help change the organizational vision.

82
00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.305
The second one is what if you don't align
with sister teams, if they are laddering

83
00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:16.823
up to organizational vision and you're
laddering up to organizational vision,

84
00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:21.026
I would argue that generally you
are heading in the same direction, right?

85
00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:23.320
Because you're both adhering to a vision.

86
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.652
You're gonna have nuanced differences
of why you think yours is better or

87
00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:28.650
different than theirs, and that's okay.

88
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.716
You don't have to have perfect alignment
because it takes too long to figure that

89
00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:34.330
out, right?

90
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.185
Where it can come into some conflict
if like, let's say I'm doing, and

91
00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:43.484
this happens to me quite a bit, it's like,
I have this thing that I wanna build, but

92
00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:47.360
I need other teams to build things
that allow me to accomplish that.

93
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.968
And we'll talk a lot about
technical communication.

94
00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.310
This is called influencing
without authority.

95
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.370
Whenever you interview to be
a product manager at a company,

96
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.480
they're gonna ask you questions about
how do you influence without authority?

97
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.170
It's one of the critical
principles of being a good PM.

98
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:14.170
The short answer is like you'd find
a way to frame your idea in their goals.

99
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.997
And so if you can convince them as like,
by helping me, you're helping yourself,

100
00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:21.080
generally your stuff will have
a much easier time of getting done.

101
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.365
But, it's not always possible and
it's gonna vary a lot by company.

102
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:33.607
At Stripe, I had to convince them,
because Stripe is very bottoms up.

103
00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:35.847
And at Microsoft,
I would go convince their boss, and

104
00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:37.810
then their boss would tell him to do it,
right?

105
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.605
Because that's how Microsoft works.

106
00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.857
So, you just kinda have to figure
out what game of thrones or

107
00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:46.645
game of you know rolling off his
chair that you're playing, right?

108
00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:50.366
Yeah, Mark?

109
00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:55.079
&gt;&gt; As a PM, are you generally
taking in the technical roadmap and

110
00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:58.360
marrying it into the feature roadmap?

111
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.280
Or do you have any other ways to negotiate
things like paying down tech debt?

112
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.554
How deep are you into the tech?

113
00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:08.240
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

114
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.010
Me being the nature of that I actually
care how they're implementing it.

115
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.291
I would say a lot of product
managers just kind of say like,

116
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.020
we're working on these things,
I don't care how you do it.

117
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.070
I actually do care cuz I'm interested and
I like technology.

118
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.430
So I work super closely with
my engineering managers.

119
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.700
Like I am glued to my engineering
manager at Snowflake and Mateo's great.

120
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.100
So, our technical and
feature roadmap are the same thing.

121
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.857
And I make sure that we're always very in
touch with where the engineers think that

122
00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:41.507
we are, so that we have enough space to
make sure that we're paying down the tech

123
00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:42.500
debt that we need to.

124
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.400
That's my product management style.

125
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.009
That's just driven by my
interest in how we do things.

126
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.763
We were in the middle of a Kubernetes
migration kind of project, and

127
00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:57.720
I am very in the details of
how are we storing secrets?

128
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.790
Where are the secrets going?

129
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.010
How are we routing traffic?

130
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.170
Because I care, and I like those things,
and I have a lot of experience in those.

131
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.752
You could also equally argue that I
should be more off in feature led,

132
00:08:07.752 --> 00:08:10.990
and trying to,
manage those kinds of things as well.

133
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.224
I'm just going to come down to
what's important to your team, and

134
00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:15.570
what's important to you?

135
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.743
So, some companies will keep separate
feature and technical roadmaps,

136
00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:23.266
engineering managers will
define the technical and

137
00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:25.460
product managers defined the product ones.

138
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.950
I don't like that,
I think they should be the same thing.

139
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.723
So far the companies I've worked at
they have been the same thing, but

140
00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:32.424
it's gonna depend on your company there.

141
00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:39.487
You just lean into your strengths,
I guess.

142
00:08:39.487 --> 00:08:42.980
In me being a part of the technical stuff,
it's me leaning into my strengths.

143
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.414
&gt;&gt; How would you tackle a company
trying to push those product

144
00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:49.999
management responsibilities and
roles on the developers?

145
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.460
&gt;&gt; It's a good question.

146
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.140
It depends.

147
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.383
That's my whole answer to the question.

148
00:09:01.814 --> 00:09:05.331
Sometimes it's just necessary,
like as a tech lead,

149
00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:08.170
I've had to be a products manager before.

150
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.970
That's why I like when I
jumped in these positions.

151
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.585
It felt really familiar to me because
in the absence of a product manager,

152
00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:16.036
it frequently falls to
the engineering manager or

153
00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:18.390
the tech lead to product
manage their product.

154
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.230
It's necessary.

155
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.067
I don't think I can necessarily apologize
for your organization doing that to you,

156
00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:26.176
because if you don't
have a product manager,

157
00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:28.770
someone has to manage the product.

158
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.837
And if you don't wanna do it,
you should make that very known,

159
00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:32.170
make sure that someone else is doing it.

160
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.720
Because otherwise, you're all gonna build
weird things that don't fit together.

161
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.307
I think product managers are necessary.

162
00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:44.870
That might be my own bias showing
here a little bit, right?

163
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.118
So, it's gonna depend on,
does your team have a product manager and

164
00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:50.247
your product manager
is not helping enough?

165
00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:53.740
Is it that your team doesn't have one and
it needs one?

166
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.550
It's gonna depend.

167
00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:02.056
But I do see frequently engineers
do have to act as mini PMs.

168
00:10:02.056 --> 00:10:03.871
I liked it when I was an engineer, and

169
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.343
I think that's why I liked
being a PM eventually.

170
00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:11.212
But I liked having a lot of say in
what we build as opposed to just being

171
00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:12.672
told what to build.
