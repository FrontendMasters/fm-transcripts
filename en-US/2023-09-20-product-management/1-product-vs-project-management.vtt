1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.500
So let's talk about what a PM does
because I get this question a lot.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.650
It's like, okay, you're a product manager,
what the hell does that actually mean?

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.564
And one, I actually don't know, [LAUGH].

4
00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:15.423
It's strongly varies by which company
you're at, and strongly varies by

5
00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:20.940
the context that you're in and
what's necessarily and what's needed.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.481
So I'm gonna give you throw
out some definitions,

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.974
I'm gonna tell you a lot
of things that a PM is not.

8
00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:29.138
But a lot of time the PM just ends
up being glue that holds the team

9
00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:30.169
together, right?

10
00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.533
Your team needs X so you jump in and do X,

11
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:37.343
they need marketing that there has been
times where I've actually jumped in and

12
00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:41.340
helped with the coding sprints
because I can write code.

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510
I've done a lot of things in
the name of product management.

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.410
I've taken sales calls before.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.350
There's tons of stuff
that a PM end up doing.

16
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.810
There was one time I
literally wouldn't worked.

17
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.256
I don't think I can say
the name of the company but

18
00:00:56.256 --> 00:01:00.800
I was embedded at a company for a week
helping them implement my product, right?

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.619
For a company that you've
definitely heard of.

20
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.083
I've done sales calls with Disney.

21
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.421
That was pretty cool.

22
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:10.150
There's all sorts of really
fun things that PMs get to do.

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.360
There's also lots of really
dumb stuff that PMs get to do.

24
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.439
So we'll talk about that too.

25
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.811
So, the first thing I wanted to call
out here is I'm gonna say PM a lot and

26
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.860
it's written a lot here.

27
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.880
And I'm gonna use that in
reference to product manager.

28
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.479
But there's a lot of jobs that
have the initialization PM.

29
00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.250
And I'm just gonna say they have
equal rights to the name PM.

30
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.205
I'm not claiming that in
the name of the product manager.

31
00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:35.669
It's just habit and it's outside.

32
00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:38.485
I don't wanna say product manager
that much it's too many syllables.

33
00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:45.551
That said, do usually see refer to
either program or product managers.

34
00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:49.490
But I'm just disclaiming that so
I don't get angry comments.

35
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.650
I'm still gonna get angry comments, but
at least I tell him like I told you so.

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.840
Okay.

37
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.979
So, throughout this course I will try and
answer what a PM is and what a PM does.

38
00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.337
But right now we're gonna go into
find some other jobs first so

39
00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:06.900
that we can kind of bound what I
think a product manager should be.

40
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.560
So like I said before,
this varies so much by company.

41
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.487
What a PM at Google does is extremely
different than what a PM at Apple does,

42
00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:22.765
and it's extremely different than what
a PM at Facebook and Microsoft and

43
00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:24.230
all those companies do.

44
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.510
So, it's extremely contextual to
the company, and even to the position.

45
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.646
PM is a Microsoft.

46
00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:34.100
I have obviously worked there, so
I have a lot of experience there.

47
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.339
What they do in one division of
Microsoft is extremely different

48
00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.340
from a different division.

49
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.908
So let's go through some other job titles,
some other PM job titles and

50
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:45.690
talk about what they do, and

51
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.550
hopefully that'll illuminate a little
bit what a product manager might do.

52
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.314
So the first obvious one
is project manager, and

53
00:02:54.314 --> 00:02:57.420
this is the job that I
hate getting called.

54
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.568
They're extremely important, and
I'm very happy it's not my job.

55
00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:05.746
But when people are like, hey, Brian,
you're a project manager, I'm like,

56
00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.847
I don't want to be called that, [LAUGH].

57
00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:11.400
And it's not that I have anything
against PMs or against project managers.

58
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.520
I think they're extremely important.

59
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.499
I just don't wanna do that job.

60
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.313
So a project manager is someone
that drives alignment in

61
00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:20.730
a huge organization by process, right?

62
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.780
So they're the ones that
are managing sprints.

63
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.760
They're the ones that are going
through and managing tickets.

64
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.670
They're the ones doing reports on,
we closed this many tickets this week.

65
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.320
We have this developer velocity.

66
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.650
You can call them gyro jockeys.

67
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.470
That's what I do, [LAUGH].

68
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.220
They are very important, but
it's very process oriented.

69
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.746
It's very much in the mechanics
of who's assigned what ticket,

70
00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.040
when are they going to complete it.

71
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.960
They keep teams on task, on timelines.

72
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.410
They're frequently Scrum Masters and
agile certified, and it's not what I do.

73
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.410
And again, they're important.

74
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.630
I'm happy that to work with them.

75
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.308
But if I had to do that job, I just
wouldn't be happy one because I'm not good

76
00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:07.920
at it and two is I'm just not
a very processed person right.

77
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.967
Now that being said,

78
00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:12.640
particularly when your team doesn't
have a designated project manager.

79
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.340
The product manager frequently ends up
taking on a lot of these responsibilities.

80
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.378
That's snowflake.

81
00:04:17.378 --> 00:04:21.994
That's a big part of my responsibilities
is some project management because

82
00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:26.112
we don't have enough project managers
to share around Snowflake and

83
00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:28.252
my team doesn't get access to one.

84
00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:32.700
But even then, I kinda split that
with my engineering manager, right?

85
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.982
So it's not just me being
total project manager,

86
00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:36.950
we kinda split it across multiple people.

87
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.424
And you'll find that this is actually
a common thing with product managers is,

88
00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:44.828
your team will need some role
that doesn't exist yet, and so

89
00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:47.800
the product manager will
kinda end up filling that.

90
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.959
This is what I'm talking about when the
product manager is the glue of the team.

91
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.000
I've had to do designs before and
I'm not a designer.

92
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.450
There's stuff like that.

93
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.873
So project managers are critical in
large companies because you have so

94
00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:05.981
many different teams moving in different
directions, and the project managers kind

95
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:09.927
of keep them moving and aligned is
&gt;&gt; Project manager synonymous with

96
00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:11.349
delivery manager?

97
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:18.490
&gt;&gt; So when I hear delivery manager,
I equate that with release manager.

98
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.840
That's the position that I
worked with at Microsoft.

99
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.860
It wasn't equivalent at Microsoft.

100
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.353
So the release manager basically is like,
you have dot NET,

101
00:05:28.353 --> 00:05:31.503
this massive project that
has these big releases, and

102
00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:35.630
they're the kinda ones deciding,
like, what makes this really use?

103
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.630
When is it gonna go out?

104
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.290
How are we gonna manage that going out?

105
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.372
And the project manager was kinda the
person that was managing all the sprints

106
00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:42.340
to get there.

107
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.744
So you'd kinda have those two positions
working closely together to figure out

108
00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:48.892
when work was gonna be delivered and
when they can be released together and

109
00:05:48.892 --> 00:05:49.930
those kinds of things.

110
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.539
I could see at maybe a smaller company
those being the same position, but for

111
00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:04.420
me in that one experience, it's the only
release manager I've ever worked with.

112
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.326
It was not the same position.

113
00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:08.540
&gt;&gt; Kinda drawing the spaces.

114
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.225
It seems to me anyway, that when you're
trying to draw a line between project

115
00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:17.130
product management and
the other concerns that revolve there.

116
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.925
Product management is more
concerned with a longer

117
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:26.820
timeline in general project management.

118
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.135
I think that you already said
this is moving downfield, but

119
00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:36.315
the strategy of that movement is
largely on the product side because you

120
00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:42.379
project management is generally not tasked
with scoping timelines on long terms.

121
00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.200
Or at least outside of
specific units of work.

122
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.040
&gt;&gt; I think you're getting to the what I
hope to arrive to which is, the project

123
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.370
manager is more concerned with the
mechanics of what is getting done when,

124
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.220
and the product manager is only concerned
with like, what are we building?

125
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.092
What things are we gonna build one, and

126
00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:10.950
then you kind of work with like
one of those things and to go out.

127
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.022
And so I always framed my product
management and it's like,

128
00:07:13.022 --> 00:07:13.800
what are we doing now?

129
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.677
What are we doing soon?

130
00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:16.730
What are we doing later, right?

131
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.199
And so you're right,
we have that longer-term arc,

132
00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.710
longer-term vision strategy.

133
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.810
I'm literally writing a strategy doc
right now for my organization, right?

134
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.140
So I end up writing
a lot of strategy docs.

135
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.555
It's more concerned with what are we
gonna build for our people, or for

136
00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:34.080
our users that we're concerned with.

137
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.004
Yeah, I think you're right.
