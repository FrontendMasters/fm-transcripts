1
00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:04.673
Product, so we've talked a lot about
everything around being a product manager,

2
00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:06.879
how to be an effective product manager.

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.945
Now, I'm actually gonna talk
about the product portion of it.

4
00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:13.213
As you can see,
a lot of product management, I don't know,

5
00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.972
25% of it is actually the product, and
75% about it is talking about the product.

6
00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:21.859
It's just the nature of moving
organizations together.

7
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.394
And if you're at a startup,
it might be the opposite way.

8
00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:28.690
It's probably 75% product and
25% getting people on the same page.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.319
You can see that I'm very colored by
the perspective of working in large

10
00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.414
corporations, where most of
my job is just communicating.

11
00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.091
But I think this is the fun part.

12
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:40.763
It's also the most intuitive part.

13
00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:46.162
I imagine many of you as engineers,
QA engineers, designers, project managers,

14
00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.875
operations people, all those kind of
people, you probably have a strong

15
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:55.531
sense of your product or product senses
as the industry likes to call it.

16
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.935
And so I don't wanna spend a bunch of time
trying to explain to you to have product

17
00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.252
sense when most of you probably
are into a lot of this stuff.

18
00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:07.719
Also, I just wouldn't know how to
explain it to you as well, right?

19
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:16.380
But let me give you some of my processes
that I use to get to good product.

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.904
So the first one is user stories.

21
00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:24.561
And I used to kinda hate this term,
but now, I realize that I use it

22
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:29.412
everywhere in my head, and so
it actually is a pretty useful thing.

23
00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:34.274
So this is forcing you to flip the way
that you're thinking about a product.

24
00:01:34.274 --> 00:01:39.442
Rather than saying,
as a product manager at Microsoft,

25
00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:44.623
I want you to use Office,
right, that's my user story.

26
00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:47.258
That's very based on me and
my company, and

27
00:01:47.258 --> 00:01:50.403
it's not at all how you
should be a product manager.

28
00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:56.050
You should be thinking about
this as a professional,

29
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.320
I need to write memos, right?

30
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.074
And you think about it, I'm a user,
I'm a particular type of persona, and

31
00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:06.619
I have this particular type of problem.

32
00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.173
That is a user story.

33
00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:14.212
It typically comes in the shape of,
as a blank, I need to blank, right?

34
00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:17.645
When you're starting to write
product specs, or tasks, or

35
00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:21.634
whatever you wanna think about,
write down your user stories first.

36
00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:24.626
If you write down your user story first,

37
00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:28.854
that forces you to be grounded
in a user's perspective.

38
00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:33.688
And instead of trying to seek, what am
I trying to get you to do, you will

39
00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:38.859
think about it as, what can I do so
that my user can accomplish their intent?

40
00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.282
I think you'll end up with
a much better product.

41
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.927
So as much as you can specify what
type of user they are, a customer,

42
00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:55.354
a shopper, an admin, a moderator,
an athlete, a chef, whatever, right?

43
00:02:55.354 --> 00:02:59.686
As a student of Frontend Masters, I wanna
learn how to be a better developer, right?

44
00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:03.002
Or as just someone that's
learning in the industry, right,

45
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.807
I wanna learn how to be
a better Frontend developer,

46
00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:10.049
would be a kind of a higher level of
Frontend Masters user story, for example.

47
00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:13.950
So and again,

48
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.564
I'm just gonna invite you to be careful
that these are just not reframing.

49
00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.039
Don't work backwards from
what you want them to do.

50
00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.342
I'm exactly trying to get you
to work forwards, not backwards.

51
00:03:23.342 --> 00:03:25.757
So as a worker with frequent users,

52
00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:29.468
I want to be able to use
the metaverse to take meetings.

53
00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:33.446
I feel like that's the user story
behind Facebook's metaverse.

54
00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:38.572
They have this thing,
the metaverse, and they're trying

55
00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:43.596
to work you into being in
the metaverse instead of thinking

56
00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:49.667
about our users have a problem and
the metaverse solves that, right?

57
00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:53.364
So yeah, as a worker who takes frequent
meetings, I want to have a more personal

58
00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:56.133
experience with my co-workers
despite a remote culture.

59
00:03:56.133 --> 00:04:01.293
Would probably be a closer user
story that might be better for

60
00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:03.631
Facebook, I don't know.

61
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:05.371
As you can see,
I'm not a big fan of the metaverse.

62
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:11.474
[LAUGH] So
think about that story a little bit.

63
00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:16.074
As a worker who takes frequent meetings,
I want to have a more personal experience

64
00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.750
with my co-workers
despite a remote culture.

65
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.325
One, do you think that's true?

66
00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:26.450
Do you think that everyone wants
to have personal experiences

67
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.758
with their co-workers?

68
00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:30.174
I'm gonna say, not everybody.

69
00:04:30.174 --> 00:04:32.463
Some people do, some people won't.

70
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:35.159
The question is what's the mix of that?

71
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.254
So as a product manager,
it forces you to go and

72
00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:43.144
then figure out how true
is this user story?

73
00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:47.098
I'm perfectly happy having a professional
relationship over Zoom, and

74
00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:51.640
I don't need anything more professional
than that or more personal than that, so.

75
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.336
And I don't think the metaverse
solves that, personally.

76
00:04:55.336 --> 00:05:00.585
But that's my biggest criticism of
the metaverse is it feels like a product

77
00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:05.334
in search for a problem to solve,
as opposed to here's a problem and

78
00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:08.185
we made a product to solve that problem.

79
00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:11.410
Do we see kinda see why I like
phrasing things as user stories?

80
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.938
It forces you to make a true,

81
00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:16.263
false statements that I can prove
users do have this problem.

82
00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:18.772
Users don't have this problem,
but in any case,

83
00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:21.952
I'm very user grounded in things
that I end up thinking about.

84
00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:24.232
Your users can be internal, by the way.

85
00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:28.829
If I'm an infrastructure team,
as a product engineer,

86
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:33.825
I want to be able to deploy my
infrastructure faster, right?

87
00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:35.918
And then you can go talk to your
product engineers like, hey,

88
00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.260
do you wanna deploy your stuff faster?

89
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.023
Of course, they're gonna say that,
but how much of a problem is that for

90
00:05:41.023 --> 00:05:43.320
you is probably a better
way to phrase that.

91
00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:50.535
Yeah, we as product managers, as you may
or may not believe, are mere mortals and

92
00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.405
we don't have all the answers.

93
00:05:55.436 --> 00:06:00.157
We frequently make guesses and
they're wrong.

94
00:06:00.157 --> 00:06:03.882
And we make bets that don't come
up the way that we want them to.

95
00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:07.802
Our product sense, right,
can intuit some of the answers, but

96
00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:10.059
a lot of them we're gonna get wrong.

97
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.520
That's why it's good to
phrase these things upfront,

98
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.305
write down all of our assumptions about
our users and the problems they have,

99
00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:20.013
and then go validate that.

100
00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:24.261
So put enter research.

101
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:28.320
Once you have all of your user stories
written down, my user has this problem or

102
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.580
it's like, as this user,
I have this problem, as this user,

103
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.708
I have this problem.

104
00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:35.953
This is where you wanna go talk to
your users and figure out like, hey,

105
00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:37.383
I think you have this problem.

106
00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:39.326
Do you have this problem?

107
00:06:39.326 --> 00:06:42.862
And actually, the better way
to phrase that is, hey, user,

108
00:06:42.862 --> 00:06:44.841
what kind of problems do you have?

109
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.341
And what would you expect a problem to do?

110
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:51.158
And then see if your guesses line
up with what your users say.

111
00:06:51.158 --> 00:06:55.794
Cuz typically, if you say, hey,
user, do you want free thing?

112
00:06:55.794 --> 00:07:00.021
And they'll say, hey, product manager,
give me free thing and then later,

113
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.567
they'll just never use it.

114
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:06.194
One thing you need to do when you have
all of your user stories written down as

115
00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:09.951
a Nike user, I'm not finding
all of my products that I want.

116
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.492
So I would need to be, or I want to be
recommended products to buy, I don't know,

117
00:07:13.492 --> 00:07:14.545
that might not be true.

118
00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:18.273
But actually, the problem would probably
be a pretty good one to research, right?

119
00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:22.448
So there's your user study or user story,
and then you should go do some sort of

120
00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:26.907
study to figure out if that's true, and
there's a bunch of ways to validate this.

121
00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:32.554
You can just do kind of passive ways
of look at forums like Reddit, Twitter,

122
00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:37.606
all of those, Stack Overflow,
if you're doing technical stuff.

123
00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:41.164
Wherever your users congregate,
go look there and

124
00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:44.893
read a bunch of the posts,
see if those are coming up.

125
00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:47.115
You could make your own posts like, hey,

126
00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:49.667
I'm a PM at Nike,
what do you think about this?

127
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.511
We at Streamlit have forums,
which is super useful.

128
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:55.891
We just pop in there and say,
hey, Streamlit forum users,

129
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:58.468
what do you think about
something like this?

130
00:07:58.468 --> 00:08:01.716
And we will get very strong
feedback of like, that's very dumb,

131
00:08:01.716 --> 00:08:05.340
you shouldn't do that, or that's great,
we would actually use that.

132
00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:14.176
A word of caution, UX research is an art.

133
00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:18.117
And there's a reason why
it's a whole degree for

134
00:08:18.117 --> 00:08:22.065
someone to go get a research
kind of background.

135
00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:24.470
Because if you phrase
questions the wrong way,

136
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.584
you strongly bias your answers, right?

137
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:32.008
So if I say, hey, if I did this for
you, would it solve your problem?

138
00:08:32.008 --> 00:08:35.201
A lot of times, no matter what this is,
people are like, yeah,

139
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:39.064
if you do something for me, I like that,
so therefore, yes, do that for me.

140
00:08:39.064 --> 00:08:42.991
And you'll bias your results
towards what you're asking.

141
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:46.893
It's much better to phrase those questions
of what problems do you have, and

142
00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.583
how do you currently solve them?

143
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:51.167
And what do you wish you
had to solve them, right?

144
00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:54.217
So that you're letting the user kind
of come up with their own answers and

145
00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:56.080
see if it correlates to what you're doing.

146
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.119
Go all the way down that pathway, and then
kind off lightly lead them into, well,

147
00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:06.185
what about a solution similar to this, so
you can kind of get a more direct answer.

148
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:08.053
I'm not the best at it.

149
00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:11.057
I always work with a UX researcher
whenever I'm doing any of these things.

150
00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:16.174
So just be cautious that
phrasing becomes critical

151
00:09:16.174 --> 00:09:21.417
on the surveys and
on forum posts and in interviews.

152
00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:26.080
So before you get too far
into your user stories,

153
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.761
validate the problem,
validate the solution.

154
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:35.409
And then, you come up with
an experiment that you can run, right?

155
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:42.015
So let's say you've validated that,
now you have a user study.

156
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:46.339
And you'll come up with 30 user studies,
or sorry, user studies,

157
00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:48.771
I keep saying studies, user stories.

158
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:50.920
At this point,
which of them do you work on?

159
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.003
Well, this is an exercise
in prioritization, and

160
00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:58.003
there's a whole section on it coming
in here in just a little bit.

161
00:09:58.003 --> 00:10:02.084
So hold on that thought for just a second.

162
00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:06.548
Generally, when I have a validated
user story, I will generally try and

163
00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:09.117
turn that into some sort of product spec.

164
00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:13.975
Even if I'm not going to immediately work
on it, even if it's just kind of a bare

165
00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:17.964
bones product spec, but I'll say,
we validated this problem,

166
00:10:17.964 --> 00:10:22.336
we validated a solution to it, and
we have this hypothesis about this.

167
00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:26.600
That if we do this,
that we will solve this problem, or

168
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.565
improve this metric, or capture this
kind of user, those kinds of things.

169
00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.178
Those product specs become useful even
if you don't work on them right away.

170
00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:38.348
They are like,
you'll get two quarters down the line and

171
00:10:38.348 --> 00:10:41.927
you'll realize,
this is actually a much bigger problem.

172
00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:44.855
Good thing we already did
a bunch of research on this and

173
00:10:44.855 --> 00:10:49.388
we already have a bare bones starter spec
for this, you kind of save that knowledge.

174
00:10:49.388 --> 00:10:55.073
So in any case, keep your users in mind,
that's my plea to you.

175
00:10:55.073 --> 00:10:57.857
I think that makes
the best product manager.

176
00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:02.522
I think that alone will give you a leg
up on a lot of other products managers.

177
00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:07.225
I do think your product specs and
your tasks that you're gonna work on for

178
00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:11.928
a quarter, or whatever your unit of
work is, should typically either be

179
00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:16.630
backed one to one with a user story, or
at least ladder up into a user story

180
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.903
that you have acknowledged as
a company that is important to you.

181
00:11:20.903 --> 00:11:23.032
Your product should solve problems.

182
00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:24.857
I think, that's basically what I'm saying.

183
00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:31.953
So when you're validating feedback and
turning that into a user story,

184
00:11:31.953 --> 00:11:38.020
be careful about phrasing your
user stories with solutions.

185
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.317
And I'm trying to think of
a good example of a way for me,

186
00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:47.081
as a power user, I want this feature,
it's a bad user story.

187
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.929
What you should look to is,
why do they want that feature?

188
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:53.323
What problem are they
solving with feature, right?

189
00:11:53.323 --> 00:11:58.487
What you wanna phrase that user story as
is, a power user, I have this problem.

190
00:11:58.487 --> 00:12:01.907
And then your solution is the proposed,
I want this feature, but

191
00:12:01.907 --> 00:12:05.031
you should also look at the other
features in there as well.

192
00:12:05.031 --> 00:12:07.255
When they're telling you, I want feature,

193
00:12:07.255 --> 00:12:09.900
what they're telling you
is I have problem, right?

194
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.808
And you wanna get to
the core of the problem, and

195
00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:15.517
then you wanna look at
all of the solutions.

196
00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:17.612
This has happened to me a lot in VS Code,

197
00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:21.053
because you have a lot of very
different personas using VS Code.

198
00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:24.471
You have everyone from accountants
to English teachers to developers,

199
00:12:24.471 --> 00:12:27.450
they're all using VS Code,
because it's a very useful tool.

200
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.538
And they will tell you,
I want this because Excel has it.

201
00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:35.443
It's like, no, you actually just want to,
you don't wanna have some fancy

202
00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:38.925
CSV processing,
you just wanna get to Excel, right?

203
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.743
And so when we build all these CSV
things for them, they're like, well,

204
00:12:42.743 --> 00:12:44.662
this is dumb, why would I stay in VS?

205
00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.154
Because I don't know,
you asked for it, right?

206
00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:49.130
It's like, well, I actually just
wanted to get this into Excel.

207
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.667
It's like,
why didn't you tell me that, right?

208
00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.119
And so when we made an Explore to
Excel button, all of a sudden,

209
00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:57.151
all of that feedback just went away.

210
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.432
So listen to your users and

211
00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:04.307
be very judicious of how you
interpret their feedback,

212
00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:09.714
because they will tell you
things that's actually not true.

213
00:13:09.714 --> 00:13:11.338
But there's always a core of it,

214
00:13:11.338 --> 00:13:14.413
there's always a reason why
they're telling you that thing.

215
00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:18.375
In which case it's like, I have a problem
and they think they know the answer,

216
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:22.658
when in reality they have no more ability
to solve their problem than you do, right?
