00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
So I have three little examples here.

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.519
I give you a little context sharing,
a little bit.

3
00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.321
Not too much, I said less.

4
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:12.617
One of these is a technical project.

5
00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:15.091
So convincing your company to
switch to frontend frameworks.

6
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:18.450
So you're pitching moving
from Backbone to Solid.js.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.676
Those are JavaScript frameworks, I don't
actually care if you know what they are.

8
00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:24.397
One is much older, one is much newer.

9
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:26.740
Solid is very cool if you
haven't played with it.

10
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.151
So you're pitching this to
the VP of product, the CEO, and

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.190
the VP of engineering of
a 5,000-person engineering company.

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.270
And this is the pitch to convince
them to change frameworks.

13
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.190
I gave them some reasons there,
and I wrote a pitch here.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.587
And what I want you to do, either
mentally or preferred writing it down,

15
00:00:44.587 --> 00:00:48.430
cuz writing it down will help you
drive understanding, I promise.

16
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.363
Write down what's wrong with this
approach, and if you have time,

17
00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:54.850
rewrite it to be something better, okay?

18
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.360
Another pitch here is you're gonna
pitch implementing a A/B testing tool.

19
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.317
If you're not familiar
with what A/B testing is,

20
00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:05.690
is you show one user one experience.

21
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
So let's say this is signing up for
Netflix.

22
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.733
And this one says, sign up now.

23
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.149
And you're pitching experience B, or

24
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.599
you're showing them to
another demographic of users.

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.260
Sign up flow B, which says click here for
free Netflix, I don't know,

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.530
something like that.

27
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.540
And you show them to 50% of your users
sees one, 50% of your users sees another.

28
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.584
And then now,
because it's random sampling,

29
00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:34.110
you can prove this one actually
works better than this one, right?

30
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.115
That's an A/B testing tool.

31
00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:40.076
So the people you're sending to this memo
are the engineers who are going to be

32
00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.118
actually working on it.

33
00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:43.122
And this is for
them to gain enough context and

34
00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.880
ask questions to be part
of your project kickoff.

35
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.860
Here's your goals.

36
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.940
Here's the pitch.

37
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.480
Same thing.

38
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.630
What's wrong with this approach?

39
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.614
How could you make it better, Okay?

40
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.065
And last one here, you are adding a social
share button to a classifieds app.

41
00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:02.580
A classifieds would be like Craigslist,
right?

42
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.868
You're convincing a group of stakeholders,
mixed engineers, product managers, and

43
00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:10.528
designers that you want them to pick your
design of a social share button over

44
00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:13.930
another one proposed by
a third-party design agency.

45
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.006
So this is gonna be an email
where the people weigh in,

46
00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:19.090
decide whether they're gonna
choose your design or not.

47
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.520
So here's the primary reasons for
doing that.

48
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.320
Here's your pitch.

49
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.820
And, [LAUGH] first of all,
I hate myself for writing that.

50
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.390
Secondly, please identify with
what is wrong with it and

51
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.628
how you can make it better.
