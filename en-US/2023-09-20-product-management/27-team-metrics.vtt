00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.693
So now that you're armed with a little
bit of stats, a little bit of graphs,

2
00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:05.090
let's talk about metrics.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.210
And metrics are central to being a good
products manager because it's evidence.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.150
It's evidence that you are going
in the right direction.

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.954
It's evidence you're going
in the wrong direction.

6
00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.668
It's a massive tool for

7
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:25.239
you to describe success,
to describe failure.

8
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.586
It's you measuring and

9
00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:30.700
being a little bit more scientific
about your approach to your product.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.179
So first of all, what is success and
what is failure?

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.392
I hope that your organization and
your team has some metrics to describe,

12
00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:46.880
we are trying to affect these metrics.

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.080
These are core to our mission, and
here's how we are measuring that.

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.767
And we are hoping to affect these other
metrics that we are hoping they go down,

15
00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:58.460
or up, or whatever those are.

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.770
So let's talk about that.

17
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.147
But generally all of your actions,
and I think that's fair to say,

18
00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:09.030
all of your actions should affect
your metrics in some capacity.

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.670
And if they are not
affecting your metrics,

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.100
you better justify that to yourself.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.188
And that usually means, I need to change
what metrics I'm looking at if I'm doing

22
00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:16.815
things that are not affecting my metrics.

23
00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:20.375
Because obviously I care about
something that's not measured, and

24
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.530
I should measure the things I care about.

25
00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.760
So let's talk a little bit about team and
organization metrics.

26
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.512
Again, I've said this several times, but
this is actually now the most important

27
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.714
thing I'm about to teach in this class is,
if your company and

28
00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:43.287
your team don't have North Star metrics or
most important metrics,

29
00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:47.320
which a lot of people call North Star
because it's the guiding star, right?

30
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.789
If they don't have top-level metrics,
go make them.

31
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.592
If you do nothing else, that'll be the
most important thing that you've done for

32
00:01:57.592 --> 00:01:58.600
your company, period.

33
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.890
And the way you figure out is,
what are my North Star metrics?

34
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.740
The first thing you look at is,
what's your mission?

35
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.210
What's your charter?

36
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.520
What's your team's vision?

37
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.984
If you have any sort of documents or
pages that describe,

38
00:02:11.984 --> 00:02:13.799
my company cares about this.

39
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.838
Usually that's gonna be something like,
hey, we're trying to,

40
00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:25.400
the Frontend Masters mantra is to educate
more people more deeply, am I close?

41
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.410
I'm close, right?

42
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.060
So you hear in that statement right there,
more people,

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.220
that's sign ups,
that's retention of users, right?

44
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.700
Those two things together, and
then more deeply is depth of engagement.

45
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.280
How much are you watching this?

46
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.810
How much are you engaging
with the platform?

47
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.060
How much are you engaging with
other people in your community?

48
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.522
There I just defined at
least some of the KPIs

49
00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:53.090
that Frontend Masters cares about, right?

50
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.634
That's a fairly straightforward
exercise for you to think.

51
00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.464
It's like, okay,
what does my company actually care about?

52
00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:02.866
And if your mission statement doesn't
describe something like that,

53
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.423
you probably need to change
your mission statement.

54
00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:11.005
Because it should have, here's the change
I'm hoping to affect in society, right?

55
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:15.350
Here's the demographic of people
that I'm trying to get to, and

56
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.195
here's what we're trying to offer them.

57
00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:24.454
So this is an interesting kind of exercise
to pick your favorite company and

58
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.299
go over what you think that
their core metrics would be.

59
00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:35.194
And when I say core metrics, or
top-level metrics, or North star metrics,

60
00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.730
synonyms of the same thing.

61
00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:44.330
So yeah, let's look at Netflix.

62
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.259
What do you think
Netflix's top metrics are?

63
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.270
Sign ups, just more people
on the platform is goodness.

64
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.610
Retention, are they staying
there month-over-month?

65
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.420
Revenue, things that you can get
people from lower tiers of Netflix and

66
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.829
the ad-supported ones into the higher
level ones generally is a good thing.

67
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.149
Watch hours, or depth of engagements,
how much are they watching the shows?

68
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.774
And that's probably pretty
close to most of their what?

69
00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:19.478
I would imagine they
probably have one around,

70
00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:23.479
actually, I know exactly what they
have because I used to work there.

71
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.430
But they have one where they prefer
Netflix shows over other shows, right?

72
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.928
Cuz they wanna justify their investment in

73
00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:35.620
personal content that keeps
people on Netflix, right?

74
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.875
You sign up for Netflix to watch,
Orange is the New Black or

75
00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.660
Stranger Things, right?

76
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.325
And that keeps you from signing up for

77
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:44.660
Hulu because you can't
get that stuff on Hulu.

78
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.930
But if you're signing up to watch Friends,
that might move tomorrow to Hulu, right?

79
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.770
So that's kind of why
they track that as well.

80
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.458
But generally, these are the things.

81
00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:55.380
And I imagine now they have games, right?

82
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.950
So they're probably gonna
have something around games.

83
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.810
And they have stuff for ads, right?

84
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.769
That's new to me.

85
00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.562
I don't know how they handle that
as one of their top level metrics.

86
00:05:05.562 --> 00:05:09.090
But probably people watching ads
successfully is probably another metric in

87
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.801
there as well.

88
00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:16.390
Again, you could probably just roll
that up into revenue though, so.

89
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.110
And gaming could probably just
be rolled up into retention.

90
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.590
So these are the metrics that every
team inside of Netflix should

91
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.380
be contributing to in some fashion.

92
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.324
So I worked on the sign up process across
web and TV, and Windows Phone, fun fact.

93
00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:45.999
What do you think that
team's charter metrics are?

94
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.707
Sign ups, that's the North Star metric of
that team cuz it's the sign up process.

95
00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:57.346
Time to sign up, generally if a user lands
on the site with the intent to sign up,

96
00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:01.086
we wanna get them from zero to sign
up as quickly as possible, and

97
00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.640
as usefully as possible.

98
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.010
Bounce rate, this is a funnel, right?

99
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.556
So if you go on this page and
you get to the third page and

100
00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:12.800
you bounce off of that page,
that's not good.

101
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.960
And then 30 day retention.

102
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.650
We don't wanna sign up people that
are actually just gonna bounce off, right?

103
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.170
So that was another thing that
we tracked pretty closely.

104
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.589
But notice all of these,
100% of these ladder up,

105
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.800
when I say ladder up, I just basically
mean that they feed into, right?

106
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.610
All of these ladder up into
organizational metrics.

107
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.730
That should always be the case.

108
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.102
If your team is working on something that
doesn't ladder up into your organization's

109
00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:48.070
goals, means you're going this way and
they're going that way, and why, right?

110
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.989
Now you might say, well, I'm working on
a product that's a skunk works product or

111
00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:56.167
project, or it's a big bet,
or blah, blah, blah.

112
00:06:56.167 --> 00:07:01.380
You should figure out a way that that fits
into your company's organization somehow.

113
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.240
Either your organization is going to add
a new top-level metric that your skunk

114
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.501
works project is gonna
feed into eventually.

115
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:10.669
Or you should figure out, okay,
eventually I'm doing this and

116
00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:14.366
it's gonna make our project more
compelling so more people will sign up for

117
00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:17.959
it or will retain users better,
blah, blah, blah, things like that.

118
00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.339
Okay, any questions about team or
organizational metrics?

119
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.800
&gt;&gt; What's your opinion on
depth of metric measurement?

120
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.170
And sometimes this is said above you,
but, [COUGH] my information science

121
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.466
background said, I don't say if I were
advising the C suite, I would say

122
00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:46.402
these metrics are incomplete because we
don't have things like characterization

123
00:07:46.402 --> 00:07:51.350
of the first 30 days, which would be
trivially accessible on a platform.

124
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.839
You could be kind of a great example.

125
00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:58.314
Did you sign up to watch the new show,
binge it, and then not sign up, right?

126
00:07:58.314 --> 00:08:03.300
In which case we know why, or
was it you poked around and petered out?

127
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.784
Those kinds of things might be useful, but

128
00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:08.962
that is really what does
the organization wanna hear?

129
00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:13.926
So how do you, and I know product would
be very much involved in these decisions,

130
00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:18.673
how do you decide where that lower bound
of information collection needs to?

131
00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:20.110
&gt;&gt; Right, no,
I think it's a good question.

132
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.562
So, first of all, Netflix very much cares
about your first 30 days on Netflix

133
00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:30.586
because it basically determines what
your lifetime value is to Netflix.

134
00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:35.024
What you do in the first
30 days characterizes down,

135
00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:38.689
how long you're gonna
stay on the platform,

136
00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:42.173
your churn rate, all those kinda things.

137
00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:44.787
So there are some
organizations that would say,

138
00:08:44.787 --> 00:08:49.840
we're gonna put that as a top level metric
and every team should care about this.

139
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.670
I, at least at the time, we basically
said that that just is retention.

140
00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.226
And if you have a great first 30 days,
you're gonna affect both retention and

141
00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:00.839
revenue.

142
00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:06.040
I think lifetime value actually was a
top-level metric on some of these as well.

143
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.057
But arguably that's retention and
revenue kind of just combined, right?

144
00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:16.013
So the way that I think about it is,
all of these kind of more advanced metrics

145
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:19.653
which I care about,
we should definitely measure, and

146
00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:25.570
the teams working on those things should
absolutely have those as team metrics.

147
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.180
But they should all somehow ladder up
into one or multiple of these, right?

148
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.827
So it should just basically be like,
if I affect what people do in the first 30

149
00:09:33.827 --> 00:09:37.650
days, I'm definitely gonna affect
these other metrics, right?

150
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.557
And so that's sort of correlation where
there's I can justify this by this just

151
00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:46.363
being an advanced metric of this,
or a derivative of this, or

152
00:09:46.363 --> 00:09:49.700
this is just this further down the line.

153
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.291
And if I'm doing something that this is
important, and it does not affect one of

154
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:56.310
these metrics, you should change
your organizational metrics.

155
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.576
That's, that opinion, and

156
00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:04.750
I think other people would have
different approaches to that.

157
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.445
Then I'm right.

158
00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:08.960
[LAUGH] I don't know.

159
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.920
That conceptually makes sense to me.

160
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.720
That's the way that I've
worked through my career.
