1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.768
I'm gonna talk about
why I like being a PM.

2
00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.366
Hopefully I've sufficiently
scared everybody now.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.407
It's, well, maybe PMing sucks,
maybe it does, I don't know.

4
00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.041
[LAUGH] I'm still finding out.

5
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.199
But let me tell you what I do like.

6
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.542
I like determining the what
of what we work on.

7
00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.785
So I saw this quite a bit at Netflix.

8
00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.367
Netflix does a really good job of getting
their engineers involved early in projects

9
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.141
where the engineer actually gets
to say how we're gonna build and

10
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:25.264
what we're gonna build.

11
00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.936
And that was really exciting to me.

12
00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:31.373
At Reddit, I kind of just determined
everything that we were gonna work on,

13
00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:34.216
cuz I didn't have a PM, and
I also didn't have a designer, and

14
00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.634
I was employee 29 at Reddit.

15
00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:40.510
So, that was kind of all of it all in one.

16
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.817
But I liked that Netflix
helped me in a big corporate

17
00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:49.837
environment get to be able to
say what we're gonna work on.

18
00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:53.822
And I've been the code monkey before
where they basically say, all right,

19
00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:55.635
code monkey, go do that, right?

20
00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.725
It's fun too, cuz I like writing code.

21
00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.493
I just enjoyed the acts of writing code.

22
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:04.853
But I also got really into, what are we
gonna build, why are we building this,

23
00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:06.518
who are we gonna build it for?

24
00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:10.624
One of my favorites experiences at Netflix
is how much UX research we got to do.

25
00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:13.102
And I actually got to go watch
people use my product and

26
00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:15.977
then we got to adjust our product
based on customer feedback.

27
00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:19.342
I really like this, right?

28
00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:22.416
And so that's one part about
being a PM that I like,

29
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.498
is that now I get to call the shots.

30
00:01:24.498 --> 00:01:30.398
For the most part I am the product
owner of my organization and

31
00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:35.269
it's not I get to dictate
to them you must do this.

32
00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:37.202
But I get to organize everything and

33
00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:41.270
I get to insert my opinions and my own
flavor and my own strategy on all that.

34
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.486
And that's my favorite part of
being a PM is determining the what.

35
00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:52.773
It is people, people, people so
you get to, that's gonna get distracting,

36
00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:57.117
so I'm gonna scroll up a little bit,
it's people all the time.

37
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.087
It's who you work with, what they're
working on, who you're building it for.

38
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:05.136
We're gonna talk a lot about users
throughout all this course because being

39
00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:09.056
a PM means being in tune with what your
users are doing and what they want and

40
00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:12.306
what they're failing with and
what the problems they have.

41
00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:15.620
It's a very empathetic position.

42
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.399
And if you're not interested in being
empathetic both on solving business

43
00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:28.110
problem and just an emotional level of how
do people respond to what you're building.

44
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.088
I like it, that's one of my favorite parts
about being a PM is you get to focus on

45
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:33.191
people all the time.

46
00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:39.652
This kind of sounds weird,
but I like being wrong.

47
00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:42.125
Going back to that Netflix example,

48
00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.792
I remember the very first time
I went into that UX lab and

49
00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:50.837
I got to watch someone use my product and
I had built this really cool thing.

50
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.797
I remember it was the first time I ever
shipped Redux, which probably has nothing

51
00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:58.129
to do with this course,
it's just something that stands out to me.

52
00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.697
And I was so excited about the technology
that I had used to build this.

53
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:04.525
And it was this really cool experience.

54
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:08.270
I had this anticipation that they're gonna
do this, then this, then this, then this.

55
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.026
And I watched them and the person clicked
on it and then it's, what is this?

56
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.902
I don't understand what
you want me to do next.

57
00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:17.698
It was very unclear to this
person then I realized I was so

58
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:20.032
focused on the technology
of how I built this.

59
00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:24.089
And all of the cool things, the blog posts
that I could put on the tech blog about

60
00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.735
this, the conference talks
I could give about it,

61
00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:29.397
because objectively it
was very cool technology.

62
00:03:29.397 --> 00:03:35.628
I had missed the entire damn point, which
is people are gonna go use this, right?

63
00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:40.535
When I saw them using it, I was like,
my god, I'm so wrong and that's so cool,

64
00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:41.043
right?

65
00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:44.002
I kind of felt like this,
right which is why I put this GIF in here.

66
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.377
You build this thing and

67
00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:48.815
you have some anticipation of
how people are gonna use it and

68
00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:53.790
then when it's actually given to someone,
they use it some entirely different way.

69
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.767
So, some of you might have
seen this picture before.

70
00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:01.289
This is called the desire path, right?

71
00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:02.745
You build this sidewalk here,

72
00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:05.660
and you have this anticipation
of people are gonna go do this.

73
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.444
And then people always find, it's,

74
00:04:07.444 --> 00:04:09.801
I actually just want to solve my problem,
right?

75
00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:12.012
I don't wanna go through your cool wizard.

76
00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:15.218
I don't wanna go through your
process that you set up for me.

77
00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:18.099
I have an intent when I arrive
with on your product and

78
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.728
I want to achieve my intent
as fast as possible.

79
00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:26.058
And you will discover these desire paths,
right?

80
00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:29.225
It's not a term I made up,
it's a term that actually exists.

81
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:33.782
And people will carve that through
your product either intentionally or

82
00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:35.059
unintentionally.

83
00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.767
And it's your job as a PM to recognize the
music, I'm wrong, I did this incorrectly,

84
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:43.331
I was not in tune enough, or
my bet or my experiment didn't work.

85
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.417
And now if you're a PM,
you would go pave this, right?

86
00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:50.507
Because now you have a concrete,
people actually just wanna go here.

87
00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:55.036
So, I love it, I find it exhilarating,
it's my favorite part,

88
00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:57.182
because when you're wrong you're learning.

89
00:04:57.182 --> 00:05:03.259
And I love to learn, and I love to kind
of go in and I love to experiment, right?

90
00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.108
I love to come up with a hypothesis of,
I'm gonna try x and see if y happens.

91
00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.985
And in reality, z happens and
I was that's so

92
00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:14.107
cool I now know more about
this than I did before.

93
00:05:14.107 --> 00:05:18.340
I read a book about this recently that my
executive coach recommended to me called,

94
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.738
Think Again by Adam Grant.

95
00:05:19.738 --> 00:05:23.992
If that resonates with you, that I'm
learning something and I'm wrong, and

96
00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:28.180
that's a lot of fun, I recommend it cuz
he actually goes into the science of,

97
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.063
why that's cool for some people.

98
00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.789
And then the variety of work.

99
00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.651
I get to write code
still fairly frequently.

100
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:37.888
I still write code on
a probably weekly basis.

101
00:05:37.888 --> 00:05:39.457
I'm not shipping a lot of code.

102
00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:43.526
I don't think I've shipped any code
at Snowflake other than to the docs.

103
00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:47.262
But I do say it's a lot of meetings and
emails and

104
00:05:47.262 --> 00:05:49.980
it is a lot of meetings and emails.

105
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.283
But it's also writing content,
it's a lot of marketing plans,

106
00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:59.760
it's a lot of coordination, it's a lot of
working across a variety of products and

107
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.554
projects rather than just on the one
that you're working at the moment.

108
00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:09.400
So the variety of work also keeps
me interested in the work as well.

109
00:06:11.177 --> 00:06:15.667
Any other questions about
what's fun about being a PM?

110
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.364
Yeah.

111
00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:28.504
&gt;&gt; So, [COUGH] I taught professionally for
many years and I know that human factors,

112
00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:33.124
size of jobs, some people really
enjoy that part of the job.

113
00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:35.991
And you can have what are very
bad days and go home,

114
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.156
go to bed, wake back up and go right
back to conversations without really

115
00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:43.802
remembering that you were in a lot
of arguments the day before.

116
00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:47.301
Other people that is not so
much their preference and

117
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:50.092
this is very much a human factors, jobs.

118
00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:55.042
How do you manage those dynamics where
it's not just about the objectives,

119
00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:57.595
it's also about the personalities and

120
00:06:57.595 --> 00:07:01.630
many times you're being stonewalled for
personal reasons.

121
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.804
Projects you're talking
about kind of offline,

122
00:07:04.804 --> 00:07:09.270
there's some disconnects that you
know you just run into walking in.

123
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.635
How do you manage your own kind of backend
on that coming in levelheaded making

124
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:16.401
sure you're making
the right kind of advocacy?

125
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.470
&gt;&gt; Sure, it's a good question.

126
00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:25.304
I think I have several answers to that.

127
00:07:25.304 --> 00:07:28.998
One of them is taking care of myself,
right?

128
00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:32.470
Making sure that after work hours,
I make sure that I try and

129
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.558
work relatively 40 hours a week.

130
00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:39.143
I really try hard not to work
much more than that these days.

131
00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:42.501
And then filling my cup at home, right?

132
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:48.646
Making sure that I'm exercising,
eating well, taking care of my family,

133
00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:54.311
that kind of base of security helps me
a lot when I get into work that I'm

134
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:59.323
happy to deal with the people
that I'm gonna be dealing with.

135
00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:04.108
I'm generally trying to associate
mostly at work with people,

136
00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:08.803
they don't have to be my buddies
I'm gonna go get beers with but

137
00:08:08.803 --> 00:08:11.925
people that I can get along with, right?

138
00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:15.921
And if I work with a PM that I don't like,
and there's anotherPM in that organization

139
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:19.214
that I do like, I'll probably just try and
work around them, right?

140
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:20.427
It's not always possible, right?

141
00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:25.273
So there's frequently that you
do have to deal with jerks.

142
00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:29.809
And then, at some point,
you just have to recognize that I'm

143
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:34.183
doing the right thing or
I think I'm doing the right thing.

144
00:08:34.183 --> 00:08:37.723
And if you have confidence in that,
working around or

145
00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:40.957
through someone becomes
less of an issue for me.

146
00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:42.922
I generally don't care what
people think about me.

147
00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:48.038
I think if you watch me make an idiot
on camera fairly frequently,

148
00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.468
that becomes fairly obvious.

149
00:08:50.468 --> 00:08:54.595
So having a little bit of a thick skin of,
I'm gonna do what I think is best and

150
00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:57.496
at the end of the day,
if this person is upset by that,

151
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:00.036
then kinda their problem, not mine, right?

152
00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:01.550
&gt;&gt; So you have direct reports or

153
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.839
does the product manager
generally not have direct reports.

154
00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:07.640
&gt;&gt; That would be a product group manager,
is what you would call that position.

155
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.847
I probably should have put that in there.

156
00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.835
They're the people that would
manage a group of product managers.

157
00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:15.114
So a product manager typically
is an individual contributor.

158
00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:18.025
So I don't have any reports at Snowflake.

159
00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:23.624
But a product group manager,
just to delineate that a little bit.

160
00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:26.278
Generally they kind of
set the strategy for

161
00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:30.925
their whole area and then they let
their individual products managers kind

162
00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:33.964
of make their own strategy
of their little part.

163
00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:36.994
So, I think that's why I would say I
think that's a pretty cool position.

164
00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:39.591
Because then you work mostly
on strategy and people and

165
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:42.079
those are two of my favorite
things about being a PM.

166
00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:49.667
But you get into a whole different thing
of what it means to manage someone.

167
00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.271
Which is an entirely different skill
set that we're not talking about at all

168
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:53.954
about today.

169
00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:59.052
&gt;&gt; So just to drive that clarification
home with a specific example.

170
00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:03.470
Would a product group
manager set the strategy for

171
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.846
something like a suite of
products like a Microsoft Office?

172
00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:14.339
And then have dedicated product
managers that report to them for

173
00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:18.516
Word and Outlook and
Excel and things like that.

174
00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:22.526
And maybe those products are bad examples
cuz those products alone are quite large.

175
00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:23.599
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you got it.

176
00:10:23.599 --> 00:10:27.968
Then yes, I was about to say,
well actually Word has like 30 PM.

177
00:10:27.968 --> 00:10:29.837
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Right.

178
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.854
&gt;&gt; You can imagine word
having a PM group manager.

179
00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:36.479
And then each one of those will
be managing the spellcheck and

180
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:39.052
the formatting and all that kind of stuff.

181
00:10:39.052 --> 00:10:42.366
So yeah, exactly, and
it's gonna depend on company.

182
00:10:42.366 --> 00:10:45.559
Some companies, those PM group managers
really only worry about the people and

183
00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:46.950
don't worry about the strategy.

184
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.138
There's other companies were the PM group
managers set all of the strategy and

185
00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:53.814
all the PMs are just
executing on their strategy.

186
00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:57.272
So there's gonna be some spectrum there.

187
00:10:57.272 --> 00:10:59.376
Yeah, Mark?

188
00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:02.343
&gt;&gt; Where do product owners
fall in the hierarchy,

189
00:11:02.343 --> 00:11:05.395
at least in the works that
you've been a part of?

190
00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:06.423
&gt;&gt; Yeah, product owner.

191
00:11:06.423 --> 00:11:09.598
That's another term that
probably bears talking about.

192
00:11:09.598 --> 00:11:14.422
In my experience, it's not actually
a title, it's kind of like a duty.

193
00:11:14.422 --> 00:11:19.085
So, for example, I would be the product
owner of Streamlet Community Cloud,

194
00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:22.208
which is the product that
I actually manage myself.

195
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:27.584
But it's not my title product owner
it's just it's a thing that it's,

196
00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:31.999
what would you want to call it,
an aspect of my job, right?

197
00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:34.539
I think that is a title at some companies.

198
00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:37.091
And I think it would be
like a vice president,

199
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.045
would be a product owner, right?

200
00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:44.889
Where they own the entire product and then
they have people that report up to them,

201
00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:49.393
that work on it, but
it's a very ill defined job description.

202
00:11:49.393 --> 00:11:51.549
And it's gonna be very
different based on companies.
