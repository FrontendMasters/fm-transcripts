00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.410
Executive summaries.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.538
If you get nothing else from this
particular writing portion of this course,

3
00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:12.687
I'm gonna say that this will
get you the most bang for

4
00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:15.250
your buck, let's go for that.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
I love this from stripe this was very
strong at the stripe culture and

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.692
I brought it with me to snowflake and
I've seen now at snowflake other people

7
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.509
are adopting this because they like it so
much.

8
00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.459
At stripe we called it the BLUF
the bottom line up front, and

9
00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:37.122
it's basically you have
this entire doc and

10
00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:42.864
at the top you have two to four
sentences is like here's the problem,

11
00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:46.430
here's why it is, here's our solution.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.887
And there is a strong culture at
stripe if like, if you read that and

13
00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:54.854
you agree with it, you can skip reading
the rest of the Doc and no one will expect

14
00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:59.270
you to have read the rest of the Doc
because there's so many docs at stripe.

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.600
It is impossible to read all of them,
right?

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.422
So that's why the culture of
the BLUF came around of like,

17
00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:10.103
write something at the top,
if you are fine with what that says, cool,

18
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.150
you're done, stop reading right now.

19
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.444
Now generally, me personally, I'd read the
BLUF if I liked it, I was like, all right,

20
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:21.226
I'm just gonna skim the rest of the Doc
here make sure there's nothing cool for

21
00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.604
me to read here, cool,
no, I'm done, right.

22
00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:28.074
I invite you to undertake this practice
because if you can put this right

23
00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:32.468
at the top and put a lot of emphasis
on it, you'll get your point across

24
00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:37.600
really quickly, this is truly how
you unbury the lead in your docs.

25
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.084
Because, inevitably,
you have to write a bunch of context,

26
00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:45.439
write why you made decisions, why you
chose this product over this product,

27
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.256
why you made this design
choice over this choice.

28
00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:51.055
If you do have to explain
some of those things, but

29
00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:53.588
the BLUF helps you get around that of,
okay,

30
00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:58.404
I'm skipping all context, and I'm going to
tell you exactly what I want to tell you.

31
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.389
So, start doing it in your own docs,

32
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:07.823
you can call them executive summaries,
at Reddit, we called it the TLDR,

33
00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:12.620
The Too Long Didn't Read,
whatever your company calls it.

34
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.321
I think the general term for
it is executive summary, but

35
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:19.571
I read it on every Doc that
I expect anyone to read.

36
00:02:21.994 --> 00:02:23.829
So, again, good bolding here,

37
00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.970
a good summary is designed to eliminate
the need to redo the rest of the Doc.

38
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.504
So, write the takeaway,
write the absolute just skeleton of

39
00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:41.487
the context needed to get your point
across and then describe the delta.

40
00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:44.604
And when I say the delta,
it's like that's the change set,

41
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:48.930
that's like we are here now and
we are gonna be here now, what's the gap?

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.359
The delta, that's it, that is all I try
and put inside of executive summary.

43
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.749
The best ones are one or two sentences,
I give myself up to four for

44
00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.308
really long things, I don't go above four,
unless I go to five,

45
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.650
then I generally try to go back to four,
but sometimes it happens.

46
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.951
Rules are made to be broken.

47
00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:16.615
Okay, how to cheat,
this is actually something that ChatGPT or

48
00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:21.090
Bard or whatever is actually very good at.

49
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.436
These AIs are really good
at taking a long doc and

50
00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.020
summarizing it into a couple of Docs.

51
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.785
I use Notion because that's what
Snowflake typically uses internally, and

52
00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:35.970
what's cool about that is you can just
say, Notion AI, write me a summary.

53
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.821
And generally it writes
you like a 80% good one,

54
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:43.484
I spend a little bit of time getting
that 80% to 100% good and then I'm done.

55
00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:47.910
In other words,
definitely write your summary last,

56
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.853
do not start with your summary because you
don't know what you're gonna write yet.

57
00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:54.556
And it is the most important part of your
Doc because that's the part that you're

58
00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:55.560
hoping everybody will read.

59
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.865
But this is definitely
something that can help.

60
00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:04.573
Don't put company secrets
in the ChatGPT we

61
00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:07.573
don't know what those people
are doing [LAUGH] and

62
00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:12.424
most of your companies will be very dodgy
that is okay I got this out of ChatGPT.

63
00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:15.283
There are some that you can run locally
Llama is one of them that you can actually

64
00:04:15.283 --> 00:04:16.420
run locally on your computer.

65
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.392
If you'd have something like that,
and a lot of products have a built in,

66
00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:23.722
like Notion, but I'm sure some
of the other ones do as well and

67
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.117
Microsoft has it built
into theirs as well.
