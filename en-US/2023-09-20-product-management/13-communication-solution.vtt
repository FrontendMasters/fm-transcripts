1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.396
So, okay, you believe that you will get
better performance on your Frontend,

2
00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:05.384
it's easier to recruit for
solid engineers.

3
00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.395
Developers get an opportunity to
rewrite buggy parts of the code, and

4
00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:10.597
you'll believe that you're
able to move faster.

5
00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.060
This doesn't really say much of that,
right?

6
00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.370
And you're getting into,
who cares about declarative primitives?

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.936
Your VP of Engineering might a bit,
but the answer's no.

8
00:00:24.936 --> 00:00:26.433
Actually, probably not, right?

9
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.358
And your CEO and
VP of Product really doesn't care, right?

10
00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:32.971
So this is a good litmus test for
you, is like,

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.787
look at how much jargon
is in what you're saying.

12
00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:36.589
In other words,

13
00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.040
is this makes sense to someone
outside of your particular discipline?

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.772
And if the answer is no, probably either
needs to be rephrased or left out.

15
00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:50.880
And this feels like it belongs on
the marketing for SolidJS, right?

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.900
This actually doesn't feel at all
like it belongs going to a CEO.

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.367
The way you should communicate this
to your CEO is, basically these,

18
00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.071
I think you'd be better off
literally just copying and

19
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:05.276
pasting these directly to your CEO, then
you wouldn't be with anything down here.

20
00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:08.435
You wanna let them know what is happening,

21
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:13.018
just the minimum of context is Backbone,
old, Solid, new.

22
00:01:13.018 --> 00:01:15.681
And by the way,
if anyone's on the chat telling me, well,

23
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.952
Backbone is better than Solid,
I don't care, I'm making an example.

24
00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:20.227
So please just follow with me.

25
00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:21.840
It is true, though.

26
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.789
I would rather write in
Solid than Backbone.

27
00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.077
You're trying to get them the minimum
of context of what Backbone is,

28
00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:32.217
why you're trying to move to SolidJS,
and a basic amount of Solid is

29
00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:36.600
a new framework that's supported and
well used in the industry.

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.515
And here is the bullet points of
reasons why we're trying to get from

31
00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.920
here to there.

32
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
That's it, say less, right?

33
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.380
Remove all the stuff about reactive
primitives, blah, blah, blah.

34
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.504
This one down here is
a very emotional appeal.

35
00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:54.281
Engineers love to talk about like,
we wanna be on the new hot stuff, right?

36
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.457
And as a product owner, as a product
manager, as a CEO, your job is kinda say,

37
00:01:58.457 --> 00:02:00.120
I don't really care, right?

38
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.130
I need you to offer me real business value
not just cuz it's pretty and shiny, right?

39
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.240
Anyone have other thoughts on this one and
why what I wrote sucks?

40
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.950
Yeah, please.

41
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.799
&gt;&gt; I would call this burying the lead,
like you said.

42
00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.812
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You want to communicate

43
00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:22.310
that the industry is moving on
from us with better technology and

44
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.989
saving time and money in the process.

45
00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.134
And so now we have this bullet list of,

46
00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:30.699
we know it's better performance,
we know more people use it.

47
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.304
And that takes five minutes to say, but

48
00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:39.985
if you focus on industry adoption and
the practical savings,

49
00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:44.370
you've got a 45 second, 60 second pitch.

50
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.901
&gt;&gt; Yep, it's something I never say in this
course, but don't bury the lead, right?

51
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.350
You're trying to get them from zero
to your point as fast as possible.

52
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.570
We'll actually talk a little bit when
we get into executive summaries,

53
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.275
it's basically how to unbury leads.

54
00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:04.120
But that's a really good way
of saying that, so thank you.

55
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.990
Okay, so A/B testing tool.

56
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.620
You go and you basically say, hey,
I wanna be able to experiment.

57
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.049
That's essentially your pitch here, is
like, I wanna be able to try A and B, and

58
00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.566
I wanna be able to prove that either
A is better or B is better, and

59
00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.280
I wanna have that capability.

60
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.472
So going into here,

61
00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:30.010
we're gonna be implementing
whatever as an A/B testing tool.

62
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.180
And you kind of get into here is like,
this is more like how you would

63
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.771
communicate a competitive
analysis to a product suite.

64
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:40.590
This doesn't really match up at
all with a project kickoff, right?

65
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.567
So my point here is I wanted you to
identify there was an audience mismatch

66
00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:49.820
here of, these people wanna hear,
what are the challenges?

67
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.120
What are we doing?

68
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.890
How are we gonna do it?

69
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.230
How are we aligned on this?

70
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.329
What sort of technical
constraints are we gonna have?

71
00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.574
You're trying to get
the engineers on board and

72
00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:03.109
pumped up to work on something that's
gonna be working on the product, and

73
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.270
instead you're giving them a bunch
of nonsense context, right?

74
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.310
You are doing the opposite of saying less,
you are definitely saying more here.

75
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.371
So I would focus way more on like, we're
building an experimentation platform and

76
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.922
we're going to be able to A/B test all
the cool stuff that you all build.

77
00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:20.609
Here's some technical information
that's gonna be helpful as we kick off

78
00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.170
this project.

79
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.830
It's more or less where I would go with
that bit of technical communication.

80
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.652
So adding a social share button.

81
00:04:28.652 --> 00:04:33.351
You're trying to convince a group of
mixed engineers, product managers, and

82
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.747
trying to basically act in persuasion.

83
00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:40.211
I actually literally just had an MBA
class on the art of persuasion,

84
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.181
which was very interesting.

85
00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.738
What is wrong with this?

86
00:04:47.738 --> 00:04:52.151
And why do you hate me right now?

87
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.040
&gt;&gt; Flowery language is just annoying.

88
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.320
&gt;&gt; It's absurd.

89
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.785
And I got through that and
I took a shower, right?

90
00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:06.635
[LAUGH] It's using so
much language, and it's massively

91
00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:11.799
distracting from the points
that you're actually making.

92
00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.159
I think I would read this, if I was
the recipient of this email, I'd be like,

93
00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.746
I don't care what you do,
I'm choosing the other person,

94
00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:19.905
because I don't trust you
[LAUGH] in particular.

95
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:21.507
Yeah.

96
00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:24.807
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kinda read that,
if my goal is those bullet points,

97
00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:28.520
I don't know if I trust myself
if I'm the one writing this.

98
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.681
The things that I probably want my
idea to succeed on is consistency,

99
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.919
it's easier to implement, right?

100
00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.830
I've hit some of the targets
that the organization likes.

101
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.670
Maybe I should just be okay
of saying that isn't enough,

102
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.675
instead of really going over
the hill to try to make a pitch.

103
00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:46.175
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

104
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.949
&gt;&gt; This one gives off the vibe that
you're better than everyone reading this.

105
00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.603
&gt;&gt; I mean, I am better than,
[LAUGH] just kidding.

106
00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:58.345
No, it definitely does come off that way.

107
00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:00.865
I do like the ideas of things
resting on their merits, but

108
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:04.080
also I also wanna get my way, and so
I'm willing to push harder for that.

109
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.243
And so I'm totally fine saying,
this is better, and it might be

110
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:14.074
visually apparent to you, and if it's not,
I'm going to tell you why it's better.

111
00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.760
Because sometimes people just
kind of need that direction.

112
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.096
We're all squishy, dumb animals, right?

113
00:06:19.096 --> 00:06:23.430
And so sometimes we just need the obvious
pointed out to us, that I'm better, right?

114
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.650
So that's why I wrote
it [LAUGH] like this.

115
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:30.947
If that's not clear,

116
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:34.290
I honestly [LAUGH] don't think
I'm better than anyone else here.

117
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.820
I'm chief idiot in the room.
