1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.863
So, we've already talked about
technical communication.

2
00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:07.146
We've talked about how to apply technical
communication principles to technical

3
00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:07.701
writing.

4
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:12.055
And now we're gonna apply those kinda
same sort of principles to how to hold

5
00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:13.031
a good meeting.

6
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.346
Now, I'm not gonna talk too much about how
to be a good participant in a meeting.

7
00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:22.332
I'm gonna hope that most of you can
kind of intuit what to do there, right?

8
00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:27.502
Participate, don't dominate the meeting
when it's not your meeting.

9
00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:28.402
It's helpful for

10
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:31.762
you to go into a meeting with a goal
of what you want out of a meeting.

11
00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.225
The other small piece of
advice I'll give you is.

12
00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:39.285
If you're attending a recurring meeting,
and it's not something helpful to you,

13
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:42.505
find a way to stop attending
that recurring meeting.

14
00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:47.404
There's a certain amount of, I don't know,
internal pressure, at least for me,

15
00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:50.793
to attend every meeting and
to want to be in every meeting.

16
00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:56.270
And it's because it feels productive to
have like a full calendar of meetings.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.171
I love that PMs love to show
each other their calendars,

18
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:05.659
like look how busy I am, and I was like,
neat, I don't care, [LAUGH], right?

19
00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.748
It's a humble brag but in reality is like
you probably are just not managing your

20
00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:12.933
calendar well enough if you're
going to that many meetings.

21
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.936
There's no way all of those are useful.

22
00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:17.744
So, that's my advice for you,

23
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:23.365
it's maybe consider cutting down
on your recurring meetings.

24
00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:26.822
I have one of my co-workers that says
that I have no recurring one-on-ones.

25
00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:32.126
They're all totally ad hoc scheduled
when we have something to talk about.

26
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:35.673
And, to his credit, he actually does
schedule a lot of one on ones, but

27
00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:37.817
he has nothing recurring on his calendar.

28
00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:39.619
And I was like,
that's kind of an interesting idea,

29
00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.512
I don't know if I have
the discipline to maintain that.

30
00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:45.856
But, anyway, so that's kinda my spiel.

31
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.631
Go to meetings that you find useful,
schedule meetings that are useful, and

32
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.506
cancel meetings that are not useful.

33
00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:55.839
So, most of the rest of this section
is going to be about how to run a good

34
00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:56.505
meeting.

35
00:01:56.505 --> 00:02:01.891
Because I think that's actually the more
unique skillset to keep in here.

36
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:06.404
So, let's talk about some
previously-learned principles that we

37
00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:08.749
learned previously, I said that.

38
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:14.441
Maybe, say it again, previously,
[LAUGH], and apply them to meetings.

39
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:16.824
So, the first one is people,
people, people, right?

40
00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:21.389
Audience, and, in this case,
it is who is in the room.

41
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.062
I think there's a strong temptation
to like reuse slide decks,

42
00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.133
there's a strong temptation
to reuse old rhetoric.

43
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:35.175
But it's always good to cater your
message to whoever is listening to it.

44
00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:39.480
And it's also look around with who's
engaged with the meeting, right?

45
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.083
Cause you're gonna get a bunch of people
that just attend every meeting on their

46
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:43.635
calendar.

47
00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:45.219
They're going to be on their phone,
they're gonna be doing other things.

48
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.190
And if they're not paying attention to
you, don't cater the meeting to them or

49
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.811
make sure that they're paying attention,
right?

50
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.043
Whatever that is.

51
00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.713
Yeah, and
if someone's not paying attention to you,

52
00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:02.196
it might be a context clue that maybe
you're not talking about the thing

53
00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:03.951
that they want to be talking about.

54
00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:06.898
So, whatever you can do
to wrangle guests or

55
00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:12.570
whoever's in your meeting towards the goal
that you're trying to get to, do that.

56
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.605
The right amount of context,
it's the same thing here.

57
00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:19.762
At the beginning of meetings, all of
us like to set up a lot of context, and

58
00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:22.322
I'm just gonna say, say less here, right?

59
00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:28.525
To say only the amount that you need
to get to your point, unbury the lead.

60
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.036
In this particular case,

61
00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:33.890
you can do executive summaries at
the beginning of your meetings.

62
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.052
And just say, hey everyone,
for context this is our point,

63
00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:41.280
that's good, now let's dive into
the point, that's an effective strategy.

64
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.411
If you can't do that, just try and
get through the context fast enough,

65
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:50.635
so that you keep people's attention for
as long as you can.

66
00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:52.059
But meeting goals are always a good idea.

67
00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:57.193
I said this previously,
prepare for 100% to say 5%,

68
00:03:57.193 --> 00:04:02.541
this is extra applies to meetings,
as opposed to documents.

69
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.688
So, you certainly don't want
to say everything that you've

70
00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:06.845
learned in a meeting.

71
00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:10.506
You'll spend the entire meeting just
talking about who you talk to when.

72
00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:14.147
Don't do that, that's not very useful.

73
00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.927
But you do want to be really prepared
that if someone asks a question,

74
00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:20.873
that you are prepared and
ready to answer it, right?

75
00:04:20.873 --> 00:04:25.411
So, this is where I'm saying, these
meetings where I would meet at Microsoft

76
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:29.979
with senior executives,
I would probably prepare 100% to say 0.1%.

77
00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.975
And I don't think I'm even
really that much exaggerating.

78
00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:37.378
That I had to have so much context and
have to cover all of my bases.

79
00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:40.638
So, that when they asked me the questions,
that I was really prepared for

80
00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:41.435
those meetings.

81
00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:44.224
And you're gonna kind of
find out as I go on here,

82
00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:46.686
there's different levels here, right?

83
00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:51.648
There's the casual one-on-one,
where you don't have to prepare a lot.

84
00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:54.505
And there's the ultra important meetings,

85
00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:59.856
where you have a million dollars of salary
going out the window for just one meeting.

86
00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:03.783
And in those meetings,
you damn well better be super prepared,

87
00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:07.286
it's basically public speaking
at that point, right?

88
00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:10.400
You need to be that prepared for him.

89
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.121
Yeah, and you can see here,
at Microsoft, no joke,

90
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.491
I would spend a month preparing for
a meeting.

91
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:20.585
That was actually most of my job, it was
preparing for one meeting every month.

92
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:22.519
It was the most important
thing I did at Microsoft.

93
00:05:24.898 --> 00:05:27.812
And you might say, well,
that's really unnecessary,

94
00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:31.771
you're paying one person a lot of money
to prepare once a month for a meeting.

95
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.823
And I would argue that's actually one of
the most effective things that Microsoft

96
00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:36.654
knows how to do.

97
00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:41.473
My entire job was to brief executives
on what it was like to be a JavaScript

98
00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.607
developer on Microsoft Azure.

99
00:05:43.607 --> 00:05:45.651
And we were able to make a lot of changes,
but

100
00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:47.934
it was that meeting that
was the lever of change.

101
00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:51.056
So, I know people love to say,
how much money is

102
00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:55.676
going out the window by having this
many people in a meeting right now?

103
00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:58.997
How much salary is being paid out for
this 30-minute block?

104
00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:03.149
And that is a valid consideration,
but it also is a useful point for

105
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.274
product managers and
people to leverage change.

106
00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:09.575
Some meetings don't need to happen, but
some meetings definitely need to happen,

107
00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:10.506
I think it's my point.

108
00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:14.576
And then don't spend a bunch of time
convincing who don't need convincing.

109
00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:18.021
I think there's a big temptation with
product managers that are like, I made

110
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.415
all these slides and I'm going to show
you all of the slides that I prepared.

111
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:23.095
If you're going through slides and

112
00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:26.914
you're realizing that I actually don't
need to talk about this, skip slides.

113
00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:30.458
Just do it and then make sure you
send out those slide decks later,

114
00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:34.334
you don't have to go in order,
you don't have to show all your slides.

115
00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:37.843
Be adaptive to the message that
you're trying to convey in the room.

116
00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:43.199
&gt;&gt; When you gave the example about
that one meeting at Microsoft,

117
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.366
which represented a reasonable
swath of the organization.

118
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:53.251
Would you talk a little bit about
how you selected or listened for

119
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:58.062
the things that you would talk about or
that you would bring up?

120
00:06:58.062 --> 00:07:02.878
Because I think the implicit point
here is that the preparation for

121
00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:07.265
that one meeting covered a lot
of work that needed to be done.

122
00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:12.191
And if that work got done,
there could be some good benefit to it.

123
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:16.708
So, how did you go about
weighing out objectives or

124
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.184
at least farming them to bring them up?

125
00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:21.405
&gt;&gt; Sure.

126
00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:27.800
So, I had an hour with people that were
able to affect change in the company.

127
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.385
And so I went in there with
usually two to three objectives,

128
00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:34.980
usually one major objective and
two to three smaller ones.

129
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.093
And then they usually expected a little
bit of informational reporting,

130
00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:39.458
which I always threw at the end.

131
00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:45.973
Cuz if that was something to cut,
that was the stuff to cut for me.

132
00:07:45.973 --> 00:07:52.593
So, I would make sure that we would cover
particularly my major point upfront first.

133
00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:58.243
And I would prepare a ton of things
of basically what was the problem,

134
00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:00.192
what was our solution,

135
00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:05.171
what kind of solutions did we look at,
and who was involved.

136
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:08.355
I think that's more or
less the major points of that.

137
00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:12.296
And then I would come in really strong and
just say,

138
00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:17.806
this was a problem and we fixed this,
what do you wanna know more about?

139
00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:22.303
Because typically they had something
that they would get really interested in

140
00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:24.971
that we would follow their tangents,
right?

141
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.264
So, I'd have to prepare all of those

142
00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:34.394
answers because they might ask me, right?

143
00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:36.958
Usually, they weren't really
questioning my solutions, and

144
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.006
that was actually the part
that I cared most about.

145
00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:43.255
They wanted to know some context, so it
was kind of like, all right, if you let me

146
00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:47.274
have my solution, I'll let you know
anything that you wanna know about it.

147
00:08:47.274 --> 00:08:51.343
That was kind of the agreements
that I had with those people.

148
00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:53.986
And sometimes they'd be like, okay,
I don't actually like your solution,

149
00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:55.076
let's go talk more about that.

150
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:59.337
And then I'd talk about alternative
solutions, why we didn't choose those,

151
00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:00.616
those kinds of things.

152
00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:05.045
So, I mean, it's kinda like I showed them
the tip of the iceberg and it's like,

153
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:09.560
okay, what part of everything underneath
that do you want to talk about, right?

154
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.338
Do you wanna talk about all
the way at the bottom of this or

155
00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:14.537
do you want to talk about
how did we get here?

156
00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:17.805
Those kinds of things, so
does that answer your question?

157
00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:21.601
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that does.

158
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:24.992
The difficulty is making those summaries.

159
00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:25.525
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

160
00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:32.563
&gt;&gt; And remaining focused, but
also not allowing the discussion to get so

161
00:09:32.563 --> 00:09:37.273
far out of your objective that it just is-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

162
00:09:37.273 --> 00:09:41.219
I'll talk about how to wrangle
here in just a second.

163
00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:46.724
Something that I didn't put in here, and
in several places I should have put this.

164
00:09:46.724 --> 00:09:50.633
Never be afraid to say I don't know,
because if you don't know,

165
00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:52.277
don't make it up, right?

166
00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:55.441
Because then you get into a real trouble
either by someone who will take you at

167
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:58.918
your word, when in reality you actually
didn't know what you were talking about.

168
00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:02.884
Or you'll get called out of it and
you'll lose credibility.

169
00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:06.702
But it's always better to say,
I don't know,

170
00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:11.774
let me get back to you, I don't know,
this person might know.

171
00:10:11.774 --> 00:10:15.118
Get used to saying I don't know a lot.

172
00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:17.736
Because frequently they're just
saying these questions like, hey,

173
00:10:17.736 --> 00:10:18.661
did we think about this?

174
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:22.258
And it's okay to say, you know what,
we didn't think about this, right?

175
00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:24.771
It's okay for
other people to also be professionals and

176
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:26.542
smart in their fields as well, right?

177
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:31.707
So, embrace the fact that
you don't know everything.

178
00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:36.446
And, yeah, that's another
important thing about being a PM,

179
00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:40.417
it's that you're not
expected to know everything.

180
00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:45.604
I'll even go as far as to say that
sometimes you'll prepare 90% to say 5%.

181
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.852
And they'll ask you something in that 10%,
something that you should have done and

182
00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:49.756
you should have known.

183
00:10:49.756 --> 00:10:53.396
And it's really okay to say,
you know what, I probably should have had

184
00:10:53.396 --> 00:10:56.869
the answer to that and I don't,
let me get back to you by this point.

185
00:10:56.869 --> 00:11:04.549
And then please follow up if you get
asked a question that you don't know.
