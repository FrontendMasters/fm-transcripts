00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.131
So far, I've just been talking
about what a PM is and isn't.

2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.857
Let's get into,
what I think PM should be doing.

3
00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:13.071
This is roughly ordered, is this true?

4
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:13.875
Not totally,

5
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:18.100
it's ordered in a way that I think I can
draw a narrative through most of it.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.486
But I try to keep the most
important things up front and

7
00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.518
basically the most basic building
blocks and then go up from there.

8
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.419
So, we're gonna hop into
stakeholder management now.

9
00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.492
Why did I put this first?

10
00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:37.600
Because product management, as I've
said before, it's about people, and

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.712
it's always about people, and
if it's not about people,

12
00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:43.529
then you're probably not
doing your job correctly.

13
00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:47.420
Because ultimately, at the end of this,
always should be a person.

14
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.383
Even if you're building, I don't know, a
piece that goes into a device that's then

15
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.031
sold to someone, that goes into something
that then ends up in a user's hand.

16
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:58.971
You need to be concerned about everyone
in that process and all of the people,

17
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.245
the people factor,
involved in all of these different pieces,

18
00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:05.416
including the end user of whatever
you're going to be doing.

19
00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.336
If you're not thinking about that and

20
00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:11.296
you're only thinking about the dimensions
of your piece that goes into that,

21
00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:15.457
I don't think you're doing your job
as good as you could be doing it.

22
00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:18.997
It's all about people, and so we're
gonna talk about stakeholder management.

23
00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:21.039
And a stakeholder is just another word for

24
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.429
person that cares about
whatever you're doing.

25
00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.487
So, let's take Google Maps for example.

26
00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:32.315
Fathom that you are a PM,
that is the product owner,

27
00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:36.842
of Google Maps, Maps likely has
dozens of PMs that work on it.

28
00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:39.121
But let's just simplify for a second and

29
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.011
say that you are the only
PM working on Google Maps.

30
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.922
Think through for a second everyone that
cares about what happens on Google Maps,

31
00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:47.641
everyone.

32
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:53.081
Well, let's talk about end users first,
first of all,

33
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.822
there's many types of end users for
Google Maps.

34
00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:59.285
There's the navigating user, which is
probably what most of us thought of first.

35
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.871
But think of all the different
types of navigating users,

36
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.361
you could be navigating on a car.

37
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.765
Which is gonna be way different
than navigating walking,

38
00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:07.099
those are two different users.

39
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.470
Even if those users like, I'll walk
one day and I'll drive the next day,

40
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.447
that's just me changing
my perspective on them.

41
00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:19.962
But I still care about both of those
personas, I am both of those personas.

42
00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:23.203
And it can be multiple personas at once,
right?

43
00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:28.104
So, cars, biking, transit, rideshare,
walking, those are all different types

44
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:32.546
of users and you need to care individually
about every one of those personas.

45
00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:36.854
I open Google Maps all the time just
to find the hours of businesses, right?

46
00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:39.641
That's a type of user,
that's a valid use case of your app,

47
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:41.291
that's a stakeholder in your app.

48
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:45.935
How far away something is, I will check
how far would it take me to drive to

49
00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:49.072
Fargo from here or
something like that, right?

50
00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:51.133
Some of this was looking at geography,

51
00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.697
I've also zoomed out where
the hell is Armenia?

52
00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:55.251
I don't actually know where that is.

53
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.403
And I know was zoom out, my math was
a cost there, I didn't know that.

54
00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:04.452
Finding where their friends are,
I've definitely used that before.

55
00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:09.720
Third party apps that embeds maps
like Uber embeds Google maps.

56
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.548
And if I'm the PM of Google Maps, I really
need to care about that end user because

57
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:19.305
now if they get upset at Uber because of
their maps, Uber is gonna be upset at me.

58
00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:23.491
And that's, those are all stakeholders
that I have to care about.

59
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.803
So, in that light,
third party developers using Maps,

60
00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.494
you have to care a lot
about their experience,

61
00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:33.925
both with the development of their app and
the end user experience thereof.

62
00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:38.903
Business owners, they have to go in and
manage their hours, their menus,

63
00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:42.393
do they accept DoorDash,
are they kid-friendly?

64
00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:46.780
And those are frequently very
non-technical users because they're gonna

65
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.431
be like mom and pop bodegas.

66
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.749
So, that's another critical
stakeholder in what Google Map does.

67
00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.413
And then you have to care about all of
your internal users, your team has a stake

68
00:03:57.413 --> 00:04:02.872
in your app, your manager, your manager's
manager, teams in which you depend, right?

69
00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:08.576
So, if you are depending on Google
infrastructure, that team, they're trying

70
00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:13.715
to solve your problems and therefore
they have a stake in your app as well.

71
00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:18.012
The DevOps team that manages that,
the Google shareholders off, obviously.

72
00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:24.684
We live in a capitalistic society, so they
also have to care about your app as well.

73
00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:29.669
So, my point here is, you have a lot of
end users, you have a lot of stakeholders.

74
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.798
And whenever you're building something,
you need to think quite a bit about that.

75
00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:39.763
So, this is kind of an exercise
of breaking down personas and

76
00:04:39.763 --> 00:04:43.339
stakeholders and
you can kind of think of in terms of how

77
00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.114
I'm talking about stakeholders and
personas being similar concepts.

78
00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:49.599
Why do we care about any of this,

79
00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.129
why do we care about all
the people that are using this?

80
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.129
Because we're building products for and
with our stakeholders, and we need to

81
00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.844
be incredibly mindful of the things,
the directions that we choose to go.

82
00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:04.027
Because inevitably, to some degree,

83
00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:08.006
you are always trading off this
stakeholder versus this stakeholder.

84
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:12.848
Even if it's like it's a slam dunk, this
is the best feature that we can build,

85
00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:17.693
you are still trading off that your team
has to maintain this feature long term,

86
00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:20.108
and you need to consider that, right?

87
00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:23.178
Like if you build a whole new
service that has a new database and

88
00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:26.484
it has a vector database that then
talks to a large language model,

89
00:05:26.484 --> 00:05:30.222
that's just three new things that you
just threw on your infrastructure.

90
00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:33.832
And now your infrastructure team cares,
and your team has to care, and

91
00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.468
your team has to get paged on it.

92
00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.551
And if you're not thinking about this,

93
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:41.226
you end up with an app where you're
getting paged constantly and no ones

94
00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:46.305
doing anything about it because you didn't
manage your stakeholders correctly.

95
00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:50.247
So I think this is best rather than, I'm
kind of talking in the abstract to just

96
00:05:50.247 --> 00:05:53.562
kind of take this and make this more,
try and make this concrete.

97
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:58.891
So, let's say we get a directive to
make more money for Google Maps.

98
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:03.472
Just pause for a second here and
just think about, all right,

99
00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:09.216
you PM of Google Maps, you need to go
make more money, how are you gonna do it?

100
00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:13.021
I'll tell you what I thought of,
sponsored listings, right?

101
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:18.248
So, right now if you search for something
on Google Maps, it'll show you one or

102
00:06:18.248 --> 00:06:22.398
two sponsored listings,
why don't we increase that to five?

103
00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:26.806
It seems like a pretty,
now we have more ad slots to sell.

104
00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:30.881
But let's talk about what did I,
either explicitly or implicitly,

105
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:34.316
just trade off to go from two
to five sponsored listings?

106
00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:38.466
So let's say I'm searching for
something like coffee shop and

107
00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:40.588
I'm going to allow Starbucks.

108
00:06:40.588 --> 00:06:45.386
Which is a mile away to be listed
higher than a half mile away this

109
00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:49.295
little boutique one that
would have been on my way.

110
00:06:50.437 --> 00:06:55.724
Explicitly what I'm doing there is I have
a ranking algorithm that would have put,

111
00:06:55.724 --> 00:07:01.024
let's call it Herkimer, cuz that's the one
I live next to and I love their coffee.

112
00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:03.257
That would have put Herkimer first and

113
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:06.760
my ranking algorithm would
have shown that first, right?

114
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.532
Instead I'm gonna put Starbucks higher
than that because they gave me some

115
00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:12.675
money to do that.

116
00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:15.674
I am explicitly giving
the user a worst experience,

117
00:07:15.674 --> 00:07:19.217
I had an idea of what I think is
the best thing to get this user and

118
00:07:19.217 --> 00:07:22.919
I am giving them something inferior
in the name of taking money.

119
00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.941
I have traded off that stakeholder for
a different stakeholder, is that okay?

120
00:07:30.136 --> 00:07:31.364
I don't know, right?

121
00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:34.989
So you kinda have to ask yourself, what's
my impact here versus who am I affecting?

122
00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.903
But that's the obvious one.

123
00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:43.438
Let's talk about people that are already
paying for sponsored slots, right?

124
00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:45.583
So, if Starbucks is already paying for
that,

125
00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:48.168
let's say that I have another
Seattle's Best Coffee,

126
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:51.579
which is actually still Starbucks,
but let's ignore that for a second.

127
00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:56.158
[LAUGH] That Seattle's Best
comes in here and they buy one,

128
00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:58.501
and they're two miles away.

129
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:03.547
And they paid even more money, so now
they're ranked even higher than Starbucks.

130
00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:07.590
I have now devalued the existing
sponsored slot, right?

131
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.464
Which probably means I'm driving down
my price on those slots as well,

132
00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:14.121
because now it has become more cheaper,
right?

133
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:15.904
Because there's more of them.

134
00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:21.209
But, I mean, the other thing you can look
at, is we can help net new businesses,

135
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.268
maybe we have a brand
new coffee shop opening.

136
00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:27.673
And they open,
they put a sponsored listing in there and

137
00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:31.960
now they can get the word out,
they're nearby and they can open that.

138
00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:36.150
Obviously, we're harming
even more businesses,

139
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.190
like now Herkimer doesn't pay at all for
this.

140
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.044
And now they are the sixth result
on Google, no one looks that,

141
00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:46.876
we have science that says people don't
don't look six results down, right?

142
00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:48.299
So that really sucks.

143
00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:55.260
So, I mean, actually, this was actually a
real story for me when I was writing this.

144
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.953
This was actually just Brian ranting right
here, this whole section right here.

145
00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:03.825
I was on Instacart, did I say that here?

146
00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:06.681
I was on a popular
grocery delivery service.

147
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:11.388
[LAUGH] And I was gonna give a gift
to a friend of Tequila, right?

148
00:09:11.388 --> 00:09:15.781
And I was so
frustrated with their search results.

149
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.560
I went through and I counted,
there was 20 results.

150
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.956
50% of those results were ads,

151
00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:27.532
and 40% of those results were not tequila.

152
00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:32.110
I would have searched for hard seltzer or
bourbon if I had one of those things.

153
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.897
But I was just so pissed, I was like,
I couldn't find a bottle of tequila.

154
00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:40.267
I'm not searching for tequila just
cuz I like, I wanna get drunk, right?

155
00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:44.010
I mean, sort of, but that's not
actually why I was doing that, right?

156
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.204
So, I really felt that popular
delivery service had sold me out as

157
00:09:47.204 --> 00:09:48.435
a stakeholder, right?

158
00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:54.627
So, in the situation should you do it,
right?

159
00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.523
Do you think this is a valid way for
Google to make more money?

160
00:09:56.523 --> 00:10:00.351
I'm gonna argue that based on my just
product sense, my intuition here,

161
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:04.010
I actually don't think this is likely
to increase profits that much.

162
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.725
And certainly not at the cost of how
much it devalues the experience of both

163
00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:13.986
existing users of the existing businesses
and for the end user of people using it.

164
00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:16.647
So, yeah, the metrics matter here,

165
00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:21.068
we have a whole section on metrics and
we'll get there, yeah.

166
00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:25.529
&gt;&gt; So when it does come to
those more gray scenarios and

167
00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:30.820
then again, maybe we'll get to
this later in the workshop,

168
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.683
but are there ways to
refine that gray area?

169
00:10:34.683 --> 00:10:39.394
So, I'm trying to think of how
would you go about quantifying

170
00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:43.290
the impact to the UX and
distilling that down into,

171
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.382
here's how it's going to impact
our bottom line, potentially.

172
00:10:48.382 --> 00:10:56.003
And why showing more ads might increase
the bottom line by one and a half percent.

173
00:10:56.003 --> 00:11:01.690
But it's going to degrade the UX
in such a way that we actually

174
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.964
lose money, there's a lot of factors-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

175
00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:07.334
&gt;&gt; In that calculus, so [LAUGH].

176
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.656
&gt;&gt; So, I'll give you the PMing
tools to do it, but at this point,

177
00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:13.935
you're starting to get into game
theory and stuff like that.

178
00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:14.462
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
[LAUGH]

179
00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:15.310
&gt;&gt; So at that point,

180
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.660
I involved the data science team cuz
I am not a data scientist, right?

181
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.318
They're gonna be able to help me do,
and probably the accountants and

182
00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:23.685
finance people, right?

183
00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:25.940
Cuz they're gonna be able to do
projections and stuff like that.

184
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.190
The tool, as a product manager,
that I use, and

185
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.205
I talked about this in
the prioritization but

186
00:11:32.205 --> 00:11:36.822
it actually applies upon a lot of
places not just in prioritization.

187
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:42.614
There's tools, one of them is called
the RICE method, which is Reach, Impact,

188
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:46.258
is it, kind of gotta remember,
lemme just scroll down in here.

189
00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:48.574
This one here, Confidence and
Effort, right?

190
00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:51.871
Using that, you can assign numbers
to all of those things and

191
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.006
you kinda get a score at the end of,
if we do this, we reach this many people,

192
00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.934
we're this confident that
we're gonna reach them.

193
00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:02.015
It's gonna have this kind
of impact on them and

194
00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:04.867
it's gonna cost us this much to get there.

195
00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:08.579
And it kinda helps you rank, do this
first, then do this, then do this, and

196
00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:09.807
don't do this, right?

197
00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:13.572
Or you can just think about as
impact versus effort, which is just

198
00:12:13.572 --> 00:12:18.379
the really simplest way of thinking,
is like, is that high impact, high effort?

199
00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:22.965
Or is it high impact low effort or
is it low effort, high impact?

200
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:24.948
Those are kind of things you
can use to think about it.

201
00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:29.401
But in this particular case, because of
all of the money and stakeholders and

202
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:32.909
what is a three-way marketplace,
how does that function?

203
00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:35.862
Generally, you need data
people to help you out.

204
00:12:35.862 --> 00:12:40.123
Or at least I do because I'm not smart
enough to handle those kinda things.

205
00:12:40.123 --> 00:12:40.942
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.

206
00:12:40.942 --> 00:12:44.769
Well, that's a good kinda coarse grain,
next level down,

207
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:48.446
how you can justify this is,
my intuition leans one way and

208
00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:52.744
here's a way that I can frame it up
that helps support my intuition.

209
00:12:52.744 --> 00:12:58.244
And then, yeah, if you need another
level of detail, then good.

210
00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:02.307
&gt;&gt; And another thing I'll just
like kinda throw out here is that,

211
00:13:02.307 --> 00:13:04.922
I'll experiment frequently, right?

212
00:13:04.922 --> 00:13:09.830
So, if let's say that we do think this
is actually gonna be a good idea.

213
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.592
I will say, we're gonna try this,
we're gonna try it for a month, and

214
00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:14.990
we're gonna turn it off.

215
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.776
And then we're gonna look at
all the data and figure out,

216
00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:20.167
what did we actually do to the products,
right?

217
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:24.585
And so those kinda low cost, quick
experiments, cuz Google Maps has such

218
00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:29.447
a user base, you could probably get really
good results really quickly on that.

219
00:13:29.447 --> 00:13:33.888
That would tell you really strongly, do we
stand actually to make more money here?

220
00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:36.504
That would actually be
a perfect use case for

221
00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:40.180
experimentation cuz it should
be pretty low cost to just say,

222
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.946
instead of showing two,
show me five now and see what happens.

223
00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:44.900
Did we lower CSAT?

224
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.478
Did we increase revenue, did we?

225
00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:50.809
Are we sending people to the businesses
that we think they should go to?

226
00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:51.797
Those things, right?

227
00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:54.614
So, experimentation is
also super valuable here.

228
00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:59.632
How do you frame this to your data science
team to get the best answers out of them?

229
00:13:59.632 --> 00:14:03.545
Certainly one of the things is I try to
have my data scientists in many of those

230
00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:07.780
kind of product planning meetings so that
they have all of the context that I have.

231
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.856
I try to involve them as early and
as frequently as they want to be involved.

232
00:14:11.856 --> 00:14:14.882
With generally, I work with our
awesome data scientists, and

233
00:14:14.882 --> 00:14:16.951
then we're kinda data science platform.

234
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:21.513
So, they're generally very interested
in the things that I build.

235
00:14:21.513 --> 00:14:24.461
I have a user research
team right in front of me,

236
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:29.422
I just go ask them, it's like, hey,
how did you not streamlet today, right?

237
00:14:29.422 --> 00:14:30.081
And then I get to build those things.

238
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:34.537
So, involving them, finding awesome
partners and involving them as much as you

239
00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:38.482
can is generally just a solve all for
many of the problems that you have.

240
00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:41.248
That's not always possible,
like at Microsoft,

241
00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.770
I didn't have a designated
user researcher.

242
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.675
And so I had to go to the user
researcher Oregon and

243
00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:50.634
make proposals and stuff like that.

244
00:14:50.634 --> 00:14:53.426
In those cases I try and make a pretty
detailed product spec, I try and walk them

245
00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:56.494
through, here's everything that I want,
here's my goals here's my non-goals.

246
00:14:56.494 --> 00:14:58.462
Here's the metrics I'm looking to affect,

247
00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:00.802
here's the metrics that
I'm hoping to hold steady.

248
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:04.261
And try and give them a pretty
solid basis for them to go and

249
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:08.457
make some predictions and analysis and
those kinds of things out of.

250
00:15:08.457 --> 00:15:11.402
So, I just try and
think like they do and I try and

251
00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:15.540
answer their questions both before
they have them and after that.
