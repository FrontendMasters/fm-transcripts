1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
Prioritization, I feel like
I've talked about this like

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.636
indirectly a bunch of times because
you all stop bringing it up [LAUGH].

3
00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:11.502
But turns out,
it's actually really important.

4
00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:15.779
It's like one of the biggest things
that a product manager does,

5
00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.625
a lot of my job as an engineer comes to me
is I can do task A, or I can do task B.

6
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.937
And I need you to choose so it's your
fault if it was the wrong one to work on

7
00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:27.576
A lot of it's just owning the risk, right?

8
00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:32.358
So if you own so much risk,
you better learn how to manage the risk.

9
00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:39.003
So you always, always, always have more
work than you could ever possibly do.

10
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.541
I have never met a PM in
my entire life who's like,

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.085
we're actually out of stuff to do.

12
00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.368
I really can't think of one.

13
00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:49.612
You know who probably says that?

14
00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:51.644
The PM of Craigslist.

15
00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:54.962
Craig ran out of stuff to do.

16
00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:59.012
I don't know who Craig is, but
what I actually admire about the product

17
00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:02.133
of Craigslist is like,
they're like, we're done.

18
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.206
We did it.

19
00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:04.378
We finished it.

20
00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:08.509
Super stable is incredibly stable and
it's a good product and

21
00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.186
they make a ton of money.

22
00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:14.945
Bananas anyway, if you are the PM of
Craigslist and you're listening to this,

23
00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:19.503
you can just shut it off and go hang out
in your yacht, right like it's fine.

24
00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:21.877
You can ignore this section
of the course right?

25
00:01:21.877 --> 00:01:26.619
You did it, everybody else tune in
because I've never met another PM

26
00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.501
that would say we're out of things to do.

27
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.626
So frequently the question is like
do I work on A or do I work on B?

28
00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:37.802
It's just obvious.

29
00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:41.557
A is mission-critical, B is not,
we're gonna work on A, right?

30
00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.757
Or Z is on fire and alpha will wait.

31
00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:46.100
We'll work on Z, right?

32
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.389
So, lean into your intuition
where that's possible a ladders

33
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.277
up into a project that is
mission critical to our metrics,

34
00:01:56.277 --> 00:02:00.598
and B,
affects like one of our secondary metrics.

35
00:02:00.598 --> 00:02:01.756
You're probably gonna do A.

36
00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:09.213
So, what do you do when you have A and
B and they are, in your eyes,

37
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.424
roughly of same importance?

38
00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:14.292
This is where this can get a bit dicey.

39
00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:17.628
So I'm gonna give you two
different tools that I use

40
00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:20.508
to assess which thing
I should work on next.

41
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.541
So I'll do the simple one first.

42
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:33.423
This one's usually enough for most things.

43
00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:39.898
So trying to, yeah, we're ultimately
trying to judge three things here impact.

44
00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:44.503
How many people can we
impact in which ways?

45
00:02:44.503 --> 00:02:46.543
How risky is it?

46
00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:48.258
And what's the cost here?

47
00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:53.588
Cost can be people, cost can be money,
cost can be resources going out, right?

48
00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:57.278
Impact, risk, and cost ultimately,
everything that I'm gonna talk about here

49
00:02:57.278 --> 00:02:59.585
more or less correlates to
one of these two things.

50
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:01.628
Sorry, three things.

51
00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:04.963
Impact is a roll up idea
of how many people and

52
00:03:04.963 --> 00:03:07.768
how deeply am I going to affect them.

53
00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:12.118
If you don't migrate your database
in your server is gonna overload and

54
00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:16.047
crash that affects all of your
users that's highly impactful.

55
00:03:16.047 --> 00:03:20.539
What if you add support to an obscure
language to your application for

56
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.952
a demographic of users not
using your application.

57
00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:30.890
Low impact, right high effort,
very costful, low impact there.

58
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.298
You can probably put that on
the backlog if that feels important for

59
00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.406
you to support.

60
00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:40.410
Risk is the idea of how likely
something is going to happen.

61
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.863
So, if you're a stripe and
you are not paying out someone correctly,

62
00:03:44.863 --> 00:03:49.631
that's a high risk that they're gonna
find out that you did that, right?

63
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.657
I would also argue it's ethically,

64
00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:55.381
you should probably pay people
the money if they're due, but it's

65
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:59.843
a very risky thing because people keep
track of their money very, very closely.

66
00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:04.994
I'm sure you can imagine like less
risky situations of like, what happens

67
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:09.752
if someone sends a direct message and
it fails to send the first time.

68
00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:13.347
So they have to send it again, not
incredibly risky is particularly if it's

69
00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:15.213
like a low likelihood of tap and right.

70
00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:18.708
I would judge that to be a low risk
kind of situation where the failure

71
00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:22.775
state is not very expensive and the
recovery state is extremely easy for them.

72
00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:24.341
It's not preferable.

73
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.924
It could be fixed.

74
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:31.067
It doesn't necessarily have to be
the highest prioritized thing.

75
00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:37.504
Actually, famously, Facebook notifications
for like a decade were incorrect, right?

76
00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:40.173
I don't remember if you remember
like old blue Facebook where

77
00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:43.303
you would go on there and it would be
the wrong amount of notifications and

78
00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:44.960
you'd have phantom notifications.

79
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.853
You'd click on it.

80
00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:46.844
Nothing would be there.

81
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:50.024
You'd close it again, and
then you would click it again and

82
00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.641
like it would go back and
it would never be right?

83
00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:57.232
That's because they just judged that
as like not a very impactful thing

84
00:04:57.232 --> 00:05:00.597
because the,
while it did happen to a lot of people,

85
00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:05.671
like the risk of them actually doing
anything about it was fairly low, right?

86
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:10.028
All right, so, yeah we kind of
talked about what risk is and

87
00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:12.044
all those kinds of things.

88
00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:16.584
So, complexity versus
business value matrix, right?

89
00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:19.327
This is just one that's kind of good
to keep in your mind, high impact,

90
00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:21.228
low effort, high impact, blah, blah, blah.

91
00:05:21.228 --> 00:05:24.813
Generally if if something has high impact,
low effort, that's like a must do.

92
00:05:24.813 --> 00:05:27.882
If something is a low impact,
high effort, it's a throw away.

93
00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:32.116
And then here is where you kind of
have to really kind of judge things so

94
00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:36.789
this is just a useful way to kind of
visualize okay if I'm in this one I'm just

95
00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.264
gonna do it right away.

96
00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:42.415
And this one,
if I'm in this one I'm not gonna do it and

97
00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:47.198
then if I'm in one of these that's
when I'll go to the like more

98
00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:51.013
advanced matrix of how
to judge prioritization.

99
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:55.627
So I talked about it before, but
I'll talk about it here again.

100
00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:58.576
This is the RICE method,
and it is from Intercom,

101
00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:02.028
which is a company that many
of us have used great company.

102
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:06.294
I like this one really resonated with me.

103
00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:08.563
So there's many ways to judge priority,
and

104
00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:10.962
this is just the one that
stuck with me the most.

105
00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:12.697
So this is what I'm gonna teach you.

106
00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:17.012
But if it doesn't resonate with you, there
are lots of other ones just search for

107
00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:21.021
prioritization framework and Google and
you will find a trillion of them.

108
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:24.939
So at intercom apparently they do this for
everything and

109
00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.885
they always judge correctly by the score.

110
00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:31.998
I am not such a stickler for
the rules here.

111
00:06:31.998 --> 00:06:37.331
I still allow for my own sense of product
sense to be infused here because this is,

112
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.616
we're this is a squishy science.

113
00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:44.040
So, you're being paid for
your opinion here.

114
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.914
So, use it.

115
00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:48.505
So, the RICE method R is reach,

116
00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:53.294
which is how many people will this effect?

117
00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:58.153
It's generally a good proxy for
the reach of whatever you're going to do.

118
00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:02.340
It helps you kind of avoid,
this will be so impactful,

119
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.353
particularly when it comes to power users,
right?

120
00:07:06.353 --> 00:07:08.424
Because power users will be very loud.

121
00:07:08.424 --> 00:07:11.207
Hey, we really want this
feature yesterday, but

122
00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:14.585
when you would go ask yourself,
What's the reach of this and

123
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:19.834
it's only 100 people out of your 100,000
users, it helps you kind of keep in line.

124
00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:25.224
Yeah, maybe this is good for our 100
people and that's impactful to them but

125
00:07:25.224 --> 00:07:30.546
we don't have to cater to their every
whim because we have so many other users.

126
00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:33.712
Okay, so after reach.

127
00:07:33.712 --> 00:07:36.444
Yeah, and
this is measured in people quarterly or

128
00:07:36.444 --> 00:07:39.250
people whatever time
period you're looking for.

129
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.672
So let's say it was 400,000, right,

130
00:07:42.672 --> 00:07:47.247
people in a quarter,
that's what your number would be here.

131
00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:53.003
Impact is a scale value for
how impactful something will be.

132
00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:59.000
And the numbers that they give here is
3 is the massive most awesome impact,

133
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.154
2 is for high impact, 1 is for
medium impact or average impact,

134
00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:08.395
0.5 is for low impact and
0.25 is for minimal.

135
00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:10.087
So I think you can see how reach and

136
00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:14.140
impact are kind of combining together to
get you a good number of what we should be

137
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.004
thinking about if you affect
all of your million users.

138
00:08:17.004 --> 00:08:18.923
And it's minimal impact,

139
00:08:18.923 --> 00:08:23.937
that's actually better than high
impact for a hundred users, right?

140
00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:30.048
So it kind of helps you keep us
a grip on reach versus impact.

141
00:08:30.048 --> 00:08:35.394
How many people is this affecting versus
how much does it affect them, okay.

142
00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:37.515
Confidence, I quite liked
this one as well, and

143
00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.172
a lot of other things didn't
have this kind of built into it.

144
00:08:40.172 --> 00:08:45.214
But confidence is like, how confident
are you in your estimations here, right?

145
00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:51.297
So I am 50% sure, this is going to do
exactly what I think it's gonna do, right?

146
00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:55.958
And if you do that,
then you are 0.5 right?

147
00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:00.657
And so you have whatever you thought
your reach at times impact was and

148
00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:06.018
if you're 100% confident that this is
definitely going to do this right?

149
00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:10.377
A good example is like if I don't fix the
database my website's not gonna come back

150
00:09:10.377 --> 00:09:11.588
up that's 100%.

151
00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:13.874
I am definitely confident
if I don't have a database,

152
00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:15.378
my website doesn't work, right?

153
00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:20.358
Whereas, like, if I add an additional
button here for them to see their profile,

154
00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:24.274
I'm like 50% confident that's
gonna do anything, right.

155
00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:29.802
So that's kind of what that value helps
you do is it helps you kind of scale down.

156
00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:33.794
Based on how confident you
are in your assessments there.

157
00:09:33.794 --> 00:09:38.204
They say for anything that you are less
than 50% confident in, go revise

158
00:09:38.204 --> 00:09:42.975
your hypothesis until you arrive to
something that you are 50% confident in.

159
00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:47.002
Don't do anything under 50% confidence.

160
00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:49.902
Because that means if
you're leaning towards it,

161
00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:51.797
this is probably not gonna work.

162
00:09:51.797 --> 00:09:54.710
So go find something that
you think is gonna work.

163
00:09:54.710 --> 00:10:01.439
Okay, and then E is for effort.

164
00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:03.586
This is how many people working for

165
00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:07.001
how long to ship it measured
in person months, right?

166
00:10:07.001 --> 00:10:13.085
So if a project needs three days for
two months, it is a six on effort, right?

167
00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:20.263
Once you have your numbers,
it is reach times impact times confidence

168
00:10:20.263 --> 00:10:23.968
divided by effort, and
that yields you a RICE score.

169
00:10:23.968 --> 00:10:28.775
Now you have more or less apples
to apples number of this is how

170
00:10:28.775 --> 00:10:32.365
impactful I think this
thing's going to be.

171
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.818
And I use this somewhat frequently
when I have things in front of me that

172
00:10:39.818 --> 00:10:44.338
I'm not really sure which one's
more important than the other.

173
00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:46.627
I don't do this for my entire roadmap.

174
00:10:46.627 --> 00:10:48.667
I probably should, and
I know people that do.

175
00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:51.421
I generally just use it
as a tool to break ties.

176
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.748
So it's a tool for discussion it's a
school for unlogged jamming conversations

177
00:10:59.748 --> 00:11:03.625
I actually like this to take in
a meeting sometimes as like, hey.

178
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:08.045
Let's like break down which of these is
more important than the other it helps

179
00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:11.798
you get talking to other people
in terms of reach and confidence.

180
00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:14.831
And you can argue over things like
we think this is high impactful,

181
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:17.336
we think this is low confidence,
blah, blah, blah.

182
00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:21.545
But at least you're talking about
something in particular rather than like,

183
00:11:21.545 --> 00:11:23.851
this is more important than this, right?

184
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:28.127
It helps break it down into
values that you can talk about.

185
00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:36.049
But I wouldn't take this as gospel cuz I
think if you do that, you end up doing

186
00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:41.592
probably things that you probably end
up deprioritizing some of your betts.

187
00:11:41.592 --> 00:11:45.813
And sometimes that product sense,
that gut feeling is really important,

188
00:11:45.813 --> 00:11:47.091
as a product manager.
