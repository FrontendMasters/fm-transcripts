1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.800
This was me, again, we were talking
about people skimming docs, right?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.709
What's the first thing
you saw on this page?

3
00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.947
You might have seen one of the headings,
but

4
00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:10.500
I imagine many of you saw that right away,
right?

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.863
Most people skim docs.

6
00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:15.168
Hopefully proved my point right away.

7
00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.110
Again, we were talking about most people
write like they're in high school,

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.273
in high school essays, right?

9
00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:25.610
At least for me, I did not use much
formatting in my high school essays.

10
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.060
I didn't use bold,
a lot of it was handwritten, right?

11
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.300
So I couldn't really, I mean, I don't have
good enough handwriting to bold something.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.089
Or is that even a good form?

13
00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:35.680
How do you do that anyway?

14
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.417
I don't know cuz I don't care.

15
00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:43.390
[LAUGH] I'm not writing missives
to my colleagues, maybe I should.

16
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.177
So this is an underutilized
feature of people not

17
00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:52.039
using formatting to their advantage.

18
00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.216
You're under no restriction of
being able to use formatting, and

19
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:57.780
I encourage you to use lots
of formatting in your doc.

20
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.963
Because it helps people draw their eyes
and read little bits here and there.

21
00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.482
And those are like little
hooks to people saying like,

22
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.799
I imagine parties, most people skimmed us.

23
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.220
And then you probably read the next
sentence, or at least started to, right?

24
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.033
Very common, so you can kind of use
those as like jumping off points to,

25
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.873
as we were talking about earlier,
to unbury leads, right?

26
00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:24.802
So headings, that's another good one,
making sure you have a good format for

27
00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.380
getting headings on it.

28
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.476
That's why I use headings all over my docs
here, so that people that come by later

29
00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:34.950
can just kinda skim through as like, okay,
I'm interested in bold and color, right?

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.747
But headings are really important for
visual hierarchy.

31
00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:43.214
You see this, and you either made
a decision really quickly like, I'm

32
00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:48.663
interested in why he chose to use headings
here, I'm gonna read part of this, right?

33
00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:52.293
Or you're like, I get it,
use headings, I agree with that, and

34
00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:54.940
I don't need to read more of that, right?

35
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.889
I already agree with his point there.

36
00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.794
It's a mini decision point to say like, I
am either interested in this and I'm gonna

37
00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:05.369
read more about it, or I disagree with
it and I'm not gonna be convinced now.

38
00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.700
Or, I agree with this, I need no
more context, I'm moving on, right?

39
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.249
It's kind of like a secret weapon to
not convince people that don't need

40
00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.364
convincing, right?

41
00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:23.750
So bold and
color are your secret weapons, right?

42
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.601
Adding bold helps a lot because it
immediately draws your eye in here.

43
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:29.322
And I'm gonna say that italicizing,

44
00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:33.770
you probably didn't even notice that
that was italicized, immediately anyway.

45
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.803
So I'm gonna say you don't
use italics the same way.

46
00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:40.511
You can use underlining,
that's another one that can be helpful.

47
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:43.640
And strikethrough is actually
fairly effective for

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.413
people to realize like, there's some
something being crossed out here.

49
00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.830
Color can be a lot of fun too.

50
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.450
The only thing I'm gonna say is a lot
of us work for multinational companies.

51
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.612
And what you think a color means
something in some culture is

52
00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.680
wildly different in a different culture.

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.424
So I put a little infographic
in here from Colors in Cultures,

54
00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:09.450
this is a weird infographic,
it's hard to read.

55
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.510
So this is actually a bad example of
communication, in my opinion, but

56
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.990
it was pretty, so
I put it in here nonetheless.

57
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.930
But you can see here, A represents
Western/America, so A1 is anger.

58
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.220
So red means anger in these cultures.

59
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.649
But in C, which is,

60
00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:30.790
Hindu, that means black means
anger in that particular culture.

61
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.550
The one that we love to use
in business is red and green.

62
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.690
Green means it went up,
red means it went down.

63
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.070
It is the opposite in eastern cultures,
right?

64
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.575
So, in other words, if you're using color
to convey meaning, in addition to drawing

65
00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:48.940
someone's eye, be extremely careful of who
your audience is and where they're from.

66
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.664
I've made that mistake,
this is why I know that [LAUGH].

67
00:03:53.664 --> 00:04:00.131
I got asked by a Japanese colleague
why I was using red to mean bad.

68
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.206
When if you're looking
a stock ticker in Japan,

69
00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:05.532
red means the stock went up that day.

70
00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:13.111
&gt;&gt; Also a call out, red-green color blind,
in an Excel doc, very hard to read.

71
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:16.732
&gt;&gt; Also a very good point,
be careful with accessibility.

72
00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:21.342
There's a strong amount of percentage of
people that have red-green color blindness

73
00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:24.003
as an addition to other
kinds of color blindness.

74
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:29.850
Almost all text editors now provide
the ability to add a table of contents.

75
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.526
In a long doc, I suggest that so

76
00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:35.210
someone can kind of just read
the information taxonomy at a glance.

77
00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:41.072
That's certainly useful,
again, if you have a 20-pager,

78
00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.292
anything probably over like 3 pages.

79
00:04:46.174 --> 00:04:49.102
And then the last thing here is,
and this is kind of fun.

80
00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:51.770
This is gonna strongly depend
on your company's culture.

81
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.719
Some companies would view
this as unprofessional.

82
00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.030
But for example, Snowflake loves them, we
have emojis everywhere and on everything.

83
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.270
And so your eye was probably
drawn pretty quick to this.

84
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.621
It was probably drawn
pretty quick to that.

85
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:10.768
Emojis can be kind of fun in
a way to draw attention to

86
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:13.765
particular parts of your document.

87
00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:17.181
Again, don't be unprofessional, that's
gonna depend strongly where you are.

88
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:23.520
I imagine if you're in banking or
medicine, that might be different.

89
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.920
But at a large data company,
it works pretty well.

90
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.686
&gt;&gt; I like using bullet points too.

91
00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:31.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually
a really good call out here.

92
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.470
I use them, I probably overuse them.

93
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.320
But it's really good way to separate,
here's a point, here's a point,

94
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.010
here's a point.

95
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.510
&gt;&gt; You don't have to go through sentences
and get lost in a paragraph of stuff.

96
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.873
&gt;&gt; It allows you to say less.

97
00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:48.163
It's a good visual hierarchy tool for
saying less,

98
00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:52.520
as opposed to having sentences that
run into some sort of narrative.

99
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.909
It kind of allows you to separate
your narrative into points.

100
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.760
So yeah, that's totally great.

101
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.340
Using an unordered list and
an ordered list,

102
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.390
that's something that
people should think about.

103
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.357
So bullet points are great when
there's no necessary hierarchy.

104
00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:11.830
And then using like 1, 2, 3, 4, a, b,
c, d, is great to communicate order.

105
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.063
&gt;&gt; Importance of why we should use them.

106
00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:15.819
&gt;&gt; Most important, least important,
whatever that is, or

107
00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.420
do these steps in these orders or
something like that.
