1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.770
Spoiler alert, I'm gonna ask you to write
a product spec here in just a second.

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.270
However, I thought it was unfair for
me to not just show you an example first.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.242
So I'm actually gonna show you
the answer first, right, and

4
00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:14.080
then I'm gonna ask you the question.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.560
So I came up with a random product idea
while I was sitting there on the couch.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.294
Let's pretend for
a moment you're a PM at Netflix and

7
00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.877
your task is to add a feature that
allows users to video chat like Zoom or

8
00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:31.440
FaceTime with someone and watch
a synchronized stream of a show together.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.947
So imagine you're doing a long distance
relationship, you're in Seattle and

10
00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.380
she's in New York or something like that.

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.332
So you could watch your show together
with your significant other or

12
00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.330
something like that.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.581
Or maybe your friend wants to watch
you watch love, death and robots,

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:52.123
cuz that show`s weird and
it elicits feelings from people,

15
00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:55.972
and don't watch it unless
you're an adult [LAUGH].

16
00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.863
So, that would be another
reason that someone might wanna

17
00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:00.640
watch that with someone together.

18
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.620
Is that a good idea?

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.140
I don't know.

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.740
But let's say we put together a product
spec to then go say maybe we wanna try

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.640
this, maybe we don't wanna try this.

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.829
Here's how I would write that spec.

23
00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.376
For the record by the way,
I don't think this is a good idea, but

24
00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.360
it was one that was easy to
produce a product spec for.

25
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.008
So I wrote this last but Netflix users
frequently express a desire to watch shows

26
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:31.680
with friends and family remotely while
engaging in real-time discussions.

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.500
Previous attempts to implement such a
feature have not met the desired results.

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.770
The goal is to provide users with the
ability to watch Netflix content together,

29
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.017
regardless of their devices, and

30
00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.439
have a synchronous video
chat similar to FaceTime.

31
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.410
Does that describe the project
to you more or less?

32
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.550
ChatGPT, I don't think I
even modified that one.

33
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.269
That one was actually quite pleased
with that came out with, so

34
00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:56.460
I just stuck with that one.

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.222
So problem statement,
this is blown out a little bit.

36
00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:06.900
I actually put the user story directly
right there, I'll frequently do that.

37
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.135
I talked a little bit about here that
Netflix has tried this before and

38
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:15.751
it has been met with varied success here,
but we still get requests for it.

39
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.750
So there's still a problem here
that users are looking to solve,

40
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.230
here's another attempt at it.

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.341
Where I can put statistics in here, I'll
usually do that as, hey, this has come up

42
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:31.550
this many times during support tickets or
X% of requests from this.

43
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.800
And so
here's our proposal to solve said problem.

44
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.407
Goals, allow two people
to watch a show together,

45
00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:47.204
regardless of the device type as
long as it has audio or video.

46
00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:52.004
We make no attempt to shows things that
like it's available in one region and

47
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.060
not in another.

48
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.032
We do wanna allow users to pause, scrub
is what you do when you move back and

49
00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:02.301
forward in time in a video,
that thing is called the scrubber.

50
00:03:02.301 --> 00:03:04.543
Have it work for
both users at the same time and

51
00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:06.670
allow users to use their own subs and
dubs.

52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.217
So, if I'm hanging out with
my Japanese friend and

53
00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:12.963
they wanna watch in Japanese and
I want to watch in English, that's okay.

54
00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:16.847
Non-goals, cuz you can imagine someone's
gonna raise their hand in the back of

55
00:03:16.847 --> 00:03:18.010
the meeting.

56
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.580
What if I wanna do it with three of us,
right?

57
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.130
This allows us to explicitly say,
not for this version.

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.497
If this is wildly successful v2 of
this sure, let's do three users.

59
00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.447
We're not trying to sell for
anyone that doesn't have video device,

60
00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:35.660
we're not making webcams, we're not
going to do anything of that nature.

61
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.057
And we're not gonna do anything to
encourage users to chat without watching

62
00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:40.850
a video, right?

63
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.450
So we're not gonna allow them to just use
Netflix as FaceTime essentially, okay?

64
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:55.049
Key metrics, time watching Netflix using
Watch Together, time spent in chat total.

65
00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.450
We wanna check specifically, is this
driving referrals of Netflix, right?

66
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.217
So if I sign up for Netflix and
then immediately use this feature,

67
00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:07.188
it probably means that other person
influenced me to try it and do it so

68
00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:10.030
that we could watch it together, right?

69
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.794
Like if I have it and maybe my
girlfriend doesn't have it, right?

70
00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:16.497
I probably got her to do it so
that we could watch it together or

71
00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:17.510
something like that.

72
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.243
Month-over-month on retention.

73
00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:23.130
I imagine a lot of users are gonna
try this and then not try it again.

74
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.705
That's a very common pattern of usage, so
I wanna make sure this people are finding

75
00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:28.760
enough use in this that
they continue to use it.

76
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.481
And then are they satisfied with this?

77
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:35.836
We'll give them a little post surveys
like, was this feature useful to you or

78
00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:37.850
did you have problems blah, blah?

79
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.969
This is obviously a big experiment so
rollback criteria here is,

80
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.260
after three months we'll look at
initial metrics if we can pivot.

81
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.210
After six months we're gonna expect to see
and we'll look at it again, six months and

82
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.334
then if by nine months we don't see
any sort of growth during that time,

83
00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:56.310
we will begin with
winding down the feature.

84
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.600
Netflix is really good about this.

85
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.493
I'm sure a lot of you have seen Netflix
will try things and then spin it down,

86
00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:03.032
right?

87
00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:07.904
Trying to think if there's any good
examples that I can point out to.

88
00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:11.439
Skip Intro was experiment that
we ran while I was there and

89
00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.510
we had no idea that people would
actually use it frequently.

90
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.013
Cuz we generally had a hypothesis once
people click play they don't really care

91
00:05:19.013 --> 00:05:20.040
what happens.

92
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.070
Turns out that was very not true,
it's extremely popular, right?

93
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.801
So that was one of them
we found surprising, and

94
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:29.950
it would have been rolled back
if people hadn't used it.

95
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.550
Timelines, product specking period,
this red dot is where we are today.

96
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.890
Technical architecture design working
from the same time development.

97
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.763
We'll have a product review here,
a beta release here and

98
00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:46.094
general availability here,
if it's works out.

99
00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:48.992
And then I pulled out the date
specifically because cuz that's something

100
00:05:48.992 --> 00:05:50.480
that executives want to see.

101
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.770
Okay, and here's my Mock UX, right?

102
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.811
I literally just went on my phone and
just took screenshots and

103
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.339
drew over with MacOS Preview.

104
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.595
So, user opens their app and with the show
that they wanna watch, they click on watch

105
00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:10.640
together you can see here I put a little
emoji there with some text on it, right?

106
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.799
You can see as that this
color doesn't match,

107
00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:17.650
this is definitely not centered,
who cares, right?

108
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.450
This communicates my point, perfectly.

109
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.450
Little modal shows up.

110
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.783
This one already exists in Netflix,

111
00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.680
I didn't even have to
redesign that at all, right?

112
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.725
User shares the link with their friend and

113
00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:32.650
then they end up on
watching something up here.

114
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.208
You can tell this is obviously
not the correct video, but

115
00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.807
you know what I'm talking about and

116
00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:40.181
I'm not gonna spend a bunch of time
trying to make this look anything else.

117
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:45.180
As you can see, this probably took me what
all of 30 seconds to draw some boxes and

118
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.783
put some emojis on a page.

119
00:06:46.783 --> 00:06:50.879
And then I took a stock photo and
put it right there.

120
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.875
Done, but you know exactly
what I'm talking about, right?

121
00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:59.403
So caveat there, that's a stock photo and
got it from Unsplash and

122
00:06:59.403 --> 00:07:02.880
the designs belong to Netflix
with only minor edits for me.

123
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.747
That's what I'm talking about with these
super low fidelity super hacky kind of

124
00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:08.750
designs.

125
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.290
This is what I want you to do.

126
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.080
I want you to be crafty about it.

127
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.689
I want you to be fast.

128
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.360
I don't want you to spend
a bunch of time on this.

129
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.008
Think if I had gone into Photoshop and
spent a bunch of time on this,

130
00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:26.905
I would have spent, I don't know
10 extra time, 20 extra time and

131
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:30.818
how much more effective would
have that been in my spec?

132
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:33.910
I'm gonna say exactly zero
percent more effective, right?

133
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.390
Maybe you might impress was, this shiny
man maybe I like it a little bit better.

134
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.390
But is that worth hours and
days of your life, you're wasting time.

135
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.910
I'm trying to get you
to not waste time here.

136
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.220
Outstanding questions, frequently,
a lot of my questions are legal.

137
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.521
Like, hey, I don't know if we can
secure content rights for this.

138
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.738
And then I put a technical one in here is,
hey, are we gonna do this over?

139
00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:05.744
WebRTC, are we gonna do a vendor thing
are we gonna build something in house?

140
00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:08.688
We haven't decided that yet
that's a big open question,

141
00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.319
I'll put that in there as well.

142
00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:15.364
And then the appendix here I just
put a bunch of links to other docs

143
00:08:15.364 --> 00:08:20.235
I didn't write these docs, but
imagine these docs existed.

144
00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:25.060
Here is one that talks about off-the-shelf
vendors that we could look at.

145
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.514
Here is one that is, what is Hulu,
what is HBO Max doing in this space,

146
00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:32.169
what is Amazon Prime doing in this space?

147
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.686
And here is a retrospective of the Xbox
app that we launched once upon a time and

148
00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:41.203
the Windows after launch once upon a time
and why this is different from them,

149
00:08:41.203 --> 00:08:41.709
right?

150
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.198
That doesn't need to go into product spec,
but I can imagine someone saying,

151
00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:48.010
haven't we tried this before?

152
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.820
Why is this different?

153
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.184
And I was like, let me point
you to the doc that says, hey,

154
00:08:51.184 --> 00:08:53.621
we've tried this before,
why is this different, right?

155
00:08:57.048 --> 00:09:01.805
Cool, and that's a pretty basic product
spec that I feel pretty okay going into

156
00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:07.210
a product review with, hey, here's kind of
everything that I'm thinking about here.

157
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.020
What do you all think about this?

158
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.950
There's plenty of here to discuss and
it keeps it pretty focused on.

159
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.772
Here's what I wanna build,
here's how I wanna build it,

160
00:09:13.772 --> 00:09:14.790
here's why I wanna build it.
