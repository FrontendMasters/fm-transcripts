00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay, so I'm gonna give you
a little bit of an exercise here.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.458
I'm only gonna actually, yeah,
so I'll give you this exercise.

3
00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:10.222
I'm gonna say, if you don't have
a preference, use Drawings, or

4
00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:13.999
perhaps Excalidraw, or Eraser,
that looks interesting as well.

5
00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.665
I just like these two cuz I think you
can get started without even signing up,

6
00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:18.419
which is nice.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.014
I think Excalidraw also has a VS Code
plugin, which I have not tried, but

8
00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:24.380
seems like it's a cool idea.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.056
So I want you to diagram
out some sort of timeline.

10
00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:37.503
Let's work under the assumption of
the formatting exercise that we just did.

11
00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:42.637
That, well, I'll let you interpret that
however you choose to interpret it.

12
00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.070
But yeah there's a two-week
delay in the project.

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.073
How can you use a little diagram to
show that we're two weeks behind,

14
00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:57.519
we have two more weeks of UX
research due than we have.

15
00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:04.300
Yeah, we can immediately
test those designs.

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.394
So you have to do UX research.

17
00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:08.266
You have to do more designs, and
then you have to do dev work.

18
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:15.650
The dev work and
the UX research can happen simultaneously.

19
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.919
That's the point that I want you to
communicate to people that are watching or

20
00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:20.516
reading.

21
00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.819
Yeah, the team is gonna take
two weeks in August to design.

22
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.299
No other work can start
until the design finishes.

23
00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.986
Then once the designs are done,

24
00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:34.170
both the UX research can start
which will take two weeks, and

25
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.560
the developers can start their coding
implementation which will take four weeks.

26
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.721
So point that I'm trying to get you
to communicate here, and again,

27
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.100
this is another useful thing,
is, who am I telling what?

28
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.057
Your visualization is supposed
to emphasize the overlapping

29
00:01:53.057 --> 00:01:57.260
nature of the development work and
the UX research.

30
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.070
So I won't spend too much time on this.

31
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.449
I think you all know what an effective
graphic here would look like.

32
00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:07.619
But I would just open drawing.new,

33
00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.119
and I would spend the minimum
amount of time possible here.

34
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:17.617
And I would just use boxes,
cuz anything more than this is,

35
00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:21.150
you're probably spinning
your wheels too much.

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.510
So I would say this would be UX work,

37
00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:34.270
Two weeks, and then copy and
paste that twice.

38
00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.430
The other thing is, I don't know
how many of you have used Notion.

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.930
Notion will do this if you
just describe something to it.

40
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.434
It'll just kind of diagram that out for
you.

41
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.710
Obviously, I'm going fast here because I
don't wanna spend too much time on this.

42
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.410
But I mean, even this at the very least,
this would be the UX work.

43
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.349
This would be the design work.

44
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:16.140
And depending on how you want to,
you can just do a screenshot of that.

45
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.697
Save to Clipboard, ready to go, right?

46
00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.650
Like that.

47
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.375
That's essentially as much time as
I would probably spend on this.

48
00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:27.428
[COUGH] And then maybe you might put in
dates here, or some sort of milestones so

49
00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:32.794
they can kind of really visually, you can
really drive home we're starting now,

50
00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:36.900
on this day you can expect
everything to come in, right?

51
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.329
Cuz that's kinda your point is,
we're not panicking,

52
00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.630
we're delaying the project two weeks so
that we can get everything aligned.

53
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.900
Any questions here?

54
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.921
Honestly, I would spend a tiny bit more
time with this to make sure that, yeah,

55
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:56.610
at a glance this might help.

56
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.238
But I might clean it up a little bit just
particularly to get the dates on there.

57
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.609
And that might be in the case
I just might do some lines.

58
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.249
And maybe a text box.

59
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.601
Come on, why don't I say like
September 3rd or something like,

60
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:30.290
I don't know I'm making stuff up, but
I don't know, something of that nature.

61
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.438
We'll see this in the product spec
one up here when it's coming up, but

62
00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:35.970
I'll just show you here.

63
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.827
This one I actually did with
this website time.graphics,

64
00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:41.930
which I think is a paid service.

65
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.590
But this actually wasn't very hard either.

66
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.078
I just described dates, and
at this date this takes three months,

67
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.350
at this date this takes two months.

68
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.730
And here's some milestones
that I wanted to show in here.

69
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.480
That took me probably all of 20, 25
minutes to get all that to look like that.

70
00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:02.182
So time.graphics,
that worked really well for the timeline.

71
00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:05.239
I actually just discovered that for
this course.
