1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.104
So let's talk about TPMs.

2
00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:04.880
And I also was informed recently
that they, those can be called PMTs,

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.229
which that was new to me.

4
00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:08.866
I think that's an Amazon term, maybe.

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.994
I don't know.

6
00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:12.323
What is a TPM?

7
00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:14.232
It really depends on
the company you're at.

8
00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:15.793
This strongly depends on your company.

9
00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:20.845
I think Facebook calls products
managers that work on technical things,

10
00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:22.564
so that would be me a TPM.

11
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.047
Which is extremely strange to me.

12
00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:27.717
I've seen other companies,
Stripe comes to mind.

13
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:32.677
They call their process managers or
like you know project managers but

14
00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:37.398
like projects on like a much grander
scale, they call those TPMS.

15
00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:41.867
So, yeah, like project manager
is concerned with process and

16
00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:45.421
intercompany relations,
they call those TPMs.

17
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.946
So I'm not gonna really draw too much on
what I think a TPM is because that one is

18
00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:51.892
so strongly contextual to
the company that you're working at.

19
00:00:51.892 --> 00:00:56.460
It's nonsensical to try and define it.

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.296
The only time that I really
worked with TPS was at Stripe and

21
00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:04.465
what's funny is I brought,
her name is Maggie Johnson Pinto.

22
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:05.579
She's awesome.

23
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.053
We were together at Microsoft.

24
00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:10.109
We were both program managers
on sister teams, and

25
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.029
then we went to Stripe at the same
time within weeks of each other.

26
00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:18.394
She was a TPM and I became a PM And it
kind of like delineates that at Microsoft

27
00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:22.483
those were the same things, and
they consider us the same position and

28
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:27.021
at Stripe, they was like, you're in
very different tracks now, right?

29
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.778
So you'll find that your abilities
kind of snap to different positions at

30
00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:33.323
different companies.

31
00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:38.211
Which is always it's always
strange to me but in particular,

32
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:44.697
if I was gonna start a company, and I was
gonna define what TPM meant at my company,

33
00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:49.596
it would be, you have ten teams
working on a similar project.

34
00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:51.657
How do those teams work together?

35
00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:52.882
That's what I would have a TPM do.

36
00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:56.842
They would define the process and
the overhead, basically, of like, okay,

37
00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:00.210
before we have anything go out
we're gonna have a product review.

38
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.692
We're gonna have an end review, and they
would run those kind of like reviews, and

39
00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:05.752
they would have those
kind of like checkpoints.

40
00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:09.476
And like they wouldn't necessarily concern
themselves with what's in those product

41
00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:13.148
reviews, but they would concern themselves
with running those kinds of processes to

42
00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:16.074
make sure that everyone's aligned and
moving correctly, right?

43
00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:19.898
And then you would have project
managers defining the sprints for

44
00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:21.646
all those individual teams.

45
00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:24.742
It sounds complicated,
it's cuz it's complicated, right?

46
00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:26.723
There's no really no two ways about that.

47
00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:34.742
Program managers, this was my title at
Microsoft, another just it doesn't make

48
00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:39.122
any sense unless you're talking about,
like, I'm a program manager.

49
00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:41.398
The next question you should ask is,
at what company?

50
00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:45.393
Because program managers can be managing,
like, horizontal initiatives,

51
00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.339
kind of what I was talking about here.

52
00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.220
So that's what I did a lot of Microsoft
was I would manage like developer

53
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.829
experience across all of Azure, which
affects every single team at Azure, right?

54
00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.269
And so I was a program manager because
I managed the program of developer

55
00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.161
experience.

56
00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:06.099
Other program managers that I worked with
at Microsoft just worked on one product.

57
00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.897
They were product managers, right?

58
00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:12.311
So it's really gonna depend on what
company you're talking about there.

59
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.793
I was gonna call out PMMs,
because you see that one quite a bit.

60
00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:20.413
Product marketing managers, they're
typically people that are like paired with

61
00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:23.581
a product manager that market
that particular product.

62
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:26.975
So they're a function of marketing
they're not a function of product.

63
00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:31.124
Though, famously,
Apple has combined those positions, so

64
00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:35.923
if you're a PM at Apple, you also
market your product as well, right?

65
00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:41.893
And I think recently Shopify did
that as well, so that's there's kind

66
00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:48.276
of some tailwind behind product managers
doing more marketing functions.

67
00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:49.719
I've never done marketing.

68
00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.076
I don't know if I'd be
particularly good at it.

69
00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:54.984
I guess I've done developer relations,
which is essentially marketing,

70
00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.995
though I'm pretty sure I just offended
a ton of people by saying that out loud.

71
00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:59.982
I said the quiet part out loud.

72
00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:03.685
But, I mean, whatever,
fight me, I don't care.

73
00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.094
[LAUGH] Wouldn't be a Brian Hall,
of course,

74
00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:09.797
if I didn't offend a lot of people.

75
00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:13.268
So anyway PMMs, if you have a good PMM
that works with you, it's awesome because

76
00:04:13.268 --> 00:04:16.707
you get to build really cool stuff, and
then they get to go tell people about it.

77
00:04:16.707 --> 00:04:18.080
So you get people using your stuff.

78
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.928
So a good PMM is worth
their weight in gold.

79
00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:24.312
I mean, hopefully I'm communicating across
all these positions are they're all people

80
00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:26.553
that if you work with them,
and they're good at their job.

81
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:30.905
They're extremely valuable to you and
even if I don't wanna do their jobs,

82
00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:34.243
I'm very happy that someone
is doing those jobs, right?

83
00:04:34.243 --> 00:04:36.039
When you're evaluating PM positions,

84
00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.541
make sure you are evaluating what am I
actually gonna be doing at your company?

85
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:43.181
Because it's actually wildly
different between companies, and

86
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:47.666
there's some product management positions
that I just wouldn't be good at, and

87
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:48.914
I wouldn't wanna do.

88
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.676
Because again,
you're you are the space between teams.

89
00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:56.616
You are the glue that kind of holds teams
together, and you might not end up doing

90
00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:01.114
the things that you like about it like
I love strategy and there's a lot of

91
00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:05.435
there's positions at Microsoft
that are like no strategy, right?

92
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:08.365
It's really just execution over and
over and over again and

93
00:05:08.365 --> 00:05:11.467
like I can do that I just don't
wanna write like I wanna be on like

94
00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.532
defining like what are we gonna be doing.

95
00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:15.603
How are we serving customers?

96
00:05:15.603 --> 00:05:20.185
I love talking to customers it's one
of my favorite parts about being

97
00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:23.113
a product manager, so it strongly varies.

98
00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:27.062
And I think it's a steward of you to
observe that companies always ship their

99
00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:30.270
org chart like 100% of the time,
no matter what happens,

100
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.805
how are you formed your company is
how you're gonna ship products.

101
00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:35.159
And I think that also,

102
00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.591
the product manager is always a function
of what the org chart looks like.

103
00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.708
So that's probably another good thing for

104
00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:45.643
you to ask is like, how is your company
organized because that'll tell you a lot

105
00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:48.011
about what you're about
to get yourself into.

106
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.596
&gt;&gt; I feel like it would make sense for

107
00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:56.513
the product manager to own the marketing
as well, cuz if you own the strategy and

108
00:05:56.513 --> 00:06:00.453
the long-term vision, I think you should
be held responsible for selling it.

109
00:06:00.453 --> 00:06:02.849
Cuz if you build a product
that nobody wants to use,

110
00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.658
then you just spent a lot of money and
time on something that nobody's gonna use.

111
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:11.580
&gt;&gt; You're straight in Tim Cook's camp,
you are like right there with them.

112
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.190
Just give them a high five and
ask him for another iPhone, right?

113
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.593
I don't know,
I don't think I disagree with you.

114
00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:21.561
I think the only issue,
if you made me tomorrow responsible for

115
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.480
all of my own marketing,
I'm just not good at it yet, right?

116
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.290
I could figure it out,
I think I will even like it.

117
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.730
But it's not some,

118
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.583
I could not replace Krista who I work with
who is phenomenal at marketing, right?

119
00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:37.876
That's the only concern that
I would have with that.

120
00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:41.397
So it's good that Krista owns
that part of the company.

121
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.943
But I think, the bridge that I could add
to that statement is like, if you don't

122
00:06:46.943 --> 00:06:50.952
own your marketing, you should work
extremely close with your marketing.

123
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.618
All of my products that I
before I even start working on,

124
00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:58.910
I meet with legal, I meet with security,
I meet with marketing.

125
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.031
I meet with developer relations, and

126
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.821
so all of them are kind of like aware
of the stuff and start building.

127
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.741
And so sometimes marketing is like, hey,
maybe let's do this, this has had a better

128
00:07:08.741 --> 00:07:11.746
fit here, or we can sell this better or
blah, blah blah, right?

129
00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:14.672
And so
I get input really early into that system.

130
00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:18.878
Using those partners is critical
to shipping the right product.

131
00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:24.100
&gt;&gt; How important is being tactical when

132
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.179
being a product manager,
having coding skills?

133
00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:35.752
&gt;&gt; Let me give a roundabout
answer to that.

134
00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:37.473
It served me.

135
00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:41.792
And so you have to acknowledge my
survivorship bias here that like, for me,

136
00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:44.768
it's been extremely useful,
and I call on it a lot.

137
00:07:44.768 --> 00:07:47.472
I write a lot of demos from
the stuff that I work on.

138
00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:50.092
I write code.

139
00:07:50.092 --> 00:07:53.830
Whenever I'm creating a product spec,
I'll go write sample codes.

140
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.832
I hope it looks like this by
the time that we're done.

141
00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:02.957
So it's a tool that I leverage personally
a lot in my personal journey as a PM.

142
00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.488
I'm gonna loop around say
some of the best PMs,

143
00:08:05.488 --> 00:08:08.347
I've ever worked with have
zero coding experience.

144
00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:11.093
So this is another kind of invitation for

145
00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:14.745
people to consider their
PMing journey personally.

146
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:19.569
And that here's a tool that worked for
me, but there's other tools that

147
00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:24.651
are equally or more effective than what
I have leveraged to get to where I am.

148
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:27.297
So is it critical to be a good PM?

149
00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:28.382
Absolutely not.

150
00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:30.672
Is it a cool tool to have as a PM?

151
00:08:30.672 --> 00:08:31.877
Yes.

152
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:35.677
It certainly helps that, like when I walk
into a room full of engineers that they

153
00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:38.983
try and talk over my head and
I can say, no, I've built that before.

154
00:08:38.983 --> 00:08:42.364
That's not like this has happened to me
before, like when I started trying to talk

155
00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.561
Kubernetes over my head, I was like,
man, I taught a course on Kubernetes.

156
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:47.666
Like, you can't talk over my head here.

157
00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:50.887
I used to work on Kubernetes at Microsoft,
right?

158
00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:54.457
And I think in particular for marginalized
people, that happens even more, right?

159
00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:58.113
So, it can be a critical skill, but
also, there's ways around that one,

160
00:08:58.113 --> 00:09:00.970
having some familiarity just
in general with it can help.

161
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.060
And then, also having good tech leads
that you bring with you to these kind of

162
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.419
meetings so, that you know where it's
gonna happen, that can help a lot as well.

163
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:11.019
So, there's strategies around it as well.

164
00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:15.589
So I like, I just wanna drive home the
point of like, you're special is what I'm

165
00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:20.312
trying to say, but you're different, and
you come from a different background.

166
00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:22.352
And I've seen people come from like,

167
00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:26.240
all sorts of wild different like one
of the PMs I've worked with came just

168
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.126
came directly over from marketing,
and he had such a good sense of like,

169
00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:33.592
what people wanted and
like what the community wanted to build.

170
00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:36.462
That he's really leveraged that
to become a really good PM,

171
00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:39.232
despite the fact that his
background is all in marketing.

172
00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:41.780
And so he's learned enough
about the platform to, like,

173
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.185
speak intelligently about it.

174
00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:45.558
But like,
what makes him a really great PM is that.

175
00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:50.372
He thinks about what do people want, and
how can I get this to them as a marketer?

176
00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:53.418
And that particular thing makes
him different and special than me,

177
00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:55.563
that I don't have that
marketing background.

178
00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:59.575
I have some intuition about it, but
I don't have the discipline that he has.

179
00:09:59.575 --> 00:10:03.889
So, it's about finding
your unique strengths and

180
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:08.212
leveraging those as tools
in becoming a better PM.
