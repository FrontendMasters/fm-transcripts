00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.116
I think my overarching point here is
have a point, keep people on task, and

2
00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.940
try and
get out of it what you want, right?

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.706
However you choose to approach that,
I give you some of my tips and

4
00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:13.498
I'm definitely not every PM.

5
00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.958
I'm Brian Holt and
I run my meetings a certain way.

6
00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.858
You're gonna have to find
the way that works for you.

7
00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:24.773
But I will say I've seen some very
introverted people, some very meek and

8
00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:30.574
quiet people run awesome meetings, and I'm
not the most extroverted person either.

9
00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:35.334
So don't use that as an excuse
to not own your meetings.

10
00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:41.947
It takes effort, it's hard,
it's straining, but it is work and

11
00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.238
those work is all of those things.

12
00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:48.761
So if you have more
difficulties like that,

13
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:57.088
there's people that do executive presence
training, both online or coaches.

14
00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:00.596
Strongly suggest that if that's something
that feels really difficult to you.

15
00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:04.721
They sent us through one
through my MBA program.

16
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:05.361
She was awesome.

17
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:10.951
I think she did legal at Google and
she had tons of useful tips for us.

18
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.523
So executive presence is the thing
that you wanna google for

19
00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:16.532
help with those sorts of things.

20
00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:19.931
Yeah.

21
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.403
&gt;&gt; Quick,
I would pile on in my experience.

22
00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:25.961
I'm very much an introverted individual.

23
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:29.801
It is very draining for
me to drive these kinds of meetings.

24
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:35.305
What I have found to be very helpful is,
you mentioned in your style as well,

25
00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:39.014
injecting a bit of humor,
throw a Spongebob meme.

26
00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:43.363
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; One of my last meetings a couple months

27
00:01:43.363 --> 00:01:45.464
ago, I asked the attendees,

28
00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:50.605
the punchline that I wanted to get out
of them was, what hurts right now?

29
00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:56.105
And I used a meme of a soccer player
getting kicked between the legs

30
00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:02.205
by another soccer player, because I
wanted to spur that conversation,

31
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:08.706
I wanted to break that ice, I wanted it
to be an open and lively conversation.

32
00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:13.824
I found humor to be a great tool for
helping break down

33
00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:21.171
what often feels to me very stuffy
corporate kind of communication norms.

34
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.505
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it can put people at ease,
it can open up conversations, it can get

35
00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.231
people on more of a peer-to-peer
level rather than at a hierarchy.

36
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:32.913
Have you ever heard of the HiPPO?

37
00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:37.111
The highest paid person's opinion,
yeah, is usually the thing that wins.

38
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:39.552
I hate those kind of meetings.

39
00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:44.272
If we're gonna go with the HiPPO opinion,
just don't invite me to a meeting,

40
00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:44.997
just do it.

41
00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:48.918
Just send me an email saying
this is what we're doing, right?

42
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.332
And so humor can be a good way for

43
00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:53.007
getting kind of people on that
kind of more equal playing.

44
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.301
The thing you wanna be cautious of is
sometimes you can distract from your

45
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.169
message, right?

46
00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:03.150
And so I'm just gonna, yes,
seek balance in those kind of things.

47
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.084
And as you can see here, a lot of my
presentations revolve around humor as

48
00:03:10.084 --> 00:03:13.640
well, so it's not something
I always get right either.

49
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.456
&gt;&gt; I think, after all this,
I feel confident, at least,

50
00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:21.128
I can draw on my experience
as a teacher and lecturer.

51
00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:25.076
And having a reputation for
delivering information in

52
00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:29.710
a consistently understandable way,
in a well-defined time,

53
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.939
is a great way to get people to
show up to your next meeting.

54
00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.124
You are your own product in many ways, and

55
00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:40.680
some people can get away
with being humorous.

56
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.399
Some people,
the same joke is gonna fall flat, but

57
00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.564
people are really showing up for
you and for how you work.

58
00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:51.587
And the audience will
give you a lot of room,

59
00:03:51.587 --> 00:03:56.346
at least in my experience,
if you are meeting the basic benchmarks.

60
00:03:56.346 --> 00:04:00.469
People want their time not wasted,
if you can do that.

61
00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.969
And a lot of that is preparation,
knowing who your audience is going to be.

62
00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.313
Things like that,
it was very effective in my career, and

63
00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:13.098
I agree, there's a need for
you to be there in a genuine way, and

64
00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:16.838
after that,
the conversations get a lot easier.

65
00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:21.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally agree, well said.

66
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.790
It's probably something that
I am skimming over here.

67
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.464
And it probably bears mentioning, I hadn't
really thought about too much in context

68
00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:32.189
of presenting this, is like, I've done so
much public speaking that getting in front

69
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.322
of a lot of people just is not something
that is concerning to me anymore.

70
00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:36.426
It used to be, right?

71
00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:40.848
Like I said, you can go watch my first
talk on YouTube at Fluent Conf 2013 or

72
00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.130
something like that.

73
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.952
I think I talked about the podcast,
The Frontend Masters podcast, that is.

74
00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:53.050
I am literally shaking in my
first public speaking appearance.

75
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.967
And now I've done it so

76
00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.829
many times that you can put me in
front of 1,000 people right now.

77
00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.165
In fact, I don't know how many
people are watching right now, but

78
00:04:59.165 --> 00:04:59.969
it might be that much.

79
00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.007
Does not bother me.

80
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.749
And I understand that
that's fairly unique.

81
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.290
A lot of people don't have that
sort of experience to draw upon.

82
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.375
So something to keep in mind, if you
are in that boat where getting in front of

83
00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.995
people is hard for you,
most people are generally on your side.

84
00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:15.946
Most people generally
want you to do well and

85
00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:20.175
they generally want you to deliver
your message in whatever way

86
00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:25.150
you're choosing to do so, and
they are rooting for you in that capacity.

87
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.273
The rest of those people don't care,
[LAUGH] right, and

88
00:05:28.273 --> 00:05:31.003
they're just generally
not thinking about it.

89
00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:34.177
And they've been to so many meetings
that if your meeting doesn't go the way

90
00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:36.923
that you planned, probably not
gonna think about it after that.

91
00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:40.266
And then the few people at
the end that are malicious and

92
00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.035
are trying to mess with you,
F them, right?

93
00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:46.243
Who cares about people like that, right?.

94
00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:50.032
And so kinda having that framing for
me helped kind of eliminate a lot of that

95
00:05:50.032 --> 00:05:52.873
public speaking pressure that
I was putting on myself.

96
00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:56.484
I was like, you know what, I'm trying to
speak to the people that are trying to

97
00:05:56.484 --> 00:05:58.145
engage with me, that helped a lot.

98
00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:03.116
And then the other thing I'll say here
is everything that I talked about here,

99
00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:06.730
agendas, coming up with a decision made,
timeboxing,

100
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.596
that sort of preparation will
give you confidence, right?

101
00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:13.993
And so if you are going into these
kinds of meetings feeling uneasy or

102
00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:17.995
scared about it, having a kind of a script
of how that meeting is supposed to go.

103
00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:22.419
Even if you go off the trail there,
having all that preparation and

104
00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.159
feeling like you have done 100% of
the prep to talk about 5% of it,

105
00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.374
it's gonna launch you from a place of
power, which will give you confidence.

106
00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:34.268
And I'll see the last thing in here, and

107
00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.906
I probably should have put this in here
as well, having a plant helps as well.

108
00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:40.041
Going in there with a coworker and saying,

109
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:44.092
hey, here's all the stuff I wanna talk
about, can you answer these questions?

110
00:06:44.092 --> 00:06:46.082
Can you make these comments?

111
00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:47.467
Can you kind of help the meeting along?

112
00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:50.086
Can you help me silence
people that are derailing us?

113
00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:54.574
That meeting where I was talking about
where I go monthly for that big meeting,

114
00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:58.110
I always had at least a plant
from multiple different teams and

115
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.750
usually change two at once.

116
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.925
An easy way to get a plant in
your meetings is to have someone.

117
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:05.568
Talk to them beforehand,
show them the slide deck, like, okay,

118
00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:07.137
I need somebody to take notes, right?

119
00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:10.749
Cuz you generally don't wanna be the note
taker when you're the one presenting.

120
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:16.109
That's a really good way,
is like, hey, person taking notes,

121
00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:21.084
can you recap of what just
happened there or something that?

122
00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:24.666
And then you can kind of prompt
them to help you as well.

123
00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:29.326
So yeah, hopefully that helps.

124
00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:33.426
And it's just practice
at the end of the day.

125
00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:36.707
After you start doing it
to a lot of people enough,

126
00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.874
you eventually just get confident with it.

127
00:07:39.874 --> 00:07:42.421
The last thing I was gonna say is,
especially

128
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:47.314
when they're important meetings, talking
to all of the stakeholders beforehand and

129
00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:51.819
getting like, hey, we're gonna talk
about this, what do you think about it?

130
00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:54.648
And getting their opinions
before you get in that room will

131
00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:57.951
give you a lot of confidence,
because then there's no surprises.

132
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.311
That'll help as well.

133
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:02.591
It also will help you drive your agenda.

134
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:05.593
Again, talking about those big
meetings that I used to go to,

135
00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:09.637
I knew every person's opinion before I got
in that room, except sometimes the vice

136
00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:12.846
president because I couldn't get
to him cuz he was busy, right?

137
00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:14.021
Everybody else's opinion,

138
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:16.426
I knew exactly what they were
gonna say when we went in there.
