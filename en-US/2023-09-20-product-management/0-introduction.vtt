00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:04.410
Hello, and welcome to the complete
intro to product management, or

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.045
learn to become a better PM,

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:10.428
which is the best subtitle that I could
fathom in a very short period of time.

4
00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:11.630
So that's what we start with.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.520
I am Brian Holt and I work at Snowflake.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.011
So if you are learning with
me on this particular course,

7
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:26.240
I want you to head to pm.holt.courses, and

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.560
that'll take you to this
particular website.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.821
This is just my course notes for

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.015
everything that you're
about to be learning today.

11
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.141
So you can follow along if you get behind,
you can read my notes.

12
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:41.450
And feel free to share
these with other people.

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.670
So I'm gonna click in here
to the introduction page.

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.260
So this is the complete intro to product
management as taught by me, Brian Holt.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.230
This course is designed to give you kind
of an introduction to what it means to be

16
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.320
a product manager in tech.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.790
This is gonna come from a very
software-oriented background,

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.727
cuz that's what my background is.

19
00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.322
But I can see this being
useful in hardware design.

20
00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:08.340
I can see this being useful in, I don't
know, biotech or something like that.

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.154
But yeah, just know that it's gonna
be from a software background,

22
00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:13.417
cuz that's what I do.

23
00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:18.444
I'm gonna see this course as mostly
geared towards people that are already

24
00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:23.709
in tech and looking to make a lateral move
from engineering into being a product

25
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.762
manager or a project manager to product
manager, or something like that.

26
00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:31.453
But it could be useful for
an MBA student or an undergrad.

27
00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:34.870
It's like,
do I wanna be a product manager?

28
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.162
So in this course, we'll go over
what a products manager does,

29
00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:44.008
what they don't do, how I found to
be an effective product manager, and

30
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:49.610
some tips and tricks of the trade as
I have learned them over the years.

31
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.648
So one critical note that I'm gonna kind
of note here is that there are many,

32
00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:58.990
many, many, many, many good ways
to be a good product manager.

33
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.472
And this is just gonna be one very biased,
from my perspective, way of doing that.

34
00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:10.512
The reason why I mentioned that is,
when I teach my React courses or

35
00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:13.904
when I teach my containers courses or
things like that,

36
00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.093
there's a realm of correct
ways to do those things.

37
00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:21.274
And you can have some opinions about
which way you choose to orient

38
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.175
yourself in that sphere of what's correct.

39
00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:31.028
But generally, there's more or less a
subset of ways or a set of ways to do it.

40
00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:33.770
That is not the case for
product management.

41
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.353
I know product managers that do my exact
same job in very different ways that

42
00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:42.080
are as effective or
more effective than me at it.

43
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.153
So this is my invitation
to you as you're listening

44
00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:48.658
to me talk about my experience
as being a product manager.

45
00:02:48.658 --> 00:02:50.913
Listen to what i have to say.

46
00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:54.473
Evaluate in your head as, does that
make sense to me given who I am and

47
00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:56.296
the environment I'm working in?

48
00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:59.424
And if it's good, maybe try it,
see if it works for you.

49
00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:02.880
And if you don't agree with it, maybe
that's forcing you to down a different

50
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.336
pathway thinking it's like, Brian said
to do it this way, but I think this is

51
00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:09.609
gonna be more effective for me given
who I am and the way I wanna do things.

52
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.326
So that's all I wanna say here is,
there's many correct ways.

53
00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:19.421
Everything I'm gonna tell you today is
gonna be steeped in survivorship bias,

54
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.529
confirmation bias, all of the biases,
being a white guy in tech bias, right?

55
00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.415
All those things are gonna be kind
of baked into my perspective here,

56
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:29.176
because that's just who I am and
that's the perspective I have.

57
00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:33.008
But I want you to consider this in
your light given who you are and

58
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:36.490
what your strengths are, and
who you're talking with.

59
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.444
So who is this course for?

60
00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:43.742
This course, hopefully, is for you.

61
00:03:43.742 --> 00:03:47.495
I designed it to be listenable
to a wide demographic of people.

62
00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:49.582
So generally if you wanna
be a product manager,

63
00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:51.524
I'm hoping this is gonna
be helpful to you.

64
00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:53.685
I'll do my best to speak to everyone,

65
00:03:53.685 --> 00:03:56.325
particularly those that
are already in tech.

66
00:03:56.325 --> 00:04:00.357
But let me know if there's other
ways that we should address this,

67
00:04:00.357 --> 00:04:03.970
and subsequent versions we
can definitely address those.

68
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.516
This is an open source project
that you're looking at here.

69
00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:10.566
So if you have issues with it,
either with grammar,

70
00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:12.521
cuz I know there's a bunch of them,
or spelling,

71
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.340
there's probably even more of those,
you can click on this link here.

72
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.051
This will take you to the GitHub repo and

73
00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:22.502
you can file issues here against
the products management repo.

74
00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:25.096
Or even better, you can open a poll
request and fix it yourself.

75
00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.638
Again, this site is free and
open source forever.

76
00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.051
Feel free to refer to this before and
after the course,

77
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.740
feel free to share with other people.

78
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.946
This is designed to be a shareable
resource for all of you.

79
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.537
I mean,
it's literally you can see my notes here.

80
00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.556
So this is what I'm referring to
as I'm speaking to you right now.

81
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.194
Cool, who am I?

82
00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:49.644
I'm Brian Holt.

83
00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:52.586
I've taught numerous courses here
at Frontend Masters over the years.

84
00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:53.660
I love being here.

85
00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.164
I am now currently a products manager at
Snowflake, which is a big data company.

86
00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:03.500
And I manage a project
specifically called Streamlet.

87
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.618
And the aspect of Streamlet that I
manage is called Community Cloud,

88
00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:12.665
which is the ability to share Python data
visualization applications with people.

89
00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:15.849
If you're familiar with something like
CodePen or StackBlitz or CodeSandbox or

90
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.299
something like that, it's like that,
but for data people.

91
00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:20.911
That's the kind of thing
that I get to work on.

92
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.246
It's like the Instagram of data viz.

93
00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:23.816
It's kind of fun to think about.

94
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.056
So I've enjoyed that,
I've been doing that for about a year now.

95
00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:34.005
Before that, I was the PM of developer
tools and SDKs, it's Stripe.

96
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:39.442
And then before that, I was the PM
of developer experience on Azure and

97
00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:42.129
Visual Studio Code of Microsoft.

98
00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.214
So I've been doing the PM gig for
probably about five years now.

99
00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:48.398
And before that, I was a developer,

100
00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:53.025
generally JavaScript noter at Netflix,
LinkedIn,

101
00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:58.389
Reddit, and some other smaller
companies in Salt Lake City.

102
00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.845
I never thought I'd be a PM.

103
00:06:02.117 --> 00:06:05.231
If you asked me really early in my careers
like, Brian, do you wanna be a PM?

104
00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:10.199
I would have said, absolutely not,
I really enjoy singing code and

105
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.132
kinda that visceral nature
of see something change.

106
00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:18.221
And what happened is, I kind of
accidentally became a PM by virtue of

107
00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:21.807
the fact that I saw an opening
to work on Visual Studio Code as

108
00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:26.910
a product manager and they required
a lot of engineering background for it.

109
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.190
And so I applied for it and got the
position and ended up really liking it.

110
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.578
So I've been doing that for
about five years now.

111
00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:37.351
So, again, I just wanna shine
a light on my bias here.

112
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:40.365
I come from a very technical background,
I'm still really biased in that way.

113
00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:43.218
I still write a lot of code.

114
00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:45.494
And I work specifically
on developer tools, and

115
00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:47.446
I've always worked in developer tools.

116
00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:51.217
So it's not to say that I couldn't PM
something more consumer-oriented like

117
00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:54.110
Pinterest or something like that,
I just haven't yet.

118
00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:01.326
So just please take that nugget of bias
with everything that I'm saying here.

119
00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:06.115
So when I'm not working, when I'm
not doing Frontend Master's stuff,

120
00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:07.977
you'll find me in Seattle.

121
00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:12.822
I like to snowboard, travel,
hang out with my wife and kid,

122
00:07:12.822 --> 00:07:17.857
play with my little jerk of a dog,
and play Dota 2, Diablo IV.

123
00:07:17.857 --> 00:07:21.500
I'm really bad at both of them.

124
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.580
I like to exercise and then I drink
a lot of Scotch IPAs and coffee.

125
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.612
So feel free to catch up
with me on social media.

126
00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:35.474
I left my links here, Twitter, Blue Sky,
LinkedIn, GitHub, and Peloton.

127
00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:39.625
Just so you know,
I'm really pretty bad at answering my DM.

128
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.725
So if you send me a DM,

129
00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:44.790
there's a high probability I don't see
them because I get quite a few of them.

130
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.260
So public tweeting is usually
the best way to get at me.

131
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.530
Or if you have an issue with the course,
filing an issue on the course repos,

132
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.353
actually the best way to get me.

133
00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:59.690
And one last request to stroke my vanity,
please star this repo here.

134
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.043
That's usually helps get some
visibility on the site, and

135
00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:07.272
it lets me know that
people like the course.

136
00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:09.055
So, awesome.

137
00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.710
So now that we've kind of gone
over the introduction here, let's
