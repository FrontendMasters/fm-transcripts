00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:04.023
Let's talk about diagrams.

2
00:00:04.023 --> 00:00:07.874
I think that's an underutilized part of
being a PM is doing visualizations, and

3
00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.493
it's something I've kind
of learned over my career.

4
00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.867
I'm not an artistic person,
I don't like drawing,

5
00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.732
I don't like any of those kind of things.

6
00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:19.253
So I generally default to a state of not
wanting to go do additional work to say

7
00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.372
the same thing using a picture, and

8
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:26.341
you absolutely should because it's really
easy to say some things with a picture.

9
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:33.388
This is actually a real diagram that I
made at one of the companies I worked at.

10
00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:38.046
We had a proposal to submit,
to ship three different SDKs,

11
00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:43.076
one that was only old features,
one that was only new features,

12
00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.013
and then one that was
a bridge between two of them.

13
00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:50.854
We had some users that we knew only
ever wanted to stay on the old stuff.

14
00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:52.729
We had new people coming in, and

15
00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.858
we knew that they were only
gonna wanna use new stuff.

16
00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:59.278
And then we had people
that were on old stuff and

17
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:05.256
that would want to get on new stuff,
that's really hard to say in words, right?

18
00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:10.081
So I was trying to communicate here if
like we have v1 APIs, we have v2 APIs,

19
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.623
they are incompatible with each other.

20
00:01:12.623 --> 00:01:17.194
So we're gonna have to write a little
interrupt layer between making v1 stuff

21
00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:18.934
and v2 stuff work together.

22
00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.924
And when I was trying to
explain this to people over and

23
00:01:21.924 --> 00:01:26.184
over again, they're like too many
words Brian, we don't get it, right?

24
00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:31.293
So I did this diagram okay,
over time this is how it's gonna look.

25
00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:33.854
So GA stands for general availability, or

26
00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:37.208
it means when you release
something publicly forever.

27
00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:41.351
So I was trying to diagram snapshots of
time this is what it's eventually gonna

28
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:45.078
look like, eventually sdk and
sdk-next are gonna be the same thing.

29
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:49.951
And eventually when that happens then we
drop sdk-next because sdk is just now all

30
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.751
of sdk-next, and then once we start
deprecating old stuff or like removing it,

31
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:59.293
the sdk-classic is going to shrink
over time until eventually it's gone.

32
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:05.235
And the only thing left after five
years of a migration will be just sdk.

33
00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:09.158
We didn't end up doing this because as you
might imagine, that's really complicated.

34
00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:11.091
But they gave me a bunch
of product requirements,

35
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:12.800
that was the only way
I could accomplish it.

36
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.851
This was a useful tool for

37
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.565
me to go back to I was like,
this is what you're telling me to do.

38
00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:20.826
And I can do it, but it's weird and
no one else does it this way, right?

39
00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:24.079
And then eventually they came back and
said, maybe we shouldn't do that way,

40
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.122
I was maybe we shouldn't do it that way,
right?

41
00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:30.909
So this was actually a really useful lever
for me to go back and say, here's what

42
00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.997
you're actually telling me, this is the
fundamental impact of your constraints.

43
00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:37.731
And they're like,
our constraints are dumb, and

44
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:39.315
I was like your constraints are dumb,
right?

45
00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.757
It was a very useful
tool of communication.

46
00:02:43.438 --> 00:02:45.854
But it's just boxes, right?

47
00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:50.264
I guarantee you these
are not spaced correctly.

48
00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:54.995
I guarantee you that these are not, like
you can see I have the line in the middle

49
00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.875
of the words,
that looks really dumb, right?

50
00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.030
But my point was communicated and
it was communicated effectively.

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.458
My point here is that,
these don't have to be pretty, right?

52
00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:07.219
These don't have to be right,
you should do these fast, and

53
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.955
you should only put as much effort into it
as it makes it clear for communication and

54
00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:12.438
put zero more effort into this.

55
00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:17.193
You should remove all of the concepts
of I need to open sketch, and

56
00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.453
I need to go get the designers.

57
00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:22.703
Sometimes you need to do that,
if you're trying to make a proposal for

58
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:26.026
I don't know something where that
would require that level of polish.

59
00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:29.168
This was just wanting to one of my
throwaway doctrines like all right,

60
00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:32.538
I'm gonna throw something weird in
the page and see what happens, right?

61
00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:34.806
Make sure you put in
the appropriate level in here,

62
00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:38.100
and please remove all the expectations
of everything needs to be pretty.

63
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.513
Most things don't need to be pretty.

64
00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:43.597
Particularly if you're not a designer,

65
00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:47.572
which as you can see here I am not,
I am not a designer.

66
00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:50.148
So this is all done in Google Drawing,

67
00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:55.073
that is typically my weapon of choice,
that's just the one that I know.

68
00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:59.840
It's very simple it is,
I like that it's very simple because it

69
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.981
forces me to not do very much because
you cannot do very much, right?

70
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.620
And same things you can
go to drawing.new and

71
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.716
it opens you a new Google Drawing
right away, that's very helpful for

72
00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:14.163
me that I can just do it
at the drop of a hat.

73
00:04:14.163 --> 00:04:19.173
A lot of my colleagues,
particularly at Snowflake like Excalidraw.

74
00:04:19.173 --> 00:04:21.828
Same thing, more powerful,
free and online.

75
00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:25.660
I think there is some paid tier to it, I
don't know what it is, I don't pay for it,

76
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.510
so I don't know.

77
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.144
If I need something with a bit more
fidelity, and I say a bit more fidelity,

78
00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:35.819
a couple of times I've reached for
Excalidraw.

79
00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.489
I see people do it in Google Slides and
PowerPoint quite frequently.

80
00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:42.820
It's really easy to just like diagram
something out and then just take

81
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.498
a screenshot of it, or export it as a PDF,
or an image or something like that.

82
00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:51.476
That's very effective if you find that
you're really good with those tools.

83
00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:56.202
Figma, Balsamiq, Canva,
Sketch, Photoshop, InDesign,

84
00:04:56.202 --> 00:05:01.838
by all means if that's something that
you are good at and wanna use, do it.

85
00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:05.691
I don't because as soon as I have
all of the tools available to me,

86
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:08.214
I get really tempted to make it pretty,
and

87
00:05:08.214 --> 00:05:12.505
that I spend a bunch of time making it
pretty, which does not help my doc.

88
00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:17.970
It's just self aggrandizing of look how
pretty my diagram is, and nobody cares.

89
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.502
Especially me, I don't care.

90
00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:23.111
So, do it if you have restraint,

91
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.319
I do not have restraint, so
therefore I don't do it.

92
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.054
I've seen people use Visio or Lucidchart
if you're really good at UML diagrams,

93
00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:38.139
which if you're very good at UML diagrams,
I'm sorry for who hurt you.

94
00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.323
[LAUGH] That's not some thing I have
done in years and I do not plan to.

95
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.788
Sometimes it's used for
the show like flows,

96
00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:51.418
in those cases actually
it's extremely useful, but

97
00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:55.996
beyond that particular use case
I don't use them very much.

98
00:05:55.996 --> 00:05:58.364
Questions, concerns here?

99
00:05:58.364 --> 00:05:59.966
Yeah.

100
00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:05.721
&gt;&gt; Do you have a metric or a way of
deciding what's an outer limit for

101
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:13.089
time spent on graphics, and part of
the motivating question is you're tooling.

102
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.719
I found out about mermaid JS like a couple
years ago, and suddenly I have a lot more

103
00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.957
time to make complex diagrams,
because it doesn't take me as much time.

104
00:06:21.957 --> 00:06:25.797
And I had to kinda rethink my workflow
on that, but when you're working

105
00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:29.703
on a document and you're trying to
get it done, where is your boundary?

106
00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:32.984
Or where do you draw the line to say,
I'm putting too much time in for

107
00:06:32.984 --> 00:06:34.262
the return I'm getting?

108
00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:36.751
&gt;&gt; It's always impact versus effort here,
right?

109
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:42.259
If more time leads to much more impact,
I'll spend all day, right?

110
00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.668
If I need a really well crafted diagram
to communicate something to a lot of

111
00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:51.358
people and that accomplishes that goal,
and less time on it doesn't do that,

112
00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:53.657
that is the calculations I'm doing.

113
00:06:53.657 --> 00:06:59.376
I don't have a hard limit, I have a what
am I getting from more time spent on this.

114
00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:04.034
I could have spent tons of time
making this probably 5% clearer and

115
00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:05.186
much prettier.

116
00:07:05.186 --> 00:07:11.157
I didn't do that, this took me all of
probably 15 minutes to draw, right?

117
00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:13.976
The only reason that I have this from my
old company is I forgot to do it in my

118
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:16.351
company account, so
it's on my personal account, right?

119
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:19.951
[LAUGH] And so that should tell
you how fast I was going there.

120
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:24.115
I was like, I don't care, I'm just
doing this as fast as I possibly can.

121
00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:28.293
So typically I can knock these out,
particularly with Google Drawing cuz I've

122
00:07:28.293 --> 00:07:30.985
gotten somewhat adept at it,
ten to 20 minutes.

123
00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:34.205
And if I'm gonna spend any longer on it,

124
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:40.094
I need to justify to myself that this
is gonna have a larger impact, yeah?

125
00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:44.197
&gt;&gt; One additional tool suggested
by the chat is eraser.io,

126
00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:48.308
which claims to be the whiteboard for
engineering teams.

127
00:07:48.308 --> 00:07:48.933
&gt;&gt; Eraser.io.

128
00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:50.811
&gt;&gt; Eraser.io.

129
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:54.196
&gt;&gt; Not what I'm familiar with,
but very cool looking.

130
00:07:56.923 --> 00:07:58.969
I think if I was gonna do some sort of,

131
00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:01.550
this is obviously
an architectural diagram.

132
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.262
When I start getting out to like zoomed
out to like this, I usually hop to Figma

133
00:08:06.262 --> 00:08:10.777
because that's the one that I have
enough familiarity with to work with.

134
00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:14.118
If you're gonna learn something like
this and you don't already know,

135
00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:17.087
if you're on Eraser and you like it,
by all means stick with it.

136
00:08:17.087 --> 00:08:24.066
Figma is a extremely cool tool and
can do a lot of things.

137
00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:25.781
So if there's one to spend time on,

138
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:28.253
that is a very useful tool
to have in your tool belt.

139
00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:35.842
&gt;&gt; Brian, do you find value in inserting
maybe a working session whiteboard,

140
00:08:35.842 --> 00:08:39.349
pretend we were all in person,
and noodling out ideas and

141
00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:41.706
visualizing it into your documents?

142
00:08:41.706 --> 00:08:44.607
Or would you take those whiteboards,

143
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:50.330
put them into something like eraser.io or
Miro and then put it in your doc?

144
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.801
&gt;&gt; I've done that for
brainstorming sessions.

145
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:54.697
I found that to be really useful for
like a remote team of like, all right,

146
00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:56.593
everyone stick your sticky
notes on the board.

147
00:08:56.593 --> 00:09:00.390
That's been with Figma just because
usually it was a designer running

148
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.297
the session, and
designers live and breathe Figma.

149
00:09:03.297 --> 00:09:05.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

150
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.072
&gt;&gt; I could see it definitely being useful,

151
00:09:07.072 --> 00:09:08.939
it's just not something
I've tried too much.

152
00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:09.984
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so

153
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:12.818
I don't have a good answer for you.

154
00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:20.258
But visual representations, and
I found a lot of value to just take

155
00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:25.919
an engineer into a conference room and
just diagram stuff on a whiteboard.

156
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:30.538
That's always been so useful, so
I see any extension of that being useful.
