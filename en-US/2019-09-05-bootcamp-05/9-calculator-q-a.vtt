00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, Dylan.

2
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are we allowed
to do just dot double and

3
00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:08.352
dot triple because the space,
it's not hyphenated in the HTML

4
00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:13.258
[CROSSTALK] style in CCS,
we don't have to do count button triple?

5
00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:18.893
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You could, okay so
what I did in the HTML for that let me.

6
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:23.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
I just have a second class here.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.070
So I have a class called calc-button and
I have a class called double.

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But it's because that's
the space is not hyphenated, right?

9
00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:31.585
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's correct, okay.

10
00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.363
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If I called it calc hyphen,
button hyphen, double,

11
00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:36.750
that's a completely different class.

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.360
It would not take on any of
the styling of calc-button,

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.060
I'd have to rewrite all of that.

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.700
And I'd have to write on
the changing the flex-basis.

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.768
Because I've used two classes here,
what we're doing is we are able to take

16
00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:54.722
advantage of all the styling that we
already put on the one calc-button.

17
00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:55.389
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

18
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
with the flex-basis of 24.5.

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.150
But now we're overwriting
it later in the document,

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.032
since it's later in
the document it takes priority.

21
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.008
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was thinking
there is table one class, but

22
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:08.137
I see the space totally.

23
00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:09.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Two separate and

24
00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:12.430
no comma just because
that's how it's done.

25
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.950
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No comma,
that's cuz that's the way it's done.
