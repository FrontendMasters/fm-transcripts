00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What else have we got left
to do here with our fine calculator?

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Orange.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right niches.

4
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.696
So, we have one thing
left to go what is it?

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An orange background for
the last column.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We need some kind of orange
background for that last column, okay?

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.360
How might you suggest going
about doing that inertia.

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.435
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I might create a class and

9
00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:31.650
just put that class after calc button.

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

11
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.816
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then in CSS put
an orange background for that class.

12
00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:39.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Fabulous,
anyone disagree with that approach?

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880
That's totally awesome, well done.

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.580
So yes, absolutely we could
go about doing it that way.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.192
So, what we would do here in our code,
we would just go on ahead and

16
00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:53.438
create a class here called, whatever.

17
00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.479
You could call it something
like function button.

18
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.322
And, we're gonna make it
an orange background.

19
00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:03.705
And then, we would apply that class
to all of these buttons in our HTML,

20
00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:08.571
you'd add that as an extra class,
and that would totally work.

21
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:11.560
But because I feel like showing off,
and because you had so

22
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.230
much fun with crazy selectors yesterday,
I'm gonna show you another trick.

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.115
Okay, so what's in common
with all of these buttons?

24
00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:25.694
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're
in a column together?

25
00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:28.776
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: They are in a column
together, which means that they are, what,

26
00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.346
in the row?

27
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: They are the last
item in all of these rows.

28
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.360
We actually have a selector for that.

29
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.500
How cool is that?

30
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.710
Okay.

31
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.437
So, the other way to do this,
the class way is absolutely legit, but

32
00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:50.492
another way that we could do this is
we could simply say, we could continue

33
00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:55.489
to work with calc button and then use
the pseudo class called last child.

34
00:01:57.844 --> 00:01:58.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I know right?

35
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.420
It's the last child, the one that lives
in the basement we don't talk about.

36
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.668
Okay, for the last child here,
we can do it this way.

37
00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:12.980
And we can give it a background color,

38
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.952
of df974c, that's our fabulous orange, and

39
00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:26.027
a color of white
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, so this is

40
00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:31.240
the pseudo class called last child, guess
what there's also one called first child.

41
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.745
Okay, there's no middle child,
there only last child and first child.

42
00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.980
Then we have one called nth child for
any of the others.

43
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.600
But last child, we'll go ahead and
select the last button in the row.

44
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.795
And so, if you go on ahead and
refresh your page, it should look like

45
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:56.103
a calculator now [SOUND] maybe we
should set up a hover state for those.

46
00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:57.710
So we can do that pretty easily.

47
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.518
What would my selector look like for
setting up a hover state for

48
00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:04.752
those buttons?

49
00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:05.829
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Dot calc button.

50
00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.567
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Dot calc button.

51
00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:08.824
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Colon last child.

52
00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.666
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Colon last child.

53
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:12.042
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Colon hover?

54
00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:16.496
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Colon hover, yep,
you can just line up those pseudo

55
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.963
classes one right after the other,
just like that.

56
00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:24.382
So dot calc button,

57
00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:29.410
dot last child, dot hover and

58
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.634
the background color for

59
00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:38.273
this is a dfb07e, okay.

60
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.545
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And, I think he had
an active state in here as well.

61
00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:51.862
That's pretty good.

62
00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:52.910
I'm just gonna leave it right there.

63
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.300
So, there we go.

64
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.556
If you refresh your page, you should have
some nice hover states on your buttons.

65
00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:04.131
And, it all lays out nicely.

66
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:05.910
The only last thing you
need to do is what?

67
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.096
Take out the unsightly red wrapper,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And,

68
00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:20.360
now you have a beautiful calculator.

69
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.460
How cool is that?

70
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.110
Are you excited.

71
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.289
You ready to code this thing?

72
00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:29.806
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

73
00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.993
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

74
00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:35.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So now, these buttons, these
buttons, you'll actually be able to click,

75
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.087
you'll be able to see the numbers coming
up here you'll actually be able to do

76
00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:39.760
math with it.
