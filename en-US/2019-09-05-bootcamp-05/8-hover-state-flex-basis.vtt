00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, we're almost done.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.780
We're almost done.

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.900
Just a tiny little bit left to go.

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.410
So, we've done so
much work on these buttons.

5
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.013
Let's go on ahead and
set up a hover state for this.

6
00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:15.917
Sound good, since we're here?

7
00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.942
So, what will my selector look like?

8
00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.860
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Colon hover correct.

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.941
Calc button, colon hover and

10
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:37.603
I think the background color is
gonna get a little bit lighter.

11
00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:44.031
Bbcbe, that's from your list,

12
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:49.090
and I missed a b, bbbcbe.

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.689
So, now we'll have a nice
hover state on those buttons.

14
00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.101
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So pretty, wow,
this color should actually be ebebeb.

15
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.682
And then, there's an active state.

16
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:15.651
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Active, and
that active state was bbbcbe, thank you.

17
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.590
Now active state,
anyone know what active state is?

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.399
I haven't really spent a lot of time
talking about the active state of a link.

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.479
Active is the moment after
you click something, but

20
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.112
before the page has loaded or
before something happens next,

21
00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:35.848
okay, so in the dial up days this
was a really important state.

22
00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:41.187
Now that many of us live on broadband we
also never see the active state anymore.

23
00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:45.138
But, it's got coded so
we'll go ahead and add it.

24
00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:51.121
It may never be seen but
we'll go ahead and add it.

25
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.230
Okay, so what have we got left
to do on this calculator?

26
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.380
There's really like two
big things left to do.

27
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.320
Here's what ours looks like.

28
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.440
Here's what the spec looks
like What do we need to do?

29
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We need to make
that zero span that triple space.

30
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
we need to do a triple.

31
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.305
We needed to code something up here to
make the zero stretch and what else?

32
00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:16.921
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On the top, we need to find
a way to make that C do double space and

33
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:19.394
have the other ones together on the right.

34
00:02:19.394 --> 00:02:22.108
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct,
we need to make the C go double, right?

35
00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.123
So basically,
we need to code that double and

36
00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.110
then that triple that we
put it on our HTML, right?

37
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.300
Anyone have any suggestions for
how we should do that?

38
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.982
What property are we manipulating?

39
00:02:32.982 --> 00:02:33.851
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex?

40
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.331
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is it flex?

41
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:36.524
Not flex.

42
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.624
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex.

43
00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:40.269
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex spaces?

44
00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:40.771
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Spaces,

45
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:44.171
correct the flex basis property
is what we're concerned with.

46
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:46.363
So, we're going to have a class for
double.

47
00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.391
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're going to
have a class for triple, right.

48
00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:01.579
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, anyone wanna take
a guess at what the number might be for

49
00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.873
double or for triple?

50
00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:04.784
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 50.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 50?

51
00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.431
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or perhaps 49.5.

52
00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:09.156
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Something like 49.5?

53
00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:14.196
Yeah, he's actually got exactly 49.7,

54
00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:16.916
so, flex hyphen basis.

55
00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:19.434
49.7.

56
00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:23.799
The way he's coded this, again,
because he didn't use the borders,

57
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.747
he's doing some higher math here in order
to make these buttons stretch and fit,

58
00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.544
and the lines look good and
all the rest of it.

59
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.633
He probably started with something like,

60
00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:39.025
well if you double the flex basis there,
24.5 times 2.

61
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:43.256
You get 49 that was probably a little bit
too small made the borders a little bit

62
00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:43.774
too fat.

63
00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:48.922
So, he tried a couple of different
numbers, and 49.7 looked good.

64
00:03:48.922 --> 00:03:51.744
So that's probably how he got that number.

65
00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:57.080
And then, for
triple what are we gonna put in here?

66
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.075
Some some number that's close to that.

67
00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:05.871
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 74.7
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 74.7 that's a great

68
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:11.825
guess Cassie he's got
74.8 [LAUGH] well done.

69
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:15.705
Okay, go ahead and save that.

70
00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:17.971
So, some kind of number like that.

71
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:20.201
And,if you refresh wow.

72
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.542
So, that look like a really
hard layout to start with.

73
00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:25.678
But in fact, when you break it down,
the way I showed you,

74
00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:29.400
thinking about how many rows how
many columns, what do we need to do?

75
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.292
What is each element going to do?

76
00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:34.308
Sometimes believe it or
not, it sounds really dumb.

77
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:39.002
But, when you say these things
out loud I need to have

78
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:43.280
a button that stretches
across three columns.

79
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.631
I need to have a button that
stretches across two columns.

80
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:50.118
Sometimes things will click in your head
when you actually think about the question

81
00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:50.832
in that way.
