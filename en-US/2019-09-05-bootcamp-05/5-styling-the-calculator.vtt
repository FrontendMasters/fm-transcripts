00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:01.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So I'm really, really,

2
00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:05.263
really super pleased that a lot of
you have gotten the memo that one

3
00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:09.663
of the good things to do as you're working
with CSS is to stick the border on it.

4
00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:12.464
Stick a border on it over and over again.

5
00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.911
It makes me very happy to see
that you all are doing that.

6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.059
So I'm gonna go ahead and
put a border on my wrapper.

7
00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:25.313
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see,
we'll make it three pixels solid red.

8
00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:33.486
So I can see that and I'm also going
to make my class .calc-button-row,

9
00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.778
and I'm gonna put a border on that too.

10
00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:41.334
Border 3 pixels solid blue.

11
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:48.538
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that is just gonna give us, of course,

12
00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:52.431
some lines around the whole thing,
so we can kinda see what's going on.

13
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
the reason that my screen looks so

14
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.541
enormous is because I've zoomed in really,
really far.

15
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:12.231
And that is in fact, a 400-pixel wide
wrapper, but it's zoomed in so far.

16
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:16.107
It looks like it stretches most
of the way across the screen,

17
00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:17.860
okay, for the rest of you.

18
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.250
It'll look like it tastes that much
less of your browser window and

19
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.000
it's much smaller.

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.426
Okay, so now that we've got all that done,

21
00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:35.533
let's go ahead and
head on to our styling and

22
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:41.330
let's start with thinking
about the easy part and

23
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.972
the easy part is what.

24
00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:45.039
This up here at the top.

25
00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.125
Yeah, so the way that looks,

26
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:53.381
all we have to do is have a zero.

27
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:54.911
It needs to be white.

28
00:01:54.911 --> 00:02:00.321
It needs to be on the far right side and
the background here needs to be black.

29
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.777
That's all we need to do.

30
00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:06.405
All right, so
the one hint I'm gonna give you is

31
00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.626
we're gonna split this
styling between two places.

32
00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:16.086
So one place I'm going
to put the colors on

33
00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:20.429
the wrapper just for the moment, okay?

34
00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:26.949
So what colors do I need to set to
make this magic happen right here?

35
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.185
What are my properties?

36
00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:30.742
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's in
the the instructions?

37
00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:31.633
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pardon?

38
00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:32.517
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The colors
are in the instructions.

39
00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:33.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The colors
are in the instructions.

40
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.058
That will tell me, but
which two colors do I need?

41
00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:38.678
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Black and white.

42
00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:40.898
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Black, white, correct?

43
00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:44.230
And what are my properties?

44
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.439
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Background color.

45
00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.677
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead
and put this on my wrapper actually.

46
00:02:48.677 --> 00:02:56.627
Background color black, all right?

47
00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:04.441
Color white,
I’m putting it right here on my wrapper.

48
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:09.415
So what is gonna happen now before we save
this and look at it in the web browser?

49
00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:13.056
What’s gonna happen?

50
00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:17.222
I made my whole background
color on the wrapper black and

51
00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:21.399
I’ve made my text color white,
what's gonna happen?

52
00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.832
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The whole
thing is gonna be black.

53
00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:24.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The whole
thing is gonna be black.

54
00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:30.597
The whole thing is gonna be black with
white writing just like that, okay?

55
00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:33.083
So this first row is looking pretty good,

56
00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:37.357
except we need to get that zero over
to the right-hand side, correct?

57
00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:42.545
Okay, so what should I do to get that
zero over to the right-hand side?

58
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:46.856
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Text align.

59
00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:49.913
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah and
what is my selector?

60
00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:50.773
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Screen?

61
00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:51.671
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Screen.

62
00:03:54.657 --> 00:04:00.735
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay and
then what else am I gonna need here?

63
00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:02.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Text just-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text align.

64
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.740
Text align, right?

65
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.170
Thank you.

66
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.124
Okay, so that's gonna put it to the side.

67
00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:17.545
Is that font the same font that we see,

68
00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:21.698
oops, not that one in our picture.

69
00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:23.075
Is that the same font?

70
00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:32.408
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not quite, so
we need to set a font here.

71
00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:39.985
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
the font we can set here is

72
00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:46.380
font-family and we can use Courier.

73
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.338
Courier New, Courier, monospace.

74
00:04:59.354 --> 00:05:03.536
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is the sort of
the typewriter font that we have going on

75
00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:07.636
here, that's going to give us and
that's appropriate for

76
00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:11.576
a calculator kind of
a typewritery looking font, okay?

77
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:19.875
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And what I have here in
my notes, I also have some padding.

78
00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:26.061
So let's put in some padding too and
the padding is 20 pixels, 5 pixels.

79
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:29.601
And again, Brian wrote this code,
so he's done it in pixels.

80
00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.516
Okay, but what does that mean?

81
00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:35.955
20 pixels means we're adding
20 pixels top and bottom.

82
00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:37.510
Five pixels is what?

83
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.231
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Left and right.

84
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.671
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Left and right, okay?

85
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:44.771
Good, so now when we refresh again,

86
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:50.877
we have a little breathing room around
zero and our zero looks very nice.

87
00:05:50.877 --> 00:05:55.451
I'm gonna go ahead and
resize this now a little bit.

88
00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:01.063
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's the real
size of the calculator so far.

89
00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:03.479
Let's also make that zero a little bigger.

90
00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.057
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we'll add a font size of 40 pixels.

91
00:06:11.057 --> 00:06:13.455
And again,
this is what would Brian has coded here.

92
00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:15.901
He's done his thing in pixels.

93
00:06:15.901 --> 00:06:17.358
So we're gonna honor that.

94
00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.887
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, that actually
looks more readable, doesn't it?

95
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.034
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You've coded the screen,
whoa.

96
00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:32.558
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
