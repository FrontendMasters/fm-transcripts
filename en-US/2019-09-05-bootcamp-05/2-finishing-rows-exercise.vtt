&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what I'd like for
you to do now, go on ahead and

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.400
take a minute or two.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.126
And I'd like for you to go ahead and
code the four, five, six, minus row and

4
00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.135
the one, two, three, plus row.

5
00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.134
Go ahead and code those two rows now.

6
00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.670
Go on ahead and write the code for that.

7
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.118
Once again, there's not a whole lot
to see once you're done coding it.

8
00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:24.900
It'll look kind of like that,
vaguely like a calculator.
