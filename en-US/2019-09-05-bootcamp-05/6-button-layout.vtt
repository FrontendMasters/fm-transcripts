00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.378
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, next thing let's do,
let's work on the layout of these buttons.

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.235
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
clearly these buttons right now,

3
00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:12.195
are they block are they in line?

4
00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:14.311
&gt;&gt; Misha: In line.

5
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:15.886
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In line,
how do you know that Misha?

6
00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:18.800
&gt;&gt; Misha: Because,
there is wide it as their content.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.079
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're-
&gt;&gt; Misha: And they're right next to each

8
00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:21.683
other.

9
00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.675
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly,
there is wider as their content and

10
00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:25.254
they're right next to each other.

11
00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.520
Okay, so buttons are an inline element.

12
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.582
And clearly, somehow we need to get these
buttons looking in this lovely grid and

13
00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:36.993
all lined up and pretty looking.

14
00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.888
Instead of just sort of
wherever they happen to be,

15
00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.530
which is what they are right now, correct?

16
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.967
Given what you know, all the things
that we've done over this last week,

17
00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:50.096
what would be a good method
of laying out these buttons?

18
00:00:57.652 --> 00:00:59.578
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What would be a good
method of laying out these buttons?

19
00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:00.323
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Display a Flex?

20
00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:02.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex box, yeah, flex box.

21
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.650
So let's use flex box to lay
out these buttons, okay?

22
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.258
So if we take a look at our code.

23
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:18.273
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Where are we
going to place our display flex?

24
00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:20.935
We need to find a parent to put this on,
right?

25
00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:26.108
What is our parent going to be and what
is our child going to be for Flex box?

26
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.922
Emma?

27
00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.128
&gt;&gt; Emma: The parent would
be the calc button row, and

28
00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:33.862
the children would be the button.

29
00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:37.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct, so
the row is gonna be the parent.

30
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.770
That's gonna be the flex container,
it's also the parent.

31
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.930
That is going to be the thing where we're
gonna set our up those properties and

32
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.350
then the buttons are the children.

33
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100
So let's go ahead and
add them to our calc button row style.

34
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.384
We already have one going,
what do I need to put here?

35
00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:58.702
&gt;&gt; Misha: Display?

36
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:03.825
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display Flex,
yeah, what else?

37
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.738
Anything else?

38
00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.218
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex flow.

39
00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:09.661
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex flow?

40
00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:15.185
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Row nowrap.

41
00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:23.103
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's not no-wrap,
it's just nowrap, all one word, okay.

42
00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:29.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
we can also do a what?

43
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.672
Justify content space between, right?

44
00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:40.480
&gt;&gt; Emma: We don't want space between.

45
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We didn't do space between,
we did go over it, right?

46
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.320
&gt;&gt; Emma: We went over it but,
do we want that in the calculator,

47
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.770
cuz the buttons are right
next to each other?

48
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well we do have,
I'm gonna do that a bunch of times.

49
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.130
We do have these little black lines here,
don't we?

50
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.870
Those could be borders or
they could be the space in our flex box.

51
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.730
Because we just set
the background to be black.

52
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.095
So that could be the space filling
in with the black behind it.

53
00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:11.761
&gt;&gt; Emma: Okay.

54
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:13.212
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
there's a couple of ways of doing that.

55
00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:19.147
Okay, so let's go on ahead and save that,

56
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.271
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go,

57
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:28.916
what do you think?

58
00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:36.971
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, all right,
it's not beautiful but what?

59
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.540
We definitely have a nice column
going on over here, yeah?

60
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.360
Definitely have a good
column going on here.

61
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.030
The zero is clearly
taking up a lot of room.

62
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.827
The one thing that's weird
is that first row, correct?

63
00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:54.231
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

64
00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:58.273
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're closer,
we're definitely closer.

65
00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:01.155
So let's go ahead and
code up the calc button.

66
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now that we have
a row all set up, let's go ahead and

67
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.796
code those buttons.

68
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.825
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Calc button.

69
00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.171
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
a couple things we're gonna do here,

70
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:22.413
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I want you to go ahead and

71
00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:26.269
try setting up a background color and
a text color for this button.

72
00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:31.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Based on what you know.

73
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.890
So you'll need to look at that text file
and see if you can figure out what should

74
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.940
the background color be and
what should the text color be.

75
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.960
Based on our specification and based
on what you've been given in terms of

76
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.990
that text file,
it gives you the instructions.

77
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.580
See if you can code those two things.

78
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.440
Background color, and
the color of the text.
