00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: There is in VS code,
something called an MPM Explorer.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
And that is here.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.430
So if, if you have the latest version
of VS code, this will show up.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.220
If you don't have the latest version,
it's not on by default.

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.180
If you go to your settings file you can
turn it on with enables script explorer.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.780
Let's see script enabled script explorer,
but it's all ready in here somewhere.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.380
Right there.

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.600
So you got my see mine's set to true.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.510
This should be on.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.220
If yours isn't on, just set the setting
to true and then you'll see it.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.060
And what this shows us is
all of the different NPM

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.200
scripts that are available
in our projects.

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.060
So these are the two scripts we have and

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.730
we can actually run them
directly from here as well.

15
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.190
Just makes it easier to
see your NPM scripts.

16
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.130
Also, little bit of a tip here,
if you wanna know what your NPM script

17
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.820
options are, you can also just do NPM run,
and then not provide an argument.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.661
Hit enter, and

19
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.818
it will show you all of the scripts
that you have in your package.json file.

20
00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:13.456
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Speaking of package.JSON
files, let's head over to one.

21
00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:20.336
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
actually let's go back to exercise two, so

22
00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:22.760
we're hanging out in the right spot.

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.290
In your package JSON file,
you'll have your dependencies.

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.130
So you can see here I've got light server,
there is an extension called version lens.

25
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.080
And I thought that I had
added it to the version lens.

26
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.290
Here it is I've got a disabled.

27
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.284
So I'm gonna go ahead and
enable this from my work space.

28
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.790
And it's probably gonna
ask me to reload PS code.

29
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.665
No, it doesn't want me to?

30
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:52.357
All right.

31
00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:57.290
So what version lens will do is
it will look at the dependency,

32
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.630
as you can see it's doing it now,
and it will tell me whether or

33
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.176
not the latest is being used.

34
00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:04.875
So you can see I'm at 2.5.3.

35
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.230
2.5.4 is the latest.

36
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.100
If I hit this it's just
gonna change it to 2.5.4.

37
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.500
Then I can run any NPM install and
do that.

38
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.580
The other thing is, inside of a package
JSON file you get IntelliSense.

39
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.300
So VS code automatically can look for,
let's come down here and

40
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.508
let's say that you wanna use,
anybody heard this one?

41
00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:35.010
&gt;&gt; class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: [LAUGH] All right, so

42
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.720
let's say we're gonna do that.

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.180
Never forget Mark, and
then I'm just gonna hit enter, and

44
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.740
then it's gonna fill it in
automatically with the latest version.

45
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.680
Now i'm not saying that you should hand
edit your in your package.Json files we

46
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.110
don't often do this, but if you have
to you can and you get IntelliSence.

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.690
And in fact, if we come back here you can
trigger it with control, spacebar and

48
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.440
it will go out and it should find and
tell you what the latest versions are and

49
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.817
then give you the options 3.4.1
greater than 3.4.1 or at least 3.4.1
