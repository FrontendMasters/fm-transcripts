00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's talk
about fonts for a second.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.370
Over here in the exercises,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.100
I have given you some fonts that
you can use inside of VS Code.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.610
There are some free ones and
there are some paid ones.

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.560
The free one that I use
is called FiraCode.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.500
So if you were to jump out
here to the FiraCode repo,

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.010
what you can do is you can,
under Releases,

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.230
you would find this file here,
you would download it, there is the zip.

9
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.450
There is a TTF file inside,
you double click that.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.860
And then your Mac or
your Windows machine will install it.

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.890
You will hope to God there's
not a virus in there, and

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.740
then you will have the new
font on your system.

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.240
Now, once you have the new
font on your system,

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.230
you need to actually
tell VS Code to use it.

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.270
So back in VS Code,

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.920
the way that you're gonna do that
is you're gonna go to Settings.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.870
And Settings is opened with command or
control comma.

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.300
When you do that, you get to the settings.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.810
These are the settings for
the whole editor, and

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.880
your just gonna search for font.

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.250
And you can see here we've got Font
Family, and we just wanna change this.

22
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.580
And I' m gonna change this to Fira Code.

23
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.190
Now you have to get this just right,
the name.

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.130
So if you don't put a space here or
there's not a space and you put a space,

25
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.870
it won't work.

26
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.880
But then once we do that it will
change the font for the editor.

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.420
And in fact, if we go back to our app.js
file, and let's go back to material icons,

28
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.160
and we activate that icon theme.

29
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.800
We're now using FiraCode, it looks
a lot like the font that we had before.

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.180
The big difference is though that this
font has something called font ligatures.

31
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.670
So let's go back to settings and
there's a box under font

32
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.390
that says enable font ligatures, so
I'm gonna go ahead and check this.

33
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.380
And then what this will do is enable
ligature fonts or font ligatures, rather.

34
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.207
So let's come back to a file here so I can
show you exactly what this looks like.

35
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:08.567
There are certain symbols that we use
in programming that we would consider

36
00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.070
compound symbols.

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.611
And these are things like equals, equals.

38
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:18.665
So what font ligatures do is they turn
those compound symbols into one symbol.

39
00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.795
So we do equals, equals,
you see we get a double equals.

40
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:24.865
Let me increase the font
size a little bit here.

41
00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:26.995
And let's collapse this.

42
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:30.950
But in JavaScript if you wanna know
something is really equal, what do you do?

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Triple equals.

44
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.780
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Triple equals, and
you get an actual triple equals.

45
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.320
If you wanna know something's not equal,
not equal, and you get a not equals.

46
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.000
Or a not equals, equals, or
as many equals as you want, I suppose.

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.540
Same thing with like fat arrows,
you get an actual fat arrow.

48
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.190
If you do a greater than or
whoa, I don't know what that is.

49
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.950
That's a weird symbol.

50
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.670
What does that do?

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Fork in the road.

52
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.170
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: What is that?

53
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A YAML.
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: It's a YAML,

54
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.350
is that what that is?

55
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: YAML,
the way it creates spaces between text.

56
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.130
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So
you can experiment with this.

57
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.650
Like if you do plus,
plus you'll see they're actually joined,

58
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.370
which is like less of
an impressive ligature.

59
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.511
And there's the ands like this.

60
00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:16.240
I think you have to be like, if i and,
that's not an and, that's dollar sign.

61
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.540
I got something on the mind.

62
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.610
So you can see they're
sort of connected there.

63
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.460
These are called font ligatures,
there are lots of font.

64
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.990
All of these fonts that
I've given you here in our

65
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.010
guide here have font ligatures.

66
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.734
One of the most popular ones is Dank Mono,
you'll see that one used a lot.

67
00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:36.923
If you like it, just go ahead and buy it,
fonts are a good thing to invest and

68
00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:38.660
again, you have to live in your editor.

69
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.540
So you wanna invest a little
bit of money there.
