00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: What we want to do here
is we want to make it so that we can run

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.410
this application here, which is an Azure
Functions project, inside of a container.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.420
Because in order for

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.980
you to run an Azure Functions project, you
have to have some very specific things.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.720
You need to have the .NET core CLI.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570
You have to have that installed.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.750
You have to have the Azure Functions
core tools installed,

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.920
you have to have the Azure Functions
extension installed.

9
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.440
This is before you can even think
about running the application.

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.250
So instead, what we wanna do is create a
container which already has those things.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.190
And then anybody else can run them
as well using remote containers.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.980
So here's how we do that.

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.060
We've got our project here.

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.010
Let's go ahead and turn this thing
into a remote container project.

15
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.230
So I'm gonna do Cmd+Shift+P,
Remote-Containers.

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.740
And what I'm gonna say is Add Development
Configuration Files for a Container.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.440
Now, it will ask us which project and

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.870
then it wants to know which on of this
pre-built environments do you want?

19
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.530
So it's got a bunch to start out with.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.380
If you go through here,
you can see there's F#,

21
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.070
there's Java, there's Go,
there's Node, there's Perl,

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.670
there's PowerShell, and
Python of course down here at the bottom.

23
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.140
Swift, just in case you
want to develop swift.

24
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
These are pre-configured
containers that you can use.

25
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.740
So what we want is
Azure Functions &amp; Node LTS.

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.270
And then what happens is it
gives us two files over here.

27
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.540
We get a devcontainer file,

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.250
which specifies information about
the development environment.

29
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.500
And then look what we get.

30
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.970
A Docker file.

31
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.160
Now, if we look at this Docker file,
it looks a little bit wordy.

32
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.410
So you can see here, we've got,
it's running some updates.

33
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.720
It's installing some things.

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.580
It's installing Git.

35
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.660
I don't know what these things are.

36
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.260
I believe they're Linux utilities that
we need to actually make this thing run.

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.620
And then down here look installing
.NET Core and the Azure CLI and

38
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.280
setting up all the correct permissions,
configuring all the pads correctly.

39
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.980
All right cleaning up, and then

40
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.990
I don't know what that does switch back to
dialogue for any ad-hoc use of apt-get.

41
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.760
Okay, we'll do.

42
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.520
All right now that we've got this we
actually need to create the container.

43
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.930
So we have the dev container folder.

44
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.360
How do we open this project
inside of the container?

45
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.080
How do we use that container as
our development environment?

46
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.140
Back at our Command Prompt I'm just
gonna move into the Start folder here.

47
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.626
And I'm gonna open a new
instance of VS code.

48
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.810
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right.
So now I'm inside the start project.

49
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.920
And what we want to do is open this
project inside of our container.

50
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.990
So what we're going to do is look at
my party parrots going nuts up there.

51
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.990
We're going to do this right here,
click on this little icon and

52
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.920
we're going to say Remote-Containers.

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.639
Reopen folder in containers.

54
00:03:06.764 --> 00:03:09.100
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Now it says
installing dev container.

55
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.370
If we go to details, and you can see
it's pulling down all these things.

56
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.210
It's running all these commands.

57
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.060
It's installing these things for
Linux, it's setting all these values.

58
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.740
It's going to pull down and install

59
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.520
the .NET Core framework that we need to
run this, which it's doing right now.

60
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.860
And the first time that you open a new dev
container, the first time you create one,

61
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.160
it takes a while because it has to pull
all this stuff down from the cloud.

62
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.606
After you do it the first time, it gets
a whole lot faster because it's all

63
00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:41.395
cached locally and
you don't have to pull it down anymore.

64
00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.987
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: If the container file
changes, and it's not the same as what's

65
00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:51.541
on your local machine anymore, when you go
to open the container, it will actually

66
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:56.780
refresh and rebuild and get you the newest
version so that's always current.

67
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.180
You can see it's got asp.net core.

68
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.190
I didn't even know you needed
asp.net core to run this.

69
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.750
I guess you do.

70
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.136
So we'll just let this thing finish here,
unpacking Azure Functions Core Tools.

71
00:04:15.203 --> 00:04:16.570
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let it
install all this stuff.

72
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.860
While this is happening,
I'll tell you about the third flavor of

73
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.010
remote development that we're not gonna
talk about, and that's for the WSL.

74
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.380
So this is a very specific
thing to Windows.

75
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.076
Windows has the Windows subsystem for
Linux, and

76
00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:36.662
what it does is it gives you
a Linux command prompt on Windows.

77
00:04:36.662 --> 00:04:40.367
The problem is that those two file systems
are separate, so people who use the WSL

78
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.766
know this, people who don't this is
going to sound a little weird to you.

79
00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:47.741
But if you create a file In the WSL
you can't even edit that file

80
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.780
from the Windows file system.

81
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.270
So the problem is that when you

82
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.320
open a project from the WSL in
VS code where does VS code run?

83
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.290
On the Windows side.

84
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.680
Where are your files?

85
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.810
On the Linux side, that's a problem.

86
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.380
And so
what it does now is it remotes in and

87
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.310
allows you to develop actually inside the
WSL which is a much improved experience

88
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.220
for people that are using
the Windows subsystem.

89
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.820
We're not gonna go over that here but
if you are on Windows you should check out

90
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.540
and make sure that you have the remote
containers or remote for WSL installed.

91
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.698
It will make your life much happier.

92
00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:23.500
All right, I think we are getting
close to getting this container built.
