00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So
let's look at MySQL here.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.332
We have an extension that
I've included called MySQL.

3
00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:09.358
And then inside of that,
I've already connected, let's disconnect.

4
00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.550
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: No,
let's not do that, Escape.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.080
Let me just disconnect this one,
and we'll start from scratch.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.980
So let's add a new connection.

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.641
And the host name of this,
you can probably guess is, what?

8
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.790
What do you think the host name is?

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.590
&gt;&gt; Student: MySQL.

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.480
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: MySQL, that's it,

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.180
because that's the name of the container
and we're linked, so we just say MySQL.

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.230
So we'll say MySQL.

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040
And then it wants to know the user.

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.920
In MySQL, root is the user.

15
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.490
And then for the password,
you wouldn't know this without

16
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.850
looking in the compose file but
it's right there.

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.540
So we'll say example,
the port we can leave as the default.

18
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.630
I don't even know what this is,
I just press enter.

19
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.709
And then, here's our mysql database.

20
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.750
So again, we can run queries here
just like we would against SQL.

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.031
So I'm going to say new query, and
let's just do select * from Colors.

22
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:15.219
And I think you have to end
mysql statements in a semicolon.

23
00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.650
And then we'll say, mysql,
run mysql query, boom.

24
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.160
So, depending on what your database is,
there's more than likely an extension for

25
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.560
it inside of the S code so
that you can work with your data and

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.790
your databases without leaving your
editor, which is a pretty cool thing.
