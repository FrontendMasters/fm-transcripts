&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I wanna tell you
one other thing about Git and GitHub.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.270
There is an extension that I've
also included called GitLens.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.130
GitLens is a really good extension
however it is rather complex.

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.480
I've included it here, it will put a,
I believe this is the one.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.060
It's written by a guy named Eric Amodio,
who is a brilliant developer.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.080
And he wrote this extension,
I think mostly on his own.

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.990
But you can see here it shows you so much
more than what you get out of the box.

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.750
So you can see the different branches
here, you can see the commits,

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.340
you can see all the comments all right,
from within VS Code.

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.300
The thing that I love
the most about GitLens

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.410
is that it has something
called blame annotations.

12
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.220
So if you see, you see you might have,
you can't see this on the projector.

13
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.830
It's not dark enough but there's a little
grayed out, and it says the name of

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.310
the person, how many days ago,
and what the commit message was.

15
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.540
I like this a lot, because as you move
through code and you look at something and

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.970
you think, who wrote this horrible code?

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.025
And then you can put your mouse there and
go, it was me.

18
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:16.356
&gt;&gt; class: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So that's GitLens,

19
00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:18.244
I did a video with Eric Amodio on GitLens.

20
00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.960
If you wanna check that out on YouTube
which is Google GitLens and my name.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.450
We spent an hour walking through it,
and looking at all the features.
