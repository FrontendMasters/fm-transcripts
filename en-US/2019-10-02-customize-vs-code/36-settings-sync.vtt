00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.360
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: One last
item that we talked about,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.860
we've done a lot of customization
today to our editors.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.450
Well, I mean, we've, at this point VS code
is very customized to your specific needs.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.300
You may have multiple computers
where you work on VS code.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.390
Or you may work in an environment
where you want someone to be able to

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.850
immediately get set up with VS code

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.130
in the same configuration that you
standardized everybody else on.

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.281
So there is an extension called,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Setting sync,

9
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:31.505
took me a minute there.

10
00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.000
I think this might be the most,
no, it's not the most popular,

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.830
it was at one point in time.

12
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.870
And what this allows you to do is
sync your settings with other people.

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.362
So what I can do is say Settings Sync.

14
00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:47.070
I think it's just sync.

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.417
Sync, what I wanna do is
Update/Upload Settings, and

16
00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:56.210
it's uploading everything right here,
it's done.

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.569
And then what it does is it gives
me a Gist ID up here at the top,

18
00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.548
right here, Gist, okay?

19
00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:08.020
It's a secret GISt, so you can't access
it, other people can't get to it.

20
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.283
And now, let's say that I want to,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Get

21
00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:18.390
another instance of VS code so that
it's the same, oof, we got a title bar.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880
Good, it's gone.

23
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.250
Let's look and
make sure we have Settings Sync over here.

24
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.640
We do, so I'll collapse this.

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.230
And this person has a dark theme,
obviously,

26
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.070
they don't know what they're doing.

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.758
So, I'm gonna fix that for them.

28
00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:38.649
So [LAUGH] we're gonna say
Sync Download Settings,

29
00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.615
and it's gonna want a Gist ID.

30
00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:46.194
I think I have to do sync,
let's see, update,

31
00:01:46.194 --> 00:01:51.934
let's see here,
I have to remember how to do this exactly.

32
00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.530
&gt;&gt; Student: Just download a public Gist.

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.780
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Yeah, that's the public,
where, did you see download public Gist?

34
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.729
&gt;&gt; Student: No, it's below the first
set of blue buttons there,

35
00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.070
below Login with Git.

36
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.735
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Yeah, there we go.

37
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:04.100
I'll just try this Gist ID.

38
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.980
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right,
so it was a public Gist.

39
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.260
So now you can see it's installing.

40
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.980
It's got bracket per
colorizers coming over.

41
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.910
All of my themes are gonna be installed.

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.640
It's installing C#.
It's getting everything that I did.

43
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.452
So if we wait here long enough,
and we let it download everything,

44
00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:28.180
this version of VS code is gonna
look exactly like the other one.

45
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.150
You will not be able to tell them apart.

46
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.205
So that is the last tip that I will leave
you with is the Settings Sync extension

47
00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:34.910
that [INAUDIBLE].

48
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.150
&gt;&gt; Student2: It's a user settings,
right, not workspace settings.

49
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.509
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Correct, user settings,

50
00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.070
only workspace settings
are specific just to the project.

51
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.090
You can put those in GitHub.

52
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.890
There's often conjecture about whether or
not you should put dot files in GitHub or

53
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.620
dot folders.

54
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.950
But in the case of VS code,
if you have a launch configuration,

55
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.450
you probably wanna share that with your
team, so put it in source control.

56
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.700
If you have a dev containers folder,
you wanna share that with your team,

57
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.510
put it in source control.

58
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.160
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Thank you so
much for having me, Minnesota.

59
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.975
I really appreciate it.

60
00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:12.143
