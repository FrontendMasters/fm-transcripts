00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.356
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right, well, my
name is Burke Holland and from Nashville.

2
00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:07.665
I work at Microsoft and
I work on the Azure team at Microsoft.

3
00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:12.256
My job is to make sure that
the JavaScript experience inside of

4
00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:15.096
Azure is as good as it can possibly be.

5
00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:17.440
So this is what I do.

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.392
I go out and I talk about JavaScript and

7
00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:25.935
I talk about VS code a lot because we
make VS code, and I love the editor.

8
00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:30.908
And so today we are going to spend
a substantial amount of time

9
00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:33.842
talking about nothing but VS code.

10
00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:37.969
Now, before we do this, everybody needs
to have some things installed for

11
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.472
this whole day to go as
smoothly as it should.

12
00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:45.057
And for you to leave with a smile on your
face, one of those things you'll need is

13
00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:49.925
git, you wanna make sure that you have Git
installed for our source control module.

14
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.049
You're going to need to have Node.js,
or Node, or

15
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.179
whatever the proper way to say that is,
installed.

16
00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.012
We're running a lot of JavaScript today,
and

17
00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:03.087
JavaScript doesn't run as well
without Node, as it does with it.

18
00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:04.964
You're going to need Docker.

19
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.694
Yes, we're gonna do Docker and
containers today.

20
00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:10.185
We're gonna learn a little
bit about containers, and

21
00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:11.601
then we're going to use them.

22
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:16.184
And then there's an extension pack called
VS Code Can Do That that has all of

23
00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:20.357
the extensions that we're going
to be using in today's workshop.

24
00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:23.129
So by installing this one extension pack,

25
00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:27.750
you get everything that you need for
the whole day which is pretty cool.

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.966
Also shameless plug, I have a show
called Five Things on YouTube.

27
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.530
Fun fact,

28
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.425
it is the most popular show in the less
than a dozen subscribers category.

29
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:43.154
So thank you, mom, for
creating 12 YouTube accounts.

30
00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:48.829
All right, let's get right into it then.

31
00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.939
Today, what I want to do is
I want us to push the limits

32
00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.132
of what VS code should
sanely be able to do.

33
00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:03.023
I was at Build in 2015 when
they announced the VS code, and

34
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:06.894
I thought, at that time,
another text editor?

35
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:11.036
Do we really need, is that what the world
needs right now is another text editor?

36
00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.393
I feel like this is a solved problem.

37
00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:17.467
But what we found is that there
is definitely a need for VS Code.

38
00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:21.073
It's become the most popular
editor among web developers and

39
00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:25.240
JavaScript developers, and
that's why we're gathered here today.

40
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.419
So what I would like for

41
00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:33.173
you to do today is picture in
your mind a dial on a dashboard.

42
00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:37.778
And that dial, you can turn it
from all the way from one, and

43
00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:41.292
then if you turn it all the way up,
it goes to?

44
00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.119
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 11.

45
00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.612
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: 11, that is correct.

46
00:02:43.612 --> 00:02:45.368
Dials always go to 11.

47
00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:48.830
So what we're gonna do today
is we're gonna start at 1,

48
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.166
and 1 is text editor in VS code, and
that's what it does out of the box.

49
00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:57.936
And then what we're gonna do is
today's we're just gonna crank on

50
00:02:57.936 --> 00:03:01.511
this dial all day until we
get it close to 11, and

51
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:05.956
11 it would be IDE or
Integrated Development Environment.

52
00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:09.374
And that's where you're doing
everything inside of VS code.

53
00:03:09.374 --> 00:03:13.502
All parts of your development
workflow are in VS code, and

54
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:19.571
we're eventually gonna put your entire
development environment inside of VS code,

55
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.777
which is kind of a crazy thing.

56
00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:26.534
So, assuming that everybody has
already cloned the repo here,

57
00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:29.541
you can follow along with this Gitbook.

58
00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:33.408
What we're gonna do is I am
going to do the exercises.

59
00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:36.107
I'm gonna run through and
teach you a little bit.

60
00:03:36.107 --> 00:03:40.815
And then we're going on break, and you can
go through the exercises yourself, and

61
00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:42.100
you can follow along.

62
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.599
So what I would recommend is that you
open the projects as I begin one of

63
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.478
these segments here so
that any dependencies that need to be

64
00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:53.678
installed can be installed
while I'm talking.

65
00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:57.831
Specifically npm install at the exercise
tells you that you need to run it.

66
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.200
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: The other thing here is,
that you need to know,

67
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.837
is that a lot of times the instructions
are gonna have you open VS code from

68
00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:10.832
a command prompt, like this.

69
00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:15.363
So, if we come over here, if I wanted
to open VS code on this folder,

70
00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:20.304
I can do code and then dot, and now
we'll open VS code on this folder here.

71
00:04:20.304 --> 00:04:25.044
If this doesn't work for you,
it's because code, the code command,

72
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:26.389
is not in your path.

73
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.181
In order to get it there, you need to open
the command palette which is Command or

74
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:36.042
Control Shift P, and you're gonna say,
you can just search for path I believe,

75
00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.135
and Shall Command,
Install Code Command in path.

76
00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:40.419
So you just wanna do that.

77
00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.053
So just know if you hit code, and
then .enter command prompt and

78
00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:46.290
it tells you code is not about command.

79
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.990
That's why if you're on Windows,
you may need to reboot.

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.312
I'm not entirely sure, but just try
those things if none of that is working.

81
00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:58.869
Another bit of a heads up here, as we go
along, you're gonna see these prompts

82
00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:03.703
sometimes when you open an exercise where
it says that there's a workspace file and

83
00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.656
do you wanna open the workspace?

84
00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:09.228
The answer to that question is always yes,
you want to open the workspace.

85
00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:12.787
If I didn't want you to, I would not
have put a workspace file in there.

86
00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:17.278
What this does is, it opens a workspace
that allows you to load multiple projects

87
00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:21.770
inside of VS code at once, but those
projects are treated as separate projects,

88
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.899
not one project into the same folder.

89
00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.807
So they have their own configuration
settings, their own debug settings.

90
00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:33.720
There's a Start folder, which is where
you're gonna start, and there's a solution

91
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.919
folder should you happen to just give
up and want to see the running example.

92
00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.699
Also, when you run a project,
most of these projects we're

93
00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.387
gonna run within npm start
command inside of the terminal or

94
00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:52.247
the integrated terminal in VS code,
your call.

95
00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:56.536
If you do that, and it tells you
that it can't run on port 3000, so

96
00:05:56.536 --> 00:06:00.201
it's gonna run on a different one,
3001 or 3002.

97
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:05.171
Or just that it can't run it means that
you have some other example that you've

98
00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:07.973
been doing so far running on port 3000.

99
00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:11.322
And sometimes it's hard
to tell where that is.

100
00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:15.776
And so I've included some commands down
here that you need to be aware of.

101
00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.002
This top one is for my Mac/Linux people.

102
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.710
This is how you find and
processes that are running on 3000, and

103
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.412
this is how you kill them here.

104
00:06:23.412 --> 00:06:28.157
So you can just go ahead and kill any
processes that you've got without having

105
00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:32.182
to go back to figure out what's
running and what's the problem.

106
00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:34.523
And then for Windows, it's here.

107
00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:37.292
I'm just gonna be honest,
I haven't actually tried this so

108
00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:38.499
I don't know if it works.

109
00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.460
But it came from Stack Overflow,
so it's gotta be right.

110
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.960
Okay.

111
00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.531
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
then one more thing before we get in here.

112
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:51.028
There are some essential
keyboard shortcuts that

113
00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:53.818
you're going to want to know.

114
00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:58.018
One of them is toggle
the side bar in VS code.

115
00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:01.237
Another one is open the command pallet,
another one's file switcher,

116
00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:04.045
another one's the terminal,
and the other one's Settings.

117
00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:09.011
So these are essential shortcuts that you
need to be aware of before I hop into

118
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:13.045
VS code, and then once I get in
there you'll see me use them and

119
00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:15.474
you'll know which ones I'm doing.

120
00:07:15.474 --> 00:07:19.879
Our agenda today is as follows.

121
00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:24.208
We're gonna start by customizing the
editors, you sort of follow along here.

122
00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:26.945
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna theme VS code.

123
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:30.470
VS code is your house
you live in your editor.

124
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.222
You don't want to live in
a house with no furniture and

125
00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:36.724
no artwork unless you're Steve Jobs,
and you're not Steve Jobs.

126
00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:40.552
So put some furniture and
put some artwork in your house,

127
00:07:40.552 --> 00:07:43.358
just makes it more enjoyable to be there.

128
00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.535
Then we're going to cover
some productivity tricks.

129
00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:50.193
I'm just gonna show you the things
that I think will make you most

130
00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:51.925
productive in VS Code.

131
00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:55.941
Then we're gonna do navigation and
refactoring, I wanna show you the best

132
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.191
ways that I think there are to
move around inside of VS Code and

133
00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:00.677
the best ways to refactor.

134
00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:05.768
When we say refactor, what we're basically
talking about is changing existing code.

135
00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:09.077
Code systems are complex,
things are either tightly coupled,

136
00:08:09.077 --> 00:08:13.366
either intentionally or unintentionally,
and we can't simply edit lines of code

137
00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:16.508
because then that breaks things
further down in the system.

138
00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:19.972
So, we want to talk about how
VS code helps us do that.

139
00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:21.439
And then we're gonna go into debugging.

140
00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:25.953
And this is where we really start
to turn the dial towards IDE, and

141
00:08:25.953 --> 00:08:27.607
away from text editor.

142
00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:31.453
This is probably the densest part
of the workshop, just a heads up.

143
00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:36.228
Debugging configurations can be difficult,
but by the time we get through this

144
00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:40.657
section you will understand very well
what a debug configuration can do.

145
00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:45.704
And you'll understand where to go to look
to figure out how to create one, okay?

146
00:08:45.704 --> 00:08:47.320
And then we're gonna talk about Docker.

147
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.391
For the uninitiated on Docker,
don't worry,

148
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:54.478
I'm gonna go through and
give you a very quick intro to Docker.

149
00:08:54.478 --> 00:08:56.528
And then we're gonna use Docker, and

150
00:08:56.528 --> 00:09:00.641
then we're gonna use Docker behind
the scenes to do some really cool stuff.

151
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.287
Then we're gonna look at something called
remote development where I'm gonna show

152
00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:07.365
you how to take an entire development
environment, put it in VS code and

153
00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:08.362
then put it in GitHub.

154
00:09:08.362 --> 00:09:11.322
So that anybody can run
your project without

155
00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:13.889
having to install any dependencies.

156
00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:15.762
Then we're gonna talk about data.

157
00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:17.591
Most applications have data.

158
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:20.736
I talked to people sometimes and
they say, I'm just a front end developer,

159
00:09:20.736 --> 00:09:21.994
I don't ever touch a database.

160
00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.622
And I think how can that be?

161
00:09:23.622 --> 00:09:24.276
How can that be?

162
00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:25.238
How do you have that luxury?

163
00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:28.438
Everybody should know at some level,
how to deal with data,

164
00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:32.408
even if it's just casually,
that's what we're gonna do in this module.

165
00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:35.800
And then lastly, we're gonna talk
about everybody's favorite subject,

166
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.457
because there's nothing you're going to
want to talk about more at the end of this

167
00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:41.377
day, that source control, so exciting.

168
00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:45.604
What is exciting though is that if you use
Get and you're like me, and you only know

169
00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:50.095
a few commands after working with it for
10 years, it's okay, that's everybody.

170
00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:54.841
And so what we're gonna do is just cover
some of the most common workflows for

171
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.232
get inside of VS Code, and see how
much easier that can make your life.

172
00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:04.670
Okay, I think we've covered
all of the housekeeping here.

173
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.603
Now, when we're talking about VS code,
VS Code comes in two flavors,

174
00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:12.163
you have two flavors to choose from.

175
00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:16.263
There is stable VS Code which
is this blue icon here,

176
00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:21.022
if I pull this up again,
see the blue icon, that's stable.

177
00:10:21.022 --> 00:10:26.593
And then there is the Insiders' VS code,
which looks like this.

178
00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:29.900
Insiders is kind of the canary.

179
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.100
So if you're familiar with Chrome Canary,
that's Insiders.

180
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.374
If you have Insiders,

181
00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:38.605
you're gonna get the latest version of
VS code before it drops and stable.

182
00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.347
So you're basically testing.

183
00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:43.631
You see that little gear
over there with a 1 on it?

184
00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:44.640
I have an update.

185
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.491
I updated yesterday, okay?

186
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:49.416
So if you have Insiders,
you're gonna update a lot.

187
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:53.179
Most of the people that I work
with at Microsoft run Insiders.

188
00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:55.068
I do not, I run stable.

189
00:10:55.068 --> 00:10:58.544
I was the kid who went down
slides on his belly feet first,

190
00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:01.384
like holding on to the side
slowly going down.

191
00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:04.673
So I am not, I'm very risk averse.

192
00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:07.916
I like things to be stable so
I use stable but you can use Insiders.

193
00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:11.065
I'm gonna start out in
Insiders this morning though,

194
00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:15.590
because I want my VS Code to look like
your VS Code if you've just installed it.
