00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.113
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I wanna talk to
you about data inside of VS Code.

2
00:00:06.113 --> 00:00:09.769
Let's talk about working with data,
and I'll open this.

3
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:19.259
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And I think,
let's see I think what we wanna do here

4
00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.153
is I'm gonna open
the Start folder directly.

5
00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:24.749
And yeah, all right, so

6
00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.917
I made the point earlier this morning that
you really do need to know about data and

7
00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:33.501
be able to work with data at
some point from your editor.

8
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.811
Now, there are a lot of
different databases out there.

9
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:40.972
There is SQL Server, there's MySQL,
there's Post Scripts,

10
00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:45.518
there's Oracle, there are document
based databases like Mongo dB,

11
00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:49.234
Cosmos dB, Firebase,
there's a lot of them out there.

12
00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:52.626
Usually databases are a black box.

13
00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:57.600
In other words, your code talks to it,
but you can't really see inside of it

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.177
unless you're using some sort
of a command line tool or

15
00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.243
something to query it,
but you can't see it.

16
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:09.156
There are sometimes third-party tools that
you can install, like Robo 3T for MongoDB.

17
00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:11.761
But then you're going in and
out of your editor.

18
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:15.029
And depending on which
third-party tool you're using,

19
00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:17.305
it may be to your standards or it may not.

20
00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:20.489
And so databases have historically
been outside of the editor.

21
00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.474
One of the things that Visual Studio
developers have enjoyed for

22
00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:27.733
a long time is an integrated
SQL Server experience.

23
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:32.426
So if you've used Visual Studio before
you know that you can connect to your

24
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.170
SQL Server and you can just inspect it,
look at it query it.

25
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.604
You can even drag out and

26
00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:41.710
create an object relational mapping
directly from Visual Studio.

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.914
Everybody else has not had this luxury.

28
00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:49.158
So today what I wanna show you is how you
can bring in data into your development

29
00:01:49.158 --> 00:01:50.016
environment.

30
00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:54.143
So at this point we've got the dial
cranked way over to the left hand side,

31
00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:57.472
like we are way towards 11 to
the point now where we ring and

32
00:01:57.472 --> 00:01:59.086
bring the database inside.

33
00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:03.538
So not only are we inside of a container
developing in an environment that's not on

34
00:02:03.538 --> 00:02:06.908
our machine but we're gonna
bring databases into the mix to.

35
00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:10.500
Now remember we just got done
doing remote containers.

36
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.995
We're gonna use them now.

37
00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:18.193
So in order for you to complete this
project you have to have SQLite,

38
00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:23.632
MySQL and MongodB installed,
but you don't because I've

39
00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:29.526
created a remote container that
has all of those things for you.

40
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:37.006
So all you have to do here is, remote
containers, reopen folder in container.

41
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.417
So what I would like to do at least is,
I've made some changes to

42
00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:45.580
this application so
that when you run it and you refresh it,

43
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.494
it saves colors to a MongoDB database
that you don't have installed,

44
00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:54.605
but I've included it in the container so
it will be there.

45
00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.143
In order to connect to
the database instance and

46
00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.004
work with it,
you need to have the proper extension.

47
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.463
So I've included for
you the Cosmos DB extension.

48
00:03:03.463 --> 00:03:05.954
Now Cosmos DB is an Azure database, but

49
00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:09.815
the unique thing about it is
that it exposes the MongoDB API.

50
00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.849
So you can use MongoDB API
to talk to Azure,

51
00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.841
which means that you can also use it
to attach to any MongoDB database.

52
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.094
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
detach this one.

53
00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.488
And we wanna attach to MongoDB.

54
00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:28.149
So to do that, we're gonna say attach,
and it's gonna say what kind say Mongo.

55
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:34.684
And then it's want to know,
the the path, the address at MongoDB.

56
00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:40.277
Now our MongoDB is running in a container
and it's called Mongo, it's right there.

57
00:03:40.277 --> 00:03:42.377
So in order to attach to it,
this is how we do it.

58
00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:47.772
We say mongodb://mongo because
that's the name of a container.

59
00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:53.149
Because that container is linked to the
container we're in, we could say Enter.

60
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:58.126
And now we are attached to MongoDB.

61
00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.264
And actually I've got a database here.

62
00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:03.807
So let's delete this database and
create it again.

63
00:04:03.807 --> 00:04:08.538
So what I'm gonna do here now is I
need a database inside of MongoDB to

64
00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:10.034
store these values.

65
00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:13.653
So I'm gonna create a database and
you just call it lamp.

66
00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.807
And then it wants to know
the name of the collection.

67
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.039
I'm gonna call that colors.

68
00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.735
Now inside of our MongoDB we have
a database and we have a colors here.

69
00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:28.721
Let's do localhost 3000 and there we are.

70
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:33.316
And you can see our logs down here.

71
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.971
Let's go ahead and
remove this color picker.

72
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:39.065
So I'm gonna change
this color a few times.

73
00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:40.647
Go Brown.

74
00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:45.382
Let's go cyan, green,

75
00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:49.667
magenta, all right.

76
00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:53.217
So now, what I've done is I've run the app
a few times, and I've changed the colors.

77
00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:57.056
And because I changed the code to
write to the MongoDB database,

78
00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:00.054
we should now have some
records in said database.

79
00:05:00.054 --> 00:05:01.377
Let's take a look here.

80
00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:06.005
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Here's our mongo,
there's our lamp, here's our colors.

81
00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.607
And here are the records
that have been inserted.

82
00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.092
So we can see them now.

83
00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:14.365
If I click on one,
there's the color that I did, okay?

84
00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:18.432
Now, if I change this value,

85
00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:25.447
let's say I change it to the only,
remember cyan.

86
00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:32.122
And I click Save, it's gonna say, do you
wanna upload this and change the database?

87
00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:35.417
So I can say yeah, done.

88
00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:42.463
Now if I go back, let's look at this one
and look at this one, it's persisted.
