00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Another thing
that I wanna recommend that you do

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.120
inside of VSCode,
let's get this, let's see.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.563
Let's take this out.

4
00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:13.948
Let's get this out too, good to go.

5
00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:19.236
There is a thing over
here called the minimap.

6
00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:23.716
And the minimap, what it is supposed
to do is allow you to quickly move

7
00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:27.269
through your code if you have
a really long file, and so

8
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.330
you can just sort of
move like this over here.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.050
So here's what I want you to do
with the minimap, disable it.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.006
So you're gonna go to Settings, and
you're gonna search for minimap, and

11
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.540
you're going to turn it off like this.

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.395
The reason why you're gonna do that is
because you don't use it, so turn it off.

13
00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:49.695
Some people are like, no, but I do use
the minimap and I say, no, you don't,

14
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:50.670
turn the minimap off.

15
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.640
I'm gonna give you some very
strong opinions today on VSCode.

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.910
I want you to be the most productive, so
I recommend that you turn the minimap off.

17
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.730
The reason for

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.691
this is we're just maximizing the space
that we have in the editor and

19
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.761
we're removing, however, 75 pixels we now
have back in our screen, which is nice.

20
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:13.673
By default, folks, the sidebar appears
on the left-hand side of the screen,

21
00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:19.497
I would like to propose to you today that
that's the wrong side of the screen for

22
00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:23.404
the sidebar to be on,
tt should be on the other side.

23
00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:26.502
And you can move it by opening
the command pallet and saying,

24
00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:30.020
toggle side bar position, and
it will put it on the right.

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.610
Now, if you've been using VSCode
with the sidebar on the left,

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.650
this is immediately going to feel
like something nobody should do.

27
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.450
But I'm gonna show you why
you should do this, okay?

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.370
So let's move it back,
toggle sidebar position.

29
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.760
Now, I want you to watch
the code as I toggle the sidebar.

30
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.730
Watch what happens.

31
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.290
You see how it's jumping back and
forth, and back and forth.

32
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.630
Now, you don't sit here and
do this, unless you're bored and

33
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.990
trying to think of which tool
song you're gonna listen to next.

34
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.920
But you do this a lot,
and every time you do,

35
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.500
your eyes have to follow the code to the
right and then follow it back to the left.

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.910
Now, I'm gonna move it to the other side.

37
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.420
Now, watch the code,
when I collapse the sidebar, you see?

38
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.690
It's a little thing but you're helping
your brain out just a little bit by

39
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.620
keeping things still in the editor, and
putting this thing on the right-hand side.

40
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.740
This is because we are English speakers
and we read left to right, we're reading

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.780
left to right, then anything that's gonna
change the width of the screen needs to

42
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.260
be on the right-hand side so
that our cognition is not affected.

43
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.596
That's moving the sidebar to the right.

44
00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:49.490
By default In VSCode, we have this thing
appear at the top called Open Editors.

45
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.565
I find that I don't use this,
I recommend that you turn it off,

46
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:56.160
we're turning a lot of things off today.

47
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.100
So what you want to do here is look for

48
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.511
open editors
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And

49
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:07.900
then you're going to go down here and
you'll see Open Editors Visible.

50
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.748
And it says 9, and
you're gonna change that to 0, and

51
00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.671
then watch up here on the right-hand side,
it's gone.

52
00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:15.630
All right, so it's completely gone.

53
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.760
Now, you have all of this space in
the sidebar, just for your files and

54
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.100
your projects which is what you want.

55
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.036
All right, by default,
our Settings is a UI.

56
00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:34.176
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
what I mean by that is,

57
00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:37.550
we have this UI that sits
on top of a Settings file.

58
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.900
We're not actually looking at
the Settings, we're looking at the UI.

59
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.956
We can change that if we go to,
if we look at settings json,

60
00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:50.210
we should be able to change
the Settings editor.

61
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.461
So here it says, Determines which
settings editor to use by default,

62
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:57.063
change this to json.

63
00:03:57.063 --> 00:04:01.040
And then, if we close this, and
then if reopen it with Command or

64
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.970
Control comma,
now we're looking at the json instead.

65
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.330
Now, here's why I think
you should do this.

66
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.890
It's because you can see all
your settings at the same time.

67
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.780
You're smart, folks, you can do this.

68
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.430
If you need to add a setting
just open quotes, and

69
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.430
you'll get IntelliSense here,
and as you start to search,

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.450
you'll get all of the different items that
align with the service that you're using.

71
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.890
So I highly recommend doing that.

72
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.350
Now, here's the thing,
if you would also like to have the UI,

73
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.220
you can have both, you can do both.

74
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.846
So what we can do here is we can map a
keyboard shortcut that opens the settings

75
00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:38.592
UI, and the settings JSON.

76
00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:42.712
So what I do is,
if we open the command palette,

77
00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:49.204
we can go to Open Keyboard Shortcuts,
and then we can search for settings.

78
00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:53.127
And I'm gonna have to
decrease my font size to see,

79
00:04:53.127 --> 00:04:57.471
open settings,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let me

80
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.930
collapse this a bit.

81
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.950
So it says Preferences, Open Settings,
and see that little UI after it?

82
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.140
So what I've done is I've mapped mine.

83
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.730
So what you would do is you'd click on
this or double-click, and you'd say,

84
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.840
what I do is just because settings is
controller command, comma, I do Command or

85
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.370
Control option, comma, and
then I can use that instead.

86
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.586
So now, If I close this, if I wanna
go to Settings, its Command comma.

87
00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:27.690
If I wanna go to the settings UI,
its Command Option, comma, and

88
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.650
that gets me into the settings UI.

89
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.184
The thing that's nice about the settings
UI is that it actually uses

90
00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:38.610
Azure's artificial intelligence on the
backend, to try to help you with search.

91
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:47.204
So you can use natural language
like I want to change the theme.

92
00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:51.070
Let's s ee if this works.

93
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.033
There we go, so look, and
it says Workbench Color Customizations,

94
00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:55.790
maybe that's what you want.

95
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.600
So you do want the UI from time to time,
and

96
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.370
especially as the AI gets better,
because the more that people use it and

97
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.370
search in the UI,
the better it's gonna get.

98
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.280
So just know that there is an AI that's
working behind the scenes that you can use

99
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.520
in VSCode.

100
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.830
And everybody can thank Azure for
that one, or is it Bing?

101
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.601
It's one of the two, all right?

102
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:18.940
[LAUGH] That's the default settings view.

103
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.980
How are we doing on time?

104
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.690
We're doing all right.

105
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.210
Let's, yes?

106
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For the AI to work,
do you have to be on the web or?

107
00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:27.713
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Yes, you do have to
be connected to the Internet, yeah,

108
00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:31.643
the AI is in the cloud, it's Skynet,
it has to be able to go up and, yeah.

109
00:06:34.432 --> 00:06:36.020
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: You see
this up here at the top?

110
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.630
These are called breadcrumbs, and they
allow you to navigate by clicking on them.

111
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.010
Kinda cool, I don't use them, so
I recommend that you turn them off.

112
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.020
So we're gonna go breadcrumbs.enabled,
false, boom, they're gone.

113
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.540
It gives you more space
back in your editor.

114
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.861
Let's see here,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Another one that you can

115
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:03.002
do is, down here in the status bar, this
was just added in a newer updated VSCode.

116
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:09.030
You can right-click items and hide them,
so if you're like I don't need to see for

117
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.380
instance, like Live Share, let's just hide
this, we can just hide it, and it's gone.

118
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.740
So you can reclaim space in your status
bar now in VSCode which was nice.

119
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.040
Before, you didn't have control
over that stuff, now you do.

120
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.180
The activity bar over here can also be
hidden if you wanna have a little extra

121
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.300
space.

122
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.440
If you do toggle activity bar visibility.

123
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.804
Now, it's gone, okay?

124
00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:35.850
I'm gonna put it back.

125
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.010
You can bind a keyboard shortcut to this.

126
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.729
So we go and search for
toggle activity bar.

127
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.750
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And you can see,
I've mapped mine to Control Command B.

128
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.440
Now, the reason that I've done that is
that Command B collapses the sidebar, and

129
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.670
if I add Control Command B,
now I can collapse the activity bar too.

130
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.620
So I'm just making more space for
myself in my editor.

131
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.527
By the way, we'll talk about this in
a minute, but you can navigate to these

132
00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:09.717
things in the activity bar with
keyboard shortcuts, right?

133
00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:15.600
So you don't have to click on
them to move around between them.

134
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.250
And once you learn those
keyboard shortcuts,

135
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.990
you can get rid of the activity bar and
it's more space for your code.
