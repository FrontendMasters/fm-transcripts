00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.050
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Now,
the branch that we've got is only local.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.360
It's actually not in,
we never published it, right?

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.200
So it's still local.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.580
So if we look at,
if we go back to our branches here,

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.990
here, and we look,
we've got a fixed description branch.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.890
So what we can do here is
we can just tell, luckily,

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300
we can say Delete Branch text description,
and it's gone.

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.050
So very powerful tools for just simply
working with your Source Control.

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.260
Now in real life,
this is not a flow that you would use.

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.380
The flow that you would more often use is
that you would create a feature branch

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.380
as a developer and that would be
published to GitHub and then you

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.020
would submit a pull request to merge
your feature branch back into master.

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.480
That is the most common scenario.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.740
So I wanna sort of simulate that now.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.110
And because I can't simulate it
with two people in the same order,

16
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.170
what I've done is I have forked
this repo into a different

17
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.680
account called notburkeholland, just so
we can keep these two people straight.

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640
And what I wanna do is
I wanna make a change.

19
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520
So I'm gonna go ahead and refresh this.

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.330
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna come up here, and

21
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.410
I'm actually looking at an older version.

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.600
So let's, that's fine,
we can still do this.

23
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.976
So what I'm gonna do here is,
I wanna change this and I wanna say.

24
00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:29.844
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's take this out and
say, we'll just do,

25
00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.590
we'll go back to the initial, I love lamp.

26
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.960
Actually let's just do all caps,
all of it.

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.860
I ate a big red candle.

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.020
And then just to switch it up,
we'll put I love lamp down here.

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.850
Okay, so I've now created a change here.

30
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.395
And I'm going to add a comment,
description so much better.

31
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.298
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
I'm gonna go ahead and

32
00:01:56.298 --> 00:02:00.591
I'm going to commit to a new branch and
start a pull request.

33
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.007
I'm gonna propose a file change.

34
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.937
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And
I'm going to create the pull request.

35
00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:14.577
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Okay, and
then I'm gonna go ahead and merge this.

36
00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:16.700
So we'll merge this pull request.

37
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.170
So emerging to my own repo here.

38
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.790
I'm doing all this from GitHub.

39
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.570
And now that I've done that, what I need
to do is, I need to come back here and

40
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.910
I need to do a new pull request to
merge this to the upstream, okay?

41
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.120
So I've got I love lamp and

42
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.420
then I'm trying to merge from
this repo into this repo.

43
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.110
So I'm gonna say create a new pull
request, and like description is good now.

44
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.610
It's okay.

45
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.360
Okay, I'm gonna create the pull request,
okay?

46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.610
Now, this cannot automatically be merged,

47
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.980
because there were conflicts with
the main branch, we're out of sync here.

48
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.590
So I'm gonna come back to VS Code, and

49
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.220
there's an extension that I've
included called GitHub Pull Requests.

50
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.080
It's made by us, I think.

51
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.110
Or GitHub which is also us.

52
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.750
It's made by GitHub.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.990
So GitHub Pull Requests.

54
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.430
And I'm gonna right click,
I've got it hidden, there it is.

55
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.980
And I'm gonna come here and
I'm gonna open this All right here.

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.370
And now you see, look,
that pull request is inside of VS Code.

57
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.480
So if I expand this,
I can click on Description and

58
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.110
it will pull up this conversation
that we're having, right?

59
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.990
So no description provided, and
I can say, can you be more specific?

60
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.420
And then say comment,
and let's go back out.

61
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.470
And if I'm not Berk,

62
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.780
I'm actually now commenting with
this person from within VS Code.

63
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.310
So I can say, description was not good.

64
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.910
Now it is.

65
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.980
Right, because this is the kind
of comments developers leave.

66
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.560
This is what I've done,
I fixed, I made it better.

67
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.570
I don't see what the problem is.

68
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.040
And then if we come back here in VS Code,
you have to do a quick Refresh here.

69
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.610
But you'll see this comment come in,
description was not good.

70
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.620
Now it is.

71
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.590
So what we can do is we can
check out this pull request.

72
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.030
So now if you look down here
we're on the PR, notburkeholland

73
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.860
branch number four, and
we can look at what's been changed.

74
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.810
Right here,
we can see the changes in the diff.

75
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.830
So let's see, nice.

76
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.600
You know what?

77
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.390
That is better.

78
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.430
I like it.

79
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.140
So what we'll do is, we will,
we can exit review mode here.

80
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.600
So I'm just gonna click Exit Review Mode.

81
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.672
And, it wants us to check out.

82
00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:49.250
Let's not do that just yet.

83
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.800
So let's switch back to master, here, and

84
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.230
then we can merge, Merge Branch.

85
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.770
Here's our PR, so we'll merge it and
what do we have, merge conflicts.

86
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.872
So we go back to Index,
we can now accept the incoming change,

87
00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:11.124
save it and then go ahead and commit it.

88
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.990
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: I guess,
I just want this to be over, okay?

89
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.409
Then we'll push it and
then we'll come back and

90
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.169
say on our item here, 0 pull requests.

91
00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.668
And if we go back and we refresh,

92
00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:35.900
this pull request has been
merged by commit into master.

93
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.770
So that's how you can work with pull
requests directly from inside a VS Code.

94
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.180
Along with what I consider to
be the most common workflow for

95
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.570
VS Code in regards to Git.
