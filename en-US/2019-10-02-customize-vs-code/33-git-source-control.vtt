00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.970
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: After ten years of
working with git, here's what I know.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.410
Git clone, git ad.git commit and git push.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.760
That's it.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.610
And I know that in a worst
case scenario git push-F.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
Now, what I've realized is that most
developers are kind of like I am.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.140
They don't really understand the ins and
outs of git because it's complicated.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.150
I think there's a course here at Frontend
Masters just on Git by my co-worker Nina

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.180
which I should probably watch
to broaden my Git knowledge.

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.200
But as it stands,
I'm not very functional with Git.

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.630
So I say that to say
that if that's you and

11
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.020
you feel that way, that's totally fine.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.260
Lots of us feel that way.

13
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.949
You're in good company.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.590
And so what I wanna do in this last
section is just show you how you can use

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.750
VS code to work with your source control.

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.640
And I wanna show you just some common
workflows that you can stick to.

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.970
So you don't have to
worry about rebasing and

18
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.500
cherry picking on all this other stuff.

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.640
You just sort of stick to the basics here.

20
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.250
So the first thing we need to do is
we need to clone a repo into VS code.

21
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.310
So I have one here, just called I love
lamp, it's our simple project for

22
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.880
our exercise.

23
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.630
And to clone it, I'm just gonna grab it by
saying Clone or Download and get the URL.

24
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.430
In the VS code, I'm going to say Clone and
Git Clone from the command palette.

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.170
And then I'll enter the repository URL and
then it'll ask me, where do you want it?

26
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.530
So I'm gonna put it inside
the Start folder here.

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700
That's the wrong exercise and
we put it in the right exercise.

28
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.590
Let's do exercise eight Source control,
we'll put it in here.

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.090
And then it's gonna clone it.

30
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.350
And then it wants to know, do you want
to add the clone, would you like to open

31
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.696
the clone repository or
add it to the current workspace.

32
00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.930
I'm just gonna open it, which is gonna
give us a new window of VS code and

33
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.620
that project is now open
inside the VS code.

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.380
So it's opened and
we are connected to Git with this project.

35
00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.590
So let me just show you sort of
the highlights of source control

36
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.650
inside of VS code.

37
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.100
So let's say, for instance,

38
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.280
that we want to change this content here,
right, this description.

39
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.100
And because we know how
to use multiple cursors,

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.370
we could change both of
these lines at one time.

41
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.990
And what we really wanna do is,
we just wanna remove this period.

42
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.860
We don't want that in the description.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.480
When I do that, you'll notice that we
get a blue bar over here to the side,

44
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.670
that shows us that something
has been removed or changed.

45
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.580
And you can see the diff here,
right inline.

46
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.650
And if you would like to,
you can just undo directly from here.

47
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120
With this button and
now we're back to where we were before.

48
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.720
If I was to remove one of these lines,
now we see a little triangle and

49
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.780
the triangle denotes that
something has been removed.

50
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.610
It's no longer there.

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.380
And if we expand that,
it'll show you what's been removed and

52
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.800
of course you can revert off of that.

53
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.590
Also notice that there's down and
up arrows.

54
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.460
So you can move between
changes in the file as well.

55
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.830
So let's put that back.

56
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.700
And then you can probably
guess if I add a line

57
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.420
we get a little green bar
out here in the side.

58
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.930
And that shows us that
something has been added.

59
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.750
So these are in line annotations in
your files so that you can see what's

60
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.460
actually been changed locally, versus
what's been changed in source control.

61
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.220
So let's go ahead and
remove this line here.

62
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.400
And I'm gonna go ahead and
let's go back and take these periods off.

63
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.319
I'm gonna save.

64
00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.027
And when we click Save, we'll now have
an item over here in our activity bar

65
00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:44.190
that's on our source
control activity bar item.

66
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.315
And we can open the source
control view with Ctrl+Shift+G.

67
00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:52.610
Now this is one of the only shortcuts that
I think is the same on Windows and Mac.

68
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.380
So Ctrl+Shift+G opens that view.

69
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.420
And we can see inside our index file.

70
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.370
If we click on the index file
we can see we get a diff view so

71
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.320
we can see what's been changed here.

72
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.772
It's these lines.

73
00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:11.028
And we can see that here and
it also highlights and

74
00:04:11.028 --> 00:04:12.980
shows us that this was removed.

75
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.876
So we can see exactly what's been changed.

76
00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:23.790
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: If we click this
plus button here, we stage the change.

77
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.720
This is the same as git add and if we come
up here to the top and put a message in,

78
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.600
we can say, fixing the description.

79
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.880
And then you can press Cmd or Ctrl + Enter
and now you have performed a commit.

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.810
Now, the next thing you need to do
is you need to push it up to GitHub.

81
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.220
And the way that you would do that,

82
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.370
you can actually hit the ellipsis up here,
you're gonna say Push.

83
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.320
Or you can come down here and click this.

84
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.500
This is a sync down here.

85
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.030
The difference between a push and
a sync is that a push just pushes,

86
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.040
a sync does a pull and
then it does a push.

87
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.100
So in other words, if you' pull and
you've got conflicts,

88
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.140
it will stop you on the push and
say, whoa you can't do that.

89
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.800
So the sync is a better
option just specifically for

90
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.660
that work flow instead of the push.

91
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.470
Although when you try to push
you're gonna find out the hard way.

92
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.680
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
click the button and

93
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.160
that's gonna push my change up to GitHub
and it will be reflected in my repository.

94
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.500
So here's another very common workflow.

95
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.425
You have made a change,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Like this.

96
00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:43.579
And then you go in and you add it and

97
00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:49.279
you're like,
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Okay?

98
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:54.490
And then you commit it and you're like,
crap, I don't wanna do that.

99
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.570
I need to add another
change to this commit or

100
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.870
this is not what I wanted to commit.

101
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.000
And this is part of the place
where people are like,

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.545
now I don't know what to do
from the command line, okay?

103
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:08.220
In VS code it's just as simple
as saying undo last commit.

104
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.520
And then if don't you want it staged,
just unstage it.

105
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.110
And you're back to where you were, right?

106
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.797
No harm no foul.

107
00:06:16.797 --> 00:06:21.289
Another thing that people do a lot is
they'll make a commit like this, and

108
00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.540
then they will do a pull and they'll
have conflicts or something like that.

109
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.687
Or what they wanna do is they wanna
revert back to what they had before.

110
00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:32.540
So the way you do that is
you can stash your changes.

111
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.581
So what we'll do is we'll just say,
up here and we'll say stash, like this.

112
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.046
Let's see, sorry,
let's undo the last command.

113
00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:49.090
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: All right, so
these are our changes, so let's stash.

114
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.220
And anything you can do from that ellipsis
you can do from the command palette.

115
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.590
All right, stash message,
maybe, not sure yet, okay?

116
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.940
And now the changes are stashed.

117
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.340
So to get them back,
you wanna pop the stash,

118
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.760
you wanna get it back off the stash,
so we're gonna say, pop stash,

119
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.270
git pop stash, right,
on master, maybe, not just yet.

120
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.190
And boom, you're back.

121
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.090
Now these are things that
you can do from the Git CLI.

122
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.400
They're all very doable, very easy.

123
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.040
Not say easy things, but
very common things to do, but

124
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.620
I can never remember what the commands
are, I don't know about you.

125
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.080
I can't remember how to stash and
pop things, but

126
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.720
the VS code makes it a lot easier.

127
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.500
Another thing that's quite
a bit easier is branching.

128
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.410
So we can create a new branch here
by just clicking on master and

129
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.690
saying, create a new branch.

130
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.120
And let's call this fix description, okay?

131
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.710
And now I'm on the fix description branch.

132
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.270
Now, let's say in fix description,
I come in here and

133
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.920
I'm another developer and
I'm like, that's not right.

134
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.680
I've seen this movie.

135
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.010
I know how this goes.

136
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.739
This is a I ate a big red candle.

137
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.170
I love lamp.

138
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.870
If you've seen Anchorman, hopefully this
reference should make some description.

139
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.940
So you've fixed the description and
now you want to commit this back.

140
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.230
So let's go to our index file here.

141
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.990
It will show you your changes.

142
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.270
Get it right.

143
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.550
Let's go ahead and commit that.

144
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.090
So now we've committed.

145
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.890
So let's go back to our master branch.

146
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.390
Master.

147
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.300
And we're on our master branch and

148
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.360
let's just say on the master branch,
we say you know what?

149
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.580
I kinda liked it with feeling.

150
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.900
It's simple, it conveys that I care.

151
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.610
Let's leave it like that.

152
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.170
So I'm gonna save that.

153
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.771
And then I'm gonna go ahead and
commit this as well.

154
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:50.614
And I'm gonna say,
say it like you mean it.

155
00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.775
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Okay and
now what I'm gonna do is,

156
00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:59.228
let's just say somebody else
has got fixed description and

157
00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:04.244
I'm somebody else has
done a fixed description,

158
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.680
well we merge that branch in.

159
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.450
So we can merge by opening
command pallet and saying merge.

160
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.910
Merge branch.

161
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.100
And we're gonna say, fix description.

162
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.440
And right away, VS Code's gonna tell us,
you got a merge conflict.

163
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.150
Now, the reason we have a merge
conflict is that we have two people

164
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.590
that have changed the code outside
of the origin, outside of upstream.

165
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.690
And Git cannot reconcile it doesn't
know which one of these we want.

166
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.900
Both of these could be valid changes.

167
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.360
And so if you've used Git before,
in outside or in a text editor,

168
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.080
it puts this in your file which
is hard to work with, all right?

169
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.190
So you have files that now
have characters in them.

170
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.790
The source control has inserted
characters into your file.

171
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.600
VS code provides a really nice view for
working with these changes.

172
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.970
So we can accept the current change,
which is what we've got on master.

173
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.764
Or we could accept the incoming change or
we could accept both changes if

174
00:10:04.764 --> 00:10:09.590
you're a person that doesn't like to
take sides, you can accept both changes.

175
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.600
And we can even compare the changes,
which is gonna give us a diff.

176
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.720
And then we can start
a Live Share session as well.

177
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.800
So Live Share, which we're not gonna get
into today is a collaboration tool for

178
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.860
VS code that allows two people or
three or four or

179
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.024
five to work in the same instance at once.

180
00:10:27.024 --> 00:10:31.110
So maybe you and I would like to
collaborate, instead of me walking

181
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.700
over starting a Skype call,
we just connect via Live Share.

182
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.490
So what this does is,
you start a Live Share session.

183
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.000
It starts a session, and then I can
look and say who made this change?

184
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.160
Who did this?

185
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.860
And then can you get on
this Live Share session and

186
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.030
take a look at this with me and
explain why you made this change?

187
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.180
So I'm going to accept
the incoming change.

188
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.880
Now, we can go ahead and stage this.

189
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.140
Yeah, I saved it already.

190
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.860
Didn't I?
I didn't.

191
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.795
Staged better description.

192
00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:05.333
Hit Enter and then we can push.
