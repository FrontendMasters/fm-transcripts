00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So let's take a look
at how we can use SQLite within VS Code.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.990
What I need to do first is,
I want to open a terminal instance.

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.730
And then from here, what we need to do
is we need to create a data directory.

4
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.220
And I've actually already got one, so
I'm gonna say, remove the data directory.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.300
We'll start from scratch.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.300
By the way, if you're on a Mac, and you
didn't know, Cmd+K clears out the screen.

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.620
Also, Ctrl+U clears off the current line.

8
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.330
Cmd+K, Ctrl+U, those are magical
commands if you're on Bash.

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830
So let's create a data directory.

10
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.280
And then we're gonna
move into that directory.

11
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.900
And you can see it appeared over here.

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.540
I don't know if you saw but
it's now in the Explorer.

13
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.925
So I'm gonna say sqlite3.

14
00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:59.135
And because I've already included that,
this command is just gonna run.

15
00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:00.779
And I'm gonna say lamp.db.

16
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.609
And I'm gonna run this, and

17
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.590
I'm gonna just hit databases
to make sure that it's there.

18
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.700
There it is.

19
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.570
And I'm gonna quit.

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.920
If we do a list now,
we see we have a lamp.db file.

21
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.360
So we can now start interacting
with this file from VS Code

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.820
because it is a valid SQLite database.

23
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.318
So let's do this.

24
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:30.065
Cmd+Palette, Ctrl, Cmd+Shift+P, SQLite.

25
00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:32.850
And we're gonna say, open database.

26
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.600
And it's gonna wanna know which one.

27
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.340
It automatically picked up this one,
we'll select that.

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.720
And now we have
a SQLite Explorer over here.

29
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.023
And inside is our database.

30
00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:47.460
And what we can do here
is run a new query.

31
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.850
And let's do some things here.

32
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.530
So let's do, let's go back to
the Explorer from my workspace.

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.220
Let's run some SQL here.

34
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.290
So what I'm gonna do is
create a table called colors.

35
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.260
So we'll do this and we can run this.

36
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.430
So we highlight it and we say,
sqlite, run selected query.

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.290
Boom.

38
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.015
Okay, and now let's do, let's insert.

39
00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:16.540
In fact, let's grab both of these items.

40
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.046
Let's highlight just this line,
run selected query, okay?

41
00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:29.910
And then let's highlight just this line,
run selected query.

42
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.933
There we go.

43
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:37.010
All right, and
now we're getting data back from SQLite.

44
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.990
So you can see if you have
a SQLite database in your project,

45
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.970
you can use it directly from VS Code.

46
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.534
And you can interact with it without ever
leaving your editor, which is pretty cool.

47
00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.090
I wanna do one more just to
show you what's possible.

48
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.750
There are other possible database options.

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.030
The other one that we see quite a lot,
quite a bit of use from is MySQL.

50
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.050
A lot of people use MySQL.

51
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.070
I've given you an entire MySQL database
as part of this dev container.

52
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.760
I'm sorry in advance to the Internet here.

53
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.110
So, whether or
not you have MySQL installed,

54
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.710
you will have to open this project.
