00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.880
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Another concept that's
become very popular in editors over

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.496
the past few years is
the concept of multiple cursors.

3
00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:08.990
Now, multiple cursors are very powerful,
but

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.000
a lot of people have trouble understanding
when I should actually use one.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.950
It's kind of like artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.500
Like it's a cool technology,
but when do I actually use it?

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.840
And so what I wanna show you is some cases
in which you would use multiple cursors.

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.070
Once you understand how to use them,
you'll start to find places to use them.

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.610
So for instance here in this file,

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.920
I'm gonna decrease the font size here so
we can get more text on the screen.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.460
I hope everybody can see that still.

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.290
If I put my cursor on colorInput,

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.380
notice that DS code is highlighting
other instances of colorInput here.

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.630
So let's say that we
wanted to rename this or

15
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.240
change this value,
this colorInput value to something else.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.410
What I can do is highlight it.

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.513
And now you can see it's highlighted, and
you can't see it on the projector but

18
00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.290
it's highlighted the colorInput.

19
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.430
It's highlighted the colorInput
in document, getElementById.

20
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.110
And it's highlighted
the colorInput that is down

21
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.170
below in
the goButton.addEventListener method.

22
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.290
I can add a cursor to every single one of
these instances with Command &gt; Shift &gt; L.

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.590
I now have a cursor on all
of these instances, and

24
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.340
I can hit backspace, and
then I can type lampColor.

25
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.180
And I have changed all three of
those instances at one time.

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.910
Now, if you're paying
close attention though,

27
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.260
you'd notice that what I just
did would break the application.

28
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.450
One of these things is a variable name,
and

29
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.130
the other one is a reference
to an element in the HTML.

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.140
So what we really wanna do here is
we wanna change two of them, but

31
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.796
not one of them.

32
00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:54.560
So we wanna change the first one, we
wanna leave the second one the same, and

33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.240
we wanna change the third one.

34
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.460
You can use Command &gt; D to
add one cursor at a time.

35
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.240
So if I come here and select this and
say Command &gt; D, it puts a cursor there.

36
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.910
Command &gt; D again, and
we get a cursor down below, and

37
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.240
I hit the arrow key there so we lost it.

38
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.960
D &gt; D, now we have three cursors.

39
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.353
What we want to do though,
is we want to skip this second instance.

40
00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:26.269
So what we're gonna do is hit Command &gt; D,
and then we're gonna say Command &gt; K,

41
00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.160
still holding down the Command key,
Command &gt; D again.

42
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.080
And that skips that instance
with the multiple cursors.

43
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.080
You'll use this a lot.

44
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.430
You need to know how to
skip with multiple cursors.

45
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.602
And now we can safely say,
this is lampColor and

46
00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:46.346
we've only got the two values
that we're looking for.

47
00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.220
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: So
that's skipping instances.

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.665
I'm gonna change this back, and
let's talk about finding things.

49
00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:00.627
Of course, you have find and replace,

50
00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:05.008
most people are familiar with this idea.

51
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:12.480
In our index.html file here, we can find
anything with just Command, or Ctrl &gt; F.

52
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.521
If you do Command &gt; Shift &gt; F,

53
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.375
that actually opens
the project-wide find and replace.

54
00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.669
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Here,
up in the Find though,

55
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.760
I wanna show you something that you can do
with Find that's a little more powerful.

56
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.270
So in our application here, let's say

57
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.760
just for the sake of demonstration,
that we're looking for

58
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.180
all of the images in this file.

59
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.850
We can do that with the Find box.

60
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.310
And we do that by using
a regular expression.

61
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.310
That's what this little toggle here is.

62
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.940
If I turn this on, we're now looking for
regular expression.

63
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.480
If we said something like input,
it's gonna find all the inputs.

64
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.470
Now, you don't need to know regular
expressions to make this work,

65
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.320
you just need to know a basic amount.

66
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.970
So for instance,
we have two images in this page,

67
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.130
and if we go over to the application
they're broken, right?

68
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.990
The header image is broken and
the background image is broken.

69
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.140
And they're broken because
they've been moved

70
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.940
over here in our start folder,
and now in an images folder.

71
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.430
But you can see the path
here is not correct.

72
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.195
So what we wanna do is we wanna update
both of the paths on these items.

73
00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:40.889
We can find all of the images
in this document just by saying,

74
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.170
I wanna find any jpeg, and
I wanna find any png, and any gif.

75
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.660
So that or right there allows
you to find multiple different

76
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.440
strings using a regular expression.

77
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.540
So if we scroll down,
you'll see we've got background, and

78
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.830
we've also got logo.png right there.

79
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.650
Now at this point what we want to do,
if we've got both of these things on

80
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.520
the screen is,
we want to change them both, okay?

81
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.340
Now, you might be tempted to change
one and then change the other,

82
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.890
you found one and then found the other.

83
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.530
You don't need to do that,
you can change them both at the same time.

84
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.770
So what you're gonna do here, is you're
gonna press Option or Alt &gt; Enter,

85
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.650
and that is gonna add a cursor to both
of those instances at the same time.

86
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.970
And then we can use Option or Alt and
the arrow key, and move to the front of

87
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.830
the word, move to the front of the period,
move to the front of the next word.

88
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.270
We're now at the very front, and
all we have to do is type images/ and

89
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.340
we've updated both instances
of images at the same time.

90
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.520
Multiple cursors are so cool,
you just have to know when to use them.

91
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.520
So just to repeat that again, when you're
in the Find, Option or Alt &gt; Enter,

92
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.309
will add a cursor instance to every
found instance in the document,

93
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.760
it's a very powerful feature.

94
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.360
One other thing I wanna show
you about Find and Replace.

95
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.190
So I think here Replace is,
Option &gt; Shift &gt; F.

96
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.370
So if you do Command &gt; Option or

97
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.790
Control &gt; Alt &gt; F,
then you get to Find and Replace box.

98
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.100
Now, a lot of times what we'll do here
is we'll say, I want to find this or

99
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.860
actually let's find something else,
say we wanna find container.

100
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.090
So we'll say I wanna find container,
and I wanna replace it with section or

101
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.250
something like that.

102
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.990
And then you hit Enter and
it will replace, just a quick tip.

103
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.320
If you do this instead of typing in there,
you can just highlight something.

104
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.560
So let's say we wanna find columns, and
then we'll do Command &gt; Option &gt; F,

105
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.120
and columns is prefilled in the Find.

106
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.897
So whatever is on the clipboard before you
open Find is what gets put in the Find.

107
00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:05.282
So just faster instead of typing it,
just copy it and then open the Find and

108
00:07:05.282 --> 00:07:09.101
Replace, and it will make you
a little bit more productive, and

109
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:10.962
everybody will be impressed.

110
00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:14.380
And that's the most important
thing in life, is it not?

111
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.580
All right?

112
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.550
It isn't, that's the truth.
