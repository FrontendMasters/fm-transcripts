WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.778
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: And now let's look at
what's quite possibly the most complicated

2
00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:04.112
scenario that I could think of.

3
00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:11.170
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: This application
has two components in it.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.580
It is the same Lamp app
that we've been running.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.740
And let me go ahead and open this,
and make sure I kill this, or

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.540
it won't work very well.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.510
It's the same Lamp app
that we've been running.

8
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.620
The difference is it is written in React,
number one,

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.830
and it has, as part of the same project,
an API server.

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.790
So there's an API server that runs on
Express, right here in the server folder,

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.480
and there's a React
project that runs here.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.500
Now for applications,
or frameworks rather,

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.680
like Vue and Angular and React,
in order to run these things,

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.280
there is a webpack development server
that is included as part of their CLI.

15
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.880
So if I come down here, let's add a new
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Terminal instance.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.010
If I say npm start on this,

17
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.310
what's gonna happen is it's
gonna run React Script's start.

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.430
This is going to fire up
a webpack development server and

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.450
then it is going to run it in the browser.

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.483
Now this is what enables hot reload
inside of View and Angular and

21
00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:16.616
all those frameworks.

22
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.980
And it's part of what we love so
much about those frameworks.

23
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.160
The problem is that process is
isolated away from everything else.

24
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.200
So it's difficult to get ahold of, and you
can only debug it in the Chrome Dev Tools.

25
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.800
We also have the Express server, so I'm
gonna open up another terminal instance.

26
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.303
And I'm gonna move into the server folder.

27
00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:41.303
And I'm gonna run npm
start in that folder, and

28
00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:45.510
that's gonna fire up the little
Express server that's running.

29
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.660
So now what I've got is I have a front-end
app and I have a server app and

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.420
they're both running simultaneously inside
of VS code, two separate processes.

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.650
Everybody still with me?

32
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.830
It's a complicated set up, I know.

33
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.600
I was trying to think of something very
complicated to make this interesting.

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.116
So what we need to do is we need
to be able to debug both of these.

35
00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:09.830
So I'm gonna come to our
launch configs here, and

36
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.240
we're going to add in a new launch config.

37
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.540
I'm gonna chose Chrome.

38
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.980
And now we should have a launch
config here, and we do.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.780
So we wanna configure a debugger for
both of these processes.

40
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.760
The first one is Chrome,
which runs on port 3000.

41
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.630
Let me just refer to my teaching materials
here, make sure I don't make any mistakes.

42
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.130
And then the web route is actually /src.

43
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.190
So if you remember, right there,

44
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.410
this is where our front-end
app runs out of src, okay.

45
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.970
So we might change this to,

46
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.600
let's change the name a little bit,
let's do Launch React.

47
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.460
So this will launch the debugger and
attach to the React process that's

48
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.730
running in Chrome, which we already
talked about debug and browser apps.

49
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.710
Now we need another configuration
To debug the server portion.

50
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.930
So I'm gonna click Add configuration.

51
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.220
And we're gonna get node,
and we're gonna say node.

52
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.250
We're gonna do launch, we need a node
Launch Program, so let's do that.

53
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.990
So now we have a node one, so
we'll change this to Launch Server.

54
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.610
And our workspace folder
is almost correct here.

55
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.210
So I'm gonna change this
to server/server.js,

56
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.090
because that's the file that gets run.

57
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.440
That's the little Express server here,
see, server, server/js,

58
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.964
that's where we're at.

59
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:39.150
All right, so now we have two
launch configurations in this same,

60
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.340
single launch configuration file here.

61
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.170
So if I come up here, you can see they're
both here, so I could start the server.

62
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.539
And actually I need to come down here and
make sure I stop it here.

63
00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:57.870
So I'm gonna start the server, okay,
server's running and attached.

64
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.860
And then I'm gonna come over and
I'm gonna start the front-end.

65
00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.220
And I'm gonna hit debug and

66
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.470
that's gonna launch Chrome which
you should be used to by now.

67
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.640
And now look,
we got both processes in our debugger and

68
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460
we can switch between the two.

69
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.880
I'm gonna stop this for a second and

70
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.590
show you something called
compound launch configurations.

71
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.290
So instead of starting
both of these things,

72
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.760
it would be easier if they
both started at the same time.

73
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.924
So what we're gonna do is
Launch the whole darn app.

74
00:04:27.924 --> 00:04:32.498
And [LAUGH] we're gonna say,
Launch Server, look, and it's helping us.

75
00:04:32.498 --> 00:04:37.550
This is why people love VS code is cuz
of stuff like this, and Launch React.

76
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.210
And now come back to the debugger and
look, Launch the whole darn app.

77
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.832
Let's go ahead and hit the green button.

78
00:04:45.832 --> 00:04:49.730
It's gonna launch the server, it's gonna
launch React, they're both running.

79
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.630
And now, let's look for app.js in our, and
this is our, let's put a breakpoint here.

80
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.140
And let's put one in the index.js file,

81
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.930
which is in our routes,
which is our Express Route.

82
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.200
And we'll go ahead and put this here.

83
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.960
And I wonder,

84
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.890
I needed to pass in an environment
variable too so that will fail.

85
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.870
But notice how this is not enabled,
see how it's grayed out.

86
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.330
If I switch over to, it's because I'm
not looking at the right process,

87
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.560
if I switch to server look, now it's red.

88
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.820
So we're switching back and forth here.

89
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.020
And that's why that is the way that it is.

90
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.440
Let me see here, let me go back and
just add in, so I'm gonna stop this.

91
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.908
Let me go back into our launch config and
let me add in on the server.

92
00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:48.676
We want env, and then we want API_BASE,

93
00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:53.370
and then let's look at the env file.

94
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.870
Let's grab this.

95
00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:58.064
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Got it.

96
00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:01.948
&gt;&gt; Burke Holland: Let's put it back.

97
00:06:01.948 --> 00:06:03.850
What's the command PP there?

98
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.450
Everybody see that?

99
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.670
All right, let's run it again.

100
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.600
Launch the whole darn app.

101
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.400
Looks good, and now we should be
able to look at our breakpoints.

102
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.720
Let's look at a breakpoint here,
let's put one here.

103
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.110
And we still have one in App.js,
let's make sure we do, all right?

104
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.130
So now, let's change the color,
green, green is good, hit Go.

105
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.780
And now we're broken in the React app.

106
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.410
This is the React app, so
we're debugging a browser app, okay.

107
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.580
And if I continue on,
now we're debugging the Express app.

108
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.420
So we're debugging the full stack app.

109
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.620
Even though these are two
separate processes entirely.

110
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.150
We have created a compound launch
configuration that allows us to launch it

111
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.530
all at the same time, and

112
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.820
debug everything as if we were
looking at one entire application.

113
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.830
That's called compound
launch configurations.

114
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.080
And now you know, more than most
people about launch configurations.

115
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.812
I have just walked you through
the nitty and the gritty
