00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.628
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're gonna
need some helpers, right?

2
00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:04.804
Because you don't actually need
to use any helpers here, right?

3
00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:09.625
If you wanna sit there and
write by hand, equals, equals, equals,

4
00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.467
open parentheses, have at it, right?

5
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:16.302
If you wanna write that Red Jax repeatedly
to see if it's a letter, right?

6
00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:18.582
Okay, that's fine.

7
00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:22.138
You do you, I'm not going to do that.

8
00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:26.472
I'm enjoying my youth and
I would like to maintain some of it.

9
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.216
So we'll figure out both the tokens,

10
00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:33.604
we need to identify white space,
so on and so forth, right?

11
00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:37.191
Once we have that in place,
what we'll do is effectively,

12
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.989
like I said before,
we'll have this cursor,

13
00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.761
we'll have an array of tokens,
let's just start moving through it, right?

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:49.906
Especially in the lexing and
parsing parts of the show,

15
00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:55.063
there will be a non-zero
amount of recursion, right?

16
00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:58.512
Which is always one of those
things where recursion,

17
00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:01.283
when it's working, this is clear as day.

18
00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:03.111
I understand how this code works,
it's great.

19
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.760
And when it doesn't work,

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.434
you feel like you don't actually know
how to use a computer anymore, right?

21
00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:11.296
So there is that, right?

22
00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:14.901
And what I wanted to kind of open up as
well especially in the room right now,

23
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.761
which is like, I would love
this to be like a conversation,

24
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.138
feel free to ask any questions or
anything you want to know more about or

25
00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:23.170
talk about, absolutely let's do that.

26
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.658
Cuz some of this stuff is a little
bit tricky to wrap your head around.

27
00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:28.290
Yeah.

28
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.789
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH] Just a quick one.

29
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.341
Inside this block where
you've got the while loop,

30
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.498
would you also be able to use a reduce for
this?

31
00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:37.927
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I mean,
you could use the reduce.

32
00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:40.204
The problem is that you kind of need to,

33
00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:43.590
you wanna be able to iterate
the cursor inside of the loop.

34
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.016
So you're gonna likely have
a loop inside of the loop.

35
00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:53.022
Right now when we do the actual parser,
definitely like this is a string,

36
00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:58.032
so my thought process on it like having
actually considered that question

37
00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:03.400
beforehand was, did I want to do a,
I didn't like an indeterminately large.

38
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.688
We're always gonna be working pretty
small chunks of code today, right?

39
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:10.247
But in determining the large file,
do I really want to go ahead and

40
00:02:10.247 --> 00:02:11.812
break it into a giant array?

41
00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.526
Right, strings reversal and

42
00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:16.892
string manipulation JavaScript
is really fast, right?

43
00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:20.880
When we get to the parcel part,
well then it is an array of tokens, and so

44
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.140
in that case I'll be popping them off
the front of the array in a lot of cases.

45
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.178
But not to spoil some of the surprises,
but since if we come across a string,

46
00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:35.215
we need to go to the end of that string
before we go and take another turn on this

47
00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:40.464
loop, we need to have control of where
that cursor is inside of a loop, right?

48
00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:44.540
Yeah, if you've made a giant or I could,
you do that as well, absolutely and

49
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.321
we will when we get to the part b,
syntactic parser.
