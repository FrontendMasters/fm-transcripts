>> Kadi Kraman: All right, that was introduction to React Native. I hope you enjoyed it, I hope you found it useful. The goal of this was to show you a bunch of kind of main components that you used to build things. So we've looked at views, text. We looked that scroll views FlatList, we looked at how to do styling, we looked at how to do conditioning, we looked at navigation.

[00:00:27]
So we have bottom tabs. We have modals, we have stack navigators, we looked at data persistence with AsyncStorage. We looked at layout animations like amazing full page animations with very little code. We looked at how to add joy to your app using haptics and push notifications, and some confetti.

[00:00:53]
So as mentioned earlier, we left the third screen intentionally blank. So hopefully, you have an idea of something I think some utility that you might want to build for your home or for your everyday use. And hopefully you have some ideas now and knowledge of how to do this in React Native, is this it, [LAUGH]?

[00:01:12]
Well, thank you, [LAUGH].
