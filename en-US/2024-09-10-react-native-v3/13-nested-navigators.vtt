00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.110
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And a final topic around
navigation is nesting navigation.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.320
So in native land, you can nest
navigators pretty much infinitely.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.672
So a stack within a tab, or a stack within
a stack, or a stack within a modal,

4
00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:19.170
or a stack within a stack, within a stack,
you can pretty much go infinitely.

5
00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:23.021
So to convert a screen into a stack,

6
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:28.805
the process differs whether the screen is
a named screen like your home screen or

7
00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.973
idea screen, or
whether it's an index screen.

8
00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:38.927
But regardless, we're going to
convert the file into a folder and

9
00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:42.979
then make it the index
screen of that folder.

10
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.963
So, we're gonna have

11
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:51.791
a stack in our counter tab.

12
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:56.589
So this will be a stack navigator
inside of a stack navigator,

13
00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.754
and we're going to add a screen for
the history here.

14
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:08.404
So to do this,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So

15
00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:11.134
this is the screen that we
want to convert into a stack.

16
00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:14.234
So in our after-actors,
create a new folder and call it counter.

17
00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:25.466
And move our counter file into
our folder and rename it index.

18
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.706
So notice that the screen path, the href,

19
00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:34.469
the url didn't change because it used
to be called counter and now the screen

20
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.801
is the index file of the counter folder so
it's still called counter.

21
00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:51.211
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, so now.

22
00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:59.131
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: We need to
add a layout file here.

23
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:03.210
So let's, in our counter folder,
let's do _layout.

24
00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.273
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
by default, let's do a stack.

25
00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:12.473
So export default layout.

26
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.279
Export default function layout.

27
00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:24.608
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And we'll return a stack,

28
00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:30.637
which is imported from Expo Router,

29
00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:36.665
and we'll have a, this is the name,

30
00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:41.916
and we're doing Stack.Screen

31
00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:47.764
[LAUGH] name="index", lovely.

32
00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:53.101
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So go to counter, okay,
so this is something that you will

33
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:58.788
often have when your nest navigators,
you end up with two navigation headers.

34
00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:03.937
And the way to deal with it is that
you hide the one that you don't need.

35
00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:09.347
So in our case, let's do an options,

36
00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:13.922
let's give it a title counter.

37
00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:21.108
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so now we have two
headers that are called counter, but

38
00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:22.773
which one do we hide?

39
00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:26.377
So in this case,
we actually want to hide the outer one,

40
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.063
so the one that we defined first.

41
00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:34.478
The reason being is that we're going to
have two screens in this inner stack and

42
00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:38.088
we want to show the header
of the inner stack screen,

43
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.321
so we want to hide the outer one.

44
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:46.527
So in our root layout
let's go to counter and

45
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:50.230
do headerShown: false.

46
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.663
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And now we have
our single header, all right, and

47
00:03:56.663 --> 00:04:00.662
the last thing we need is to
actually be able to navigate to it.

48
00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:05.121
So with the react navigation,
we can use header buttons,

49
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:09.867
which is quite a convenient way
to navigate between screens.

50
00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:13.669
So in our layout file,

51
00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.073
the counter layout file,

52
00:04:18.073 --> 00:04:22.887
let's do a header, right.

53
00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:27.942
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
this will be a function.

54
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.278
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's return some text.

55
00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.108
This is always a good thing to do.

56
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.591
See the things are rendering.

57
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.702
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: There you go.

58
00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:41.980
So this is where this icon or button or

59
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.812
whatever you want is
going to get rendered.

60
00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:47.132
So to the right of the header.

61
00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:52.132
So in this case, I think it will be
handy to use an icon button once more.

62
00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:55.182
So let's choose another one.

63
00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:00.978
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's do the history.

64
00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:08.494
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: What is
a good history icon?

65
00:05:08.494 --> 00:05:12.510
Can't remember which one I use now,
maybe this one.

66
00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:22.945
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Yeah, well, it doesn't
really matter which one you use, but

67
00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:24.064
I'm gonna use.

68
00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:30.174
I want to use the same that I did
in the example, so let me see.

69
00:05:30.174 --> 00:05:33.274
I'll use material icons, history.

70
00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:37.484
I'm just gonna copy it from here for
a bit of consistency.

71
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:44.864
All right, and then let's

72
00:05:44.864 --> 00:05:49.651
render this material icons,

73
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:54.071
and it's called history.

74
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:58.195
Size is do 32 and color,

75
00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:02.696
let's make it a gray color.

76
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.845
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely.

77
00:06:14.845 --> 00:06:19.050
And now we want to use a link.

78
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.510
So this is the link from Expo Router.

79
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.940
And let's do href, and
we want to link to, so what's the screen?

80
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.588
So we want to link to our history
screen that I'm not added yet.

81
00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.010
Let's add a history screen.

82
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.989
So, we need a new file call history.tsx.

83
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.663
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, and I'm gonna
copy the contents of the idea file because

84
00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:57.535
it's just gonna be a placeholder again.

85
00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:59.632
So call this a history.

86
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.365
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, okay.

87
00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:10.046
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Again, so
we wanna link to this screen.

88
00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:17.229
So the apple is in count, so
it will be /counter/history.

89
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.257
So here we'll do counter/history.

90
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:31.392
Okay, and now when I click it,

91
00:07:31.392 --> 00:07:34.247
we can navigate.

92
00:07:34.247 --> 00:07:39.432
But one thing that's a little bit
annoying here is like this button

93
00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:44.442
is actually quite small, so
you have to tap right on the button.

94
00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:49.431
And this is not great UX, you want to
kind of increase the touchable area so

95
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:54.743
butter fingered people like me who
are just approximately pressing the button

96
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:59.994
could also press it accurately, and
if we actually wrap this in a pressable.

97
00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.411
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Here you go.

98
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:10.071
We can use this thing called hitSlop,
so it's hitSlop.

99
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.841
And it basically defines an area around
the pressable area which also triggers

100
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:16.161
the press.

101
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.891
So let's do 20.

102
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.974
And this actually won't work
because if you parse in

103
00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:30.266
a component inside the Expo Router link,
you also need to mark it as child.

104
00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:33.171
There we go, so now this works.

105
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:41.253
And notice that I can actually press next
to the icon now, and it will still open.

106
00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:44.423
So instead of having
to press right on top.

107
00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.933
So this is a great UX thing.

108
00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:50.132
If you're ever using icon buttons
that don't have a defined border,

109
00:08:50.132 --> 00:08:52.132
this is a great thing to do for UX.
