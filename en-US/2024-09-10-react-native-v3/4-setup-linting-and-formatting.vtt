00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.197
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Next up,
let's set up Linting.

2
00:00:02.197 --> 00:00:03.599
Linting is really important.

3
00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:06.545
Setting this up is really quick,
I very much recommend you do it.

4
00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:12.466
As of SDK 51,
there is actually a Lint command built in.

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:17.330
So if you do npx expo Lint,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: It will

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.885
tell you that you don't
have any ESLint config.

7
00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:21.203
And would you like to configure one?

8
00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:27.296
So let's do yes, and it will install
ESLint, it will source some packages,

9
00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:31.061
and it will also create
an ESLint config for us.

10
00:00:31.061 --> 00:00:34.451
And the second thing we want
to do is install Prettier.

11
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.954
Again, this is just a very strong
preference of mine because to be a good

12
00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.216
developer, it's good to be lazy.

13
00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:44.194
And Prettier lets you focus on
the things that are important,

14
00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:47.286
which is writing code,
not the things that aren't important,

15
00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:51.081
which is figuring out where exactly to
put the brackets, so they look pretty.

16
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:55.511
So I have these instructions here to
install Prettier and the Prettier config.

17
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:57.969
So you have separate instructions for
yarn and

18
00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.000
other because you want to
install them as dependencies.

19
00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:10.482
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
then to integrate Prettier with ESLint,

20
00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:15.277
we need to update our
.eslintrc.js to also add it.

21
00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.501
So this basically,
extends the Prettier config.

22
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.716
It adds the Prettier plugin so

23
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:25.240
that we would have all the Prettier
errors as ESLint errors.

24
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.161
I actually see that I'll immediately
get some squigglish because by default

25
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.006
Prettier uses double quotes
instead of single quotes.

26
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.971
So you could create a .prettierrc.js to
change the preference to single quotes,

27
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.075
but I'm just gonna stick with the default.

28
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:42.101
And the great thing is that Prettier
errors are all too fixable.

29
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:47.222
So if you run your Lint command,
yarn Lint or npm run Lint, etc.

30
00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:52.692
With, -- fix,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: It

31
00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:54.773
actually auto-fixes all of these.

32
00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:59.080
And if you have an editor like VS Code and
you have your ESLint plugin,

33
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.315
it will also auto-fix as you save.

34
00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:06.501
All right, now it's time to actually write
some React Native code finally, right?
