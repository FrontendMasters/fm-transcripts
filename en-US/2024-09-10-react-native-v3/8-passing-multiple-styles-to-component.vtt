1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.090
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So the next step we're
going to add a mark ask completed UI.

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.980
So if we scroll down to see what
we're going to be building.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.514
So remember this is a shopping list.

4
00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:13.527
So we add things to our shopping list,
and then we can delete them.

5
00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:18.000
But then the other action we want
to do is mark them as complete.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.486
So we have picked up tea from the shop
Apps, but we don't want to delete t from

7
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:24.515
a shopping list because we
might want to re-add it later.

8
00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:29.829
So this UI is gonna be this gray out UI
and we're gonna have the text crossed

9
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.416
out and the delete button also, kind of
grayed out, but you can still use it.

10
00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:39.237
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So.

11
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:47.356
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's start by adding
some more colors to our theme file.

12
00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:49.863
So let's do a color gray.

13
00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:52.863
So this is actually the system gray.

14
00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:55.663
I haven't looked up the hex color for
that, but you can just do gray.

15
00:00:56.943 --> 00:01:02.201
And let's do a light gray as well,
so color light gray I find

16
00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:08.100
that this e color [LAUGH] is really
convenient to use as a light gray.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.193
I tend to use it a lot.

18
00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:18.504
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now in our shopping
list item, we can add another prop for

19
00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:23.364
whether or not,
this item is completed or not, so

20
00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:26.165
let's add an is completed.

21
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.221
And let's make this one optional, so

22
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:36.306
we'll default to false and
make it an optional Boolean,

23
00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:40.005
there we go and here we can import.

24
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.076
Or we can de-structure it from
our properties, all right?

25
00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:47.906
And then we basically want different
styles based on whether the item is

26
00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:49.200
completed or not.

27
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.198
So the handy thing about this
style prop is that you can pass

28
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:57.063
in an object, so a style object.

29
00:01:57.063 --> 00:02:03.464
But you can also pass in an array
of style objects so I can do this.

30
00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:11.705
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And the other handy thing
is that you can parse in undefined.

31
00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:15.193
So if you parse in undefined here,
it's totally fine,

32
00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:18.772
which means you can easily
add conditional styles here.

33
00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:29.180
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So let's add,
so we have an ItemContainer,

34
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.365
so let's do a CompletedContainer,

35
00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:39.730
and let's do in our ContainerStyle.

36
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.656
We'll do if this isCompleted is true,
so if isCompleted,

37
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:50.997
then we will also add
styles.CompletedContainer.

38
00:02:50.997 --> 00:02:53.291
I think I misspelled container here.

39
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.903
It needs an a, container.

40
00:02:58.894 --> 00:03:01.188
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Otherwise,
let's just do an undefined.

41
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.977
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
in the completed container,

42
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.430
let's give it a background color and
use our LightGrey.

43
00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.938
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And a border bottom color.

44
00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:27.115
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Order bottom color.

45
00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:30.230
And let's, so it's Solu Saru, and

46
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.793
let's make it,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's

47
00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:37.642
make it a light gray as well.

48
00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:38.760
And actually,

49
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.609
I've spotted that I forgot to actually
use my cerulean color from my theme file.

50
00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:46.863
So let's do that.

51
00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.718
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, and
none of our UI is updated, why?

52
00:03:53.718 --> 00:03:54.845
Because we actually,

53
00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:58.789
none of our existing components
are using this isCompleted prop.

54
00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.223
So let's mark a couple of these completed.

55
00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:07.370
So with the reaction native, so
you could pass in the prop like this.

56
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:13.413
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So true, but for Booleans
in particular, coz it's a very common

57
00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:17.561
thing for Booleans if something is true,
you can also do this.

58
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.748
So you just pass in, it's completed.

59
00:04:19.748 --> 00:04:22.305
And you can emit the equals true.

60
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:26.573
So you can only do this with Boolean
properties if the Boolean is true.

61
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:36.101
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And I think we also wanted
to add some custom styles for the button.

62
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.665
So we have our button here.

63
00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:39.987
So let's do the same thing.

64
00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:45.036
So, let's convert this into array and

65
00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:49.020
let's do a completed button.

66
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:05.310
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And do isCompleted
use the styles/.completedButton,

67
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.017
otherwise undefined.

68
00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:16.314
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And in the styles,
let's give it a grey background.

69
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.856
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And finally, for
our text, we again do the same thing.

70
00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:27.340
So old handed this now.

71
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.011
So let's convert this into array.

72
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:34.964
And let's say if isCompleted,

73
00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:40.834
it will be theme dot, sorry no theme,

74
00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:48.730
styles.completedText, otherwise undefined.

75
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.594
And then for the completedText,
let's add a text decoration.

76
00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:59.855
So we can do a textDecoration line,
line-through.

77
00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:07.788
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
we also need to give it a color so

78
00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:11.115
textDecorationColor.

79
00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:16.129
Let's do theme and color gray.

80
00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:21.713
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I've made a mistake here
and I've put this on a delete button.

81
00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:28.081
[LAUGH] and we delete that.

82
00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:31.873
So I wanted this to be on the item
text button, there we go.

83
00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:34.865
So this needs to be an array and

84
00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:40.026
I've got a little if statement here,
there we go.

85
00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:42.691
So these get crossed out.

86
00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:45.108
I think I use a different color for
this as well.

87
00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:50.687
So let's do a color theme, colorGray.

88
00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:52.601
There you go.

89
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.151
So now we have two different UI types.

90
00:06:55.151 --> 00:07:02.431
So we have a completed UI for
our shopping list item and a to do UI.
