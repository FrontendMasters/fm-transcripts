1
00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:06.490
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's start
by rendering this text.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.454
So we want thing doing or
thing overdue by.

3
00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:16.830
So let's go, we want above our button.

4
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.275
So let's say, if status is overdue,

5
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:30.909
then we'll render a text saying,

6
00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.736
thing overdue by, and otherwise,

7
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:43.744
we'll render some text, same thing to n.

8
00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.620
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay,
you can see that every time we reload,

9
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.791
because we're not storing the data in
any storage yet, every time I reload,

10
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.163
it will get reset, but this is fine.

11
00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.441
It's actually good for testing.

12
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.707
All right, and let's do our timer
segments as well before we add style.

13
00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:14.507
So we'll do a view, and we'll use this
timer segment file that we created.

14
00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.188
So, timer segment.

15
00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:24.231
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
we'll have, unit is days,

16
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:30.011
the number will be status, distance,

17
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:34.740
days, and this might be empty,

18
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.605
this might be undefined.

19
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:42.716
So let's also default it to 0.

20
00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:49.563
And, yeah, last thing we need is some
text there, but we'll do that later.

21
00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:53.893
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
let's do three more of these.

22
00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:57.287
So we need hours, there'll be distance in

23
00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:01.932
hours,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Minutes, and

24
00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:08.242
we show the distance minutes,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And seconds.

25
00:02:17.118 --> 00:02:19.990
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so again,
by default, I'm rendering underneath each

26
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.981
other, but we would probably want them
to render next to each other in a row.

27
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:27.556
So we will do a styles row and

28
00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:31.761
give it a flex-direction row.

29
00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:38.754
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely.

30
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:47.003
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So
let's see what is different here.

31
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:53.149
Again, gonna give this text some styles,
so we need a heading style.

32
00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.275
So style=styles.heading.

33
00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:11.326
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And the heading,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So,

34
00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:18.160
fontsize 24, fontweight, bold.

35
00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.152
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: MarginBottom, 24.

36
00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:33.975
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Well,
I guess we don't need the color,

37
00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:36.807
I don't know why I did a color hit,
but there we go.

38
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.390
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so
now we want to change the container so

39
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.633
that if you are late, it will be very red.

40
00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:52.070
So we can use our, as you can recall,

41
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.320
you can pass in an array of styles
here instead of just an object.

42
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.960
So let's make this into an array.

43
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.466
And we can say, if it is overdue,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Then

44
00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:15.073
do styles.containerLate,
otherwise undefined.

45
00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:21.196
And we'll create this containerLate style,

46
00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:26.848
which will give a background color of red.

47
00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:31.182
To make it very annoying so you want to do
the thing to not have this red background.

48
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:39.336
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, so
now the problem is that I think we'd

49
00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:45.065
like the text to be white
here if the thing is overdue.

50
00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:50.108
So, if you recall, in the time of segment,
we have an optional prop for

51
00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:54.079
the text style that gets passed
to both of these styles.

52
00:04:54.079 --> 00:05:02.206
So we can add another style
to just say white text.

53
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.080
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Which is here.

54
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.662
Style, text style, there we go,

55
00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:19.509
text style, which is styles.whiteText.

56
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:28.486
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: We text,
and this will be white.

57
00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:33.243
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Theme, colorWhite.

58
00:05:36.827 --> 00:05:41.351
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, we want this to,
well, now if this appears in our white

59
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:47.093
background because we want this to only
be color white if the thing is overdue.

60
00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:50.591
So let's do if status is overdue,

61
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:56.271
then we'll use the whiteText,
otherwise undefined.

62
00:05:58.918 --> 00:05:59.897
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, and

63
00:05:59.897 --> 00:06:05.069
we can copy this style to the other
timer segment components as well.

64
00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:16.618
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And actually,
we can use this for our heading as well.

65
00:06:16.618 --> 00:06:22.188
So if it is overdue,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: We

66
00:06:22.188 --> 00:06:25.214
can do your styles, whiteText.

67
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.511
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Make sure it works.

68
00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:42.349
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, so
this now, it looks like the UI.

69
00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.496
And let's update this button as well,
to say, I've done the thing.

70
00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:57.794
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I think we need a little
bit of padding between these two.

71
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.231
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: I'm just
gonna add it to the row.

72
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:09.387
So, let's do a marginBottom of 24, so just
to add some space between these two, okay?

73
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.445
I think that looks all right.
