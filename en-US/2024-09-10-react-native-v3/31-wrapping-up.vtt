00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.670
All right,
that was introduction to React Native.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.020
I hope you enjoyed it,
I hope you found it useful.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.425
The goal of this was to show
you a bunch of kind of main

4
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:15.510
components that you used to build things.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.545
So we've looked at views, text.

6
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:23.854
We looked that scroll views FlatList,
we looked at how to do styling,

7
00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:27.739
we looked at how to do conditioning,
we looked at navigation.

8
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.741
So we have bottom tabs.

9
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:33.608
We have modals, we have stack navigators,

10
00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:37.271
we looked at data persistence
with AsyncStorage.

11
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:41.856
We looked at layout animations like
amazing full page animations with very

12
00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:43.167
little code.

13
00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:47.564
We looked at how to add joy
to your app using haptics and

14
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:51.097
push notifications, and some confetti.

15
00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:58.367
So as mentioned earlier, we left
the third screen intentionally blank.

16
00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:03.045
So hopefully, you have an idea of
something I think some utility that you

17
00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:06.813
might want to build for
your home or for your everyday use.

18
00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:09.193
And hopefully you have some ideas now and

19
00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:12.998
knowledge of how to do this in
React Native, is this it, [LAUGH]?

20
00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:16.806
Well, thank you, [LAUGH].

21
00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:19.536
&gt;&gt; Students.: [APPLAUSE]
