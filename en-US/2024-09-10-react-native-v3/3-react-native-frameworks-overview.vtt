00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.512
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Hi,
before we get into coding,

2
00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:04.204
I wanted to quickly talk about
React Native Frameworks.

3
00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.949
So you might be wondering why in this
introduction to React Native course,

4
00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.279
we just created an Expo app and
we installed Expo Go.

5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.219
So in short,
Expo is a React Native framework.

6
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.210
So this is the same as how Nextjs or
Remix or

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.825
Redwoodjs are reacting Frameworks
as of React Con in 2024,

8
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:28.013
Meta actually recommends
using React Native framework,

9
00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:32.211
so specifically expo for
creating new react native apps.

10
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.084
So you are wondering why
is Vanilla React native?

11
00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:39.706
So React native without a framework,
not enough, and basically what

12
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.187
React native gives us out of the box
is the ability to run react code.

13
00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:48.798
So some java script code with react on
native iOS and android platforms so

14
00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.527
using the underlying native components.

15
00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:56.217
So a huge amount of work goes into
making this happen, we have metro for

16
00:00:56.217 --> 00:01:01.001
bundling and Hermes java script runtime
and jsi and all kinds of stuff.

17
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.000
So this is not an easy feat.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.047
And on top of this, we also get some
core building blocks, like your text and

19
00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:08.640
view and scroll up the lists.

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.646
But a huge amount of things that almost
every mobile app needs aren't built

21
00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:18.666
into react native so for example,
we don't get navigation out of the box.

22
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:23.006
We can't send push notifications,
we can't store data across app launches,

23
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.090
we can't use the phone camera, etc.

24
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.943
And there's plenty of things that is
possible to do, it's just really hard.

25
00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:35.597
So for example, changing the app icon or
adding custom native code or just building

26
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:40.946
the app bundles for store release,
they're possible but they're tedious.

27
00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:45.162
And this isn't a failing by meta.

28
00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:50.080
This is by design because adding all of
these functionality out of the box would

29
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.386
make reactivity completely unmaintainable
for the really small reacting matter.

30
00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:58.778
So, we need to add these ourselves.

31
00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:00.739
And from the very beginning, and

32
00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.813
React Native is literally almost
10 years old now, which is wild.

33
00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:09.195
And from the very beginning, React Native
developers have had to rely on community

34
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.206
libraries for these functionality.

35
00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:15.145
And there is also this page here,
React Native Directory, which is a great

36
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:18.847
resource for finding various
community libraries for React Native.

37
00:02:21.117 --> 00:02:24.105
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: The problem is if you're
only just getting started, it's very

38
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:27.992
difficult to know which libraries are fit
for purpose, which work well together.

39
00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:32.351
What's even possible, especially if
it's at the start of your project.

40
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.614
So this is where the React Native
framework comes in.

41
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:38.190
So the role of a React
framework is defined in...

42
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.100
In the RFC,
which you can also look up here.

43
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.739
And it's a cohesive framework that's
built on top of React Native.

44
00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.374
And it consists of tools and

45
00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:54.011
libraries that are not provided
by default in React Native.

46
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:58.166
There's also a bunch of requirements for
something to become a framework.

47
00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:03.107
But the main thing that's important
here is that a framework needs to

48
00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:05.675
be open source, popular and free.

49
00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:10.639
So companies may provide
additional pay features on top of

50
00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.005
the framework, but
the core of it needs to be free.

51
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:19.163
The pay parts should not be
requirements to use the framework and

52
00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:21.553
there should be no vendor lock-in.

53
00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:24.043
So there's three restrictions for

54
00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:27.363
something to become
a React Native framework.

55
00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:31.163
So Expo is the open source React Native
framework that we're going to be using

56
00:03:31.163 --> 00:03:32.456
throughout this course.

57
00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:36.306
In particular, we're using Expo Go.

58
00:03:36.306 --> 00:03:40.394
Now this is really important,
Expo Go is not Expo.

59
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.075
Expo Go is one small part
of the Expo framework.

60
00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:48.193
It's a sandbox environment that's
meant for learning, prototyping, and

61
00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.657
getting started quickly.

62
00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:54.264
It is not recommended to build
your production apps with Expo Go.

63
00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:58.838
We're using Expo Go today because
we're learning about React Native, and

64
00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.135
this is literally the use case for it.

65
00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:04.792
In the intermediate course, we're going
to move on to development builds,

66
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:07.449
which is what you graduate to
after you outgrow Expo Go.
