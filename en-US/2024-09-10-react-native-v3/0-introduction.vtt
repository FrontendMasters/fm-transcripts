00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.123
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Hello and welcome to this
introductory course to React Native.

2
00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:09.096
If you're new to React Native or
you've just tried a little bit or

3
00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:13.587
you're just getting started,
I'm honestly, I'm so excited for you.

4
00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.545
I love building mobile apps and

5
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:20.668
the first time you actually see something
that you built in JavaScript in React or

6
00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:24.657
in your own phone and
actually interact with the components.

7
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:31.277
It's incredibly satisfying and rewarding,
and yeah, let's get started doing that.

8
00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:35.747
So this course is going to be
an introduction to React Native.

9
00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:39.887
So you don't need to know anything
about React Native already.

10
00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:47.702
If you're familiar with JavaScript and
TypeScript, that is very much preferred.

11
00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:51.672
And knowledge of React is desirable but
is not essential.

12
00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:56.359
So in this course,
we're very much going to learn by doing.

13
00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.704
We're going to start
completely from scratch and

14
00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:05.288
we're going to cover the fundamentals of
building mobile apps with React Native.

15
00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:10.195
So the primary components are use interact
with, and we'll highlight the subtle and

16
00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:10.808
then not so

17
00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:15.053
subtle ways that mobile development
is different from web development.

18
00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:20.940
So hi, my name is Kadi,
I'm your instructor.

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.776
I've actually been fortunate enough
to stumble onto React Native

20
00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:28.378
really early on, and I was hooked.

21
00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:31.227
And I've been building
React Native develops ever since.

22
00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.516
I've worked on loads
of interesting things,

23
00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:37.107
I guess one of the notable things was
that I was the tech lead on the PU map.

24
00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.612
Aside from consultancy work,
I've also been active in direct community.

25
00:01:41.612 --> 00:01:43.482
I've done several conference talks.

26
00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.664
I've linked to a couple
of the more recent and

27
00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:49.776
more interesting ones in this course page.

28
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:54.284
I've also spearheaded building
the React Conf app for React Conf in 2024,

29
00:01:54.284 --> 00:01:56.986
which you can find in Google Play and
App Store.

30
00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:01.879
And this was actually an example
app that was built specifically

31
00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.771
to have an end-to-end,
in-production example of what it's

32
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:11.585
like to build React Native apps
with Expo and go to production.

33
00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.751
So you can actually see
it on the app stores and

34
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.355
the code is available on GitHub.

35
00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:19.021
I'm currently working at Expo and
hoping to bring more people

36
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:23.018
into the amazing world of building
mobile apps in React Native.

37
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:27.208
So for this workshop, what you'll
need to follow along is a computer.

38
00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.818
So a Mac, Windows, or Linux, all are fine.

39
00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:32.518
And you'll need to have Node.js
ideally installed already.

40
00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.498
And the second thing you need is a phone.

41
00:02:35.498 --> 00:02:41.164
So an iPhone or
an Android phone,and internet connection.

42
00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:46.676
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: In this course,
we're going to be learning by doing.

43
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:49.665
So all we're going to do is we're going
to build a little utility app completely

44
00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:50.252
from scratch.

45
00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:52.594
So we're gonna start
from the blank template.

46
00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:55.300
And I'm going to introduce
various concepts and

47
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.382
point out common patterns in
React Native development as we go on.

48
00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:01.540
This app is gonna have two main features.

49
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.140
We're gonna have a shopping list.

50
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.780
It's gonna be a fancy shopping list,
and a reminder.

51
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.610
I'm also gonna add a third screen, and
this is gonna be intentionally left blank.

52
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.788
So it's gonna be for

53
00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:17.690
you to fill out with something that you
would like as a utility app for yourself.

54
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.307
So have a think of what
you'd like to build and

55
00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:21.658
hopefully the skills in this
workshop are going to get you there.

56
00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:27.353
And just as a bit of housekeeping,
I've had this course website and

57
00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:31.588
all the material that I'm going to
cover is available on this course.

58
00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:35.100
I'm probably gonna say more things
live than I've written down, but

59
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.718
all the code is going to be here.

60
00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:41.400
In general, all the commands
that you need to execute In your

61
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.980
terminal are going to be
displayed in these code blocks.

62
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.290
And any code that we're going to write is
going to be in these collapsible elements.

63
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.265
So these will be either for
new files or write the whole file, or

64
00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:56.600
it will be a diff of what's changed.

65
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.454
And at the end of each section
If we've added any code,

66
00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:03.627
I'm also going to have a checkpoint.

67
00:04:03.627 --> 00:04:11.187
So it's gonna be this blue checkpoint with
a link to the course solutions repository.

68
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.067
And this will link to the commit.

69
00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.129
So if you go to the git commit history,
this will have a commit for

70
00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.847
every step that we're going
to do in the workshop.

71
00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:22.837
So you can refer back to
this to check your work.

72
00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:31.737
I might also add a couple of these
annotations for tips or warnings.

73
00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:36.667
So a tip is just something useful related
to the topic that we're discussing.

74
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:41.680
And then this warning is
usually either a warning

75
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.182
against a common anti-pattern or
a common mistake,

76
00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:50.993
or just a tip offering debug advice.

77
00:04:50.993 --> 00:04:53.173
I think that's it for the intro.

78
00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:54.933
And I hope you'll enjoy the course.
