00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.830
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now let's talk
about haptics and haptic feedback.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.610
Haptic feedback is something that
you don't have on the web, and

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.590
it is the little vibration that your phone
makes in response to certain touches.

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.270
So it can be in front of pressing a button
or just typing on your keyboard, etc.

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.898
And It's really handy to use haptics
occasionally, but sparingly,

6
00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:28.852
to kind of enhance your app and make it
a little bit more interesting to use.

7
00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.704
Let's install the library for haptics, so

8
00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.502
we'll install
mbx-expo-install-expo-haptics.

9
00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:40.676
And if we look at the documentation for
this library.

10
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:46.154
It's a pretty small library and it
basically has functions for impact async,

11
00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:51.383
notification async and selection async,
which are basically presets for

12
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.786
the different kind of vibration
patterns you might want to do.

13
00:00:55.786 --> 00:01:01.323
So I'm gonna open this on my phone
to make sure that it's working.

14
00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:04.213
Can't feel vibrations on a simulator.

15
00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:08.681
Lovely, so I'll do some milk,

16
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.994
some coffee, and tea.

17
00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:21.091
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, it's so satisfying
to see these animations on a real phone.

18
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.871
All right, so let's add some haptic
feedback in response to taps.

19
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:29.431
So we want to do a medium impact
when the user deletes an item.

20
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.183
Success notification so like the strongest
animation as the strongest haptic

21
00:01:34.183 --> 00:01:36.991
feedback when the user completes an item,
and

22
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:41.395
then the medium impact if they mark
a previously completed item as to do.

23
00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:53.396
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So in our code,
let's go to the index file and

24
00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:58.380
let's look at when we're
deleting the item.

25
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.676
So let's do just after
the set shopping list,

26
00:02:02.676 --> 00:02:06.321
I think we'll need to import haptics.

27
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:13.696
So the import for this is import star as

28
00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:19.238
haptics from expo haptics.

29
00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:28.134
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Right and then in
handleDelete, just before setShoppingList,

30
00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:31.807
we'll do Haptics.ImpactAsync, and

31
00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:36.961
we'll do
Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium.

32
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.841
So this will be a medium impact.

33
00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.166
Make sure that this works.

34
00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:51.244
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So
if I delete this, I'm getting

35
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:56.509
a little haptic feedback, love it.

36
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.012
And now we want to do
a success notification, so

37
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.080
the strongest feedback when
the user completes an item and

38
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.320
then a medium impact when they mark
a previously completed item undone.

39
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.960
So this will be in our toggle function.

40
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.170
So handleToggleComplete.

41
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.180
So it will be in here, in our,

42
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.989
if the item is the item that
we are currently toggling.

43
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.979
Let's add another if statement here.

44
00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:29.858
So if item complete as time stuff,
so if it was previously

45
00:03:29.858 --> 00:03:35.004
completed, let's do
Haptics.ImpactAsync and

46
00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:39.549
Haptic.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium.

47
00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:48.963
And else,
let's use a success notification.

48
00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:53.130
So Haptics.NotificationAsync,

49
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.665
Haptics.NotificationFeedback type,
and success.

50
00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:08.575
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Lovely, so,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now when

51
00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:15.988
we go back,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: If

52
00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:20.005
we mark this as complete, yeah, it's a.

53
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:25.053
So you should, when you now toggle
these between completed and not,

54
00:04:25.053 --> 00:04:30.276
you will notice that the success
notification is quite a bit stronger,

55
00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:33.757
so on the iPhone it's
like a double vibration,

56
00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:37.437
whereas the medium impact
is quite a bit lighter.

57
00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.822
So let me just try this
on Android as well.

58
00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:46.452
So this is actually one of those things
that it is much more fun if you're

59
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:50.928
developing on a real device unlike
on a simulator like I am because you

60
00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:52.412
can actually feel it.

61
00:04:53.512 --> 00:05:00.018
So let me plug in my
Android phone,okay and

62
00:05:00.018 --> 00:05:04.546
expert go, scan the QR code.

63
00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.135
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Okay, so again, new phone,
so I don't have anything set up yet.

64
00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:16.375
So let's do coffee.

65
00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:23.605
Let's do some milk, tea, sugar.

66
00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:28.495
All right, so now,
yeah,interestingly Android haptic

67
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:33.729
feedback by default it feels
much more stronger than iOS.

68
00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.719
I don't know if this just this phone but
it's quite interesting.

69
00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.299
But yeah so same for Android.

70
00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:45.776
So the success notification is quite
a bit stronger than the medium impact.
