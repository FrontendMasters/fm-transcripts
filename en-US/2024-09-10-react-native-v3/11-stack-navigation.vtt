00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now, let's look at the
different types of navigation you can do.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.621
The basic type of navigation
is a stack navigate.

3
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:16.532
By default,
everything's rendered in a stack.

4
00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:21.462
And it means that when you navigate onto
a new screen, It renders on top of the old

5
00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:26.700
screen, and then the new screen renders on
top of the old screen, so we have a stack.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.307
So when you go back,
it will go back to the previous screen.

7
00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:34.525
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Let's
add a couple new files.

8
00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.267
So let's add a counter.

9
00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:41.417
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So
I'm gonna copy this file,

10
00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:45.659
because it's just gonna be a default
layout where we have a view and

11
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.464
a text just as a placeholder,
so I'm not gonna type it out.

12
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:53.978
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: There we go, and

13
00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:59.307
let's also add this placeholder screen,
so idea.tsx.

14
00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.304
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So let's do IdeaScreen.

15
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.655
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So this will be the screen
for whatever you would like to build.

16
00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:17.205
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Now,
there's three main ways to

17
00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:21.232
navigate between screens with explorator.

18
00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:26.676
The default one is using
this link component.

19
00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:27.598
Just make sure we run.

20
00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:34.117
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Yeah,
default one is using this link component.

21
00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:38.251
So we can import link from experimenter,
and inside here,

22
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.991
you can just write some text actually.

23
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.402
So you can say, Go to counter.

24
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:53.501
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And this, you need to give
it an href of where you want to link to.

25
00:01:53.501 --> 00:02:00.675
So let's say we want to link to counter,
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: There you go.

26
00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:04.133
Let me just give it some style.

27
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:10.278
So textAlign center,

28
00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:18.301
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And marginBottom: 18 and

29
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:21.147
fontSize 24.

30
00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:24.439
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: This style
isn't that important,

31
00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.824
I'm just doing it so it will be
a bit easier to see on the screen.

32
00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:31.707
All right, so now, when I click on this,
you can see that it

33
00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:36.703
navigates another screen on top
of my shopping list screen.

34
00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:40.418
And you can use gestures,
actually, to go back.

35
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:43.845
So, specially when you're
doing this on your phone,

36
00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.310
you can see you can swipe from the side.

37
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.508
Actually, the fun thing about this
is if you're on an Android phone,

38
00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:53.986
it looks a little bit different.

39
00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:59.039
Yeah, so on Android, that's another
thing that I didn't mention.

40
00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.747
So the header actually looks slightly
different on Android as well as on iOS as

41
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:06.352
well, and that's because by default
you get platform specific styling.

42
00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.541
So we have a slightly different shadow
here, so it's using an elevation and

43
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.183
the heading is aligned left.

44
00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:13.723
And this is not a mistake or a bug or

45
00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:17.420
anything, this is intentional because
it looks more natural to the platform.

46
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.456
But you can customize it and you can
make both of your apps look the same.

47
00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:23.461
Anyway, so if you go on Android,

48
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:26.623
I can't actually see it
that much on this emulator.

49
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:27.965
But on a physical device,

50
00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.773
you get a different animation
when you navigate back.

51
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:41.464
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: All right, so the other
way to navigate is programmatically.

52
00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:47.641
So let me add a text here and
say, Go to idea, and

53
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:53.671
then let's wrap this
in a TouchableOpacity.

54
00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.628
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: And
I'm just gonna copy these same styles.

55
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.895
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: Text, there you go.

56
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:26.583
All right, so now we have Go to counter,
and then we have Go to idea, lovely.

57
00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.899
So here, you can use an onPress.

58
00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:33.117
So router has a use router hook, so

59
00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:37.927
you can do a const router = useRouter.

60
00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:41.945
So this will be an export from explorator.

61
00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:47.008
And you can do onPress,
you can do router.,

62
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:52.751
and you can see all
the different things you can do.

63
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:58.614
So mostly, you would do router navigate,
push or replace.

64
00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:03.522
So the difference between
them is that push will

65
00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:07.700
always push a screen on top of the stack.

66
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.327
So replace will obviously replace the
screen, that's a little bit more obvious.

67
00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:17.123
But then navigate will navigate to
the screen, but it might navigate back.

68
00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:23.342
So for example, if I had my index screen,
my idea screen, and my counter screen,

69
00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:29.112
and then I did router navigate idea,
it would actually go back in the stack,

70
00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:33.106
because an idea screen
already exists in the stack.

71
00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:36.763
But if you want to guarantee that
you're always going forward,

72
00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:40.500
so adding another screen on top
of the stack, you would use push.

73
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.910
So in this case let's use navigate and
we want to go to our ideas screen.

74
00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:53.466
&gt;&gt; Kadi Kraman: So open that and
then we will navigate to idea.

75
00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:57.932
And then the third way to navigate is
using these navigation buttons that get

76
00:05:57.932 --> 00:05:59.760
added with React navigation.

77
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.175
So you can see, by default,
we actually get these header buttons,

78
00:06:05.175 --> 00:06:08.986
so I can go back all the way up and
down the stack.

79
00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:11.354
That rhymed unintentionally.
