00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.335
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So essentially I just
jumped into button styles to look at and

2
00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.133
say well, really there's nothing like,
this is just kind of a utility for

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.900
being able to generate something we
can pass to a style property, right?

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.801
Now this may be something you do in CSS,
or maybe you like CSS in JS, and so

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.337
that's kind of familiar.

6
00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.214
But the point here is that this
function just returns a string that we

7
00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:24.600
could use and set.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.326
So we could take and say button.style,

9
00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.150
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: = makeColorStyle, and

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.006
let's say, I don't know, I'll say cyan,

11
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:46.199
I like cyan.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Hi, how about it?

12
00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.853
[LAUGH]

13
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So that's really neat,

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.200
we're instantly able to take this
functionality and compose it.

15
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.430
And reuse it in many different ways,
so this is really neat.

16
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.911
Let's do some other relevant things, so

17
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:18.168
let's jump into footer.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So

18
00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:23.780
we wanna make a footer element, and
it's gonna have a top and a bottom.

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.421
So instead of this, why don't we

20
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:32.665
instead,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Say

21
00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:38.228
document.createElement, and

22
00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:44.006
we'll call it,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: [SOUND]

23
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.306
We could just say like div,

24
00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:51.734
cuz it'll be composed of two pieces.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And

25
00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.917
in the same way we could do the same for

26
00:01:54.917 --> 00:02:02.281
bottom.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And

27
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:06.252
lets see, we would wanna say,
not bottom, but div also.

28
00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:10.137
So we're creating two divs, and

29
00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:15.980
then const footer =
document.createElement.

30
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.250
I'm pretty sure footer is a valid one,
it is, footer.

31
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.353
And I think you can say,
footer.appendChild(top),

32
00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:29.107
I don't think it takes, yeah.

33
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.737
And then we'd wanna append the.

34
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.615
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Cool, and

35
00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:41.350
we could apply other attributes.

36
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.050
Technically, what I think is really cool
is that we could pull in these pieces.

37
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.229
So I'm just gonna say top.innerHTML,
or no, I'm sorry, innerText.

38
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.504
And I'll set it to Top of Footer,

39
00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.864
and bottom.innerHtml.

40
00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:14.755
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And then what's
great is hey, we have this function,

41
00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:18.520
I wish I could color the bottom and
the top differently, right?

42
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.940
But we now have a module that
we can reuse to do this.

43
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.055
So we could say import, let's see from,

44
00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:32.618
I think it's button-style.

45
00:03:32.618 --> 00:03:38.381
So we could even just say red and blue,
cuz those are still available exports.

46
00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:47.216
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And say top.style=red.

47
00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.820
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: bottom.style = blue.

48
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.320
So of course, now maybe we don't even,
we could export all three of these, right?

49
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.037
Maybe we don't need the top and
the bottom,

50
00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:02.197
let's say you wanted
an element that does this, or

51
00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:07.253
we could just export the footer to you.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Let's

52
00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:12.002
jump back to index, and instead of,

53
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:17.663
we could just pull footer in.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And

54
00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:23.393
just say,
document.body,appendChild(footer).

55
00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:30.860
And be pretty basic in terms of the, let's
see my color style, where's my blue half?

56
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.514
I feel like I could append to.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: innerHtml

57
00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:38.713
instead of innerText?
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Yeah,

58
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:43.370
that would probably be better,
but I'd need a toString.

59
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.940
What's the, you're right,
absolutely, thank you.

60
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.172
Yeah, at any time, if you see me
doing something wrong on accident,

61
00:04:51.172 --> 00:04:52.231
just call me out on it.

62
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:56.100
Cuz I'm just usually not thinking
about it while I'm talking.

63
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.000
So yeah, like hey,
we now have two components.

64
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.460
Now of course, you don't want
your web apps to look like this.

65
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.200
But it's just trying to show you,
you're instantly able to validate, or

66
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.080
I was able to be like wait,
why is this not working right away?

67
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.940
This I expect is like a standard for
my development environment.

68
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.520
And so we haven't really done
much with webpack here though.

69
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.583
If we just look at the config,
like we've added a couple plugins and

70
00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:24.674
using webpack dev server.
