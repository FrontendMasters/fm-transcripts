00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.731
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So why don't we, for a
moment just jump into, actually adding or

2
00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:08.930
start building into our
configuration a little bit more.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.204
And so like this is kind of where I have,
I call it starting out right but

4
00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:15.739
we're gonna go through and just cover and

5
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.300
add a bunch of different
features that I believe are like.

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.862
These are things that you're gonna come

7
00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:28.840
across that exist in any webpack.config.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.060
And so we could probably
get rid of the mode none.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.124
But we wanna have a nice way to be able to
compose, and organize and use our project.

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.700
And so
I wanna talk about a couple of things.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.460
So we wanna eventually start writing
some code that's gonna work in

12
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.230
the browser, right?

13
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.150
And probably the first
thing that we wanna do is

14
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.700
we're gonna apply certain features or
capabilities dependent on if it's

15
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.550
a production or
development environment, right?

16
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.757
And so like webpack,

17
00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:09.993
we tried to solve this out of the box as
much as possible using the mode flag.

18
00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:13.540
But we can also pass in
environment variables, and

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.470
environment flags from the CLI into the
configuration, and that's super valuable.

20
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.603
So webpack can take an object,
as the default export for the module for

21
00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:30.664
your config, but it can also take
a function that returns an object.

22
00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:35.969
And so,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Let's see,

23
00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.386
this is the nice shorthand syntax
if you don't have any logic and

24
00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:41.040
it's like an instant return.

25
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.934
So if we wanted to add
additional behavior or what not,

26
00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:49.252
why don't we just start out
by adding a single property.

27
00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:52.898
Let's just say,
I don't like main.js personally,

28
00:01:52.898 --> 00:01:55.520
I like calling them chunks or bundles.

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.522
So let's go ahead and
go to the output property,

30
00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:03.697
and this is, it's an object.

31
00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:07.217
And so there's a bunch of different
properties underneath, but

32
00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:10.320
the one we're concerned about is filename.

33
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.254
And we can just call it bundle.js.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So

34
00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:19.175
it should,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: if

35
00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:24.100
I'm correct.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: There we go,

36
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.950
that's what I was expecting.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So

37
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.423
you should now see the name of
your bundle changed to bundle.js.
