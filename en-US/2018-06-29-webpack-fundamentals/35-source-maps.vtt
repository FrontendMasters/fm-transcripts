1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So the last piece that
I think is valuable to talk about is

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.470
really gonna be about source maps.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.250
It comes up a lot in question.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.750
There are a variety of different ways
that you can generate source maps, or

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.790
I guess I should say a variety
of different formats.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.640
And they all have trade-offs,
like everything in programming.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.480
And so really I just wanna go to our docs.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.250
So for any config property,

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.380
you can actually go to
webpack.js.org/configuration.

10
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.330
And you can even go to
the base property name.

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.600
So in this case like devtool,
which is the property we'll be going to.

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
There's even an interactive explorer
to see, what are all the different

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.160
possibilities that you can add, and
what do they do, for the most part.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.140
And you can always contribute
by going to Edit Document.

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.820
Anyways, so we're gonna go to devtool.

16
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.164
So devtool is the property responsible for
creating source maps.

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.986
Now you'll notice here that we
have this little table that

18
00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:10.442
talks about all the different qualities
of what the source maps produce.

19
00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:13.340
So and there's a small key here.

20
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.130
The plus symbols mean better or

21
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.430
faster, and then the minuses mean slower,
I guess you can say.

22
00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:26.760
So, or kind of a mediumish,

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.750
at least that's what it says here,
medium, pretty slow, and slow.

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.670
So the point being is that you can make
trade-offs on how long your builds take,

25
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.410
depending on the quality of your
source maps, and vice versa.

26
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.220
So if you wanted the most beautiful
looking original breakpoints and

27
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.420
everything works in whatever
browser you're working in,

28
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.240
source map is the property [COUGH].

29
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.768
And so if you wanted to jump into your
config and we wanna create an add

30
00:01:57.768 --> 00:02:02.760
source-map support, you can go into

31
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.380
your production configuration, and
just add the devtool property and

32
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.900
supply that string, source-map.

33
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.430
Oops, I forgot the env flag,
env.presets compress.

34
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.030
There we go.

35
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.870
So we shall build.

36
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.570
And now when we look,
we're actually gonna see

37
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.419
we've had source maps generated not only
for our CSS, but also for our JavaScript.

38
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.920
And now, if we wanted to kind of live
demo what these source maps look like,

39
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.790
we could override the devtool
property in our development config.

40
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.250
So let's say we just went
over to our dev config.

41
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.890
So I just want to show you for the case.

42
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.790
I won't check in having it added for
the development,

43
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.960
because you want fast dev builds, right?

44
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.140
And so we can go to the dev config and
do the same thing.

45
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.060
So devtool and say source-map,
not source-nap.

46
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.660
I might need a source-nap after
I eat that Nutella donut.

47
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.380
That thing is good.

48
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.284
Okay, and we'll just switch this
over to instead be yarn dev.

49
00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:21.980
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Oops.

50
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.050
I know what I did.

51
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.079
Hoist the devtool up to the top level,
not inside a module.

52
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.108
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Okay, so we can check
out our production environment,

53
00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:37.370
or I guess our dev server.

54
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:47.130
So great, if we inspect this now, and
hey, I like that font, nice font.

55
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.570
Good job with the fantasy font.

56
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.870
So if we look in our devtools and
we actually wanna look at sources, we

57
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.060
get the full source mapping, so much that
we can even look at the individual files.

58
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.680
So you'll notice this little
sidebar feature that says webpack.

59
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.890
And you go down to the period,

60
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.700
and you can even see your entire
project structure if you want.

61
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.730
So let's say I went to Image,
and look, there's our code as is.

62
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.290
So much that we could even
set a breakpoint and reload,

63
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.430
and it stops there, we can see the URL.

64
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.381
We can do debug-driven development,
which is my absolute favorite.

65
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.223
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Let's see.

66
00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:38.372
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Yeah.

67
00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:43.540
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And so this gives
you the most accurate source maps.

68
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.320
But why don't we play
with another quality and

69
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.550
see what we're kind of sacrificing for
the speed, right?

70
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.720
So If we went over to the, so

71
00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.310
we go back to that .js.org/devtool and
we look here.

72
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.850
So we have, why don't we choose
cheap-module-source-map.

73
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.160
So this is the one I think by default is
used in Create React App, for example.

74
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.730
It's kind of like a medium trade-off.

75
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.740
And so we could put that string in here.

76
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.855
Let's see what it creates now
if we run the command again.

77
00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:27.920
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: All right,
back to our server.

78
00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:35.627
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Okay, so
we still get accurate line markings, but

79
00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:39.540
I wonder if we look at the bundle itself.

80
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.790
Now the bundle is kinda transforming
some of the module code, and so

81
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.350
it's a little less accurate.

82
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.900
On some browsers you might
not get the full source map

83
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.050
breaking that you're looking for.

84
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.220
And so that's kinda some of
the trade-offs that you see there.

85
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.312
And hey, you can even see now
there's webpack dev server

86
00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:59.880
hot module replacement code
that's in here as well.

87
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.435
So that's the kind of client code
that gets inlined when you're using

88
00:06:03.435 --> 00:06:04.950
dev server with the hot flag.

89
00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:14.863
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: But yeah, really,
let's look at the photo.css.

90
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:21.591
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So here's an example
of where you don't get the true, or

91
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.890
it's not always perfect.

92
00:06:26.248 --> 00:06:29.108
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: But that's what we're
trading off to have better builds, or

93
00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:30.770
better speeded builds.

94
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.540
So one could even say, well,
when would this be valuable,

95
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.880
to have a one-off kind of ad hoc
opportunity to see a different source map?

96
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.450
That would be another example where
you'd maybe wanna add something,

97
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.600
add a special source map for a preset.

98
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.260
And you could add it
just if you're debugging,

99
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.610
then you could just add
it through an EMD flag.

100
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.336
Does anybody have questions
about source maps?

101
00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:05.258
I can kind of explain what
the other properties do.

102
00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:09.530
There is,
I don't know where I keep losing that tab.

103
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.120
There it is.

104
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.720
So you might wonder,
what are these ones down here?

105
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.280
Inline.source.map will actually inline the
entire source map in the module itself.

106
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.280
So you'll notice your bundles
are gonna get really huge looking.

107
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.280
And that's why we say don't
use in production, no.

108
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.890
And then there's some other
ones like hidden-source-map,

109
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.540
which has the original source and
you can use it.

110
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.590
It doesn't expose some of the mapping and
directory information.

111
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.350
So it's not available but
you still get the source map quality.

112
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.740
And then one, I think this is kind of
cool, which is the nosources.source.map.

113
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.560
So what this does actually
is if you don't wanna,

114
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.510
I know some people out there think,
we should obfuscate our source, but

115
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.360
really you're shipping assets
that are public to a website.

116
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.570
So no matter what, people can see it.

117
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.080
I think it's valuable, though,
that you could hide the source, but

118
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.750
it still maps your stack traces.

119
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:20.080
So you could still see the path to where
an error occurs in your stack trace, and

120
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.890
it maps back to that.

121
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.120
So that's another case.

122
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.210
If you're in a super enterprise-y
land where your boss gets to call all

123
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.890
the shots and doesn't really know that all
the sources are always exposed anyways,

124
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.430
you may be like, okay, we'll hide
the source, but we get the stack traces.

125
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.609
And then, you can use nosource as source
map, so, and then use a preset locally.

126
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.620
And then all the way down to eval,

127
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.820
which is what we use in
the development mode by default.

128
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.040
Super fast rebuilds,
super fast initial build, and

129
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.350
you don't use it in production cuz
it wraps everything in eval strings.

130
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.050
Which means your bundles
are gonna get really big.

131
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.989
And eval completely de-ops
your JavaScript performance,

132
00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:08.555
and there's lots of security
issues with that as well.

133
00:09:08.555 --> 00:09:11.081
So yeah, that's really source
mapping in a nutshell and

134
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:12.520
we even kind of talk about this.

135
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.480
What's quality?

136
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.450
What do these qualities mean?

137
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.240
What do you recommend for
a development environment?

138
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.580
Special cases,
like you can choose to not have column

139
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:29.360
mappings versus the same thing but
with the data URI in the bundle.

140
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.791
We try to be pretty explicit here,
don't use this when,

141
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:39.544
or you should have your
server disallow access for

142
00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:46.237
source maps to non-internal cases or
not for normal users, I guess.

143
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:50.367
And so I would take a look if you're
ever curious about source maps, or

144
00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:53.730
really any configuration property,
there's so many.

145
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.920
Like I said, we could spend an entire
week, maybe more than a week,

146
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.140
just covering each of the cases.

147
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.700
But they really are case by case.
