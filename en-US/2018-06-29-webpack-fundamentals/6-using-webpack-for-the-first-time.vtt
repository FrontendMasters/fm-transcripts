WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:07.468
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: What I really wanna
do is just kinda start diving into

2
00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:08.990
using Webpack.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.755
Let's use it for
the first time, from scratch.

4
00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:22.216
A lot of the code that we're gonna work on
today is gonna be coding along with me.

5
00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:27.550
And so [LAUGH]
I love to preface this and

6
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.390
say, I'm probably one of
the least creative people

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.440
as possible when it comes
to building the web app.

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.708
And we're just gonna talk about the core
pieces, so it may not be the most visual.

9
00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.950
It's not gonna be Sarah Drasner doing
these beautiful page transitions with SVG

10
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.694
animations, not at all,
although those are really great.

11
00:00:47.694 --> 00:00:53.280
We're gonna be just doing bare-bones,
because the whole point is that you,

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.050
like every single one of your
workflows are completely different.

13
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.220
And so trying to pull up something
that's already created and

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.240
walk through it is not gonna
provide as much value as it is

15
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.610
being able to just start from scratch,
build as you go.

16
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.045
And then understanding that you have
the flexibility to do anything,

17
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:14.480
anyway that you want.

18
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.653
And especially, I think some people
would say Sean, there is no.

19
00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:22.404
Actually, there's
a Twitter thread yesterday.

20
00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:26.485
Somebody who was from the Rails community
was ripping on Webpack and his first

21
00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:31.480
response was, I guess the problem is that
there isn't one right way to do things.

22
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.916
I'm like yeah, it's the web.

23
00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.089
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: There is no one solution

24
00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:36.740
for what you're trying to create.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.900
If every web application was made the
exact same way, Webpack wouldn't exist.

26
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.414
We wouldn't need it.

27
00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:45.690
But that's not the case.

28
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.430
We all have unique challenges.

29
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.790
We either work for finance, or e-commerce,

30
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.280
completely different domains of
things that you're trying to solve.

31
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.720
And things are gonna be completely more or
not important to you.

32
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.211
So if you haven't cloned this
repo already, go ahead and do so.

33
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:05.939
And I actually want you to check out.

34
00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.247
So there's a lot of branches
that are there, and

35
00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:10.060
we'll probably jump back and forth.

36
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.895
If you feel like you're lost
at any time please speak up.

37
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:18.820
Because this is the most important part,

38
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.650
is you experiencing how to do it, and
having the confidence of doing it.

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.440
So there is a branch
that you can check out.

40
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.473
And so, let's see,
let's just pretend I'm on master, okay?

41
00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:40.550
All right, so I'm asking you to look, and
you're like Sean, there is nothing here.

42
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.959
That's the point,
we're starting from scratch.

43
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.639
So we're gonna jump to git checkout
feature, feature I can't spell,

44
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.824
/01-fem-first-script.

45
00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:59.709
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: All right,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So you're going to

46
00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.650
see that there are a billion dependencies
in here, but that's intentional.

47
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.490
I use Yarn myself, who uses NPM?

48
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.690
Okay, so
the commands are gonna be the exact same,

49
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.020
the only difference is
if I'm running a script.

50
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.560
Or if I'm installing anything
I'll probably use Yarn,

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.720
I'll just type yarn
instead of npm install.

52
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.460
So if you wanna go ahead right
now you can run npm install.

53
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.960
And it's gonna pull down
a whole bunch of dependencies,

54
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.810
cuz of course the Webpack
ecosystem is huge.

55
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.870
And so you have a lot of different
integrations and things to choose from.

56
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.820
And we may not cover every
single one of these, but

57
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.920
we are gonna touch on
definitely the fundamentals.

58
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.520
And how to include these features
into your application, or

59
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.450
as you're building it.

60
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.030
And so I'll run it myself, run yarn or
npm install, either is fine.

61
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.223
You might see some dependency warnings,
that's okay, that's NPM [LAUGH].

62
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.730
Now while you're doing that, and

63
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.311
I hear the multicore fans kicking
in on your Macs and your PCs.

64
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.580
So while this is happening I'm gonna
give kind of a high level overview, or

65
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.460
we're just gonna look and work through
understanding how scripts work, right?

66
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.300
So if you've never been familiar
with the NPM ecosystem,

67
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.610
you'll probably wonder how
the heck you run anything, right?

68
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.070
You're using Node, that's a prerequisite,
and you need to actually run Webpack.

69
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.833
So when you install packages, or

70
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:45.590
you might notice if you do npm install,
you could do --save-dev.

71
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.390
I usually recommend if it's NPM,
you do npm install -dev.

72
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.029
If you don't, that's okay too.

73
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:56.276
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: But regardless,
what NPM does is it takes and

74
00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:01.949
adds a .bin folder inside
your node_modules.

75
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.090
And these are the executables for all of
the modules that have been downloaded.

76
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.060
And so
each of these have some sort of CLI or

77
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.774
binary executable,
including Webpack itself.

78
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.566
And so to actually run these,
if I was just to try and

79
00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:26.452
do webpack in here,
it doesn't work, it fails, see?

80
00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:28.715
It says webpack not found.

81
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:33.466
So what NPM does is it allows
you to run scripts that

82
00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.775
hoist that binary package
within its scope.

83
00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:42.270
So this gives you the opportunity, so
the first thing we'll literally do here.

84
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.457
Now I know that there's a script field
already, but if you wanted to have

85
00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:52.743
that from scratch experience,
you can literally just add a scripts key.

86
00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:59.287
Or a scripts key, and
then the object is the value.

87
00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:03.689
Now basically how this works,
is you can have anything in here.

88
00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:09.684
It could be seanlarkin, and
then what NPM will allow you to do is,

89
00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:13.810
you can run any sort of command from here.

90
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.130
It can be any sort of even Bash command,
but

91
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.940
the difference is now you have those
binary executables in this scope.

92
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.770
So for example,
if I wanted to run Webpack,

93
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.684
all I have to do is type webpack here,
right?

94
00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:34.295
So now to run it, it's either npm run and
name of that script, right?

95
00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:41.597
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: But why don't we,
just for the sake of following along,

96
00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:43.016
we just rename it to build?

97
00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:44.330
Or we can even call it webpack.

98
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.450
I like that, because then I know
exactly what that's running.

99
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.255
So if I just said, npm run webpack and
I saved this, oops.

100
00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:57.290
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: There we go,
that's the feedback I'm used to seeing.

101
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.754
That's the default console output for
Webpack.
