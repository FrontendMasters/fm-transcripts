WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: I was in two years ago,

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.791
before I started maintaining
webpack in your exact position.

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:13.676
I actually got obsessed with webpack,
cuz being a really one off

4
00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:18.470
contracting job and I got involved,
because I jumped into a new

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.469
web project that was using React and
I used Angular my whole life.

6
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:28.219
Well, we, the last year and
a half before and

7
00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.346
I encountered this beautiful, rich,

8
00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:36.360
obsessive development experience.

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.186
I was like, how can I get more of this?

10
00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:43.780
So that's kind of where it all started,
but I have been in your shoes.

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.210
And so hopefully, what I'm gonna present
to you today is really gonna teach and

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.600
lay a foundation of not only
like why are we using webpack?

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260
Why do people use it today?

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.164
What problems does it solve?

15
00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:00.553
What are the concepts and how can you
walk away feeling really comfortable?

16
00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:03.346
Because at the end of the day, really,

17
00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:08.015
webpack's strength is the ecosystem
itself that's around it.

18
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:16.271
At its core, it's a very simple tool in
terms of its capabilities standalone.

19
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.450
But yes, a little bit about myself,
I'm Program Manager at Microsoft.

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.320
I work on the Microsoft web platform or
Microsoft Edge.

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.744
I'm a Program Manager for Edge Dev Tools.

22
00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:31.742
So probably maybe about 30,
40, 50% of my time now,

23
00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.780
I'm also helping other companies or

24
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.397
other teams internally across
Microsoft use webpack.

25
00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:44.108
It turns out when I started,
I didn't know that webpack is the third

26
00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:48.670
most used JavaScript library at
Microsoft and that blew me away.

27
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.270
It was also a huge
opportunity to provide value.

28
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.184
But you may know me as one of
the maintainers of webpack, and

29
00:01:56.184 --> 00:02:00.820
you'll probably see me on Twitter
all the time responding to tweets.

30
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.417
That's kind of how I got my following,
trying to help people.

31
00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:08.543
I also did a little bit of work with
Angular CLI as one of the core team

32
00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:13.480
members and I helped, brought web pack
to Angular, in the Angular ecosystem as

33
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.265
well as just an evangelist for
open source sustainability.

34
00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:22.591
So a little bit about myself, I'm a former
Tech Support Rep gone rogue, turned

35
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:28.255
software engineer and I as just tired of
not being able to solve people's problems.

36
00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:32.358
Everyday I'd take calls,
I'd work around, this is a workaround,

37
00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:36.012
we're gonna fix this eventually and
it was just I got tired of it.

38
00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:40.245
And so, I taught myself Apple script,
and then Ruby and

39
00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:43.317
it led to objective c and finally Swift.

40
00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:45.560
And then I found my true
love with JavaScript.

41
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.827
And I also just really
believe in sustainable

42
00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:53.077
open source practices in community and
outreach.

43
00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:57.424
And so, probably like any of
the things you can find me @THELARKINN,

44
00:02:57.424 --> 00:03:02.137
so feel free and follow me on Twitter,
tweet at me any time, my DMs are open,

45
00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:06.852
doesn't matter when, I always promise
people I will eventually respond,

46
00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:10.560
it's just depending how busy I am,
it may take a day or two.

47
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.990
And I do have an ask-me-anything, page so
you can go to github.com/thelarkinn/ama,

48
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.150
you can ask me anything you want,
it doesn't matter.

49
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.978
So what are the expectations?

50
00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:25.247
So I have some general expectations for

51
00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.826
you.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: And

52
00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:32.860
really day one is kind of setting
the scene, like why webpack?

53
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.387
Just getting started with nothing,
but the command line.

54
00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:42.997
Understanding, how many here even
understand how the npm ecosystem works?

55
00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:44.805
Or npm scripts?

56
00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:48.344
These are things that maybe
you just have been like,

57
00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:50.500
run this command in the terminal.

58
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.130
And if you're like a dot net developer,

59
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.680
you're like I've never
ran a command in my life.

60
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.433
And so, like these are just some subtle
things that when you are just talking

61
00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:01.483
about webpack.

62
00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:05.570
You're going to understand
how the npm ecosystem works.

63
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.802
Running scripts,

64
00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:11.350
really simple things that are gonna
be super valuable to you later on.

65
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.046
And then we talk about the core concepts.

66
00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:15.810
So I break down a web
pack into four parts.

67
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.639
And then we'll do a little bit of live
coding and just really start from scratch.

68
00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.646
We'll add scripts into an empty project,
we'll build on and start adding

69
00:04:27.646 --> 00:04:33.288
more functionality, more behavior, and
really it's gonna set the foundation for

70
00:04:33.288 --> 00:04:37.600
how you really have your build
architecture your build system.

71
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.027
Things that you can reuse over and
over again, but

72
00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:44.302
at the end of the day
it's really your control.

73
00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:49.025
And then other things like, what are the
essential loaders and features that come

74
00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:53.553
with webpack that are in the ecosystem
that are canonical across any project?

75
00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:58.962
And then we'll even try to build
some very, we'll built some very low

76
00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:04.200
fidelity web applications and
bundle them together with webpack.
