00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: I don't want to have to
force anybody to have to run mpm run prod

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.830
a thousand times and so,
why don't we jump back into our scripts.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.887
We can solve this.

4
00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:14.002
Webpack has a watching mode and
so, maybe it makes sense for

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:20.495
our development mode,
that we just have a watch flag added on.

6
00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.811
What's cool is that guess what,
we just have to compose the watch flag

7
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:28.660
onto the end of our DevScript.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the order matter there?

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.276
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: It does not.

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.283
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: So if we say that npm run

10
00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:40.815
dev,
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: All right,

11
00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:45.930
the process doesn't exit and
it just shows this feedback.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.225
But what's great now is why don't
we even just jump into nav,

13
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.230
what if we wanted to change this?

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.355
What if we wanted to instead have
it be a function that calls and

15
00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:02.127
returns the string literal nav.

16
00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:06.555
[LAUGH] Now of course,
our code would look a little different, so

17
00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:09.835
if this is a function that
returns a nav string,

18
00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:14.854
that means we now have to call nav if
we wanna get the string back, right?

19
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.300
But you can see slowly in your terminal
feedback as you're changing that.

20
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.500
So, let me see if I can get both of
them up in the same, both files.

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.120
It'll be helpful.

22
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.260
Oops.
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: There we go.

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960
But as you make changes,
web pack is just incrementally compiling.

24
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.190
It just changes whatever
modules you're working with.
