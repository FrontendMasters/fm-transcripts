00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.130
So we covered some of the basic primitive
types that we might see in an application.

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.336
But we not only deal with
properties that are strings or

3
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.966
Booleans whatever in TypeScript,
we might also see that a lot,

4
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:25.075
one thing that we might pass
in are like more sophisticated

5
00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:29.270
react components are other
components right?

6
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.000
So one of the easiest
examples is children right?

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.286
Well children's out a string or
bullying or anything along those lines so

8
00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:42.100
like what do we pass in if we wanna
have a prop, that's children.

9
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.881
And so we're gonna have our first
little exercise here, where we've

10
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:54.820
got a box component and we've got a whole
bunch of different use cases around it.

11
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.846
I'll actually switch over here,
we've got a box, and

12
00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.470
really all it does is render children.

13
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.493
Right now that is defined as any
because we haven't figured out yet

14
00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:13.580
how exactly we want, we don't know
what what property is here, right?

15
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.695
And one of the things that we saw
when we hovered over name tag,

16
00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:21.830
you're like, well,
name tag returns JSX element, right?

17
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.276
So maybe that's what it is, there's a
bunch of options that seem plausible if we

18
00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:32.484
poke around react, there is JSX.element,
there's an array of elements,

19
00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:37.400
there's one given one, or
this is the symbol for or a array of them.

20
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.648
We've got react node react children,
react child,

21
00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:44.770
a array of react child,
which is different than react, children.

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.964
There's a bunch of different things this
is where it starts to get a little bit

23
00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:52.940
tricky because it's not necessarily
always like particularly well defined.

24
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.636
So what I want for you to do kinda
our first exercise together,

25
00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:58.840
spend a few minutes and go through and

26
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.600
figure out try all of these
out is currently typed as any.

27
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.762
What we wanna do is we want to figure
out which one of these will prevent

28
00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:12.770
us from getting wet red squiggles
in our actual component here.

29
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.587
So try them all out we'll see and

30
00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:19.110
then we'll kinda figure out which one
the winner is and, we'll talk about it.
