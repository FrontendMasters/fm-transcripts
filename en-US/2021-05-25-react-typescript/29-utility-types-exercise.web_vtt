1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.660
And then the friend component
is also using user model.

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.600
But the challenge I give to you
is instead have it read the type.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.095
Since this is that last slide,
so before I have it,

4
00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:19.710
see if you can have it read
the type of current users.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.056
See like, okay, I wanna be able to use all
the same prompts as current user without

6
00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.365
having to use the user model type itself.

7
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:29.015
If you need to reference any
types you saw on the slides,

8
00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:34.155
you can go back onto the website, we have
the two other utility types in react.

9
00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.228
They're all here as well,
so you can reference that.

10
00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:40.481
But the two goals of the mission
here are mega tight that excludes

11
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.880
the account ID and
then have the friend component.

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.698
Figure out its props based on the current
user component instead of just using

13
00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:50.470
the same type.
