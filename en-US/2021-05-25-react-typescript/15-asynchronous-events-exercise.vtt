00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:03.420
We're gonna give you a quick exercise
to kind of bring this all together, and

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.366
then what we're gonna do after
that we're gonna move into things.

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:10.245
How do you actually type reducers,
how do you have context and

4
00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.742
things of that nature?

5
00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:13.384
So let's go take a look here,

6
00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.219
we're gonna try to pull everything
that we've worked on together.

7
00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.794
We have this application here, which is
going to asynchronously load, I mean,

8
00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:24.638
it's truly a synchronous,
it is not really API.

9
00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:28.725
It's gonna asynchronously load some dog
facts based on a form that we're gonna

10
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.679
do a submit event, so on and so forth.

11
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.306
You're gonna visit this sandbox
right here or it is under projects,

12
00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:40.665
in dog facts, in the repo, if you wanna
just NPM install and spin it up locally.

13
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.393
If you wanna use those tools,
like whatever makes you happier,

14
00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:48.395
what we wanna do is we'd love to select
some number of dog facts that we

15
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.730
would like as you can see right
now we can't do anything.

16
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.013
And then, what we wanna do is go fetch
them and they should load after the fact.
