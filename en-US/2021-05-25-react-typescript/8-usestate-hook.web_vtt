WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.009
So right now we've dealt mostly
with the props that we pass in,

2
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.660
which is great and wonderful,
but there is the use

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.531
case that we might want to
pass in some state as well,

4
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.510
or managed state in our application.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.380
And first, we're gonna talk about
this in two different ways.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.415
So, we're gonna talk about
state that we know about and

7
00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:28.020
we're gonna talk about state
that we eventually get, right?

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.367
A great example of state we might
eventually get is state like,

9
00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.157
okay, we're gonna fetch stuff from
an API when the component mounts,

10
00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:36.940
we don't have that yet, right?

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.056
And a lot of times if we can use defaults,
it's something along those lines,

12
00:00:42.056 --> 00:00:45.756
right like that works,
right when you say like, okay,

13
00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:49.470
like we don't have the user's
first name from the API.

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.645
Yeah, but we might choose to
use empty string for now,

15
00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:54.021
that's usually super helpful and
we'll see for reasons.

16
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.607
But there's some cases where we don't
actually necessarily know the shape of

17
00:00:57.607 --> 00:00:59.300
everything as the component loads.

18
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.345
All right, so let's take a look at this.

19
00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:11.568
Let's start up here.

20
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.405
We haven't actually implemented
the state part yet, but

21
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:23.000
we're gonna have a few questions and
we wanna do is be able to toggle them.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.877
And so right now they are blurred and
eventually we want to take off

23
00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:32.790
that class name in the event that
they hit toggle answer, right?

24
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.647
So our state in this case will be whether
or not the answer should be hidden, so

25
00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:40.800
let's go ahead and
we will kinda define that.

26
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.157
Let me pull in, let's just say use state.

27
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.187
I was hoping for the auto import,

28
00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:53.740
it's one of those things some
of the time works every time.

29
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.398
So when you start as react from react.

30
00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:01.659
Okay, so now we've got,

31
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.712
let's say is hidden and toggle hidden.

32
00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:15.304
And we're gonna say that by default,

33
00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:18.010
it should start out as True in this case,
right?

34
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.210
So, first of all be hidden if
you make that shown as well.

35
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.371
One of things I wanna point out
is we didn't really have to use

36
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.100
any type definitions here, right?

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.108
I could do something like this and

38
00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:35.194
we'll kind of explore this is
a generic which I'll explain a little

39
00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:39.870
bit later in the course where we could
say that it should be a boiling, right?

40
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.665
Cuz we know that react use state takes
lots of different art and take basically

41
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:49.034
anything that's gonna be the default
value of whatever the state is.

42
00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.944
And then toggle should then only be
able to switch it to something new.

43
00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:55.700
Now in regular JavaScript you can
start with the state as a boolean and

44
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.326
switch it to a string and
then accidentally set it as undefined, or

45
00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:01.200
something along those lines.

46
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.807
TypeScript is going to enforce that,
whatever it was when you first set

47
00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:12.400
it should be what it is in the event
that you set it to something else.

48
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.651
So we can define it,

49
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:18.077
which point you can see that it knows
that is hidden should be a boolean.

50
00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:22.327
And if you look closely at
the definition of toggle hidden, so

51
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:26.986
it's got some ceremony around,
it's got reactive dispatch, and

52
00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:30.029
as dispatching and react set state action.

53
00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.774
Cuz you can learn a little bit about
has might just be using a reducer under

54
00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:36.920
the hood, right and
it's expecting that it gets a Boolean.

55
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.082
So not only is it a Boolean but like when
you go to set the state to something new

56
00:03:41.082 --> 00:03:43.670
that can also only be a Boolean as well.

57
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.444
But what's kind of interesting
is I can get rid of that.

58
00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:48.980
right?

59
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.959
And this is kind of one of the core
concepts that we are going to

60
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.778
explore a little bit in our time together.

61
00:03:55.778 --> 00:04:00.691
Which is TypeScript is going to analyze
your code to try its hardest to figure

62
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:03.531
out what you meant without
you having to tell

63
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.700
it everything about everything
that you're doing, right?.

64
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.945
And so I think sometimes when there's
complaints of yeah, TypeScript,

65
00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:11.584
but there's so

66
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:15.070
much extra ceremony that I have to go
through in order to get anything done.

67
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.391
And to be clear, that was definitely true
a while ago, but these days there's a lot

68
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.662
that it will do to try to figure
out the intention in your code and

69
00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:23.747
get out of your way.

70
00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:27.741
The times that we're gonna have to kind
of step in there and really kind of guide

71
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:32.070
TypeScript is when it doesn't have
enough information to figure that out.

72
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.934
But in this case, it does react use state,

73
00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:38.540
you're passing in a Boolean
as the initial value.

74
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.254
So it's like is hidden is probably going
to be a Boolean and when you toggle it,

75
00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:45.900
it's also probably going to get
toggled to another Boolean, right?

76
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.995
And we didn't have to actually
necessarily define the type or

77
00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:54.180
say anything about it,
it can manage a lot of that stuff for us.

78
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.644
And again, if I change this
to something else real quick,

79
00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:02.751
right, like we can see
if we hover over this.

80
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:06.798
Now assuming as a string and
you're gonna set it to another string,

81
00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:10.640
but out of the box we don't
that's a terrible name.

82
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.780
So we're gonna say that it is true and
we'll be able to use it as such.

83
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.098
So here's what we're gonna say is,
we're only gonna give it the blurred class

84
00:05:20.098 --> 00:05:23.966
in the event that it is hidden otherwise
we'll give it a visible class or

85
00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:25.600
something.

86
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.240
So here we'll say,

87
00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:38.220
If it's hidden give it
the blurred otherwise

88
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.330
give it visible, it's hidden.

89
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.350
Cool, all right nothing changes
cuz by default that's set to true.

90
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.445
The other one that we're gonna do is
give us a button to just toggle that.

91
00:05:58.037 --> 00:06:01.203
On click,
just give it a little click handler.

92
00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.360
And we'll say toggle hidden.

93
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.050
And yeah,
I'll totally give it the string false.

94
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.440
That doesn't work, but
like zero's fallacy actually work, right?

95
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.567
Cuz JavaScript this would
theoretically for reasons that I want

96
00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:24.750
to talk about work but in TypeScript it's,
no, I understand the zero is fallacy.

97
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.350
Or no is false but like it literally
you said a Booleen, right?

98
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.013
So instead of an accidental value that
might work and then might have a bug like

99
00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:39.550
six months later and then you get blamed
and you find out it was you, right.

100
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.650
In this case, we will see that like,
like typescript again like listen,

101
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.300
you taught us the intention this
code is to toggle to a Boolean,

102
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.710
I'm going to ask the you do that.

103
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.686
There are ways which
we'll se in a little bit,

104
00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:51.370
to say listen this could be one thing or
the other thing.

105
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.260
Or this could be null or a value.

106
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.423
We'll see all of that but
out of the box you can, it's gonna

107
00:06:58.423 --> 00:07:04.528
basically look at what it was and
try to ask you set it to the same thing.

108
00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:08.759
So now Back in Black is the first song
in Iron Man Thor took a class and

109
00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.010
speaking group and
the first stone that power first

110
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.140
infinity stone that that I was
got was the Power Stone, right?

111
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.315
I don't think any of those are spoilers,
so I think it's fine.

112
00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:23.310
But we can go ahead and we can say that
a lot of there's not other nice question

113
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.556
prompts, which again, is not much more
than using prop types, which is again,

114
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:29.990
mostly trying to save you from yourself.

115
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.645
TypeScript is doing a lot of this for
us under the hood, and

116
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:40.259
there's not a lot that we need to
necessarily deal with out of the box.
