00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:03.821
One of the things is, like I said at
the very beginning of this course,

2
00:00:03.821 --> 00:00:07.900
right this course is mostly about the
interaction the intersection not to use.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.308
That's not a typescript tonight,

4
00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:14.571
I promise you the intersection
between react and typescript.

5
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:19.649
Mike North has both a on front of masters,
he has both a react fundamentals v2.

6
00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.469
As well as production getting react in
the react fundamentals of v2 is like,

7
00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.846
and TypeScript writ large a way to
kind of like very iteratively go from

8
00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.276
a JavaScript app to a TypeScript
application as well.

9
00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:36.453
Well, like kind of in depth, and so
I highly recommend that as well,

10
00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:40.502
that concludes our time together
learning react and TypeScript.

11
00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:44.108
Thank you so much for joining us,
and I hope you enjoyed this course.
