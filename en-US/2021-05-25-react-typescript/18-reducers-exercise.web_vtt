00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.440
It's time for
you to take a take a run at this.

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.904
Again, if you're just locally
in projects folder in the repo,

3
00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:17.712
there is a base of a project called
counter for hooks that you can use.

4
00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:21.430
That was like we used in the last one, but
you can basically use the same project.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.600
As well, there's also a clean
spot in examples number 20,

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.310
which is the incident
kind of reducer exercise.

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580
Don't look at 21 cuz this is a solution.

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.780
But you can go through and give it a shot,
get some muscle memory in there, and

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.820
just go and add some, add a reducer
instead of using state for our counter.

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.639
Yeah, it's simple, but actually won't
be able to see something cool, cuz

11
00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:50.450
it'll go back to that question that just
got asked about, different payload types.

12
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.280
And we'll be able to see a kind of cool
trick that we can do after as well.

13
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.284
So why don't you go and
get most of that kind of set up, and

14
00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:59.860
then we'll kind of look
at it together shortly.
