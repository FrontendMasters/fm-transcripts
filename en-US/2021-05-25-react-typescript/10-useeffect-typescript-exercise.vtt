00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
So another kind of example of that,
we kind of go over to the next piece

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.440
is to kind of take a look at this
slightly problematic piece of code and

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
I'm gonna leave it to you for
a few minutes just to kind

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.369
of just read there and
see if you can figure out what's going on.

5
00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.328
But TypeScript as it loads is
not going to be particularly

6
00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:27.229
pleased with this piece of code.

7
00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:31.640
So spend a few minutes, look at it,
and just kinda see if you can.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.471
The Code Query works, but it's not
actually working the way react intends it

9
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:40.199
to work in TypeScript notice
that it's trying to help you.

10
00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.622
So I want you to do is kind of look at it
play around with and figure out, can you

11
00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:49.464
read the error message and figure out like
what we need to do to appease TypeScript,

12
00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:52.810
PS TypeScript in order to really,
truly appease react.
