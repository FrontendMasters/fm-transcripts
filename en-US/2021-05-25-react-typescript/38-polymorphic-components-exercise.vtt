00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.502
We're gonna do another kind of
simplified version of this,

2
00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:08.170
which is I kind of mentioned this before,
is we've got this text element.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.427
And right now for the text element,
it always returns a div,

4
00:00:12.427 --> 00:00:16.530
we wanna make a semantically
better text element.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.626
Where we could pass in as prop in there,
and

6
00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:23.076
as you'd be like as a paragraph tag,
as a span.

7
00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:27.910
As I don't know article,
whatever you wanna pass text into.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.098
We wanna just make it so

9
00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:33.490
we're using the same pattern that we use
from the buttons with this text property.

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.931
And give it a shot and
try to cuz it's a lot,

11
00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:42.674
I think the act of kind of going through
it will cement it into your brain and

12
00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:45.370
then we'll review it together as a team.
