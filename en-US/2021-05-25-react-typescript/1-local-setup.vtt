00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.558
So let's talk a little bit about just
how to follow along, but locally,

2
00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:04.596
like as I mentioned.

3
00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:08.280
We've got code sandboxes for
every step, but

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.960
I don't always trust things that
are not completely under my control.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.167
So one of the things we have is,
we've got all the code sandboxes which

6
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:24.919
I'll show you are kind of in the appendix
listed per every step along the way.

7
00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.330
As well as embedded in a lot of
the lessons are linked there.

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.312
But also if you want to do any of these
stuff locally as well, and we'll do some

9
00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:39.840
of them like that ourselves, we've got
at repo that you can clone down here.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.179
And so what we'll do is you can
clone it I have it already.

11
00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.124
And any of the examples
from along the way like

12
00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:54.212
the smaller things,
are kind of here as well.

13
00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:59.838
And they are aligned to all the sandboxes
you can kind of see the code in

14
00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:04.981
any given one of those,
you can navigate in there NPM install.

15
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.514
And NPM start,
to get a local environment running.

16
00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:14.179
For some of the larger projects that
we might work on or some of the bases

17
00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.669
that we might work with there
are indivdiual projects here as well.

18
00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:23.233
And NPM start should get them up and
running as well.

19
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:29.040
If you want to there is like a tool
that recursively installs everything.

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.486
One of the things that I will warn you
is since there are a lot of directories.

21
00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:38.534
And you might not want everything for
every one of these,

22
00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:41.950
you might not be spinning up
every individual example.

23
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.130
So it's up to you, if you want to
recursively install all of those different

24
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.850
things, it's gonna start eating up some
disk space and stuff along those lines.

25
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.785
So I would probably if you find yourself
annoyed, or having to do it over and

26
00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:57.050
over again, you can recursively stall,
maybe just in the projects.

27
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.797
Otherwise, you can just install the
dependencies in whatever you want to spin

28
00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:04.160
up, but NPM install NPM start
should give you a local version.

29
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.298
Of any given code sandbox you find us
using, as well as some of the kinda

30
00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:12.520
projects that will build upon,
as we write some code together as well.
