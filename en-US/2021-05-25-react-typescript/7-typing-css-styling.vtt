00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.159
The other thing we might want to do is,
again,

2
00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.709
this is where it gets
into the React specifics,

3
00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.710
is you could see a world where
this could get problematic, right?

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.440
Like this inline style on this section,
right?

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.087
We are just used to that being
a JavaScript object, and

6
00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:26.413
you can pass in anything, and you can
misspell anything that you want, right?

7
00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:32.030
You can say this is border, and
you would see that the borders vanished.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.536
Now, that's a really distinct change
from my very beautiful purple

9
00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.410
borders to see them vanish.

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.450
I'm probably well aware of that one.

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.824
But you can imagine something where
you misspell margin or something and

12
00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:46.874
it just looks slightly off,
it gets a little bit trickier to see.

13
00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:50.892
Now, React has gone out
of its way to figure out,

14
00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:54.722
you probably didn't mean to do that,
right?

15
00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:58.700
Cuz it's not assignable to
the type CSSProperties, right?

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.525
Again, that is another React built-in
type that basically understands

17
00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:07.646
all of the style properties that
you can pass into a component,

18
00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:10.390
and says that's not one of them, right?

19
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.880
And so basically, very quickly catches
any of those misspellings, right?

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is a super simple one, but you
can see some of those more insidious bugs

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.935
that we deal with in our code is simply,
there was some kinda misspelling,

22
00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:23.320
some kind of mistake.

23
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.406
TypeScript seeks to find
out all those things and

24
00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:29.266
give you immediately
a red squiggly line that

25
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.190
shows you where the issue can be
to make it a lot easier for you.

26
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.380
And one of the best ways
to learn what kind of type

27
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.790
you might need is simply
to hover over stuff, right?

28
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.113
So you can see that this is
using React.CSSProperties, or

29
00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:49.900
undefined in this case, right?

30
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.855
I don't know why you'd pass it undefined,
I guess if you don't have a defined,

31
00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:54.710
right, which nothing will get passed in.

32
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.780
But otherwise it has
this React.CSSProperties.

33
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.551
So what would happen if we
wanted the ability to be able to

34
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.915
pass in to the box another prop,
which is okay, and

35
00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:11.700
you can pass in whatever other
CSS styles that you want.

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.530
So let's figure out how we might do that.

37
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760
Well, we wanna have another property here.

38
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.162
And we'll say style, and
by default style is an empty object.

39
00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:25.170
Right, and
TypeScript is a little annoyed with us.

40
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.014
Well, it's never red and that's true, but
it does not exist on the style BoxProps.

41
00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.129
Let's go change this back to ReactNode.

42
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.860
We're going to find this
second property here as well.

43
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.240
Now, because it has a default value,
there's a lot of cases where I don't wanna

44
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.970
pass in a style,
which I do style question mark.

45
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.500
And I can say at this point that
it'll be React.CSSProperties, right?

46
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.160
And this will appease it,
now I can say this one.

47
00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:20.370
All right, that's gotta be a string,
right, and CSS in there like it's okay.

48
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.294
All right, and
we'll actually say this is a border color.

49
00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:32.305
And if we don't use it in the component,
nothing happens.

50
00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:34.688
So here we'll also spread it out.

51
00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:40.320
Right, and so now we can pass styles in.

52
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.870
Now, it is an optional property.

53
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.744
And Steve, didn't you say that
if you use an optional property,

54
00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:48.792
that TypeScript will yell at you?

55
00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.640
I did say that.

56
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.542
But because it has a default,

57
00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:56.250
TypeScript knows that in no
case will it be undefined.

58
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.710
It'll either be what they passed in as
a prop or it's gonna be an empty object,

59
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.340
both of which can be spread.

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.248
But if we, for
instance took this out, right,

61
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:11.930
in this case we gotta
take it out here as well.

62
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.863
Right, you can see that it is,
maybe it's not.

63
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.608
It's actually yelling us from when it
doesn't, so it's trying to catch us like,

64
00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:26.240
hey listen, you said this was required,
it's not being used here at all.

65
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.900
So for any of those little, the way it
manifests might change a little bit.

66
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.773
But like any kind of those cases where we
might have done something unintentionally

67
00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.160
or have an edge case, TypeScript is
going to seek to try to find it for us.

68
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.788
So let's actually put
that back the way it was.

69
00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:41.177
So we will say style exists, and

70
00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:45.345
we will say that it should be
an empty object by default.
