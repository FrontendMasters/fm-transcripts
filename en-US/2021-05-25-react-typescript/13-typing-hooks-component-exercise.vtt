00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.580
Now it is your turn, my turn for what?

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.140
We're doing again, this time, you're gonna
do it with the hook space example, right?

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.320
We're just gonna wire it up,
real quick with the three buttons.

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.560
This one,
you can kind of get a sense to try it.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.836
You can try to make the form work,
if you want, but spend a few minutes,

6
00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:21.870
getting it working with the Hooks example.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.354
And then we'll kind of go
through it together and

8
00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:28.231
just see how some of the stuff from
the classmates example might also apply to

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.880
the Hooks base example as well.
