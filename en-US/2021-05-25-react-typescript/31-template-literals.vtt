00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.310
I was talking about a little bit about
a brand new feature in typescript 4.2.

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.991
And I mentioned that it's a new
feature because type 2.4 was the most

3
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.919
recent version you see in at the star
ship play ground running to 4.23.

4
00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.437
And am gonna go jump into my cool bass
tomorrow and do this, the problem that you

5
00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:26.476
might have is that if you're running
an older version of TypeScript,

6
00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:27.861
this is not supported.

7
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.102
But in the current version,
this is another really,

8
00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:37.287
really great way to take common
things that you might deal with and

9
00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.561
do it a little more cleanly.

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.287
So, in JavaScript,
we have template literal,

11
00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:45.419
which are the ability to do
like string interpolation.

12
00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:48.732
Into a given string and
what type template literals

13
00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:52.438
allow you to do is do something
like that with your types.

14
00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:58.040
So, right now we have
an alignment which is a string.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.542
I also want to spell it right?

16
00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:03.277
We have an alignment that's a string,
right?

17
00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:08.091
But we don't want to just
have a any given string here,

18
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:13.636
we wanna say that it's got to be
one of the somewhere in the law in

19
00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:18.990
chaos spectrum and
somewhere on the good and evil spectrum.

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.752
So we only wanna have chaotic good,
lawful, good, true neutral, so on and so

21
00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:24.874
forth, neutral, neutral, lawful evil.

22
00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:26.869
We don't want to let them
put any string in there.

23
00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.655
That's slightly problematic.

24
00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:36.745
An interesting way to do this is again,
we can do like type alignment.

25
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.131
Again, this works in the most
recent version of TypeScript.

26
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:44.272
And we can say that we wanna

27
00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:49.414
have low chaos dash good,

28
00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:52.463
evil, right?

29
00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:55.749
And now if you look this went ahead and

30
00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:00.732
made all of the composite
types out of those two pieces.

31
00:02:00.732 --> 00:02:04.715
So now we've got lawful neutral, lawful
good, lawful evil, neutral, neutral,

32
00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:07.986
neutral good, neutral evil,
chaotic neutral, so on and so forth.

33
00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:12.870
And this is you know,
now I can switch this with alignment

34
00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.904
And if I misspell part of
it It's not gonna work.

35
00:02:19.904 --> 00:02:22.650
If I do things that aren't okay,

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.169
it's still not gonna work
it adds additional safety.

37
00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.322
All right, so this is, cool.

38
00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:30.797
What might this look like?

39
00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:35.505
This we can become
particularly interesting if

40
00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:39.514
you're building a component library.

41
00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:42.088
So if you go to the page,
we can see there's a your turn here.

42
00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.684
I'll bring this in.

43
00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:49.335
A more apropos version for
a react component,

44
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.266
is a different kind of
alignment instead of good or

45
00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.867
evil, maybe top Center and
bottom left Center and right.

46
00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:01.991
So we maybe wanna have a box component or
a card component or something.

47
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:07.172
We wanna be very specific
about the different

48
00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:11.134
combinations that you could use.

49
00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:14.397
So instead of allowing a string,
we want top center to work.

50
00:03:14.397 --> 00:03:16.877
We want bottom, right to work.

51
00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:21.895
My challenge to you,
kind of check it out the sandbox up here,

52
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:27.394
is left right should not work and
right now center should not work but

53
00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:31.273
then I'll do a follow up
extension in a second.

54
00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.242
We will get that working as well.

55
00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:37.097
So similar to what we did with
the dungeon dragons alignment.

56
00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:42.724
Your mission is to create an alignment
type that will be the combination

57
00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:48.934
of vertical alignment and horizontal
alignment that will get a and b working.

58
00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:53.377
Will break should break and it will at
first break this should break at first but

59
00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:54.799
eventually work, box.

60
00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.782
I want you to spend five minutes on
that and then we'll come back and

61
00:03:57.782 --> 00:03:58.485
do it as a team.
