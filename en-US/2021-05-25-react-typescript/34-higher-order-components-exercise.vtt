00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.580
All right, so
now you're getting your hands dirty.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.215
I've got another kinda simple
example from a lot earlier,

3
00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:10.795
where we're going to take the name tag and
we're gonna try to pull out the,

4
00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:14.523
we're gonna try to do a width
current user that will pass in.

5
00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.945
We're gonna create a width current
user higher-order component.

6
00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:20.110
It's gonna pass in
the basic user information.

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.324
But the extra challenge at this point,

8
00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:25.419
we still wanna accept that
salutation prop manually.

9
00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.240
So it's kind of a little
bit of an extension.

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.769
So I'll give you a chance to kind of get
your hands dirty with the pattern, and

11
00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.470
then we'll do it together as a team.
