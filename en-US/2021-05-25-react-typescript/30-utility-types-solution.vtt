00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.614
So, mission again was to take over
the end user model, and just exclude,

2
00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:12.850
well exclude maybe not the right word, but
the conceptually exclude just account ID.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.266
And so previously, we've called
Are the types that we're using as props,

4
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:23.005
whatever the current use, or
whatever the component is props, so

5
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.239
we could make one called
current user props.

6
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.870
And the one we're gonna
use this case is omit.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.377
And that's gonna take the user
model as the first generic and

8
00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:36.080
there's gonna figure out.

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.110
We're gonna remove any
property called account ID.

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.549
So if we hover over this one we can
see this get used whenever defined.

11
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.290
Which is fine.

12
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.459
If you don't spell account ID,
right it doesn't work.

13
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.240
Just fun fact.

14
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.050
And so
now you can see it takes off account ID.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.570
And we've just got display name and
verify.

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.343
So if we go and we swap it in,
we'll use a model was here,

17
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:13.510
you can see that my account
ID is no longer allowed.

18
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.030
It's not a thing that I could use.

19
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.690
This.

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.596
So this allows us not to have
to duplicate our code and

21
00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:22.426
have a second one where we take
something off, so on and so forth, but

22
00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:25.220
actually kinda be
programmatic about our types.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.159
Our other mission is, this is effectively
the same, but I wanna be able to see if I

24
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.820
can read the type of the current user
component In order to use it for a friend.

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.860
And with that we saw that we
had the react.component props.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.416
And so for here we can do.

27
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.487
And we're gonna type of what
type of is a JavaScript keyword,

28
00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.830
but it works in our typescript
definitions as well.

29
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.160
So we use type of and then current user.

30
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.852
And you can see that this is
getting the same to proper

31
00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:10.976
display name, and
is off of the current user as well.

32
00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:18.559
Cool, and so everything works here and
it's all wired up together.
