00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.753
So the challenge is,
we don't want to take the shortcut here,

2
00:00:04.753 --> 00:00:07.273
we don't wanna use any, right?

3
00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:11.409
We want to correctly define
what kind of property,

4
00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.974
children should be using the correct type.

5
00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:19.856
As I said before,
we have a bunch of options.

6
00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:22.231
So let's try some of them out.

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.107
Let's try JSX dot element.

8
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:32.351
And you can see that it
works some of the time,

9
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.028
but not all of the time.

10
00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:37.922
And one of the reasons for that is,
if you look it works on the box and

11
00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:38.821
only has one child.

12
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:45.494
But it doesn't work on any of the ones
that have multiple children, right?

13
00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:50.646
Cuz we saw before those brackets,
a lot of times,

14
00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:56.178
will work only for
single objects and not for arrays.

15
00:00:56.178 --> 00:00:58.199
All right, so, I'll make an array.

16
00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:02.613
That changes things a little bit.

17
00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:07.657
Turns out,
when we saw that name tag component before

18
00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:12.490
we returned a JSX element,
and that seemed great.

19
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.024
But if you look at what is not
a JSX element it's a string.

20
00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.568
I mean yeah, we could we start
to get real weird with this.

21
00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:22.021
Or we could say, this might even work.

22
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:26.430
No, cuz now it's like, yeah.

23
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.426
It'll take a JSX element but
it doesn't take a string.

24
00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:34.797
So we could try to say or a string, but
this is not the way forward for us.

25
00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:39.290
All right, so
then we've got react dot react children.

26
00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.743
And if you look,
there's a little bit of a difference here.

27
00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:48.636
I can see that,
we gotta pull in react as well.

28
00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.346
All right, you can see that this is
also still, yeah, it doesn't work for

29
00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:02.227
the multiple ones.

30
00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:03.193
It's actually just a helper function.

31
00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:04.529
This is not the right answer for
us either.

32
00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:14.795
All right, so then,
what about an array of React.React.Child.

33
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:18.791
No.

34
00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.992
Again this one is also not working
except multiple chosen but

35
00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:28.297
doesn't accept a single child less
paired than some of our other options.

36
00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:30.023
Finally we have React.ReactNode.

37
00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:35.240
And this is the typing built
into react for just saying,

38
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.904
listen anything that would
work as an HTML child.

39
00:02:39.904 --> 00:02:41.399
Which is a string, another HTML element.

40
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.684
Or react opponent,

41
00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:47.077
which will eventually be HTML elements
at the end of the day, right?

42
00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:53.263
React.ReactNode will be the one that
finally satisfies all of these needs.

43
00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:59.685
Later on we'll look at some things
along the lines of figuring out.

44
00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:02.703
Okay we wanna have a, React Node has
certain props or stuff along those lines,

45
00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:04.637
but this is kinda about
a highest level right now.

46
00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:08.574
So the question is,
is there a difference between using

47
00:03:08.574 --> 00:03:13.028
React.ReactNode versus react child and
or an array there of.

48
00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:17.984
Let's find out.

49
00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:25.646
One of the things that we can kinda,
see here is, if you hover over you

50
00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:29.931
can get a sense of all of the things
that React Node supports.

51
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:33.467
So we've got string number, boolean,
an object, a react element, portals,

52
00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:34.309
so on and so forth.

53
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.816
Right, you can actually basically see,

54
00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.832
the entire definition of
React Node in this case.

55
00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:42.308
This is all of the cases
that it will deal with.

56
00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:47.863
If you go ahead,
they might work in this example.

57
00:03:47.863 --> 00:03:48.753
But again,

58
00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:54.189
it doesn't have the idea of supporting
some of those other ones as well.

59
00:03:58.852 --> 00:04:01.938
Let's see, it does appease this example,
but it's kinda curious to see.

60
00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:09.616
This doesn't have all of the same options,
it doesn't seem to have anything

61
00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.550
about having a portal in there or
anything along those lines.

62
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.352
So it seems like react children is
a subset of everything you would get

63
00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.086
from React Node.

64
00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:19.333
Or react child is a subset of
everything you get from React Node.

65
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:24.095
The other question was differentiating
react children and react child,

66
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:31.572
which is actually, So

67
00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:34.337
React.Children is not a type.

68
00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:40.950
It is actually built in to react
in the JavaScript library.

69
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.528
And has a bunch of utility methods for

70
00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:46.947
working with the children
in a react component.

71
00:04:46.947 --> 00:04:49.949
So it's like,
which one of these types work, well,

72
00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.577
this one was a little bit of a trick and
so far there's not a type.

73
00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:57.445
It has a type, right, but it actually
has a count for each map to array and

74
00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:01.077
only it has a bunch of helper methods
that we might use along the way.

75
00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:03.060
So it is not a type.
