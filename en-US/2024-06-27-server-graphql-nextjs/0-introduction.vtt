00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.049
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: How's it going, everybody?

2
00:00:01.049 --> 00:00:02.985
Welcome to Server Side GraphQL.

3
00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.122
I'm your instructor Scott Moss,
thanks for tuning in.

4
00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:10.678
And in this course, we're gonna be
covering all types of things with GraphQL,

5
00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:12.860
but specifically on the server side.

6
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.183
We actually shot a client-side version
of this course that covers pretty much

7
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.090
everything on the client-side.

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.170
So I highly recommend checking that
out if you want the full stack of what

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.924
GraphQL is.

10
00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:27.705
But in this course,
it's specifically gonna be server side.

11
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:32.999
So GraphQL is one of those technologies
that I've used pretty much my whole

12
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:38.560
career as an engineer since it's been
adopted, in some way or some capacity.

13
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.179
From creating headless
CMSs with dynamic GraphQL,

14
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.558
APIs on the fly,
to building tooling around it.

15
00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:48.497
At one point,
people were using GraphQL for

16
00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:52.316
developing static websites and
querying file systems.

17
00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:55.268
It's like GraphQL is
just a powerful language.

18
00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:59.040
So I'm super excited to talk about how to
take advantage of it on the server side,

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.768
which I think is where all the power is,
but also where a lot of the confusion is.

20
00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:06.755
So we're gonna demystify some
of that in my own perspective.

21
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.421
So we'll dive into that.

22
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.077
And just a little bit more about me,
if you're new to any of my

23
00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:16.812
courses here at Frontend Masters,
I've been an engineer for over ten years,

24
00:01:16.812 --> 00:01:21.212
working at various companies like Netflix,
starting a few companies.

25
00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:26.625
Also had a stint as a VC where I took
a lot of startup pitches in San Francisco.

26
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:30.252
Currently I'm in the middle of
starting another startup right now,

27
00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:33.326
it's AI startup, and
we use a lot of these technologies.

28
00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.256
So I'm using Next.js, I'm using GraphQL,

29
00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:38.532
I'm using even the database that we're
gonna use today, you're gonna see.

30
00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.866
I'm using all of these things,
which is why I'm so

31
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.433
excited to talk about them
because I use them every day.

32
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:45.071
So this is the app that
we're gonna be building.

33
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.915
It's called Parallel.

34
00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:51.271
It's a play on a really cool
app that I like called Linear.

35
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.950
And on the client side course, we took
care of all the client-side queries and

36
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.142
GraphQL stuff on the frontend with React,
we take advantage of it.

37
00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:00.360
Here, we're gonna be
doing the server side.

38
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.069
How do we actually enable that?

39
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.270
So the framework of choice along
with GraphQL is gonna be Next.js.

40
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.245
So when it comes to Next.js,

41
00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:12.945
you don't actually need to be an expert at
Next.js to take advantage of this course.

42
00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.961
We're just using it because it's
the simplest way to get some API service

43
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.014
functions going.

44
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:20.540
We're not gonna be doing
anything Next.js-specific here.

45
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.100
It's gonna be strictly GraphQL.

46
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.564
Everything that I show you here
is 99% gonna be the same if

47
00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:28.764
you were using Node.js with
something like Express.

48
00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:31.648
Or even if you're using
something like Deno, or Bun,

49
00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:33.600
it's pretty much gonna be the same.

50
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.953
Next.js is just the quickest way to
spin up a server, that's why I chose it.

51
00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:39.501
So you don't need to know Next.js here,
you don't need to know React here.

52
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.731
We're not doing anything on the frontend,
it's all backend.

53
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:46.492
So if you know Node, you know how APIs
work, you've ever interacted with any

54
00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:50.022
type of database,
you're gonna do fine in this course.

55
00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:51.144
But yeah, here's the app.

56
00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:53.319
So you can do things like create an issue.

57
00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.707
So I can make an issue here.

58
00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.374
I am teaching a course today,
so I'm gonna make that.

59
00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.760
And I can click Create Issue,
and then it pops up here.

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.250
I can change the status of it,
I can refresh, I can get them all back.

61
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.291
There's also some authentication that's
involved here where you can sign in

62
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:08.803
and sign up.

63
00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:12.722
So we need to enable all of that by
creating a GraphQL experience on

64
00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:13.588
the backend.

65
00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:15.899
So that's what we're gonna be doing today.

66
00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.232
So if you go to the repo,
which is gonna be here on my GitHub,

67
00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:23.888
which is,
I'm gonna zoom in on that a little bit.

68
00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:27.970
It's /Hendrixer,
which is a play on my son's name,

69
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.896
whose name is Hendrix,
and /server-side-gql.

70
00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:38.084
So go there, fork that if you want, and
then clone it down into your computer.

71
00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.234
You'll notice in the read me here,
there's a link at the bottom, it says,

72
00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:41.883
Course Notes.

73
00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:44.630
These are the notes that we'll
be using to follow along.

74
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.030
If you ever take any of my courses,
you know the notes are mostly for

75
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.460
me because I go on tangents and
I start talking about random stuff.

76
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.384
So it's a way for me to stay on track and
reel myself in, but

77
00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:57.932
they're also a place for you to look
at the code that I'll be writing.

78
00:03:57.932 --> 00:04:03.653
So if you want to copy it and
stay ahead, you can use it.

79
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.421
One note on the course notes,

80
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:10.090
I'm actually gonna pull it up real quick,
is I wrote the course notes in Notion

81
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.722
cuz these days I pretty much live in
Notion 24/7, so I decided to do that.

82
00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:18.799
And you'll notice that there's gonna
be code here, these code examples.

83
00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.154
For the most part, you can copy and
paste this code, and it'll work just fine.

84
00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:24.391
But there are some
gotchas with some of it.

85
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:28.988
So for instance, with the GraphQL code
blocks, you'll notice when we get into it,

86
00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:31.474
we're gonna be writing
GraphQL in a string.

87
00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:34.905
And Notion puts hidden tab
characters in the string.

88
00:04:34.905 --> 00:04:38.371
And if you don't have your editor set up
to when you hit Save to automatically

89
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.618
format it and to get rid of the tabs and
replace it with spaces, those tab

90
00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:45.389
characters will get interpolated by
the GraphQL parser and you'll have errors.

91
00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.842
So basically what you can do is, if you're
copying from here, you just wanna be safe.

92
00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:53.443
Don't copy the GraphQL code from here, but

93
00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.618
that's fine because I'm gonna
have it on the GitHub repo.

94
00:04:55.618 --> 00:04:58.582
Everything's gonna be there,
I'm gonna be pushing things up as I teach.

95
00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:01.431
But to get the best experience,
just follow along.

96
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:04.941
Try to follow along, I won't be going
too fast, I'll stop if I need to.

97
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.461
But this is here, the repo will be there.

98
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:09.374
And then also I'll be
doing this from scratch.

99
00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:14.379
So you'll have three different ways
to kinda figure out what's going on,

100
00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:15.975
but just a note on that.

101
00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:20.615
The repo will be set up to have the right
configuration to fix that if you hit Save,

102
00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.223
but you have to enable
it on your editor side.

103
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:26.135
I think there's a prettier integration or
something like that.

104
00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:29.572
So just a quick note there.

105
00:05:29.572 --> 00:05:33.427
Other than that, we should dive
right in and kinda get to it.

106
00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:35.292
Let's get into some of
the prerequisites and

107
00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:38.397
the things you're gonna need on your
computer to actually do this course.

108
00:05:38.397 --> 00:05:40.264
Promise you, it's not extensive.

109
00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:43.320
If you've taken the client-side course,
it's exactly the same.

110
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.539
So if you've taken that course and
you went through that course and

111
00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.724
have everything downloaded and installed,

112
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:52.363
you won't actually need to do anything
here other than pull the repo down.

113
00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:54.269
So it should be fine here, but
I'm just gonna walk through it.

114
00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:55.743
Kinda talked about it already.

115
00:05:55.743 --> 00:05:57.918
You need to know JavaScript.

116
00:05:57.918 --> 00:05:59.233
We're doing this in JavaScript.

117
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.111
GraphQL is not specific to JavaScript.

118
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:05.444
It actually does not care what language
you decide to write your backend in,

119
00:06:05.444 --> 00:06:09.928
because there's so many ways you can
use GraphQL, as we'll talk about soon.

120
00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:12.294
But we're gonna be doing it in JavaScript.

121
00:06:12.294 --> 00:06:15.344
Technically, we were doing it in
TypeScript, but types are optional,

122
00:06:15.344 --> 00:06:16.546
you don't need to use them.

123
00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:20.464
You'll see in the code that I use types
sometimes, sometimes I don't use types.

124
00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:22.367
I don't have a good reason for
that [LAUGH] other than,

125
00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.202
sometimes I feel like it,
and sometimes I don't.

126
00:06:24.202 --> 00:06:25.974
I'm not consistent with it.

127
00:06:25.974 --> 00:06:30.392
But these days, I kinda just use AI for
types cuz it's just so

128
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:32.397
much better at it than I am.

129
00:06:32.397 --> 00:06:34.658
You need to understand APIs,
talked a little bit about that.

130
00:06:34.658 --> 00:06:38.400
So if you've ever built an API before,
whether it's in Node or

131
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.518
some other language,
that's really all you need.

132
00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:45.213
Maybe you've never built one, but you
kinda know how they work because you've

133
00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:47.927
interacted with them in so
many ways, that's also fine.

134
00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.736
And then a little bit about databases.

135
00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:54.501
You won't be designing database
schemas and things like that.

136
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:59.027
But we will be using a database ORM,
specifically Drizzle,

137
00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:01.792
to interact with a SQLite database.

138
00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:04.889
So if you've never done a database
query before in your life,

139
00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.864
that might be a little uncomfortable.

140
00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:07.546
But then again,

141
00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:10.233
the whole point of the course is
not to teach you about databases.

142
00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.341
So you can just follow along with that
part and just trust that it works.

143
00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.698
But having some familiarity with
a database and how it works and

144
00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:19.672
how you query it is gonna be helpful.

145
00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:23.072
But by no means do you need to be a
database expert to take advantage of this.

146
00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:27.985
I decided to use a database versus some
in-memory data to give you a real-world

147
00:07:27.985 --> 00:07:31.376
example of what it would be
like to build a GraphQL API.

148
00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:32.997
So I kinda opted into that.

149
00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:34.427
As far as the format goes,

150
00:07:34.427 --> 00:07:38.463
it's kinda how I always do, it's going
to be me talking about a concept.

151
00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:40.762
I'm gonna try to talk as
little as possible about it,

152
00:07:40.762 --> 00:07:43.075
cuz I just really like to just
get in there and show it.

153
00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:47.400
I think demoing something is a lot easier
to grok than someone just sitting up here

154
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.427
talking about it.

155
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:50.877
So I'll talk as little as I
can about some concept, but

156
00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:53.874
eventually I'll just dive right
into it and start practicing it.

157
00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.776
And then what we'll do eventually is,
once we build up some of that context,

158
00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:01.137
we'll apply those things that I
taught into the application that I

159
00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:04.279
just showed you to enable that
application and get it to work.

160
00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:08.559
So it'll just be like that flow for
the most part.

161
00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:13.215
And then by the end of the course, once we
go through all of that, I'm pretty much

162
00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:17.894
covering, I would say, more than 80% of
what it takes to build a GraphQL API.

163
00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:22.786
The last 20% is probably gonna be some
techniques you would do in production

164
00:08:22.786 --> 00:08:25.762
as far as performance and
things like caching.

165
00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:27.273
And most of this is more of the same.

166
00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.937
So that's a little more advanced and
I just don't have time for

167
00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:30.849
that in this course.

168
00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:33.824
But 80% of what you'll do in GraphQL
will be covered in this course.

169
00:08:33.824 --> 00:08:34.761
So by the end of it,

170
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:38.185
you should feel pretty comfortable
to go build your own GraphQL API.
