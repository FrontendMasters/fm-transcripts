00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.571
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now as far as setup goes,
fork the repo, pull it down.

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:08.948
Once you have it, also make sure
you have at least Node version 20.

3
00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:10.216
I built this on 20.

4
00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:12.637
I think this works with 18,
just can't confirm.

5
00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:16.109
If somebody's using 18,
please give it a try, let me know.

6
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.422
This should also work, if you prefer bun,

7
00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.132
this should work in the latest
version of bun too.

8
00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:24.172
I actually prefer bun over note,
I use it for everything.

9
00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.365
I tested it with bun, it does work, but

10
00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:30.038
I'm gonna use NPM here since
that's just more widely accepted.

11
00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:34.757
And I highly recommend you also use
NPM as far as installing the modules.

12
00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.625
And that's because I have a package
lock in the root to resolve all

13
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.252
the dependency versions.

14
00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:43.445
So to make sure that this course
continues to work into the future and

15
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.210
doesn't download breaking change in
modules, you should use NPM to install.

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.253
If you use bun or yarn, it's gonna create
a different lock for those installers and

17
00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:55.298
which will have different versions, which
then you won't have the same version of

18
00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:57.761
what I have at the time of
what I taught the course.

19
00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:00.155
And I can't guarantee
that things will work.

20
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.377
So highly recommend using NPM to install.

21
00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:05.792
As far as the database goes, we're
gonna be using something called Turso.

22
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:11.261
If you've never heard of Turso,
it is a hosted SQL lite database.

23
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:15.720
So we don't have to install any database
or run any database on our machine,

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.541
it's all taken care of for us.

25
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.446
All we have to do is go
create a free Turso account.

26
00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:25.121
I decided to use Turso because
it's quite simple to get started.

27
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.765
It's free, you can make as
many databases as you will.

28
00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:32.182
I think you get 500 on a free plan,
which is more than enough you need for

29
00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:33.045
this course.

30
00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:37.236
And for the tooling that I use, which
is like drizzle, there's great support.

31
00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:37.995
It's super fast.

32
00:01:37.995 --> 00:01:39.912
So it's just a good alternative.

33
00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:44.917
In the past, I've used different databases
that I thought were really good and

34
00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:50.157
I use them in production, but then they'll
go and knock off the free, yes, Mark?

35
00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:55.080
If we have the DB setup from
the client side Graph QL course,

36
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.958
do we need a fresh one?

37
00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:57.480
Great question.
So

38
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.326
if you've taken a client
side Graph QL course,

39
00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:00.765
you don't need to do anything here.

40
00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.432
You can use the same database.

41
00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.687
The only thing you would have to, and
I'll get to that in a second, the specific

42
00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:09.149
thing you would have to do, but yeah, you
don't have to set up a database right now.

43
00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.969
If you've already have a Turso account,
whether it's from the client side course,

44
00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.099
or you just already have a Turso
account and you already have all that,

45
00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.814
you don't need to go make an account.

46
00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.875
But if you don't have an account,
please go make an account.

47
00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:22.294
It's free, you can sign up,
takes two seconds.

48
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:27.833
Once you do that, on the Turso dashboard,
I'm gonna go there right quick.

49
00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.852
So I'm going to my dashboard.

50
00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:34.103
Eventually, once you sign up,
you'll land here on the dashboard.

51
00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:39.134
And if you go and click on Databases,
you can find your database.

52
00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:40.610
Mine is called Parallel.

53
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.635
And then here you'll see a URL.

54
00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:45.269
So take note of this,
you're gonna need this URL.

55
00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.806
And then if you click this button,
Generate Token, make sure it's read,

56
00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:50.319
right?

57
00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.599
Click Generate Token, that's gonna
generate a JSON web token for you so

58
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.556
you can authenticate with your database.

59
00:02:55.556 --> 00:03:01.568
Keep note of that, you're gonna need
those two for the next step And

60
00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:06.611
then for the next step,
you need to create a .env

61
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:12.034
file on the root of your fold or
the root of your repo.

62
00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:13.465
If you don't know what that is,

63
00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:16.171
a .env file is a file that
doesn't get checked into GitHub.

64
00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:20.732
It's where you can store secret variables
into your application that can be

65
00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:25.434
changed dynamically without having to
redeploy, without having to, well,

66
00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:30.227
sometimes it will redeploy, well,
without having to push new code to GitHub.

67
00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:34.259
This is a great way to change things out
that change depending on what environment

68
00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.920
you're in.

69
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.974
So in development,
maybe you have this database,

70
00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.244
but a staging you have this database,
production, you have another database.

71
00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:41.527
It's a great way to do that.

72
00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:46.255
And also you don't wanna store secret
things as plain text in your repo cuz

73
00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:47.940
that's a security risk.

74
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.623
So that's what a .env is for.

75
00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:52.923
That's why it's not in your repo right
now because it's not checked into GitHub.

76
00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:54.959
So make that file.

77
00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.291
And then like I said,
grab that URL, grab that token, and

78
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:01.425
then you wanna make these
two variables in your .env.

79
00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:05.486
So you have Turso_Connection_URL,
set it equal to that database URL, and

80
00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:07.431
then you have Turso_Auth_Token.

81
00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:10.936
So if you already have a Turso
database from the client side,

82
00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:15.470
of course, or from anywhere else, this
is the thing that you would need to do,

83
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.939
just create your .env file just like you
did with the client side course, and

84
00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.893
add in these two variables here.

85
00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:26.316
So you can probably just copy and paste
from that repo if you still have it, but

86
00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:27.759
feel free to do it again.

87
00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.521
That's really all you would have to do.

88
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.218
If you do make a new database and

89
00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:36.853
you're not using the existing one that we
did on the client side course, so this is,

90
00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:41.358
again, your first time or you made a new
database, the last thing you would need to

91
00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:44.204
do is push up our database
schema to that database.

92
00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:48.268
So I have a command in
a package JSON called db:push.

93
00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:51.959
You can run that command
by doing npm run db:push.

94
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:57.284
That's gonna push your schema up to
the database that you put in this file.

95
00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:58.858
That is necessary.

96
00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:01.782
Again, if you already have
the database from the client side,

97
00:05:01.782 --> 00:05:02.786
this is done for you.

98
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:06.101
You don't need to push it, it's the exact
same schema, nothing's changed.

99
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:08.490
If you just made a new Turso database,

100
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.935
you have to run this push
command to push the schema up.

101
00:05:11.935 --> 00:05:16.364
So I'll show you what that looks like so
you know when it's done.

102
00:05:16.364 --> 00:05:20.451
So if I go here and I say npm run db:push,

103
00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:24.668
mine already has it, so yours might not.

104
00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:28.012
You might not get the same output that I
currently have right now because I already

105
00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:29.106
have the schema on there.

106
00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:33.228
But regardless, if you do,
it'll ask you no or yes.

107
00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:35.921
Just say yes,
you wanna execute all these statements.

108
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:41.213
And then you know it push when at
the end it says changes applied.

109
00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:44.540
So once you there, database is good,
it's configured, it's ready to go.

110
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.928
We never have to worry
about the database again.
