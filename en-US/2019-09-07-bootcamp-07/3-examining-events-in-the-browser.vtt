00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's actually
just say console.log(event) just

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.390
to take a look at that.

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.330
Where is?

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.816
So here, I'm just gonna open my

5
00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:19.520
desktop, calc, index.html.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.167
I open my console here.

7
00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.397
They put five so
you can see here it's a click event, and

8
00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:29.510
it has just a bunch of stuff on it.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.120
Hold keys, cancel bolt,
like you can, where the mouse is at,

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.120
do they hold the control
key when they clicked it?

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.240
Other stuff that I just never cared about.

12
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.950
Timestamp, when it actually happened.

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.650
All sorts of stuff.

14
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you have to tell it when
I click call this function, that'll take

15
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.100
in something that I called event but that
event will automatically be that stuff.

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep,
the browser will always give you that.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.509
You can depend on the browser,
it'll always give you that.

18
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.627
So to even drive that for further,

19
00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:10.570
let's take this one out of here and
go back up to button click,

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.718
I'm gonna put console.logvalue
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And refresh,

21
00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:21.690
so notice that now it's actually giving
me the correct number that I clicked.

22
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.096
including this crazy intercode things.
