00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we have buffer.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.360
Buffer is going to be correct in terms
of number at this point, but we haven't

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.400
actually displayed it on the screen yet,
so we have this lurking variable out here.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.765
In fact,
let's just console log after this,

5
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:20.909
console.log('buffer', buffer)
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

6
00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.159
now I have to come over here and

7
00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.970
refresh on this one 2, 5, 3, 1, 7, 0.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.120
That's right, right?

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.830
That looks correct.

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.960
That's exactly what we want
numbers to look like, but

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.390
it's not appearing up here,
cuz we haven't put it there.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.140
Again, the computer is only
gonna do what you tell it to do.

13
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
So now after every single time that
someone types or clicks something,

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.190
we have to go in there and actually go and
write that out to the screen.

15
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.822
So make sense?

16
00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:57.668
So how are we gonna do that?

17
00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:01.898
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna say document,
or actually we have it up here,

18
00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:03.701
screen, right there.

19
00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:12.536
Screen.innerText = buffer.

20
00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.796
Now, hopefully,
is it working for most of you?

21
00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:37.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
your best friend's gonna be the console.

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.215
If you're not seeing,
you should check out the console and

23
00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:46.181
see if you have some sort of syntax error
or type error or something like that.

24
00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:49.849
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do this.

25
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.887
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just kind of
briefly run over the code that we wrote

26
00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:23.367
here, so here we're keeping track of
what's on the screen on the buffer.

27
00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:24.799
The running total is actually the number.

28
00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.515
We're not using running total yet.

29
00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:30.000
We're just using buffer, and
then I hear I grab screen so

30
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.080
I can keep writing to screen
continuing on line five.

31
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.076
Okay, let's go down look at a init.

32
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.955
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're doing it like I
am and doing the init function mixture on

33
00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:44.838
line 35 there that you are actually
calling init, if I just defined init and

34
00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:48.145
don't call it it's just a function
that never gets run, right?

35
00:02:52.328 --> 00:02:54.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you don't like
that you can also just not make this

36
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.380
a function at all.

37
00:02:57.153 --> 00:02:57.976
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

38
00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:01.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops.

39
00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And do that, right.

40
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.530
This works just as well.

41
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:14.458
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You said before that
the init function just gets run once, and

42
00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:17.600
init is like a special
function name right?

43
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not.

44
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.102
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's just

45
00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:20.110
a function here.

46
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.920
That's why you have to call it or
else it never gets run.

47
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.610
To me it's just like self-documenting that
this is what some people actually run at

48
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.914
the beginning of the program.

49
00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:35.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it's saying on my
program that value isn't defined.

50
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:38.989
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can I see that code?

51
00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so it's probably
this one up here, value on button click,

52
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.118
which means that you're probably not
passing it in the event listener.

53
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.974
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if I go down here to the event listener,

54
00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:56.382
I call buttonClick right here
with event.target.Entertext.

55
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At line 31 there.
