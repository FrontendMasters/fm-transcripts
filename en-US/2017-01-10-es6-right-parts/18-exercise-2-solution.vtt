00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:07.780
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
let's talk about solution for Exercise 2.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.336
We have the a1 and the a2 arrays.

4
00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:14.140
If we wanna pass those in,
we can just spread out a1 and a2.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.206
And then we have the foo function,
which we want to define.

6
00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:22.960
We want it to return something, but

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.450
we're gonna declare the parameters in
such a way that it does the work for us.

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.380
So we basically want to account for,

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.010
we wanna keep the first one, but
then we've got two that we don't.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.810
We don't care about the value,
4, or the value, 6.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.850
So essentially, those are ones
that we're gonna throw away.

12
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.480
So we can name them y and z, or
we could name them something else that

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.590
indicates that we're going to ignore them,
right?

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.270
We could call them ignored one and
ignored two if we wanted to.

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.160
But then everything else we do care about.

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.370
So we can say ...rest, or args,
or whatever you wanna call it.

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000
So now we have an x value,
and we have the rest value.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.810
And we wanna put those two together.

19
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.214
So we can say return, make ourselves an
array that includes x and everything else.

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.454
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now the foo name here
can throw people off because what would

21
00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:21.680
foo be?

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.350
You'd give foo some sort
of a name that made sense.

23
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.600
For example, if the whole purpose of this
function is to ignore the second and

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.950
third arguments, then you might call this
thing ignore23 or something like that.

25
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.860
You'd give it some sort of reasonable
name that described what it was doing.

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.220
And now this would be a utility.

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.290
And ostensibly, this would be something
that you were doing on a regular basis.

28
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
So now you can use this facility
to pass in a set of values.

29
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.500
And have it ignore just the 2 and
the 3 and keep everything else, right?

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.360
So don't get too tripped up when
you see tricks like this, and

31
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.470
you see me only using foo and bar.

32
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.250
Think about it in terms of how would I
use that kind of facility in my own code?

33
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.272
What would I call that utility,
that sort of thing?
