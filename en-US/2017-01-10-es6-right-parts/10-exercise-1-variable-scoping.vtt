&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
open up exercise one.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.904
You'll notice that I've created some
functions here, and I've created some for

4
00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:12.896
loops and stuff.

5
00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:14.278
And here's our test case at the bottom.

6
00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:19.383
It needs to assert true, which is the case
that the x value of 2 multiplied by 2.

7
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:24.183
So we're saying that 4 needs
to be the same thing that's

8
00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:29.610
returned if I call the function
in this fns array at position 4.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.395
So in other words,
I'm gonna loop over from 0 up to 5,

10
00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:38.270
not including, and
I'm gonna add functions to an fns array.

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.969
Each one of those functions needs
to close over some variable such

12
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.683
that when the function is called,
it returns that value, okay?

13
00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:50.295
So looking at your IIFE here,
looking at your var statements,

14
00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:55.090
figure out which ones of these
should be made into lets and conts.

15
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.609
And re-factor this code and set yourself
up correctly with your closure.

16
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.119
Should only take a few lines of code.

17
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.560
So we'll just take a three-minute break,
and then we'll talk about the solution.
