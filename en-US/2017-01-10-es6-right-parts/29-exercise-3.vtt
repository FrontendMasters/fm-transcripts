00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.108
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's go ahead and
open up Exercise 3.

3
00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:07.862
We sort of have almost the same thing,

4
00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:10.960
except in this case there's a little
bit of foo barring going on.

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.340
But we have almost
the same thing going on.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.430
So let me orient you,

7
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.690
what we have is a check function
that's gonna pass in an object.

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.350
But that response function
is receiving an object.

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.830
Okay, so stick with me.

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.370
What you want is you want right here.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.650
You want to do some object destructuring.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.947
And right here,
you want to do some object restructuring,

13
00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.711
exactly like I just did for you before.
