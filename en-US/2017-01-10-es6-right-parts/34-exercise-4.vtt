&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right,
let's go ahead and open up exercise 4.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.770
Exercise 4 gives you this silly
example and you need to write

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.764
a tag function that uppercase is only
the values not the strings, okay?

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.270
So you're going to need to modify
line 8 to use the tag function.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.070
Put in your interpolated
expressions appropriately in those

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.130
places where the underscores are.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.190
And then write your upper function to do
the looping just the exactly the same way

9
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.710
I just showed you.
