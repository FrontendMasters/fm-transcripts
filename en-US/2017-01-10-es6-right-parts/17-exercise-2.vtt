2
00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.840
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I think that's
good on our gather and spread.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.700
So let's open up exercise two.

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.718
And this is we will finish exercise
two and then take our lunch break.

5
00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:20.610
Okay so go ahead and

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.070
open it up and I'll orient you to
exercise two and then give you.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.390
Will take like five
minutes on exercise two,

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.570
four minutes, it's a short exercise, okay?

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.360
Same kind of thing that I was just talking
about before the kinds of tricks that we

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.580
can play with spreads, and
gathers, and with parameters.

11
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.170
The spirit of this exercise is
that when I call the bar function,

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920
which is giving me back
whatever comes back from foo,

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.990
that's gonna give me an array that, if I
join those together, comes to this string.

14
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.350
In other words, I'm expecting an array
back with the values 2, 8, 10 and

15
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.410
12 in it.

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.020
And the starting values that I have
to play with, are these two arrays.

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.480
So in some way shape or form.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.304
I want to transport those values into foo,
and in some way shape or form,

19
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.942
I want to declare foo and
return something from foo that

20
00:01:13.942 --> 00:01:18.552
ends up resulting in an array that has 2,
8, 10, and 12 in it.

21
00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:22.834
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So using the same
sort of stuff with gathers and

22
00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.970
spreads that we just talked about.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.840
See if you can declare that code.
