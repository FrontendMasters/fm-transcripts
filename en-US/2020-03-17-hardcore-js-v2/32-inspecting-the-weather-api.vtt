1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.622
Had in mind, we're gonna build
this weather app, that's all.

2
00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:08.020
Cool so our starting point,
we have an API key.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.940
I don't want to show it to you.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.900
If I do, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.340
They're gonna delete it anyway,
it's not a big deal.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.580
But the point is, we have an API
key to do weather app stuff.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.900
You can go to open weather as open
weather API, and get your own.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.100
We're just going to do this
together have some fun.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.510
Let's see the index HTML is
just this it has an input for

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.140
zip code, a button that says go and
ul, that's results.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.090
And I don't wanna so

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.770
all I know is that we're going to have
some data and we can play with that data.

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.010
I don't really have a direction for this.

14
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.950
But I will say I don't want
to use the view library.

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.739
So keep that in mind.

16
00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.130
[LAUGH] I don't want to slap on
the prereqs that you have to know react to

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.660
because just for this, right?

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.250
Or view or Angular or whatever else.

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.480
So let's keep it sane.

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.579
Keep it clean all right.

21
00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.590
So we're gonna do.

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.280
I also have this little thing,
the API call that gets us our data cool.

23
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.540
So it takes a zip code and
my API key and we'll return some stuff.

24
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.120
So why don't we start there.

25
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.430
We'll build some stuff around it.

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.500
And I think, what I wanted to show
is you put in your zip code, right.

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.120
And we'll put some weather down here and

28
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.070
then we'll just keep on building
until we're out of time.

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.280
You know, we'll do this together,
have some ideas.

30
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
All right, so I know right off
the bat that I can fetch this

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.172
because I did this last night at my hotel.

32
00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:49.027
[LAUGH] and I can call was event
because it's a promise and

33
00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:54.130
we get this result and results .Jason.

34
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.500
And let's go ahead and
then console dot log.

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.523
What do we have?

36
00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:05.391
Perfect cool.

37
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:10.443
404 cities city not found,
right we have to fill in the zip.

38
00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:12.230
Anybody have a zip code?

39
00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:15.480
&gt;&gt; For this one.

40
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.254
&gt;&gt; Cool.

41
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.850
Hey, Minneapolis.

42
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.152
Let's see what the weather is.

43
00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:24.840
Okay.

44
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.418
[LAUGH] So, for this, all right so

45
00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:34.324
It looks like we have some stuff here

46
00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:38.748
that looks like this is count y.

47
00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:40.922
Looks like there's 40 yep, 40 in the list.

48
00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:41.903
That's good.

49
00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:42.403
Good to know.

50
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.850
We have if you're into fish [LAUGH] so
its 200, I guess that's the code.

51
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.070
They're very,
very into lining these two up.

52
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.309
I betcha It was like city list.

53
00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:03.182
Anyway, you ever work with someone
like that they like just hammer

54
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.455
on the name until they line up.

55
00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:09.970
Okay, so
we have DT I'm assuming date time.

56
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.960
Looks like a timestamp.

57
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.405
In the list we have clouds.

58
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:20.457
All the clouds 21 and daytime again,

59
00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:25.202
no this is the same daytime it's just

60
00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:30.113
fold it out okay and DT text of course.

61
00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:31.015
We got mean,

62
00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:36.790
weather it's in weather it's more stuff
well it's a nice little description.

63
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.516
That's cool.
We might wanna use some of this.

64
00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:44.981
Main has a ground level humidity pressure,

65
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:51.932
temp in key f full disclosure,
I know that's a Calvin.

66
00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:55.110
And we got a 10 maxmin.

67
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.760
Our temp, this is the Kelvin.

68
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.390
I don't know what the Kf is.

69
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.170
This is the Kelvin.

70
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.591
These are kelvins.

71
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.531
So the first thing we have to do,
in my mind would be,

72
00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:09.847
figure out what app
we're going to build but

73
00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:15.042
the actual I envision tell me if you
agree is that we would look through

74
00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:20.060
the lists get the temperatures out
turn the kelvins into Celsius or

75
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.580
Fahrenheit and
then maybe group them by date.

76
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.810
Because I think a lot of
these dates are the same.

77
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.758
So these are different
times of the same day.

78
00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:35.376
So, you might want to like
a normal weather app would

79
00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:39.540
show like your times across the day and
each row or something in a table.

80
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.080
Don't want to get to UI heavy
because we don't use a UI framework.

81
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.100
So let's just start by digging in here.

82
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.464
So this is impure come on.

83
00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:52.550
All right, so let's fix that.

84
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.440
And, I'm just going to wire this up.

85
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.470
When I hit the Go button,
I'm just going to give it this so

86
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.010
don't have to type that
in every single time.

87
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.570
But I don't want to like make
it not look like it's working.

88
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.420
So let's give it a value.

89
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.517
There we go.

90
00:05:11.517 --> 00:05:13.264
And boom.
