Any last questions on compose
before I make you compose?

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.617
&gt;&gt; I know one struggle I've had with
compose is sometimes I need to insert some

3
00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:11.370
console logs to kind of
figure out what I'm doing.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.643
&gt;&gt; Check it out.
&gt;&gt; You know a go a way of doing that.

5
00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:18.769
&gt;&gt; So, you could say,
I like to do a tag in x and

6
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.899
then console.log the tag the x and

7
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.469
cheat and [LAUGH] return the x.

8
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:34.990
So, if I log right here, what's going to
happen is oops, I didn't give it a tag.

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.100
[LAUGH] Should probably I wrote
this in manual curried form.

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.020
I could curry it like that and
get rid of that.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.640
Cool.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.190
But if I log like here, so
what's gonna happen is, sorry.

13
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.230
Again, not helpful editors,
editor writers.

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.542
So to log it in the middle of my pipeline.

15
00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:08.820
And then return it back, yeah,
it's a very useful thing,

16
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.671
very side effecty, but fine for

17
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.846
debugging I'm not too strict on that,
and so you can log,

18
00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:21.622
everywhere you can do log start and
then we get there.

19
00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:30.490
And we can even kind of do an inline
little console.log and return an x here.

20
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.221
But that's not it's not very helpful.

21
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.500
[LAUGH] So.

22
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.690
Yeah, I don't know how that works.

23
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.175
Doesn't matter the point is use the log.

24
00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:47.350
But yeah, so that was a great question
that happens all the time and

25
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.900
it's very useful to know going in.
