1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
Let's go ahead and just make a fetch.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.821
Start off by saying getJSON, how's that?

3
00:00:03.821 --> 00:00:09.499
When we getJSON,
that takes in a url, preferably.

4
00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:15.650
And we'll just grab this fetch API,
or let's do the getJSON part of it.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.710
We could make two functions,
as typically advised, right?

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.230
It would give you a fetch function,
which is a Task, and

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.310
then we would map over
the Task at the JSON.

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.548
Okay, we'll do that.

9
00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.080
[LAUGH] All right.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.870
So let's do that.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.930
Hide all this stuff.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.479
So we're gonna do getJSON, or
we'll just do fetchIt [LAUGH].

13
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.954
All right, takes a url.

14
00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:51.121
And let's bring in Task from our types.

15
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.060
For your convenience I've added types.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.553
No, I haven't,
done better while they're doing it?

17
00:00:56.553 --> 00:00:57.370
Yeah, there it is.

18
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.650
So, let's start by fetching it.

19
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.690
And so, here's what I'm gonna do.

20
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.647
I'm gonna get rid of this stuff.

21
00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.965
We're gonna start by separating
our effects, our effects folder,

22
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:12.613
we're gonna write a boundary,
this is our colors stuff,

23
00:01:12.613 --> 00:01:15.231
and everything above it is gonna be pure.

24
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:20.005
So, fetchIt needs to be in a task,
cuz it's above the line.

25
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:25.439
Write address to be established where

26
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.053
we can run effects and where we can't.

27
00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:34.240
And here we can do, then.

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.395
Or no, this is just, yeah,
then(res), catch(res).

29
00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.800
Wow, what is going on?

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.110
There we go.

31
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.670
It was like, Task, hey, it's a Task,

32
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.997
I know it's a Task,
I'm gonna tell you better [LAUGH].

33
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.784
Sorry, I'm still learning this from them,
it's been a hard road.

34
00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:55.150
And this is not, this is no longer,
it's just a url.

35
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.892
Cool.

36
00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:59.147
So let's try out our new function,
fetchIt with their url.

37
00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:01.840
And why don't we make
this into a pure thing?

38
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.100
Here you make url, or
getURL, open weather.

39
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.980
GetOpenWeather, that's nice.

40
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.390
All right.

41
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.160
So it takes the url, or takes a zip.

42
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.770
And, the API key, static, never changes.

43
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.185
We can pass it in, and
we can find out clever ways to do that.

44
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.210
I'm just gonna leave it alone,
I still consider this pure.

45
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.862
So let's go down here.

46
00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:37.190
We'll call fetchIt with the
getOpenWeather, and we'll give it our zip.

47
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.190
So where's the zip coming from?

48
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.060
Well, the zip comes from this thing.

49
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.673
So I hit Go.

50
00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:48.890
So let's just, we're below the line,
so let's make a little app here.

51
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.330
And this is where all the dirty,
nasty stuff is gonna happen.

52
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.550
So we're gonna go ahead and,
get our buttons.

53
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.410
Let's see, just bring in a document, you
can pass a document in here if you want.

54
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.570
I don't care, I mean, whatever length.

55
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.185
GetElementById, and we've got a Go button,
that's out goButton.

56
00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:18.299
And then we have input, which is a zip.

57
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.120
And then we have our results,
just results.

58
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.017
And then we'll add our event listener down
here on the goButton, goButton, getButton,

59
00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:36.210
goButton, addEventListener, and
we'll go ahead and say, click.

60
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.596
And when we click it,
we don't care about the e there,

61
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.242
we'll just say input.value.trial, Maybe?

62
00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:49.010
That'll be our zipCode.

63
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.830
And then we'll have
the zipCode too fetchIt.

64
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.585
Get the open weather API with the zipCode.

65
00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:00.160
And then we're gonna fork it.

66
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.900
Console.error, console.log, cool.

67
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.260
Now, stop me if you have questions or
qualms.

68
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.730
But, what I'm doing is, saying,
listen, we're gonna build a nice app.

69
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.820
And look, I'm already doing two
things right here, in the trim.

70
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.901
I can push all of this above the line.

71
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:24.470
We wanna push as much
above the line as we can.

72
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.832
So why don't we do, how about this?

73
00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:33.830
A little open weather type.

74
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.833
And this little module, we can bring
this new file or not, depending,

75
00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:41.530
whatever we want, and
we'll be like getWeather, how's that?

76
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.650
Now we getOpenWeather.

77
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.073
Just the same function,
just takes the zip.

78
00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:48.876
But how aobut, it'd be the composition.

79
00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:52.685
Compose, makeUrl.

80
00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.226
What.

81
00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:57.550
No, this is getOpenWeather,
that's the url.

82
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.843
That's a terrible name.

83
00:04:58.843 --> 00:05:03.313
[LAUGH] makeWeatherUrl.

84
00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:10.043
All right, makeWeatherUrl, and
then we'll compose that with fetchIt.

85
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.143
Cool.

86
00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:17.256
So this is a function that returns a Task,
it takes a zip, and then it makes a Task.

87
00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:20.274
And it's a nice, little open weather API.

88
00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:21.473
So let's do that.

89
00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:26.714
I think I need to bring
in compose from Ramda.

90
00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:32.654
Finally down here we'll get
rid of this silly stuff,

91
00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:37.410
and we'll do openWeather.getWeather.

92
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.036
It's bad names, is there anyone
who has a better name than that?

93
00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.851
It's like, openWeather and
getWeather's a silly thing.

94
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:43.293
But, let's see what happens-.

95
00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:44.349
&gt;&gt; With fecth.

96
00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.135
&gt;&gt; What is it, getFecth?

97
00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:47.207
&gt;&gt; Or just fetch.

98
00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:48.499
&gt;&gt; Yeah, fetchWeather?

99
00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.200
Response, course, redirected,
false, headers, body.

100
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.650
I did not call JSON on it.

101
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.310
So, sorry, Mark, was it fetchWeather?

102
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.481
&gt;&gt; Or just fetch.

103
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.190
&gt;&gt; Fetch, openWeather.fetch, I like it.

104
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.810
Fetch, fetchIt.

105
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.750
Cool.

106
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.217
So, we've got that.

107
00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:13.973
Sorry, this is kind of.

108
00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:16.458
I don't have the most screen real
estate right here, actually,

109
00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.070
this is all nonsense,
we don't care about this stuff.

110
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.678
Whoa, what did I just do?

111
00:06:21.678 --> 00:06:23.110
I made a new thing.

112
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.790
Okay, cool.

113
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.990
Here's a little bit more,
a bit more for everyone to see.
