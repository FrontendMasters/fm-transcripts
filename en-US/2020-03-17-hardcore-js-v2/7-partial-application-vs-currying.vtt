00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
The other thing is, I should mention
there's a slight difference between what

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.890
we call a partial application, which is
giving a function some of its arguments

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.680
versus a curried function which
expects one argument at a time.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.820
And those lines kind of blur.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.096
So in a way they're kind of dual
of each other, where I say filter,

6
00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:24.820
I've defined as a curried function
that will take one argument at a time.

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.160
If I never defined it up
front as a curried function,

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.630
there's a way to call filter inline
with this thing called partial.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.700
And then you can give it some of its
arguments and it'll kind of allow you to

10
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.900
call uncurried functions at the time
with a partial application.

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.920
We're not gonna get too
into the details of that.

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.824
We're just gonna stick with
currying through and through.

13
00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:50.930
But partial application
has the same effect.

14
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.370
It's just the different,
it's at the caller not the definition.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.890
Okay, I'm throwing a lot at you right now.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.910
As we go through the class, you'll be
using currying a little bit more and

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.450
you'll get more comfortable with it.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.310
I'm not gonna talk about
partial application or

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.530
flip or pairs or isomorphism.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.590
So I just wanted to kind of lead
up to why this is mathematical and

21
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.820
why it's practical.

22
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.520
And hopefully you can
gather why it's practical

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.450
with things like these functions.

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.640
So this is the code pen.

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.240
Let me know if you have
any issues getting to it.
