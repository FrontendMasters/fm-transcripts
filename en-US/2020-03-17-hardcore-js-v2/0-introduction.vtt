00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.770
Welcome to the hardcore Functional
Programming class in JavaScript.

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.830
Today we're gonna learn how to do point
free programming with currying and

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.060
composition.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.710
And then we're gonna move into more
.syntax using functors and monads.

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.790
And we'll end up the class by just
playing around building an app.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.070
So I'd like to thank Joe Nelson who
contributed a couple slides to this class,

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.090
and I'd like to say,

8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.620
a lot of this stuff today is going to be,
kind of the ground work for a follow up

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.220
class called Functional Architecture that
will be a lot more application building.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.920
Today's a lot of definitions but

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.600
you need it all to be able to build
pure functional applications.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.203
So if you already know Ramda
you might wanna skip ahead but

13
00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:48.568
this is the course for the type of
people who know map, filter, reduce and

14
00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:51.790
want to just learn all there is to
know about functional programming.
