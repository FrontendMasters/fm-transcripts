00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.980
Before we go into the next example,
we've got fromNullable.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.290
Very helpful utility.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.050
So we'll say I take some value x and if x
is not equal to null, I'll go ahead and

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.530
return a right of the x,
rather return to the left of nothing.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.700
And then we can take this big nasty,

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.674
I don't like to use curly braces and
return if you've noticed.

7
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:33.093
So we can actually just call
fromNullable on this thing.

8
00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:35.948
I know this is,

9
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:41.020
bear with me and, whoops.

10
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.407
And so what's happening here
is it's basically saying,

11
00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:48.870
if you can, it's a little squished.

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.729
But the idea is that fromNullable
captures, hey, if whatever's in

13
00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.735
here is null just return it a right or
a left based on if it's null or not.

14
00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:01.173
That way I don't have to keep writing,
assigning variables and

15
00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:02.661
then checking that.

16
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.449
I have one definitive null check that I
can return you if my function ever returns

17
00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:11.952
null I'll do it in the function, so
then my function becomes much safer for

18
00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:13.900
every caller of that function.

19
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.720
Cool, so we have that.

20
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.000
And now let's blow that away.

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.130
Did anybody see that a little longer?

22
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.160
I wanna take that away,
you'll see it, pretty good.

23
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.030
You don't have to implement these.

24
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.420
Either box all this stuff is there's
libraries out there for you and

25
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.210
they're functional programming
Monad libraries out there.

26
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.010
There's predefined a lot of these types.
