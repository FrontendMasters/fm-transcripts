00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.550
We're gonna do here is,
is we're gonna switch this map to a chain,

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.840
and we're gonna return
another Either in here.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.070
So that's the flag.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.710
If we didn't do map here,
we're gonna put in another tryCatch.

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.395
Hey, let's make a little parser
that does the same thing.

6
00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:23.820
parseJSON, I wanna give you the contents,
and we'll make a little

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.250
parseJSON helper, contents and
does the exact same thing as that.

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.731
It just JSON.parse(contents)
in the middle.

9
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.627
Looks like this is a template for
a function I can extract, and

10
00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.145
just parsing the function but.

11
00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:43.970
There we go.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.545
What do I do wrong?

13
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:49.730
[LAUGH] So parseJason(contents),
did something wrong.

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.386
Jason.parse(contents).

15
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.150
That's right.

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.980
Because we didn't call this chain.

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.450
And chain is not a function.

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.110
I didn't define chain on these.

19
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.274
Alright, let's do that.
That'd be fun.

20
00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:07.184
But, let me just point out
that if I didn't fold this,

21
00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:11.350
what's happening here
is this isn't config.

22
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.590
This is another either of config.

23
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
And so if we just return that right
then in there, let's get rid of this.

24
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.930
We get a right holding a right.

25
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.840
Because what we've done, is right here,
that returned us a right of some contents.

26
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.800
Then we mapped over that.

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.779
We took those contents, parsed it.

28
00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:37.020
And now you've got to a right, and
then parseJSON returned to right.

29
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.960
So now we have a Right(Right)
of the actual parse contents.

30
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.900
That is the,
that's like the fundamental thing here.

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.480
I just want you all to like
really understand that,

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.930
that readFileSync returned
us a right of the stuff.

33
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.870
Since we mapped,
we just pass this in here.

34
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.800
Then we parse the JSON,

35
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.540
and we ended up with a Right(Right)
because we finished the map.

36
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.780
So we went back here, and
just put this function inside of it.

37
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.940
So, by calling chain here,
we will fix this problem.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.600
So, let's go back to the actual
thing there, and define chain.

39
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200
Let's find it for Left and Right.

40
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.261
So left chain is awesome.

41
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.005
It's just like, thank you for
your function, go home.

42
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:31.177
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And then Right is just like box.

43
00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:36.506
But this is where fold diverges,
because we actually Instead of doing

44
00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:42.670
this where we would map and put it back in
the box, we expect f to return us a Right.

45
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.180
And this is not fold, it is chain.

46
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.050
And config is not defined.

47
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.937
Where did we lose our variable?

48
00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:54.500
I see.

49
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:57.310
Cool.

50
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.168
So this basically flattens
it as a flat map.

51
00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:08.980
Are we okay, cuz that's monads,
you're learning monads.

52
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.150
[LAUGH] feeling okay about it?

53
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.420
map chain, chain flattens apps.
