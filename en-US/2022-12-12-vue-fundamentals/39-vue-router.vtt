1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.819
It's time for
us to talk about Routing with Vue Router.

2
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.459
Okay, Routing with Vue Router,
let's do this.

3
00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:17.036
All right, When we take a look at the code
and we look back at our C'est La Vue app,

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.757
You can see here that we're currently
faking navigation, not actually working.

5
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.825
And so, navigation is a real thing though,
we wanna actually be able to track your

6
00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:29.360
health, even if it is only
a single page application.

7
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.960
So, how do we do this?

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.550
Well, again, like any developer, we can
certainly write our own solution for it.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.011
But libraries are there to provide us
some conventions and more importantly,

10
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.267
make it easier for
us to debug things in the future,

11
00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:42.700
because they provide standards for us.

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.669
So, the library you're gonna want
to bookmark for this is Vue Router.

13
00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:50.923
So if you go to router.vue.js.org,
this is the page you're gonna need for

14
00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:51.634
your exercise.

15
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.724
Because one of the things I'd like you all
to do going forward is to start getting

16
00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:59.584
more familiar with the docs that the team
has written for these libraries.

17
00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.160
This is the official router for vue.js, so

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.730
it actually is officially
maintained by the team.

19
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.763
And so, inside of here we'll provide
a lot of the explanatory code snippets

20
00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:08.510
and stuff.

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.680
And don't worry, we're not gonna read and
walk through this.

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.833
But I just want you to have this ready so
that if you have a specific question,

23
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.370
you wanna read about it,
it's there for you.

24
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.458
But what we're gonna go ahead and
do is let's go ahead and

25
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:19.470
get that set up, shall we?

26
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.991
So as we can see here,

27
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.610
I'm gonna go inside of my playground
to sort of demo this first.

28
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.170
Let's clear out all these tabs.

29
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.349
And if I open up, Right,

30
00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.557
go here, cd playground, now we're good.

31
00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:37.550
Delete that one.

32
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.230
Great, npm run dev.

33
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.660
And if we're good, we should be back.

34
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.357
We are back.

35
00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:43.920
My gosh, the black though.

36
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.890
I need to change that so
it's actually readable.

37
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.820
Okay, so we have this, let's go ahead and
do some installation, shall we?

38
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.810
Npm install vue-router, and
then the @4 specifies which version it is.

39
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.750
Because Vue Router3, unfortunately,
the versions cannot line up, 3 is for

40
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.310
Vue2, 4 is for Vue3.

41
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.450
Okay, so
to verify that this has actually worked,

42
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.879
we can check that inside
of package.jason now.

43
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.111
You will see that, wait,
this is cest-la-vue, here's playground.

44
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.799
You can see vue-outer right here, 4.1.6.

45
00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.060
Okay, now that we have this,
let's go ahead and keep going,

46
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.330
we wanna go ahead and
actually get that set up.

47
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.209
So, the way routing works inside of
vue out of the box is that what we get

48
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.130
is the ability to define a route, right.

49
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.440
So, there's gonna be a router
controller that controls everything.

50
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.879
So the way we're gonna do this is,

51
00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.676
we're gonna create a new file
at our source called, router.js.

52
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:41.317
And so,

53
00:02:41.317 --> 00:02:47.370
router.js here will follow the syntax
that we're gonna see right down here.

54
00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.584
And basically, what it allows you to do,
it allows you to define a set of routes,

55
00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:57.874
that's an array,
that I'll explain in just a moment.

56
00:02:57.874 --> 00:03:02.601
And then, what we need to be able to do
then is to then take those routes and

57
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:05.570
actually apply them to the Vue app.

58
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.700
And so, inside of our main.ts app,

59
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.619
remember here when I was saying that,
we can actually do things like

60
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.720
chain functionality on top of this train
of creating an app and mounting it.

61
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.600
So this is where I typically would
actually go, const app = create app.

62
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.940
Cuz we've now created the app,
app.mount app.

63
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.206
But then, what this allows us to
do is inside of here we need to

64
00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:33.060
initialize the router from Vue Router.

65
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.495
So, we get to import what?

66
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:41.283
createVue or is definevue better?

67
00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:47.530
From vue-router,
Then create, there you go.

68
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.979
Now the autocomplete is showing up.

69
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.505
createRouter, cuz why?

70
00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:52.680
We need the router to run everything.

71
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.120
So we can say, const router =
createRouter(), just like that.

72
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.890
And so, you can see that on this line
right here const out, createRouter.

73
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.487
And then, what you can do is then
we can say, app.use(router).

74
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:13.473
And so, let me make sure this works.

75
00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:15.849
Okay, this is still missing some stuff,
but

76
00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.420
I wanted at least show
this in its simplest form.

77
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.296
So this is where I like the declarative
nature of it, going step by step.

78
00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:24.652
In that,
we import what we have from the top,

79
00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:29.120
we create an app that's based on this
app right here, from our App.vue.

80
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.307
Then, we initialize our router, and
then the app can then use the router, and

81
00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:35.029
then it's mounted to the page.

82
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.667
So, it's step by step.

83
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.824
As opposed to the alternative just to show
you visually what that would look like.

84
00:04:40.824 --> 00:04:46.506
Is to then say,
createApp(App).use(router),

85
00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:52.193
assuming you've declared it already,
.mount app.

86
00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:55.317
And you can imagine, once you start to
chain multiple uses together and you're

87
00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:58.550
using multiple libraries, the git-diff
on that isn't very pleasant, right.

88
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.632
We wanna make things easy for
people to review.

89
00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:04.434
And again, declarative code is
typically easier code to understand, so

90
00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:07.210
I prefer the multi-line
approach that we have here.

91
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.659
Okay, but we're not quite done yet.

92
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.336
It's still yelling at us because create
router does take an object that we need to

93
00:05:12.336 --> 00:05:13.370
configure.

94
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.926
The first thing we need to configure are
the routes that we want to actually define

95
00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:18.720
for our application.

96
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.080
So in other words,
what URLs go to what pages?

97
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.710
So right now, we have all of our stuff
existing inside of this components folder.

98
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.818
But when we're thinking about it at
a larger scale in terms of our app,

99
00:05:32.818 --> 00:05:35.478
we wanna think of things like pages or
views.

100
00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:39.265
And so, the standard folder that is
typically named at this point are views.

101
00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:42.490
And so, what you might do instead is
we might actually then switch over

102
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.413
the Pokedex component over to the views.

103
00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:48.842
Because you can imagine that you probably
want your app to have something like slash

104
00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:51.000
Pokedex, we'll show you the Pokedex.

105
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That would make sense.

106
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.280
And so, how would we actually
define that though, right?

107
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.220
Because just because we put in the folder,
it doesn't do much for us.

108
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.187
What we need to do is inside of this
router.js that you will have practice

109
00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:05.163
creating later,

110
00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:09.510
is that we'll have this array of
routes that we will get to define.

111
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.056
Every route is defined by
a couple of properties,

112
00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:14.810
one is the desired path
that you want it to be.

113
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.910
So in this case,
we have something for Pokedex.

114
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.090
And then, you can define what
the component is, that it's going to be.

115
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.040
So in this case,
we want the Pokedex page component.

116
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.282
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna import and

117
00:06:26.282 --> 00:06:28.119
this time I'm gonna rename this though.

118
00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.650
I usually prefer to try to name them
PokedexPage, just to give it a little bit

119
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.640
of a differentiator from
the rest of the components.

120
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.324
And so it'd be, PokedexPage
from './views/PokedexPage.vue',

121
00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:44.680
and then we can just do PokedexPage.

122
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.880
So we can save that, there's our routes.

123
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.670
Now, the only thing though is that we do
need to export this const, because why?

124
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.670
While it's being defined here and the
reason why I like to define it over here

125
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.608
is because what this allows us
to do is to then import it,

126
00:06:57.608 --> 00:07:01.060
basically, it allows us to scope
the data easier to manage.

127
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.740
Otherwise, your main.js, or
TS file is gonna get massively large.

128
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.440
So, we're gonna go ahead and
import routes,

129
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.054
I believe is what I called it, yep,

130
00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:19.736
I did call it routes,
routes from the router.js file.

131
00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:25.126
And what we can say is basically these are
the routes that we're gonna pass into it,

132
00:07:25.126 --> 00:07:26.210
and that's it.

133
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.014
That should be good, okay.

134
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:34.255
The other thing we need to do though
I realized is that we haven't defined

135
00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.408
the homepage yet, so
the app needs somewhere to go.

136
00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:38.600
We have the path, this is the base route.

137
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.020
And then, what we wanna do is we want it
to actually go to a homepage component.

138
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.930
So we don't have that at the moment,
and that's totally fine.

139
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.230
We just create a standard
one to use real quick.

140
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.173
So we'll go ahead and
do that, HomePage.vue.

141
00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:55.020
I'm gonna use my template blog to
really create a quick homepage.

142
00:07:59.065 --> 00:07:59.640
There we go.

143
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.830
And now, we can just import HomePage
here at the top, and there we go.

144
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.720
So see here we have our routes that
go to these specific components.

145
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.500
Any questions so far?

146
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.609
Feeling good?

147
00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:19.970
Okay, well, I'll keep going through this
and then questions as always are welcome.

148
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.091
Okay, so these routes are being
passed into here, right.

149
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:27.010
Cuz the router needs to know
what routes are being passed.

150
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.450
Okay, so we'll save that.

151
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.785
Again, I'm not sure why some
of the stuff is yelling at me,

152
00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:32.720
looks like some eslint stuff.

153
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.267
So, now that we have all this stuff,
let's actually try to run it So

154
00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:41.370
when we run it, you'll notice,
okay, does this file exist?

155
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.740
Well, let's see,
we'll go inside of PokedexPage.

156
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.941
It's yelling at us because, well,

157
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.206
the stuff we're importing now is
in a completely different folder.

158
00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:52.850
So, base-button.vue, does this file exist?

159
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.109
Go back, go to components,
go to base-button, yeah, it does exist.

160
00:08:58.109 --> 00:08:59.324
What are you talking about?

161
00:08:59.324 --> 00:08:59.831
There we go.
