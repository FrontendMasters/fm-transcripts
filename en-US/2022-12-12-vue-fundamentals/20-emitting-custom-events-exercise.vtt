00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.613
So now that you have this equipped or
this new knowledge the exercise

2
00:00:04.613 --> 00:00:08.881
now is to kind of continue on your
component exploration journey.

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.223
And now you have basically the opportunity
to architect your components kind of

4
00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:14.405
however you see fit.

5
00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:15.805
Do you want to go ahead and

6
00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:19.898
just have these display components
that received data from the parent.

7
00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.969
And then if it makes changes emit that
upwards or do you want to just keep

8
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:26.457
everything at the top like you can figure
out how you want to play around with that

9
00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:34.040
and see what works well for
you All right, and we're back.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.761
So, one of the questions that came up
during the exercise is people were playing

11
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.328
around.

12
00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:42.410
And what they notice is,
is that if you mutate the prop,

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.127
everything does seem to work.

14
00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:49.670
So in other words,
if you're in here, for example, and

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.148
we said this.user.name, right,
equals let's do Dominique.

16
00:00:56.148 --> 00:01:00.008
Okay, again, it will technically work.

17
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.638
The principle I kind of want to
kind of stress here, it's not so

18
00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:07.762
much that a question of whether or
not it works or not, but more so that.

19
00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:11.536
When it comes to best practices for
architecting apps,

20
00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:15.724
you want to keep it as easy as
possible to debug what's wrong.

21
00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:20.114
This is why I'm also a big fan of
when you have error reporting, or for

22
00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:24.809
example, we talked about styling later,
but when we go too far in terms of

23
00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:29.383
our optimizations of like, well,
it's easier to just do this right.

24
00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:31.972
It can make it tricky to track
where things are happening.

25
00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:33.427
And so when it comes to UI,

26
00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.014
a lot of it ends up boiling down
to where's your source of truth.

27
00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:39.411
And when you allow your codebase to start,

28
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.740
sort of messing with that source of truth
in different places, all of a sudden

29
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.690
becomes a lot trickier to figure out
why and when something happened.

30
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.682
Whereas if you follow this pattern
of emitting for children to parent,

31
00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:55.936
you'll always know that if in the future
the user has a bug where this list for

32
00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:57.085
example is broken.

33
00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:00.487
You'll know that basically you probably
should be looking at the parent and

34
00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.371
basically, you probably ought
to solve it just off that alone.

35
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.935
But if you allow the mutation to profit
elsewhere all of a sudden that guarantee

36
00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:10.666
becomes far less likely, it's because
you just don't know what's happening.

37
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:16.085
So I always err on the side of keeping
it easy when it comes to maintenance and

38
00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:17.039
debugging.

39
00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:22.630
Okay, so let's take a look
at this exercise, shall we,

40
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.782
okay That's all I want to know.

41
00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.993
Okay, perfect.

42
00:02:31.993 --> 00:02:38.495
So I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up my
atla forum, actually just good, okay.

43
00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:43.084
So atla forum, you great,

44
00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:47.278
refresh, cool, okay.

45
00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:55.224
So a good component to kind of illustrate
this is going to be the favoriting button.

46
00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:57.419
Because we can see here
that inside of app.view,

47
00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.309
we're actually managing our
favorite list here at the very top.

48
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.497
And so let's go ahead and
create that favorite list component.

49
00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:06.743
So favorite list, great.

50
00:03:06.743 --> 00:03:10.418
Actually, what I think favorite characters
is actually a bit more accurate.

51
00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:13.225
Favorite characters, great.

52
00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:17.303
And then I realized though actually wait,
I misspoke rather than the favorite

53
00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:20.972
characters, we actually wanna
create individual character cards.

54
00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:26.393
That's what we want, so
let me rename this now to CharacterCard.

55
00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:31.878
And so, what we have here now,
what I did earlier in case when people

56
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.895
see that this is sfc code extension,
so are not an extension.

57
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:38.272
It's one of the shortened cards.

58
00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:42.090
So it's a shortcode that I customised so
that when I type SFC for

59
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.851
single file component,
it will tell me my building watch me.

60
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:51.654
Okay, so what we have here is we
have this HTML that we basically

61
00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:57.130
want to refactor,
which is what we are looping right here.

62
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.684
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and actually
just copy this as a div as a list item.

63
00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:05.454
Let's just do it as a div.

64
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:09.227
Actually, this will be cleaner so
that it doesn't have to be in the list.

65
00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:14.821
So we'll have a div and
the div will contain all this stuff.

66
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.348
Now, we need to move some
functionality over though.

67
00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:19.899
So here's our placeholder.

68
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.033
We need to move the favorite
character functionality.

69
00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:30.347
Okay, and I think we need a prop,

70
00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:35.640
because we need to actually know
what character we're rendering.

71
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.168
So the character this case again
will be a type object and so

72
00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:43.063
I'm not gonna actually break
down the individual properties.

73
00:04:43.063 --> 00:04:48.206
And then that way we can get character
that name and then for now let's not

74
00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:53.960
worry about the dysfunction because this
will break and then that's it, okay.

75
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.552
So to prove that this works, we're going
to go ahead and import our character card.

76
00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:09.633
And then drop that here and then we're
gonna use it inside of our placeholder.

77
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.101
And we'll pass in
the character as a prompt.

78
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:19.239
So this is reusing all
the stuff that we did earlier.

79
00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:22.616
Okay, everything is appearing as expected.

80
00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:26.696
Now the difference here though is that
this favorite character functionality

81
00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:30.340
doesn't work because, guess what,
this card does not care about its

82
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.078
responsibility is not to
track the favorite lists.

83
00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:37.515
So to the point of what I was talking
about earlier you can theoretically pass

84
00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:40.022
favorite list as a prop to this component.

85
00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:43.446
And then you could have theoretically
the component update favorite lists.

86
00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:46.018
But again, that starts to convolute
the scope of the data and

87
00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:47.035
how it's being owned.

88
00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:48.218
That's not his goal.

89
00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:52.296
It's goal is to say, hey,
I'm gonna show a card of my characters.

90
00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:55.388
And by the way, when someone clicks
the favorite event, I will go ahead and

91
00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.253
tell the parent of
whatever context I'm in,

92
00:05:57.253 --> 00:05:59.481
that the user decided they
wanted to favor this card.

93
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.707
Whatever you do with that,
that's up to you.

94
00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:05.831
So what we gotta do here
is we'll define our emits.

95
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:09.427
Call and we'll just call it so we'll keep
it simple actually, because it emits

96
00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:12.824
are scoped to this specific component,
which is call it a favorite event.

97
00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:15.075
This is what's happening.

98
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:20.092
So now that we have the favorite event,
we can say, okay, well,

99
00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:24.945
when this happens, this.emit,
what event are we emitting?

100
00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:30.382
It's called favorite, but
more importantly, actually,

101
00:06:30.382 --> 00:06:34.858
what we can do is we can
actually pass in an argument

102
00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:39.775
to our emitted function,
which is this .character.

103
00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:41.309
So we can save that and

104
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:46.773
then this time now you can click here
to favoriteCharacter, okay, great.

105
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.778
Now that we have this we can come
over here and then we can say yes so

106
00:06:53.778 --> 00:06:58.477
on the character card we have this
favorite event that's gonna happen and

107
00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:04.372
when it does we can say
addFavorite character And

108
00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:09.873
so if you take a look now, let's update
this method called addFavorite character.

109
00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:13.483
And what you end up getting because you're
passing it as an argument is a payload,

110
00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:15.594
basically you can rename
it whatever you want.

111
00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:16.788
But generally speaking,

112
00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:19.453
we call it a payload because
this is coming from the event.

113
00:07:19.453 --> 00:07:23.494
So again, the way this is connected
to show the side by side,

114
00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:26.680
this tournament admits
this as the event name.

115
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.266
And this year the second argument
will basically be the payload.

116
00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.783
So it's generally frowned upon for
example to

117
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:37.314
just keep adding to this if you're like,
I want to add like A custom Id like 123.

118
00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:42.610
You wouldn't do this, you would
actually instead just pass a single

119
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.280
object that's like this is
the character and this is the id.

120
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.602
So payloads are typically
done in a single argument.

121
00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.562
Try not just spread them out beyond that.

122
00:07:51.562 --> 00:07:54.896
And like I said, if you need more nesting,
then by all means use an entre.

123
00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.824
All right, but we don't need to do that.

124
00:07:56.824 --> 00:08:00.066
So let's go ahead and
actually just emit the character directly.

125
00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:03.916
And then with that payload,
we can actually just push that over.

126
00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:06.305
So let's go ahead and
verify that this works.

127
00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:11.934
Refresh, boom, and he's Zuko Aang bam.

128
00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:13.238
And there you have it.

129
00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:17.141
And that is a way that you can implement
the prompts in a way that lets you render

130
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:18.354
exactly what you need.

131
00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:22.108
But then when you when it's time to
actually do something the child can tell

132
00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:26.161
the parent that hey it's there's this
thing that I'm requesting please do what

133
00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:27.077
you will with it.

134
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.473
Does anyone have any questions regarding
what the solution that we just

135
00:08:31.473 --> 00:08:32.153
went to, over.

136
00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:41.147
&gt;&gt; If you wanted to have your favorite
be a separate favorite module, and so,

137
00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:45.298
you want to call that function in
another module in Shell module.

138
00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:46.286
&gt;&gt; Okay.

139
00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:48.328
&gt;&gt; From the template code or something.

140
00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:50.997
&gt;&gt; So let me make sure I
understand the question correctly.

141
00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:54.849
So let's say in the event you're
mentioning that the favorite Functionality

142
00:08:54.849 --> 00:08:58.013
is something that's shared
amongst different UI components.

143
00:08:58.013 --> 00:09:00.947
How would we share that amongst
the different components?

144
00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:04.307
&gt;&gt; Yeah, or I mean specifically you
have a button with an at-click that says

145
00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:05.346
favoriteCharacter.

146
00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:07.965
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And let's say that function is actually

147
00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.379
in a different module.

148
00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:14.038
&gt;&gt; Okay, so with this button, you're
saying that this is in a different module.

149
00:09:14.038 --> 00:09:21.828
So, okay, so you're saying that
in this example you'd have,

150
00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:26.736
let's say we'd have a utilities folder

151
00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:31.951
that has a, favorite.js, for example.

152
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:36.113
And so is that what you're kind of
referring to, where there's like

153
00:09:36.113 --> 00:09:38.098
a function that like will,
&gt;&gt; Okay,

154
00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:40.960
I was thinking have a component
that displays the favorites and

155
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.446
then have the ad favorite
function also inside there.

156
00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:46.494
&gt;&gt; I see, okay, got it.

157
00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:51.341
So the scope here is you're saying
that having the favorite lists scoped

158
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.413
with the component directly.

159
00:09:53.413 --> 00:09:55.636
So actually, it's not this scenario.

160
00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:04.282
The idea here actually being that,
instead let's go and

161
00:10:04.282 --> 00:10:09.777
create that favoriteList characters.view.

162
00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:10.910
And so in this case,

163
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.592
are you referring to the fact that like we
would be rendering out the list here then.

164
00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:16.677
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

165
00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:20.078
&gt;&gt; So got it.
So here okay, let's see, so

166
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:25.812
inside of here,
we're doing another refactoring here.

167
00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:30.534
We have our data being the actual
favoriteList that's being tracked here.

168
00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:34.408
And then this is where we're
actually rendering the favoriteList,

169
00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:36.689
which is gonna be this block right here.

170
00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:41.152
And apparently we have SFC condition,
so that is that whole thing.

171
00:10:41.152 --> 00:10:44.691
And then drop that in here.

172
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:47.114
Okay, so that should be good.

173
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.368
FavoriteList is good.

174
00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.995
That's good, okay.

175
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:55.429
Now the question here is we need
to import favorite characters.

176
00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:02.016
So let's do that real quick favorite
characters and drop that as well.

177
00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:05.634
And then once we have that you said
that you want to render it here.

178
00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:12.937
FavoriteCharacters like this, okay.

179
00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:16.878
&gt;&gt; And I guess you told me where you'd
put a function to addFavorites but for

180
00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:18.827
the variables inside that module.

181
00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:19.329
&gt;&gt; Right.

182
00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:21.697
&gt;&gt; So how would you go about.

183
00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:26.709
&gt;&gt; Okay, and then variables in here.

184
00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:31.269
And I think something's missing
those something must be delta

185
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:35.063
resolve component because
I think I misspelled it.

186
00:11:35.063 --> 00:11:35.567
What do you say?

187
00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:40.371
&gt;&gt; Which favoriteCharacters
&gt;&gt; See the one [LAUGH] that gets me this

188
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.956
is why I generally do list anyhow.

189
00:11:43.956 --> 00:11:46.455
Okay, no favoriteCharacters yet, okay.

190
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:50.194
So are you saying that in this
particular context you're saying,

191
00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:54.078
we clearly have the favorite
functionality inside of the card here?

192
00:11:54.078 --> 00:11:58.018
And you're saying that what if we had
like another section that also had like

193
00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:00.002
a favorite button to add characters?

194
00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:02.835
&gt;&gt; Guess am just says,
&gt;&gt; Yep.

195
00:12:02.835 --> 00:12:07.719
&gt;&gt; How would you the data over into the
favorite list variable inside the favorite

196
00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:09.282
characters component.

197
00:12:09.282 --> 00:12:11.506
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is where it gets tricky.

198
00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:17.357
So at least with the tools that we have
now, you would basically have to do.

199
00:12:17.357 --> 00:12:21.858
Okay, so if you've admitted this,
you would admit this.

200
00:12:25.191 --> 00:12:28.729
I'm not sure if it actually makes sense
because so the thing about we have to

201
00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:32.507
remember when it comes to emit some props
is that it's a top down relationship.

202
00:12:32.507 --> 00:12:37.416
And the problem we're trying to solve
here is a sibling relationship because

203
00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:42.639
character card contains data that bender
statistics are not binary statistics.

204
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:46.280
Favorite characters and character card are
trying to talk to each other basically,

205
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:46.956
at this point.

206
00:12:46.956 --> 00:12:50.783
And so usually what happens at that point
is where you want some sort of alternative

207
00:12:50.783 --> 00:12:52.178
state management solution.

208
00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:57.247
Where you have like, basically,
as a preview is you'd have stores and

209
00:12:57.247 --> 00:13:00.553
we probably would have
like a favorite store.

210
00:13:00.553 --> 00:13:03.750
And the favorite store becomes a file that
becomes basically a JavaScript module

211
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.347
that's shared between the two
components that care about that.

212
00:13:06.347 --> 00:13:08.949
And that way,
the updating becomes cleaner.

213
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:12.600
And in fact, what's interesting though,
is that once you start doing these stores,

214
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.000
sometimes the omit goes away actually
because now you're actually not thinking

215
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.717
about admitting to a parent,
you're just updating the store.

216
00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:22.351
And so that can do a lot in terms of like
cleaning up code and that kind of stuff.

217
00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:25.695
But I wanted to at least start with
the fundamentals of like if you're dealing

218
00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:28.938
with two components parent child this
is like kind of like best practice for

219
00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:30.032
how we approach things.

220
00:13:30.032 --> 00:13:33.345
But then what tomorrow once we
talked about store module and

221
00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.071
that kind of stuff is gonna
be all sorts of fun so.

222
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:40.282
&gt;&gt; The situation you have here this is
where that generic list component could be

223
00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:40.813
useful.

224
00:13:40.813 --> 00:13:41.430
&gt;&gt; Yep.

225
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.499
&gt;&gt; Where you're passing as a prop the list
of characters into one list, the list of

226
00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:49.954
favorites into the others, and then using
functions to update those separate lists.

227
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.448
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yep.

228
00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:55.377
Great.
