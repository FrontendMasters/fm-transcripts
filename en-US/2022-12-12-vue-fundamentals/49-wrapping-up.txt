>> So as I mentioned, there's a lot in the ecosystem out there waiting for you. Going past view, when you start looking at things like server side rendering or you want a sort of, a higher meta framework that provides more built-in things, highly recommend checking out Nuxt 3 that should be coming close to stable soon.

[00:00:14]
But we have a Nux three Foundation workshop that actually gave recently. So if you check that out, that will also walk you through how Nuxt 3 works. And with the new Vue 3 knowledge, you'll be able to pair those things pretty well. In addition, whether it's TypeScript as well, TypeScript, be sure to check those things out because with Vue 3, TypeScript is much easier especially for those using composition API.

[00:00:35]
And so other than that I would say, I think that about wraps it up from my end. So a big thanks to everyone team here from frontendmasters for hosting this, but for for those online, if you have any questions, I'm online in the community under the moniker bencodezen.

[00:00:54]
So there's my info there, so if you ever wanna reach out or have any questions, don't hesitate to do so. Thanks.
