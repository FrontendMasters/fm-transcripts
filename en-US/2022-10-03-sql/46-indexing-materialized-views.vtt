00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.568
So, how do we get this to be even faster?

2
00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:05.404
This is still pretty slow.

3
00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:14.068
Indexes, surprise, surprise,
our old friend the index.

4
00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:19.042
CREATE INDEX idx_actor_categories.

5
00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:26.795
ON actor_categories.

6
00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:31.201
(count DESC NULL), And

7
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:35.495
I don't think there's actually any
nulls in this cuz it's just counts, but

8
00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:39.539
if you want to you can put nulls last,
so then you are always sure of that.

9
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.154
Or not, up to you,
I'm gonna put it in there.

10
00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:42.598
You can leave it out if you want to.

11
00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:52.379
Okay, now I have an index on that,
so let's run that same,

12
00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.399
This descending,
because I put NULLS last here,

13
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.760
I have to put NULLS last here.

14
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.030
Even though that would
make a difference here,

15
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.620
it won't use it because it doesn't
see them being the same index.

16
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.263
But let's run this again, this was 88,000
up here, let's see what this is now.

17
00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:23.030
This went from 88,000 to 0.75.

18
00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:31.437
That's a slight increase in performance.

19
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:38.043
Even just from the 88,000 up here,
but think of it from the 290

20
00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:42.839
something thousand, this one right here,
almost 300,000 up here.

21
00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.898
So I'm not a math guy but
that seems pretty good.

22
00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:57.333
Or I did the math for you, that is
a 4,000,000% increase in performance.

23
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.948
You should get promotion for that,
I think, or at least a pat on the back.

24
00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:09.587
A really firm one though that
makes you feel good, one of those.

25
00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:15.581
Okay, any questions
about what we looked at?

26
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.732
&gt;&gt; Besides how expensive they are to make,

27
00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:20.842
what would be the downside of
just having a ton of indexes?

28
00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:27.709
Say you have the downtime, you can do all
that, is it like an organizational thing?

29
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.840
Why wouldn't you just index
as much as you could?

30
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.543
&gt;&gt; Space.

31
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:32.979
&gt;&gt; Just space, okay.

32
00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.356
&gt;&gt; Space is number one, number two is
it does slow down the planner, right,

33
00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:39.421
because the planner has to go
through every index, can I use this?

34
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:40.137
Can I use this?
Can I use this?

35
00:02:40.137 --> 00:02:40.883
Can I use this?

36
00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:42.275
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay, that makes sense.

37
00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:46.248
&gt;&gt; Yep, Those two things,

38
00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:51.193
I guess three is,
you should keep it tidy house, right?

39
00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:56.800
Yeah, that is, views,
and materialized views.
