1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.736
Aggregation.

2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.310
So, we've kind of already
been cheating a little bit.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.150
You've probably already seen it's just
a really common kind of query to run.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.547
But let's go ahead and
do a few of these right now.

5
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:21.922
So, I'm gonna say SELECT,

6
00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:26.931
COUNT (*) FROM ingredients.

7
00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:32.233
If you ever wanna know how many rows
you have in a particular database,

8
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:33.465
that's what this does.

9
00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:39.584
It's aggregating all of your rows together
and then returning to you a number.

10
00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:43.229
You wanna know how many recipes we have?

11
00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:44.328
56.

12
00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:53.350
You wanna know how many
recipes photos we have, 44.

13
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.097
And recipe ingredients,

14
00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:01.336
170, right?

15
00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:05.200
COUNT(*) is something that you're
going to see very frequently.

16
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.049
What if I wanted to know how many
different types of ingredients we have?

17
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.500
I don't wanna know what they are, I wanna
know how many different ones we have.

18
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.864
Well, here from recipes,

19
00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:27.030
sorry ingredients,
I can say DISTINCT type.

20
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.070
And this will return to
me that I have four.

21
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.713
It's not gonna tell me what they are,
cuz I didn't ask for that,

22
00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:35.555
it tells me how many
different types we have.

23
00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:40.220
So this is where we're actually
telling it what we want you to count.

24
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.828
When you put COUNT(*) in there,
you're just saying count everything,

25
00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:48.362
count everything the results set and
give that back to me.

26
00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:52.185
Just for clarity sake, if you wanna
see what those types actually are,

27
00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.999
you can say SELECT DISTINCT
type FROM ingredients.

28
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.509
And this will actually give
you the four different types.

29
00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:04.013
What if I wanna know how
many of each type there is?

30
00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:07.110
Seems like that would be
useful information to know.

31
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.770
So, here I would say SELECT,
let's Ctrl+L this so you can see.

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.647
SELECT.

33
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.221
Type, right we wanna know the type and

34
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.880
then we wanna know the count of
how many of each type there is.

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.912
So count type, I think that tracks, right.

36
00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:31.723
From ingredients, now we have to give
it like a little bit of a hint is,

37
00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:35.733
how are you going to group
these things together, right.

38
00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:40.170
That's where you enter this GROUP BY, a
group by is always going to be accompanied

39
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.330
by some sort of aggregation function,
count as an aggregation function.

40
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.780
Another one that you might,
use a lot is average or min or max, right?

41
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.872
It's taking a bunch of things and kind of
condensing them down or, in other words,

42
00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:56.800
aggregating them into some
higher level insight, right?

43
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.623
Here we're gonna group by type, right?

44
00:03:00.623 --> 00:03:04.182
Because that's actually what
we're trying to count here.

45
00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:07.075
We have 29 vegetables, 78 fruit.

46
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.649
And meat 6.

47
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.760
Now you get into this weird situation of,

48
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.580
let's say, I was trying to do a query of

49
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.422
something like this, SELECT, title, type,

50
00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:34.017
COUNT(type) FROM ingredients,
GROUP BY, type.

51
00:03:34.017 --> 00:03:38.733
This query doesn't work, why?

52
00:03:40.468 --> 00:03:44.700
&gt;&gt; Cuz the title could be different for
all of the, different groups.

53
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it should be different, right?

54
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.012
It actually must be different,

55
00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:52.305
because there's a constraint on the table
that forces them to be different.

56
00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:55.849
So you need to ask yourself,
what is this actually really asking.

57
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.586
The title here is
nonsensical because it's,

58
00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:02.730
the title is being aggregated away
into this type and account type.

59
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.778
So asking for the title here
it's nonsensical to ask for one,

60
00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.479
because it couldn't possibly,
you're not really asking for anything.

61
00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.810
Or you're asking for
something that doesn't make any sense.

62
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.775
So if you do this,
it's gonna be like, I can't do that.

63
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.224
Because the ingredient title at that
point would have to actually show up in

64
00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:21.503
the group by for
that to make any sense, right?

65
00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:24.558
So in other words, if you're gonna be
asking for something in a SELECT and

66
00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:25.406
you have a GROUP BY.

67
00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:28.951
Everything that's gonna appear in
the GROUP or in the SELECT probably

68
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.500
needs to be in the group by as well,
because you need to be grouping by things.

69
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.171
Grouping by title wouldn't
make any sense because,

70
00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:38.495
everything would have a count of one,
right.

71
00:04:40.253 --> 00:04:43.655
So, I found that really confusing
when I was starting out with SQLs,

72
00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:47.550
I wanna select things that aren't in
the GROUP BY and then I kind of head over.

73
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.910
Have this light bulb moment of,
what am I trying to do here?

74
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.630
And it didn't make any sense.

75
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.870
We'll see more of this as we get
into using the movie database.

76
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.110
We don't really have lot of things
to count on the recipe database.

77
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.504
But I'll show you how to do things like
averages and other things when we get

78
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:07.570
into Window functions,
which are closely related to aggregation.
