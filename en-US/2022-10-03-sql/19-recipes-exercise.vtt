00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.374
Okay, so let's walk through our second,
Project here.

2
00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.737
So you've already done
the ingredients portion of this.

3
00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:13.510
Now, we're gonna go do
the recipe portion of this.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.040
So go into your recipes.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.090
Same sort of thing here.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.379
We have a client, I mean,
the detail-client.

7
00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.324
They're two different pages, but
you only have to worry about api.js, okay?

8
00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:25.035
You're gonna have to connect
to postgres again here.

9
00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.280
You can literally copy and paste the one
from the other one, that's fine.

10
00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:34.266
Here, you're gonna have to
return the recipe ID title and

11
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:39.292
the first photo as a URL, you can use that
distinct magic that I was showing you.

12
00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:41.273
And then for the recipes without photos,

13
00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:44.848
return the URL as defaults.jpg which
I showed you how to do with coalesce.

14
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.210
Okay, that's the first one,
that's for the search page.

15
00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:54.779
Which, let me just go ahead and
show you that first.

16
00:00:57.236 --> 00:00:59.330
I'm gonna have to run npm dev again.

17
00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:06.513
It's already running,
localhost:3000, that's here.

18
00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:13.291
We're gonna go into recipes, actually,
kind of just do this here, yeah, I can.

19
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.312
This is just gonna be
a list of all the recipes,

20
00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:19.575
it's not paginated or
anything fancy like that.

21
00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:25.024
And then here, you're going to
click on one of the recipes and

22
00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:27.519
that'll take you to one of these pages.

23
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:32.641
It'll show you all the ingredients,
the instructions, and

24
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:38.569
then a rotational picture of all
the ingredients as well as the images.

25
00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:47.393
So looking back at our code,
So the search page,

26
00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:52.704
you should just have to do this one, the
recipe ID, the title, and the first photo.

27
00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.451
Again, that's gonna take
probably two joins to get that.

28
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.836
This one you're gonna
return all ingredients.

29
00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.419
This is gonna be a top
level item that you return.

30
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.907
So instead of having status
data implemented here,

31
00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:18.158
you're gonna have ingredients be an array
of the ingredients from the API, right?

32
00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:25.332
Make sure that you can use as,
right, remember as to rename things.

33
00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.172
Return the ingredient
image as ingredient image,

34
00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:32.736
ingredient types as ingredient type and
ingredient titles as ingredient title.

35
00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.351
Probably gonna be your first query,
I would imagine.

36
00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.553
Okay, then you're gonna have a photos
in a row that you're going to return

37
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:42.686
this in an array.

38
00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:47.390
Return the title, body and
URL as named by the same, right?

39
00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.916
So you don't have to rename those things,
title, body and URL, that's totally fine.

40
00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:59.408
And then finally, return the title of

41
00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:04.266
the entire recipe as, Whatever and

42
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:10.389
the body as whatever the body is.

43
00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:18.211
So actually,
you can actually just return this as URL,

44
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:21.478
cuz I don't think it actually
uses the other stuff.

45
00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:24.359
So I'm kind of clueing you
in on how I did it, but

46
00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.964
you're welcome to do it however you want.

47
00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:37.722
All right, any questions?

48
00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:38.778
Make sense?

49
00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:42.321
&gt;&gt; For search, what are the query params?

50
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.459
&gt;&gt; There are no query params.

51
00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.820
&gt;&gt; So this is more like a list?

52
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.024
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it could have been called list, yeah.

53
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.449
I don't think I even have
a search box up there, do I?

54
00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.470
I don't, yeah, there's no search,
it'ss just listing all the recipes.
