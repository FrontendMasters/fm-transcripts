00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.206
Lessons, we're already here,
and we have this.

2
00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:06.637
What if we wanted to include it?

3
00:00:06.637 --> 00:00:07.667
What would we do?

4
00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:14.838
In the FROM table, so
you do left, run one.

5
00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:20.289
Say, this is the thing that I was getting
messed up on, left to right, it's right.

6
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:25.499
So we do what's called a RIGHT JOIN,

7
00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:31.597
which basically means that anything
that exists in the recipe table.

8
00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:35.055
Sorry, the, yeah, the recipe, that's fine.

9
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:40.240
Anything that exists in the joining table,
not the FROM table, the original table.

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.669
I wanna include anything that doesn't have
a corresponding thing in the other table,

11
00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.082
you would do a RIGHT JOIN to include
things from the joining table,

12
00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:51.997
To right table.

13
00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:54.215
As you can see,
I can never keep it straight in my head,

14
00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.981
so I normally have to do both to
make sure I'm doing the correct one.

15
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.324
But you can see here,

16
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:03.034
now this is being included even though
it doesn't have a photo to include.

17
00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:06.594
You can imagine this being useful if
we're trying to include a results set for

18
00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:07.537
all of our recipes.

19
00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.327
We wanna include recipes
that don't have photos,

20
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:11.168
that's totally fine that
they don't have photos.

21
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:15.303
They should still be shown on the site and
will show some default thing.

22
00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:17.611
That's what a RIGHT JOIN is useful for.

23
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.395
For some reason we had photos
that didn't have recipes.

24
00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:28.220
Then we need to use LEFT JOIN, right?

25
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:35.987
If you wanna include both, I think it's
full join, if I remember correctly.

26
00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:38.888
Not generally one that I think
a lot about, but it's out there.

27
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.355
As I said,
I think 95% of what I do is inner joins.

28
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:50.130
The last five,
let's say 4.9% of it is left and

29
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.362
right and 0.1%,
I'd have no idea what I'm doing.

30
00:01:55.362 --> 00:02:00.739
One thing that I didn't show you here,
technically, it's a RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

31
00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.176
So you can actually include
that OUTER there, but

32
00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:06.204
the word OUTER is optional,
as oppose to INNER JOIN, right.

33
00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:09.914
Which is only include
everything that matches up.

34
00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:12.546
There you go.

35
00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.983
So I was right, it is a full OUTER JOIN.

36
00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:17.917
If you wanted to include everything,

37
00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:20.850
this is not gonna be any different
than our RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

38
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.035
Because there's nothing that exists in
photos without recipes because that

39
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:27.319
wouldn't make any sense, we wouldn't
have photos that don't have recipes.

40
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.608
But if you did,
FULL OUTER JOIN would include both.

41
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.813
In other words,
FULL OUTER JOIN is LEFT plus RIGHT JOIN or

42
00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:42.630
LEFT plus INNER plus RIGHT,
whatever you wanna call that.

43
00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:50.129
So let's go look at this
really cool graphic I got from

44
00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.023
Wikipedia, that's helpful to look at.

45
00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:58.620
This one right here,
you can think of it like a Venn diagram,

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.496
this is INNER JOIN, most of the time what
you want between table A and table B.

47
00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:08.330
A RIGHT JOIN includes everything
in the middle plus everything

48
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.608
that's not included in the LEFT table
that exists in the RIGHT table.

49
00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:14.438
There's a LEFT JOIN here and

50
00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:18.564
these top ones are most of what
you're gonna do most of the time.

51
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:26.068
If for some reason you wanted to include,
you wanted to use a table to

52
00:03:26.068 --> 00:03:30.307
exclude something in there,
Maybe you have,

53
00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:36.775
a user that has chosen to ignore a bunch
of other users in their timeline, right?

54
00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:41.348
So you have this table that user
A has ignored user B, C, and D, and

55
00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:44.145
you're trying to make their timeline.

56
00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:49.235
So what you would basically
do is you do this right here.

57
00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:52.698
This RIGHT JOIN, and
then do a right key is null, so

58
00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:55.774
you're just including
the outer side of it.

59
00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:58.731
So you'll exclude all those
people in the middle,

60
00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:03.639
the users that were ignored by user A, and
get everyone to the rest of your timeline.

61
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.224
I'll tell you it kinda do that
ignore list sort of pattern, right?

62
00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:11.773
Or deny list or
whatever you wanna call it.

63
00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:17.376
To make sense, that's what you would do,
use something like this.

64
00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:20.117
There's a FULL OUTER JOIN
where basically you can say,

65
00:04:20.117 --> 00:04:22.165
exclude everything where they overlap.

66
00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:25.355
This is the FULL OUTER JOIN right here.

67
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:29.382
We just looked at that,
rather and vice versa there.

68
00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:34.159
So that's kind of the full
possibility of JOINS, again,

69
00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:39.825
this one's the most common,
these two are a little bit more common.

70
00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:47.567
Fathom to the only example I can
think of to do one of these, right.?

71
00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:51.754
And yeah, cool any questions?

72
00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:54.623
&gt;&gt; I'm still a little confused.

73
00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:58.554
So RIGHT JOIN returns a bunch more stuff

74
00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:03.446
because it's the INNER JOIN plus,
what again?

75
00:05:03.446 --> 00:05:07.737
&gt;&gt; So as you're just saying, if you have a
world that doesn't have something to match

76
00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:09.346
with it, what do you wanna do?

77
00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:10.805
Do you wanna include the right side?

78
00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:11.905
Do you wanna include the left side?

79
00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:12.959
Do you wanna include neither?

80
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.644
Inner join just include the inner
part of the Venn diagram.

81
00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:19.018
Left and right is saying take from left or
take from the right, and

82
00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.282
then full is include everything.

83
00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:24.202
&gt;&gt; And the left and right is
basically the left side of the ON or

84
00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:25.886
the right side of the ON?

85
00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:33.236
&gt;&gt; Left is gonna be stuff from the FROM,
right is gonna be stuff from the ON.

86
00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:42.122
But I have to check that every time,
cuz I can never remember.

87
00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:43.887
Usually is from both
queries we see that one.

88
00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:46.872
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Is that opposite, though, cuz-

89
00:05:46.872 --> 00:05:48.196
&gt;&gt; It might be, C.

90
00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:50.082
&gt;&gt; It may be opposite
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

91
00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:56.223
&gt;&gt; Because we found on the recipes photos,

92
00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:58.855
&gt;&gt; And we don't wanna include those.

93
00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:04.042
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it was the, my God,
I'm confusing myself never mind.

94
00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:07.205
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm also confusing myself too,
and you are not helping, I'm just kidding.

95
00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:10.061
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just kidding.

96
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.633
&gt;&gt; But
there where you could switch the FROM, and

97
00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:19.152
then if you switch FROM and ON,
look at the one you listed first.

98
00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:23.410
You could still do FROM recipe
instead of recipe_photos, and

99
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.564
then LEFT JOIN on recipe_photos, and
you just switch the join direction.

100
00:06:28.564 --> 00:06:29.624
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Do the same thing.

101
00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:30.554
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
