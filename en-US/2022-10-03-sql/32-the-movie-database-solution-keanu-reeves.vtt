1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.882
Okay, so how much revenue does
the movies Keanu Reeves in, act in make?

2
00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.518
Which I recognize is a weird question but

3
00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:11.560
basically what's the box office
of all Keanu Reeves movies?

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.793
So, we're gonna start from movies, right,

5
00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:20.390
because we wanna know all of the movies,
so that's gonna be our front table.

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.637
So select then we're gonna

7
00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:32.882
do a COALESCE here as well,

8
00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:39.945
of the (SUM(m.revenue),

9
00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:49.760
0 AS TOTAL I actually don't know if
we need that COALESCE, but we'll see.

10
00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:53.945
&gt;&gt; Total to be lower case.

11
00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.075
&gt;&gt; So yeah, you're right, I mean it
would work it would just be weird.

12
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:07.012
Okay, FROM movies.

13
00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:12.878
INNER JOIN,
we're gonna join on CASTS, right,

14
00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:16.830
cuz that's the give me the connection
between movies and people.

15
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.721
So casts c, m, c and

16
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:31.190
then ON m.id =c.movie id, right?

17
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.540
Because that's the connection and
cast is just movie id and people id.

18
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.250
&gt;&gt; Don't think you movies as m so.

19
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.938
&gt;&gt; You're correct I did not, so select.

20
00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:51.443
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I found it helpful to
write the stuff in a code editor and

21
00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.720
then paste it in.

22
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that's typically what I do as well.

23
00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:00.600
But we're here, so,
we'll do it this way first.

24
00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:11.062
As total
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

25
00:02:11.062 --> 00:02:12.360
Yep.

26
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.668
All right,
maybe we will just do this in my editor.

27
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.231
We'll get syntax highlighting as well.

28
00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:29.539
All right, here we go, SELECT,
COALESCE(SUM ( m.revenue), 0) AS total.

29
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:46.258
I actually don't think we need that
COALESCE but I'm gonna leave it in next

30
00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:49.860
that's my notes have and then we'll
go back and try it without, movies m

31
00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:59.260
INNER JOIN casts c

32
00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.460
On m.id = c.movie.id.

33
00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:17.729
Then we're gonna INNER JOIN again,
people p, ON.

34
00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.745
C.person_id = p.id.

35
00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:36.720
WHERE p.name = Keanu Reeves.

36
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.528
All right, let's check that one out.

37
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.854
So this is the amount that Keanu Reeves
movies has done, let me try just removing

38
00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:58.215
this COALESCE and trying to remember
exactly why I had to put this in here.

39
00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:04.580
And it might have not been necessary,
it's not.

40
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.792
Because that would basically say, if
this entire SUM was no then make it zero

41
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:15.651
which is nonsensical in this particular
case, so it wasn't necessary.

42
00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:24.367
Cool, that sounds good,

43
00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:28.770
any questions about this one?

44
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.467
&gt;&gt; I was trying to order
by his most popular or

45
00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:41.360
his highest revenue movie.

46
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.590
&gt;&gt; Which doesn't make any sense
because selling them anyway right?

47
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.909
&gt;&gt; Well no, I misread the question, so
instead of SUM, I was just like, hey,

48
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.498
what movies did Keanu Reeves, which one
of his movies did the best or whatever?

49
00:04:59.588 --> 00:05:03.166
&gt;&gt; So I mean,
you could do m.name, m.revenue,

50
00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:07.600
I think this will give you
back all his movies, right?

51
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.806
With their revenues, which it does.

52
00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:13.031
&gt;&gt; Yeah,that's where I went bad, yeah.

53
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.762
&gt;&gt; ORDER BY, ORDER By, and

54
00:05:20.762 --> 00:05:26.511
revenue descending NULLS LAST.

55
00:05:29.632 --> 00:05:31.656
Was it NULLS or NULL LAST?

56
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.633
So there you go, that would be that one.

57
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.450
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Toy Story 4.

58
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.240
&gt;&gt; Was he?

59
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.150
Yes, no, maybe, I guess, according
to this database it is, that's year.

60
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.700
&gt;&gt; That's very cool data.

61
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.200
&gt;&gt; Pretty fun, right?

62
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
