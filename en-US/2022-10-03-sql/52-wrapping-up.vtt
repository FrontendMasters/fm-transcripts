00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.841
So, you did it you did it I'm so
proud of you you listen to me drone on

2
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:09.332
about SQL for literally hours,
you deserve a badge, a metal,

3
00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:13.830
pat on the back,
a hug whatever you need treat yourself.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.419
So, It's what I'm saying.

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.274
This is a lot of information to
come at you all at once, but

6
00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:23.477
I'm going to assert now that you have a
pretty good working knowledge of how to be

7
00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:24.690
a developer with SQL.

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.164
I'm gonna say that you probably now have,

9
00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:30.669
more knowledge than a lot of
seasoned developers about SQL,

10
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.220
because most developers don't bother
to go in and learn their tools, right?

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.044
They just kind of learn by necessity and

12
00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:39.210
don't bother digging
any further than that.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.650
I think what you did is better.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.950
I think this is going make
you a better developer and

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.960
I think you can do 95% of the surface
area of SQL, you can all do here.

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.295
There's ways to grow and continue in
advance on this learn more about all

17
00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.239
the various different inner workings, but

18
00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.410
this is a really good working knowledge
for an application developer.

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.302
So some final thoughts Almost all of
what you learned with some exceptions

20
00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:18.490
like JSON B applies to MySQL,
Oracle SQL Lite, SQL Server.

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.760
SQL is a general spec.

22
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.180
All these things generally
apply across most of these.

23
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.100
Many of them like copy and
paste as well as is into other databases.

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.080
If it's not that, it's minor modification.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.965
This course was exclusively
focused on using a database and

26
00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:38.220
not setting up a database.

27
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.373
If you wanna do things like sharding and

28
00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:45.197
running multiple databases there like ops,
classes that you should take, and

29
00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.610
I'm just not qualified to teach
on those kinds of things.

30
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.680
We didn't cover ORMs.

31
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.730
We talked a little bit about that.

32
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.850
I tend to not use them because
I tend to fight them more than

33
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.425
like it's really useful if like
you're in their happy path, and

34
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.940
it's miserable if you're
outside of the happy paths.

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.362
I would rather just be a little
uncomfortable all the time rather than

36
00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:07.310
have to fight it.

37
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.543
I don't like tools that I have
to fight In other words, so

38
00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:13.763
I don't use RMS hardly ever.

39
00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:17.620
But that's a decision for
you and your team to make.

40
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.855
And then we didn't talk a ton about
execution order that might be something

41
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.490
that for you to go look into.

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.616
That's just like when does a select happen
versus Windows aware happened versus one

43
00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:28.720
of the order by happen again?

44
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.133
For 99%, of course, other than the having
section, you didn't have to care and

45
00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:33.950
you probably still don't have to care.

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.360
So you can just kind of tackle
that when you get there.

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.264
The last thing I have for
you is our last challenge I have for

48
00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:42.495
you as application developers,

49
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:47.250
you have this now movie database
that you're now very familiar with.

50
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.790
I would like you all to
go make a movie website.

51
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.826
I don't have them on the website or
on the site yet

52
00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.419
by the time this gets posted we'll have
it there actually have designs for

53
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.670
you That you can actually go and
adhere to.

54
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.685
So, but you have to write the CSS and
JavaScript, I'm not doing that for

55
00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:07.410
you this time.

56
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.960
You got it once,
you're not getting it twice.

57
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.070
Make a movie database,
you also don't have to use my designs.

58
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.010
But it was done by a professional design.

59
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.870
The design like the course website,
design the rest of your website.

60
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.650
I think I melted everyone's brain.

61
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.670
There's not a lot left.

62
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.560
I sympathize I was here too.

63
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.590
So there's not a lot left in my
brain either, but yeah thank you.

64
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.225
Appreciate it.

65
00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:35.611
