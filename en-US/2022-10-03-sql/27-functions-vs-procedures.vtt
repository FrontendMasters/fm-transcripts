00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.290
You're gonna find that procedures and
functions are very similar.

2
00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:08.830
But a procedure is a bit more
limited in what can accomplish.

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.404
I think procedures came first and
then they made functions later that feels

4
00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.840
right for
me to say I have no data on that.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.205
So Someone's probably gonna correct me but
there are some.

6
00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:25.449
There's a lot of similarities.

7
00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.392
Functions can definitely do more,
almost everything that a procedure can

8
00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:34.400
do a function can do whereas
the other way around is not true.

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.802
So, a procedure is designed to do
some sort of action, a function,

10
00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:41.040
its general purpose.

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.696
It can do an action, it can just
do some sort of like selecting,

12
00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:49.540
it can do basically anything that you
can think of in code that you would run

13
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.940
inside of a database.

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.118
That's what a function can do a procedure
is much more scoped down to doing some

15
00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:58.810
individual action, let's just
think about our recipes database.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.609
Let's say we have a lot of
churn on ingredients for

17
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.153
images can get created and deleted and
sometimes images are set to null, right?

18
00:01:06.153 --> 00:01:10.613
Let's say we wanted to tolerate that,
that sometimes ingredients could be null.

19
00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:14.565
So we don't want to set, like the not
null constraint on the database.

20
00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:17.953
But let's say that we don't want
to keep that for very long.

21
00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:22.028
What we could do is we could have some
sort of job right that would run in

22
00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:26.457
the background that would just go and
find all of the images that had null set

23
00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:29.640
on them and then it would set
it to some default image.

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.554
Right does that makes sense?

25
00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:36.952
So you have an ingredient it has an image,
for some reason the image gets deleted,

26
00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:40.290
maybe it gets dropped out of our cache or
something like that.

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.849
So that at that point for a brief moment
of time, whether that's, minutes, hours,

28
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.820
days, something like that.

29
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.797
It'll have an ingredient that will have
a null image and then at some point we can

30
00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:57.000
run a procedure that goes and
sets all of those to be default .jpg.

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.970
That's what a procedure would be fit for.

32
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.968
That is what that's like the call sign for
when a procedure could be useful.

33
00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:11.530
So let's run this query right now,
SELECT* WHERE image IS NULL.

34
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.614
Right now we don't have any.

35
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.150
But let's just go insert
something into our database.

36
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.820
So we're going to put venison in there.

37
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.567
And now if we run that again, we now have
venison that does not have an image.

38
00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:30.319
All right so this is what I'm talking
about maybe, maybe this would be another

39
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.071
case where we'd want to allow people to
insert things and we don't want to like

40
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.891
burden the process too much with
all this like setting things.

41
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:42.388
I don't know I'm contriving
a very contrived example here.

42
00:02:42.388 --> 00:02:46.036
You were just in your code,
say call this default .jpg and

43
00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.946
call it good and
then make image not nullable.

44
00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:51.070
Bear with me for a moment, please.

45
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.830
Now we're going to create a procedure.

46
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.390
And it's going to be called set
null ingredients to default.

47
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.594
This is not going to be
the programming language,

48
00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:05.040
this is actually going
to be directly a query.

49
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.288
So we can say the language is SQL,
it's not the PL/pgSQL.

50
00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:13.386
So all it's going to do is
upgrade ingredients set image to

51
00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:16.070
default where image is null, right?

52
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.790
It's really just running a quick query.

53
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.420
You can use PL/pgSQL here,
by the way, we just didn't need to.

54
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.480
So now I have a procedure here
that I can call at any interval.

55
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.750
We created our procedure here.

56
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.770
We haven't called it yet we haven't done
anything if we call that query again.

57
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.936
Venison's still there and has no image.

58
00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:41.642
So again we could use PL/pgSQL here but

59
00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:46.562
we don't need to this is a simple query
if you needed to do some sort of for

60
00:03:46.562 --> 00:03:52.570
loop or something like that you could you,
you would need to use PL/pgSQL.

61
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.154
Now, we could have some sort of
background job, we can have something in

62
00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:01.813
our database, or not our database that
are like app that would reach out,

63
00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:05.121
there's a crom that we could
have like a AWS lambda,

64
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.600
that lambda is some sort of
timer that would call this.

65
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.446
But anyway, something needs to
call this function right here.

66
00:04:11.446 --> 00:04:16.865
Which is CALL,

67
00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:21.740
what did I call it, set null ingredients,
null ingredient images to default.

68
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.670
I'm just gonna copy that because
I don't want to write it again.

69
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.440
Call that it has no parameters.

70
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.610
It could have had parameters.

71
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.070
We just didn't give it any right.

72
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.185
We could have made it like,
some sort of like,

73
00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:39.355
parameter to like what image
that we're gonna set it to but

74
00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:42.110
we didn't, that's fine.

75
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.620
We're just going to call that so
I called the procedure.

76
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.449
Now if I come back here and
say this again it is not null and

77
00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.000
if I say select star from ingredients.

78
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
WHERE id equals 127,
which is what we saw right there.

79
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.400
You'll see now that it has a default jpg.

80
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.698
So we call we use CALL
instead of SELECT here,

81
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:10.880
that's what procedures you CALL them,
whereas with functions you SELECT them.

82
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.360
So we can invoke this
procedure whenever we want to.

83
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.933
And that is that's it.

84
00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:22.160
Now you might ask me when would you ever
use a procedure instead of a function

85
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.538
because everything I just showed you
you could obviously do with a function.

86
00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:29.782
I don't know there's not really
a good reason procedures

87
00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:33.890
have just been around for a long time so
people expect them to be there.

88
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.599
There's a bunch of stuff
that's built on procedures.

89
00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.508
They are more limited so if you believe
in like the principle of least power

90
00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:44.669
right we try to use the least powerful
thing that it can accomplish what you're

91
00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.707
trying to do procedure would be that.

92
00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:50.020
Frankly if it was me I probably
wouldn't put any of this in my.

93
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.735
If I wouldn't make a procedure,

94
00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:54.749
I wouldn't make a function I
would just have my code do it.

95
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.255
I'd write some sort of lambda that
would just query the database and

96
00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:01.147
then update all those things
because again if this lives

97
00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:03.977
in your database it's not
in your source control it's

98
00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:07.688
really hard to track that business
logic outside of your application.

99
00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:10.910
So I don't really suggest it,
but I wanted to know it's there.

100
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.810
It is kind of fun.

101
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.769
And when I'm doing stupid projects for
myself,

102
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.690
I really like to write
stupid things like this.

103
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.918
&gt;&gt; Can you call functions and

104
00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:24.996
starred procedures from other
functions and starred procedures?

105
00:06:24.996 --> 00:06:27.870
&gt;&gt; Yes you you can call you can do both.

106
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.841
I don't know, I assume you can
call a function from a procedure.

107
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:36.880
You can definitely call
a procedure from a function.

108
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.920
Vice versa I'm less sure.

109
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.281
That seems like a cascading
effect of terror.

110
00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:46.919
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

111
00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.460
&gt;&gt; But it's it sounds plausible.

112
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.730
Yeah, question Dustin.

113
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.092
&gt;&gt; If a procedure or
function has to update millions of rows,

114
00:06:57.092 --> 00:06:59.150
will it be a blocking operation?

115
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.625
&gt;&gt; It's let me answer that
with a hand wavy response,

116
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:09.550
which is it's not any different than
just calling a function, right?

117
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.640
So if you have some sort of function
that's going to tie up your database

118
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.083
doing it through a procedure a function
is also going to tie up your database.

119
00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:22.019
So the call the way it's called isn't
going to make a difference in that

120
00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:23.079
particular case.

121
00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:27.303
The performance profile does not change
coming from a procedure function or

122
00:07:27.303 --> 00:07:28.495
just a normal query.

123
00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:32.638
If you're in those kind of cases where
you are like updating a lot of things and

124
00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:35.670
alter tables, and things like that.

125
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.860
You need to be more thoughtful
than just writing a big query.

126
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.090
You kind of have to do that
piecemeal through code.
