00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.477
Welcome to Complete Intro to SQL.

2
00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:04.329
I am Brian Holt.

3
00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:05.819
Or Complete Intro to SQL,

4
00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.420
I know I'm gonna get people upset
about how to pronounce that.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.237
I will probably say both cuz I have
no consistency in my life, but

6
00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:15.511
that's between me and my therapist.

7
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.488
Anyway, let's click on
the Introduction here.

8
00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:27.222
Well, first of all, actually I want you
to go to sql.holt, H-O-L-T, .courses.

9
00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:30.193
That'll take you to this website here.

10
00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:31.909
This is literally all of my course notes,

11
00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.125
this is everything I'm gonna
be teaching you today.

12
00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.679
I have two computers here because I teach
from this one and I read from this one.

13
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:39.741
I have my notes up here.

14
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:43.689
So if you fall behind or
if you wanna review something, or

15
00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:49.055
if you wanna share this with your friend,
this site is open and free forever.

16
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:53.233
Okay, so now we've done that,
we're gonna click on the Introduction.

17
00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:56.888
Just to show you how this kind of works,
up here in the top right,

18
00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:58.862
you see WELCOME, INTRODUCTION.

19
00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:01.679
This is the name of the section,
this is the name of the lesson.

20
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.180
So that if you jump ahead or if you fall
behind, or if you just wanna know where I

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.572
am, you can just see that Welcome
Introduction, Welcome Introduction.

22
00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:14.086
It matches up so you can kind of use
a breadcrumb to find where you are.

23
00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:16.688
And with that, let's get into
the introduction to this course.

24
00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:19.739
My name is Brian Holt.

25
00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.667
I've taught too many courses here,

26
00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:27.210
I literally can't count how
many times I've been here.

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.867
And I wanna teach you about SQL today.

28
00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:34.520
So SQL, it's a language.

29
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.862
It's not necessarily programming language
though you'll see here in a little bit,

30
00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:43.348
you can kind of turn it into
a programming language, but

31
00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:46.259
there's an incredible
amount of depth here.

32
00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.447
And I think that makes it seem
a little unapproachable to people.

33
00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:52.876
It seems like they have to learn this
entire new programming language, but

34
00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:55.054
in reality you can get, I would say,

35
00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:59.081
almost all the benefit of SQL with
a very small subset of knowledge.

36
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:02.331
Don't get me wrong, there's people
that have decades of experience here,

37
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.684
they can do wild things with it.

38
00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:07.433
We're not going there today,
I'm trying to get you something really,

39
00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:08.487
really practical.

40
00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:12.283
And I guess that's kind of one of
the first points I wanna hammer on,

41
00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:14.159
this is a course for developers.

42
00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.903
I'm not gonna teach you how to replicate,
I'm not gonna teach you how to deploy,

43
00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:24.245
I'm not gonna teach you how to
manage instances of Postgres.

44
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:29.002
You wanna learn that from a DBA or from
an Ops person, and I am neither of those.

45
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.363
What I am going to teach you today is if
you're a developer and you wanna write

46
00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:35.145
queries to an SQL database, or
you need to create some tables or

47
00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:38.527
need to model some data, that's stuff
that we're gonna talk about today.

48
00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:41.863
So yeah, here's kind of some examples
of things you're gonna learn,

49
00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:45.213
how to set up databases and tables,
what's gonna go into your tables?

50
00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:48.052
We're gonna run it just
the smallest bit of Node.js today,

51
00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:51.348
cuz I actually wanted to get your
hands on code, querying a database.

52
00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:53.515
If you don't know Node, that's fine,

53
00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.521
you can just kind of follow
along those kinds of things.

54
00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.352
So who is this course for?

55
00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:02.757
It's for you, hopefully.

56
00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:06.715
The things that I will suggest that you
know before you take this course it'll be

57
00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:07.615
really helpful.

58
00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:11.111
Just Internet fundamentals,
there's a great course from Jen from

59
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.117
Frontend Masters that goes over
how the Internet works and

60
00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:17.638
a bunch of stuff like that,
it's very good to have that done first.

61
00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:20.287
Some basic coding abilities
will be really helpful.

62
00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:24.042
If this is your very first coding
class ever, that's gonna be hard.

63
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:27.408
It's probably still possible,
to be honest with you, but it'll be hard.

64
00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.841
And then a little Node.js
would go a long ways.

65
00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:33.012
And I linked three different
FrontendMasters courses here for

66
00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.998
you to kind of brush up on those, yeah.

67
00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.605
&gt;&gt; What about Jen's full-stack?

68
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:39.835
&gt;&gt; What about Jen's full-stack course?

69
00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:41.234
I mean, it's a great course.

70
00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:46.154
I don't think you need to take it
before you take this course, you could.

71
00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:49.435
I guess Jen does talk a little
bit about Node.js, right?

72
00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:53.589
&gt;&gt; He talks about everything, like how
the Internet works, basics of sysadmin,

73
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.019
all those kinds of things.

74
00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.999
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
if you wanna get more of that direction,

75
00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.040
certainly that course
would be really helpful.

76
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.609
So your setup, I have tested this
both on Mac OS and on Windows 10.

77
00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.677
And if it works on Windows 10,
it should work on Windows 11.

78
00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:12.094
And if you're doing this on Linux, you
probably already know what everything I'm

79
00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:15.077
about to tell you so
you can just ignore me at this point.

80
00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:18.507
I'm kidding, you can follow the Mac OS
instructions and that'll work for

81
00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:19.330
Linux just fine.

82
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.263
You won't need a particularly
powerful computer for this.

83
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.188
I would recommend about 8 gigs of RAM.

84
00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:29.045
That's probably the thing that's
gonna get you the most, but

85
00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.092
you could probably do this on 4.

86
00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:34.749
2 would be hard, but
you could probably do this on 4.

87
00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.834
You will need to use Docker,
you don't have to know Docker.

88
00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:41.083
If you would like to know Docker,
I teach a whole course on Docker for

89
00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:44.392
Frontend Masters, but I will give
you all the Docker instructions.

90
00:04:44.392 --> 00:04:47.023
This is not a Docker course.

91
00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:50.422
You do not have to use Visual Studio Code,

92
00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:55.764
though I will be using it, and
I will show you a couple of tricks for

93
00:04:55.764 --> 00:05:01.127
it just throughout the course,
I used to work on it, so I like it.

94
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:06.705
People always ask me about my setup, so I
put it in here, but the font is MonaLisa.

95
00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:09.894
I just use the default Dark+ theme.

96
00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:14.225
I use iTerm2, and
then this vscode-icons extension.

97
00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:17.220
So if you wanna come back later and
you're wondering how I set things up,

98
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.263
it's all linked there.

99
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:24.811
Where to file issues,
there is a repo here.

100
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:31.410
So if you open this,
this is the course website here.

101
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.362
So here you can open issues,
you can open pull request.

102
00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.013
I'm going to ask you,
if you have questions, don't message me.

103
00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:41.529
Put them on the repo because then later
if someone else has the same question,

104
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.971
they can Google it and
find it in the repo.

105
00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.390
And pull requests are very welcome,
particularly cuz I always have a ton of

106
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.514
spelling and
grammar mistakes on my courses.

107
00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:52.617
So there's another course on Frontend
Masters which I'll pull up really quick

108
00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:55.361
here, that I taught previously
called Complete Intro to Databases.

109
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.205
This is all still current and useful.

110
00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.327
This covers four different
types of databases.

111
00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:07.556
This is more comparative of, I'm
thinking about this problem that I have,

112
00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:10.098
how should I model the data, right?

113
00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:12.642
And so it goes over an SQL
database which is Postgres, right?

114
00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:18.331
So this section here is going to largely
overlap with what I'm gonna teach today,

115
00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:21.636
but we're gonna go into
much more depth today.

116
00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:25.769
But this class also goes
into graph databases,

117
00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:30.121
Key-Value Stores,
as well as NoSQL databases.

118
00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:33.633
Specifically it goes into MongoDB,
Postgres.

119
00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:38.028
This is Neo4j, and then this is Redis.

120
00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:41.679
So this much more like a higher
level comparing use NoSQL for

121
00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:45.916
these kinds of problems, use Postgres for
these kinds of problems,

122
00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:48.856
use Redis for
these kinds of problems, right?

123
00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:53.231
Whereas this class is specifically
teaching you in-depth SQL so

124
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:55.227
that you can work with an SQL.

125
00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:57.633
You've already decided
to use an SQL database.

126
00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:01.940
This one is going to help you choose
that you wanna use an SQL database,

127
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.327
that makes any sense.

128
00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:07.176
My name is Brian, and I work at Stripe.

129
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:12.163
Specifically at Stripe I am
the product owner of the Stripe SDKs,

130
00:07:12.163 --> 00:07:16.516
the Stripe VS Code extension,
the Stripe React Native,

131
00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:21.251
Eexperience, the CLI,
a bunch of developer tools, right?

132
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:23.365
So that's kind of the theme
of my entire career.

133
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:26.669
For the most part,
I've worked on developer tools.

134
00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.384
Previous to being at Stripe I worked
on VS Code and I worked on Azure.

135
00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.959
I was the owner of JavaScript on Azure.

136
00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.614
And then before that I was a Node.js and

137
00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:39.581
JavaScript frontend developer for
a decade.

138
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:42.113
I worked at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit.

139
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.204
I started teaching at Frontend Masters
when I worked at Reddit.

140
00:07:44.204 --> 00:07:48.258
So that's been coming up
on a decade of me teaching

141
00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:52.419
in Frontend Masters which
is crazy to think about.

142
00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:56.667
I've written a lot of code and
queries over the years.

143
00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.726
I started coding probably
around when I was ten.

144
00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:03.051
My brother made me write code before
he'd let me play video games, so

145
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:07.242
I'm both still upset at my brother and
also thankful cuz here I am.

146
00:08:07.242 --> 00:08:09.794
But I'm gonna tell you right now that
you can learn these skills at any

147
00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:10.420
point, right?

148
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.056
You can be 16 starting this, you can
be 5 when you can be starting this.

149
00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:15.931
I don't know five,

150
00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:19.440
I don't know if I'm gonna teach my
five-year-old how to write queries in SQL.

151
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.582
I don't know, maybe if he's bad.

152
00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:25.961
When I really started writing a lot
of serious SQL was my internship,

153
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:29.393
where I had to query
these really archaic and

154
00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:33.401
weird databases using SQL,
which taught me a lot.

155
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.622
And then over the years at Reddit,
I wrote a lot of queries.

156
00:08:36.622 --> 00:08:41.192
At Netflix,
it's kind of been a theme throughout all

157
00:08:41.192 --> 00:08:45.163
my career to use SQL in
various incantations.

158
00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:49.074
I didn't start using Postgres
until I worked at Reddit.

159
00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:53.563
Before that was mostly MySQL, but you'll
see that while most of the things that

160
00:08:53.563 --> 00:08:57.061
we're gonna talk about today
are very specific to Postgres.

161
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:00.460
A lot of these skills are generally
applicable across all in any SQL

162
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.324
databases, and
we'll talk about that in a little bit.

163
00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:04.193
I live in Seattle.

164
00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:08.331
I like to travel,
hang out with my wife and my new kid.

165
00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:12.232
And yeah, that's me.

166
00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:17.464
Feel free to catch up with me on
social media, all my links are there.

167
00:09:17.464 --> 00:09:21.526
And the last thing I always ask people
is if you can give this repo a star,

168
00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:23.851
it helps people find it, which is cool.

169
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.836
It also pads my ego which
needs help sometimes.

170
00:09:27.836 --> 00:09:31.836
&gt;&gt; What's the secret of mastering
all these skills, like databases and

171
00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:33.268
frontend development?

172
00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:34.962
&gt;&gt; It's a good question.

173
00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:40.042
Kind of the theme of my career's I've
worked all over the stack, right?

174
00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:45.138
I went all the way from working on
pure frontend application sometimes.

175
00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:46.993
Did that at Reddit and Netflix,

176
00:09:46.993 --> 00:09:51.335
all the way to working on lower levels
of the stack and doing backend stuff.

177
00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:54.123
I did that at LinkedIn and also Netflix,

178
00:09:54.123 --> 00:09:59.292
all the way down to I worked on
Cloud Infrastructure at Microsoft, right?

179
00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:03.700
And now I do product management stuff and
business stuff at Stripe.

180
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.236
And the thing that's been
critical to my success in me

181
00:10:07.236 --> 00:10:12.187
learning all these various different
tools is that, I learn by teaching,

182
00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:15.112
and that's just kind of my learning style.

183
00:10:15.112 --> 00:10:19.281
When you're teaching, you are forced to
kind of reduce your knowledge down to

184
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.653
a common vocabulary between the person
that you're trying to communicate with.

185
00:10:23.653 --> 00:10:28.415
Which means that you have
to break down these things

186
00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:32.629
that you kind of hand
wave over in your brain.

187
00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:36.118
And you have to kinda open the box and see
what's inside of it and understand what

188
00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:39.415
are those primitives because you know
people are gonna ask you questions.

189
00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:42.679
And you have to kind of provide for
those questions in advance.

190
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:46.719
So in other words, a lot of it's
from experience, and secondly,

191
00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:51.193
I've taught a lot of people, both
teaching workshops to my coworkers and

192
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:54.894
doing in Frontend Masters and
doing conference workshops.

193
00:10:54.894 --> 00:10:58.782
Doing all that teaching really helps
solidify these kind of basic primitives

194
00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:03.046
in my brain, that I used to build backup
into more complicated higher level things.

195
00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:07.850
&gt;&gt; Should I take the Intro to Databases

196
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.481
course before this or-
&gt;&gt; No, so

197
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:15.656
the complete Intro to Databases,
like I said it's kind of a different

198
00:11:15.656 --> 00:11:20.538
approach to a similar thing where it kind
of teaches you how to model problems, and

199
00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:23.482
what kind of database to use for
each one of them.

200
00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:30.172
This one has no dependency on
complete intro to databases.

201
00:11:30.172 --> 00:11:34.161
This is its own thing, so
you do not have to take that one before.

202
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.906
In fact, if you take this one before for
the most part,

203
00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:39.783
you could probably skip the SQL
section in the other one.

204
00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:45.667
This one is gonna have more depth than
the complete Intro to Databases as well.

205
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:47.574
Yeah, Dustin.

206
00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:50.425
&gt;&gt; Do I have to download Docker for
this course?

207
00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:53.797
&gt;&gt; You must download Docker in this
course, it's literally the next section.
