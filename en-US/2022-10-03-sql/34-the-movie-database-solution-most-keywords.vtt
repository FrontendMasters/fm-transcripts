00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.362
We have the Movie Keywords table,
we have the Categories table.

2
00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:09.646
So you have to start from movies,
then go to movie keywords,

3
00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:12.762
which is a connecting table to categories.

4
00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.813
So you have to go from movies,
to movie keywords, to categories.

5
00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:26.334
So we're gonna say SELECT m.name,
movies.name.

6
00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:30.758
And then we're gonna do a COUNT(

7
00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:35.502
c.id) from categories AS COUNT.

8
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:39.532
So, this is gonna be how
many different categories

9
00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:42.726
are associated with one movie, right?

10
00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:46.604
We're gonna start from Movies m.

11
00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:48.119
There's other ways to write
this query by the way.

12
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:53.044
This is not the only way you could do it,
just the way that it occurred to my brain.

13
00:00:53.044 --> 00:01:02.450
INNER JOIN Movie_keywords mk.

14
00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:12.908
ON mk.movie-id = m.id

15
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.866
INNER JOIN categories

16
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.280
On.

17
00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:31.459
Mk.category_id = c.id.

18
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.462
So movie category id
equals the category id.

19
00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:39.601
Good, so far we're gonna

20
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.498
GROUP BY m.id, and m.name.

21
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:52.989
ORDER BY Count descending,

22
00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.092
there should be no nulls in here, right?

23
00:01:56.092 --> 00:02:00.202
So I don't have to do the nulls last
because the count is always gonna return

24
00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:00.796
a number.

25
00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:04.859
And you can limit here by
however you many want.

26
00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.307
Let's do 15.

27
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.665
Let's check to make sure that works.

28
00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:22.528
So this is what I I'm getting for
movies that have the most keywords.

29
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:25.942
I look some of these up.

30
00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:31.685
This is, I think it said, Croatian or
according to Google Translate.

31
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:36.465
This one was, what we decided,
was Hindi, right?

32
00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:39.246
And a bunch of these came back as Hindi.

33
00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:45.146
Mogambo came back as Basque,
which I'm gonna guess may not be correct.

34
00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:47.613
It could be Basque.

35
00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:51.509
Three Idiots, I'm guessing that's English.

36
00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:57.154
I don't know what that is,
anyone know what that is?

37
00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.068
Kind of look cool script.

38
00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.465
&gt;&gt; It looks like Hebrew.

39
00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:02.713
&gt;&gt; I don't think that's Hebrew.

40
00:03:02.713 --> 00:03:07.505
Anyway, those are the movies that have
the most categories associated with them.

41
00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:14.971
So, if this was my database and I was
running a website with it, I would look

42
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:19.949
at this and say, does that one Croatian
film really need 200 categories?

43
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.171
That's probably more
than a category a minute.

44
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:28.725
[LAUGH] I have a strict rule that you
cannot have more than a category a minute.
