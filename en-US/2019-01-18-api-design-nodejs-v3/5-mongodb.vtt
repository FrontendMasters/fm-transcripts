00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.110
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, MongoDB.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.951
Its basically the goal
to non-relational DB and

3
00:00:05.951 --> 00:00:08.790
for me it just works so well.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.020
Its like, its a given.

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.019
It's the first database
that I learned how to use.

6
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.110
It's not the the only that I used but
its just so easy.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.490
Especially the tools that come with it.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.970
So it's a non-relational document store.

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.830
So to compare that to
a relational database, and

10
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.150
I'm sure most of you have used Postgres or
SQL.

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.250
It's not relational, so basically
what that means is it doesn't really

12
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.330
care about how data relates to each other.

13
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.330
It's basically just storing JSON
in a blob like here you go.

14
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.190
In Postgres you can store a JSON now.

15
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.200
So imagine it like, the whole database
is like that, you could just store JSON.

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.550
So that might seem scary, because it is,

17
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.040
because you can do that,
that doesn't mean you should do that.

18
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.300
That's just what Mongo allows you to do,

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.820
is just throw this data in here,
and just be free.

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.990
But that doesn't mean you should do it.

21
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.160
I highly recommend not doing that,
and we'll talk about that later.

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.620
But it does make it easy to get
started because it is like that and

23
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.080
you don't have to define different
lists of columns and things like that.

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.800
You can just throw JSON in your database.

25
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.620
It is open source and it's backed
by the company that created it,

26
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.740
the MongoDB company, or
whatever their name is.

27
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.930
But yeah, they're called MongoDB,
they're like a public company and

28
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.310
they have tons of products.

29
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.660
So it's not going there anytime soon like
other databases that have come and go.

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.870
So it's gonna be here for a while.

31
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.290
Like I said,
as far as non-relational databases go,

32
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.460
it's definitely the biggest one.

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.560
And I don't think it's gonna
go anywhere any time soon.

34
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.350
Tons of hosting solutions,
I talked about one earlier.

35
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.140
MLAB is one.

36
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.430
Compass is another one.

37
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.150
The people who created MongoDB,
Atlas, is another one.

38
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.570
And there's more popping up every day.

39
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.420
I'm sure Atlas is probably gonna buy
them all, but they're popping up.

40
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.410
So yeah, you have tons of solutions
whether if you're on AWS,

41
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.850
if you're on DigitalOcean, if you're on,
wherever you're hosting your stuff,

42
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.720
there's going to be options for
you to get some cloud hosting for MongoDB.

43
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.000
If not, it's open source,
you can host it yourself.

44
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.100
If you want to manage it, your own
replica sets and do all that stuff,

45
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.235
you can totally do it.

46
00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.005
It's open source.

47
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:11.885
Everything is there.

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.616
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: One of my favorite things
about MongoDB that we're gonna be using in

49
00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.175
this course is the ORM, or
ODM is what they call it.

50
00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:24.305
So the object relational mapper or
their object data modeler,

51
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.205
or object data mapper,
whatever that stands for.

52
00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:30.055
But it's basically the JavaScript
representation of how we

53
00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:32.560
interact with the models in the database.

54
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.490
If you have an orm for SQL or postgres,
this is the equivalent of that but

55
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.490
in mongo and it's called Mongoose, or

56
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.750
at least that's the one
that we're gonna be using.

57
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.717
There's tons of them, but

58
00:02:41.717 --> 00:02:44.205
that's the one that we're going to
use it because it's the best one.

59
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:48.378
And it's so good that a lot of
databases actually copy its API,

60
00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:52.237
like I've seen so
many database copy the API of Mongoose,

61
00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:57.380
like this is really cool we're gonna
copy this and it's really that good.

62
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.170
So I like it.
