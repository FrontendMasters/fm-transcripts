00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:02.320
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So yeah, so
now that we have the CRUD,

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.935
we know a route combination adheres
to some type of CRUD, right?

3
00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:09.006
So if I were just to map
those out very quick,

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.170
I'm just gonna write some pseudocode here.

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.512
If I were to map those out, I know a GET
request to a /, that would be a create.

6
00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:25.550
I know a GET request to a / id would
also be a create, I'm sorry, not create.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.050
That would be a read.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.100
A GET request to a / id would also be
a read, but it would be a read one.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.616
So I'll just put that.

10
00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:37.590
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is like read many.

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.059
If I did a POST request to a /,

12
00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.740
that's gonna be a create one.

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.128
If I did a PUT request to a / id,
that's gonna be an update one.

14
00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:57.359
And if I did a DELETE request to a / id,

15
00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.809
that's gonna be a delete one.

16
00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:05.402
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So knowing all that,

17
00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:11.012
if we already made the routes that already
create this routing logic, then all

18
00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:16.470
we gotta do is add these queries inside
of our controllers that change that.

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.670
So for the create, for
the GET one, which is read many,

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.122
then I would come over here and say,
okay, for read, we have a model.find.

21
00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:26.010
That's gonna read many.

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.490
So I will use that one
inside of that controller.

23
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.490
For a read one,
I would use model.findOne or findById.

24
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
In this case, we have an id in the URL,
so I would use that id in the URL.

25
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.970
So that's how we get that one.

26
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.050
So that's how all that stuff works.

27
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.210
But because we're gonna generalize them,
what you're gonna do is you're gonna go

28
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.204
down into,
there's a file here called crud.js.

29
00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:55.313
And inside of there, that's where we're
gonna generalize these controllers to

30
00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:58.014
work for
all of the resources that are there.

31
00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:00.485
And then you won't have to create one for
every single one.

32
00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.884
So that's what we're gonna
do in the next exercise.
