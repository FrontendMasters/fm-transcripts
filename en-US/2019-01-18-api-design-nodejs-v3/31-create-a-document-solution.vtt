00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.212
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So for a createOne,
this one creates a new document.

2
00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:13.040
Okay, so, and it says the createdBy
should be the authenticated user.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.320
So it's gonna create a new document.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.710
And the createdBy filled on that document
should be the authenticated user.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.570
So you have to keep that in mind.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.490
So what I'll do, is I'll say,
doc = await model.create,

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.730
because remember, that's how we create
what current model is, that create method.

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.720
And then, we pass in the body, or
whatever is being posted to our server,

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.820
cuz the create one's gonna
be used on a post request.

10
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.405
And we know on a post request, we're gonna
be getting information on some type of

11
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.510
rec.body, which is what we
did earlier on the day.

12
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.580
So if I say I wanna create based
on whatever the rec.body is,

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.550
that's halfway there.

14
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.090
Because whatever's being
sent up to the server,

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.860
that's definitely what we wanna create.

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.880
But, we also wanna use
the authenticated user's created by,

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.590
which is not going to be on this payload.

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.200
So instead, what we'll do, is we'll just
do an object spread here right quick.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.470
And we'll say req.body.

20
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.400
And then, we need to add createdBy,
which is gonna be req.user._id,

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.760
which is what it's been for the last two.

22
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.610
So that's gonna create
an object with the body.

23
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.180
And then, override the createdBy field to
be whatever the authenticated user is.

24
00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:29.880
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we'll do that.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.111
And then,
we'll say rest.status200.jason doc.

26
00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:42.018
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes?

27
00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:47.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Once you return your data,
your structure again?

28
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.180
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes.

29
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.190
Yes, I will, thank you.

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.900
I just technically posted a question
a bit 201, but 200 is good.

31
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.250
So now, if I run this test, maybe,
my test is asking for a 201, let's see.

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm unfamiliar
with that dot dot dot.

33
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.430
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Dot dot dot?

34
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.660
So that's an object spread.

35
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.180
That's basically the same as merging
an object or extending an object.

36
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.008
That's the same as if I had an object, and
I said, if I had a function called extend,

37
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:27.800
that extended that this object,
with this objects, with this object.

38
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.434
It's the same thing, wherever the furthest
to the right gets priority over the left.

39
00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:32.430
So whatsoever on the right,

40
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.170
is gonna overwrite any fields on
the left and return a new object.

41
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.760
So it's just a shortcut for extend.

42
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.200
It's called object spread.

43
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020
But yeah, that's basically it.

44
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.050
It doesn't go over cursively.

45
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.240
So it's not an emerge,

46
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.420
like if you had nested fields,
it won't smartly merge those,

47
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.360
it'll just override the whole object,
so you still need to merge for that.

48
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.860
But for a flat copy, yeah, dot dot dot.

49
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.382
Pretty cool, okay, so let's scroll up.

50
00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:04.702
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so,
it looks like this one, like I said,

51
00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:09.298
it's expecting a 201 and not a 200,
and yeah, so we'll do that.

52
00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:11.530
Let's say 201 for a post request.

53
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.500
Cool, so if we scroll up,
we can see that those passed.
