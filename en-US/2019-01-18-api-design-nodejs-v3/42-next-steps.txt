[00:00:00]
>> Scott Moss: So the last thing I wanted to talk about was just next steps, what to do after this. You kinda learned how to put some stuff together, and build a RESTful API for the things that you need, as far as an express. Yes, there's other things in there that we didn't talk about.

[00:00:15]
They don't really have a lot to do with building RESTful APIs more than they had to do with like using a framework itself or setting up configuration and stuff like that. So feel free to look into the source folder and poke around. So there's other stuff there, but as far like RESTful API and APIs in general, some next steps I highly recommend looking into is one.

[00:00:38]
It's gonna be, if you're a big corporate company and you wanna look into a more opinionated framework, there's other frameworks out there other than Express. They literally build on top of what Express does and do other things. And there's other frameworks that sit side by side, so Hapi with a I is another REST framework that a lot of people use to build APIs.

[00:01:01]
It's got a lot of backers. So you could check that out, that's a really cool one. If you're gonna use other databases, yes you can use other databases. So PostGres, MySQL, MySQLY, whatever database you wanna use, you can totally use it. All the code, [COUGH] is exactly the same.

[00:01:16]
The only thing that changes for you is the models that you create, and the schemas and then how you use them in the controller. But the routes, everything else is exactly the same. You don't change any of that. You're just changing all your controllers. So just remember that.

[00:01:27]
You can even have multiple databases here. So in the next course, we're gonna be walking into intro to GraphQL servers and how to build those which are very similar to REST as in their interface for building APIs to consume. But in a completely different way, if you're familiar with graphs and grab databases you'll be familiar with graph QO.

[00:01:46]
So we're gonna be doing that which has some similarities, but also very completely different than REST. But also a very good way to get data. So we'll be doing that in the next course. Other than that, only other thing that I can think of, which would be really cool, is Insomnia, but I've already told you about that.

[00:02:06]
And yeah, that's it. Any questions about anything specific that came here in mind with that I didn't cover?
>> Speaker 2: And just for authentication, there's probably plenty, right?
>> Scott Moss: Man, there are tons of package authentication. So JSON, so JSON web token is the one that I was using. That's a really good one.

[00:02:26]
I highly recommend using it. The only thing about JSON web token is that you have to manually set all the stuff up like I did. If you don't wanna do all that, if you just look up mpmjwt, there's an express JWT right here that uses JSON web token and creates all that middle ware for you.

[00:02:42]
The whole protect middle ware that we had to write, this thing does it for you. So you don't have to write it. I just don't like using stuff like that. I'll just write it myself. But yeah, you can totally use this. You can see right now it does all that stuff for you automatically.

[00:02:54]
You don't have to do anything. So there's tons of authentication stuff out there. No, okay. All right, appreciate you coming, thanks.
