00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.525
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So Express,
anybody here use Express before?

2
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:08.539
All right, Nate,
you said you used Express.

3
00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.498
What did you build with Express before?

4
00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:14.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Ooh, let's see,
I've built a collaborative drawing app.

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.133
It's basically a,
it's like a little drawing game

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:23.290
where you start a picture and
send it to a friend.

7
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.520
And they can only see a clue of
the picture, and they have to finish it.

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.939
We used Express to build the different
routes to send image data back and

9
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.430
forth from the Mongo database.

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.700
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's awesome.
So without Express,

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.041
how difficult do you think it
would have been to build that API?

12
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Tooth pullingly difficult.

13
00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:44.428
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.

14
00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:49.895
And that's because Express is basically
like the standard API for Node.js.

15
00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.935
Without Express,
you could totally build an API.

16
00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:59.151
No, like, Express is not like something
that implements APIs for Node.

17
00:00:59.151 --> 00:00:59.978
It just makes it easier.

18
00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:04.818
Node has the ability to create its own
APIs with its own internal modules.

19
00:01:04.818 --> 00:01:08.550
It's just that it's
really difficult to do.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.672
I don't wanna say it's lower-level,
because there's definitely lower

21
00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.219
level implementations of
building APIs in other languages.

22
00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.041
But when compared to just
like what you can do in Node,

23
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.008
it's pretty low level as far
as like what you need to do.

24
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:21.417
And yeah, you can totally do it.

25
00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:24.382
But I highly recommend not doing it
because you'll just be building your own

26
00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:25.990
Express at the end of the day.

27
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.254
So you might as well just use something
that somebody else already made and

28
00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:31.019
maintains.

29
00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:36.799
So it handles all the tedious tasks, like
managing sockets, route matching, which is

30
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.710
a big one, error handling, which is very
sneaky in Node cuz it's single threaded.

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.364
And a lot more,
like delegating to controllers,

32
00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:50.024
handling async execution,
all types of things.

33
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.207
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It is open source so you
can just use it, you can contribute to it,

34
00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:55.315
it's pretty awesome.

35
00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:59.618
It has a huge community and support from
anything that has to do with APIs and

36
00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:00.314
Node.js.

37
00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:03.745
So basically what I'm saying is,
if there is a plugin or

38
00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:08.709
a library that you wanna use in your API,
if they, if that maintainer wants their

39
00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.350
project to be used they most likely
made it compatible with Express.

40
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.620
Cuz they know everybody uses Express.

41
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.068
So chances are the thing that you
wanna use is compatible with Express,

42
00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.320
if it's an API plugin or
something like that.

43
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.013
For instance, if you need it to
add rate limiting to your API and

44
00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.982
you wanted to do it on that level,
yeah, chances are if you go look,

45
00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:31.624
NPM rate limiting,
it's gonna be compatible with Express.

46
00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:33.428
Not saying you should be doing
rate limiting on Express.

47
00:02:33.428 --> 00:02:35.240
You should do that higher
level somewhere else.

48
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.961
But yeah, it's gonna be compatible.

49
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.945
Any questions?

50
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.717
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Nope, okay yeah, and
it's not going anywhere any time soon.

51
00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:50.615
It's like on version four and it's still
being upgraded, still being maintained,

52
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:51.490
so it'll be here.
