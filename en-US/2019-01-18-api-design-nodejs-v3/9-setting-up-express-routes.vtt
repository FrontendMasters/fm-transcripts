00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so now that you were
able to get your feet wet creating some

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.700
basic routes with Express,

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.330
I'm just gonna walk through
a slightly more complicated example.

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.827
So if we hop into server,
we're gonna go in here and say,

5
00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:18.846
let's just do a GET request to /data
this time instead of just doing slash.

6
00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:22.272
And it will go ahead and
make our controller function here.

7
00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.805
We'll pass in our two arguments,
the first being the request,

8
00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:27.384
second being the response.

9
00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:30.024
And then what we wanna do
is just serve up some data.

10
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.376
We'll just say response.send, and

11
00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:37.987
we'll just put a message here that says,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Hello, so

12
00:00:37.987 --> 00:00:43.020
now that we have some data sending there,
and then we'll do another one for post.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.094
So we'll do a post request
here to the same route.

14
00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:51.290
And remember, I'm sorry,
to data, and although

15
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.370
that both of these have the same route
to /data, they're two different verbs.

16
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.450
So we're doing a get request to /data.

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.170
This one's on a post request to /data.

18
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.562
So it's a different match here.

19
00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.506
So we won't have any conflicts here.

20
00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:04.680
So we'll do a request,
we'll do a response.

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.686
And in this case, let's just know that
the body that's being sent to this

22
00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:17.164
post request is gonna be attached to
a property called body on request object.

23
00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.161
And we'll talk more about that
in the future lessons, but

24
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:20.190
that's gonna be free for us.

25
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.830
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
go ahead and just send that back.

26
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.096
So I'm just gonna say res.send,
and then I'll say req.body.

27
00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:35.760
And that will go ahead and
send back the body that was sent to us.

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.850
And the next thing we have
to do is start the server.

29
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.470
So we'll go down to the start
function that we have.

30
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.353
I will say app.listen, and
it'll listen on port 3000.

31
00:01:47.353 --> 00:01:49.140
And we'll run our callback function here.

32
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.155
And just to put a log in here,
just so we know our server's running,

33
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.346
we'll say server on port 3000.

34
00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:58.850
So now we go ahead and
start the server and we run a yarn dev.

35
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.107
Or if you're doing NPM, npm run dev.

36
00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:07.456
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And if you scroll down,
you can see servers on port 3000.

37
00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.910
So let's head over to Insomnia.

38
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.670
And we need to change this to
a get request to /data, and

39
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.680
we'll go ahead and run this.

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.160
And you can see I get
back the message hello,

41
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.020
which is what our REST
put in the server here.

42
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.474
So message hello.

43
00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.384
And then I would do a post
request to data and

44
00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:26.620
we should just get echoed
back what we post.

45
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.410
So post request here,
make sure we change that to /data,

46
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.305
and then we'll just send some data here.

47
00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:36.939
So let's just put an email.

48
00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:44.251
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: hello@hello.com, so
we'll send that email there, and

49
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:46.990
you could see we get that back echoed.
