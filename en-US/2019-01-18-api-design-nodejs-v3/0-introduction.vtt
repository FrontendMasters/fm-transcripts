00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.505
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is v3 of
the API Design in Node with Express.

2
00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:06.592
And the reason I wanted to
come back to teach it is, one,

3
00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.970
we got some really good feedback from V2.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.240
Also, things have changed as far as
the community and how APIs are built,

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.268
and then changed with me because I
actually use the stuff that I teach.

6
00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:22.199
And I learn every single day, and
I've just developed different ways and

7
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.480
different strategies to develop APIs and
I just wanted to share them.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.930
So it just made sense to come back and
then just teach it, so I'm back.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.700
So just to get things started,

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.780
the format of kinda how I teach
is normally just three things.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.740
So we'll have a repro that you
all will be following along.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.310
And every post gonna consist of things
like tests that you will have to get to

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.050
pass and instructions on what to do
that are gonna be based off the lessons.

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.490
And those lessons
are gonna be taught by me,

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.660
with some slides that
I'll be going through.

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.680
And then also I'll be live
coding some examples.

17
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.840
And then for dependencies what you're
gonna need is you're just gonna need Node,

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.170
at least version six.

19
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.750
If you don't have that already, just
at least have version six of Node, and

20
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.630
then MongoDB.

21
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.520
So just have those two things,
and you should be good.

22
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.180
If you don't MongoDB installed,
you do have two other options.

23
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.450
You can just use a free cloud
hosted provider like mLab,

24
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.190
which spins up a MongoDB for you for free.

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.440
There's other ones out there as well.

26
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.260
I just recommend that one cuz I've used
it before and it's easy to get started.

27
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.788
Or the third option is to
use MongoDB in memory,

28
00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.810
which is an NPM package you can install.

29
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.634
So if you go to NPM and
search for MongoDB memory server,

30
00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:37.293
you'll just NPM install that or
Yarn install that.

31
00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:40.557
And then you'll just scroll down to the
instructions where they talk about using

32
00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:41.330
it with Mongoose.

33
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.450
You probably know what Mongoose is yet,
but we're going to talk about that.

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.380
But yeah, if you were using that third
option, this is how you would use it, and

35
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.020
you can literally just copy and
paste this code.

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.214
But I highly recommend installing MongoDB,
that is the option that I recommend doing.

37
00:01:55.214 --> 00:02:01.680
All right, so now that we got that going,

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.620
you got Mongo, you got Node,
let's just hop right into it.

39
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.190
So I'm gonna head over to
some slides that I have here.

40
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.030
So again, API Design in Node with Express,
and this is gonna be v3.

41
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.490
So the slides,
you can follow along as well.

42
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.230
The link for
the slides are in the readme of the repro.

43
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.070
So if you wanna follow along,
just click that and you can.

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.330
Or you can just watch me,
and we're gonna keep going.

45
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.440
Any questions so far?

46
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:35.160
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, all right, is this
big enough, can everybody see this?

47
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.770
I've got glasses on so
I feel like I can see everything.

48
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.110
So I just wanted to check.

49
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.466
All right, all right, cool.

50
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:44.270
So first thing we're gonna talk
about is just the intro to

51
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.100
kind of some of the tools
we're using in this course.

52
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.540
We talked about something Express, you
heard me say something called Mongoose.

53
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.000
So we're just gonna do an overview of what
those tools are and those frameworks and

54
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.250
kind of where they are now and why we're
using them and how they work together.

55
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.380
So I think that's very important.
