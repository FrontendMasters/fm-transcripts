00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the last thing I wanted
to talk about was just next steps,

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.960
what to do after this.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.810
You kinda learned how to put
some stuff together, and

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.340
build a RESTful API for the things
that you need, as far as an express.

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.420
Yes, there's other things in
there that we didn't talk about.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.290
They don't really have a lot to
do with building RESTful APIs

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.070
more than they had to do with
like using a framework itself or

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.380
setting up configuration and
stuff like that.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.660
So feel free to look into
the source folder and poke around.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.097
So there's other stuff there,
but as far like RESTful API and

11
00:00:33.097 --> 00:00:38.404
APIs in general, some next steps I
highly recommend looking into is one.

12
00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:43.938
It's gonna be, if you're a big corporate
company and you wanna look into a more

13
00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:50.670
opinionated framework, there's other
frameworks out there other than Express.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.230
They literally build on top of what
Express does and do other things.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.700
And there's other frameworks
that sit side by side, so

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.490
Hapi with a I is another REST framework
that a lot of people use to build APIs.

17
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.590
It's got a lot of backers.

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.960
So you could check that out,
that's a really cool one.

19
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.830
If you're gonna use other databases,
yes you can use other databases.

20
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.020
So PostGres, MySQL, MySQLY,

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260
whatever database you wanna use,
you can totally use it.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.810
All the code, [COUGH] is exactly the same.

23
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.360
The only thing that changes for
you is the models that you create, and

24
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.740
the schemas and
then how you use them in the controller.

25
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.260
But the routes,
everything else is exactly the same.

26
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.120
You don't change any of that.

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.910
You're just changing all your controllers.

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.300
So just remember that.

29
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.743
You can even have multiple databases here.

30
00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:34.011
So in the next course, we're gonna be
walking into intro to GraphQL servers and

31
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:38.806
how to build those which are very similar
to REST as in their interface for

32
00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.631
building APIs to consume.

33
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:43.816
But in a completely different way,
if you're familiar with graphs and

34
00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:46.520
grab databases you'll be
familiar with graph QO.

35
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.410
So we're gonna be doing that
which has some similarities,

36
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.350
but also very completely
different than REST.

37
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.630
But also a very good way to get data.

38
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200
So we'll be doing that in the next course.

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.760
Other than that,
only other thing that I can think of,

40
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.130
which would be really cool, is Insomnia,
but I've already told you about that.

41
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.750
And yeah, that's it.

42
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.200
Any questions about anything
specific that came here in mind with

43
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.790
that I didn't cover?

44
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And just for authentication,
there's probably plenty, right?

45
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.860
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Man,
there are tons of package authentication.

46
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520
So JSON, so JSON web token
is the one that I was using.

47
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.100
That's a really good one.

48
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.920
I highly recommend using it.

49
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.880
The only thing about JSON web token
is that you have to manually set all

50
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.250
the stuff up like I did.

51
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.910
If you don't wanna do all that, if you
just look up npmjwt, there's an express

52
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.350
JWT right here that uses JSON web token
and creates all that middle ware for you.

53
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.740
The whole protect middle ware that we had
to write, this thing does it for you.

54
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.110
So you don't have to write it.

55
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.580
I just don't like using stuff like that.

56
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.030
I'll just write it myself.

57
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.700
But yeah, you can totally use this.

58
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.700
You can see right now it does all
that stuff for you automatically.

59
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.120
You don't have to do anything.

60
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.100
So there's tons of
authentication stuff out there.

61
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.731
No, okay.

62
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:04.305
All right, appreciate you coming, thanks.

63
00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.394
