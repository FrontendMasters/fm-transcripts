00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.567
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now that we're on 3,000,
I'm gonna go ahead and

2
00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:03.570
interact with our API.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.940
So to do that,
there's a lot of ways you can do it.

4
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.060
I mean, if you're just doing
a whole bunch of GET requests,

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.440
you can just go to the browser and
just type those URLs in the search bar or

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.820
whatever and just see what happens.

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.140
But we're doing some post requests too and
that's really hard to do from a URL bar.

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.380
So normally what people will do is they'll
use like some clients on their terminal,

9
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.970
all different types of things.

10
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.290
I've been using this tool called Insomnia,
which is very much like Postman,

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.470
if you ever used Postman before?

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.440
Yeah, I use Insomnia, which I think is
way better than Postman and it's free.

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.990
So, that's what I'm gonna use in today's
course to interact with the APIs that we

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.090
will be making.

15
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.780
And you can download that on the Internet.

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.710
So if we just go to Insomnia,
I shouldn't have Googled that.

17
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.830
Why did I do that?

18
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.080
[LAUGH] Insomnia api, there we go,
Insomnia REST Client.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.782
There's a Mac one here.

20
00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.800
It looks like it works for
Windows and Linux as well.

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.240
So everyone should be able to
download it if you want to.

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.750
If you prefer, you can use whatever
CLI tool that you want or Postman.

23
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.380
Doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.660
This is just how I interact with my APIs.

25
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.170
I like it because it has support for
GraphQL too, which is really cool.

26
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.350
So I'm gonna head over to Insomnia.

27
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.620
And this is what it looks like for me.

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.870
I have a dark theme on.

29
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.160
Yours might look different.

30
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.300
Might be a light theme.

31
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.000
Mine is a dark theme.

32
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.850
And I'm just gonna go ahead and add a new
route, a new request for our server.

33
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.447
I'm just gonna say get data.

34
00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:38.984
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I'll create that.

35
00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:42.380
And then I'll add the URL for our server.

36
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.440
Remember, I said it's gonna connect to
localhost on that part that we pass in.

37
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.170
So for us, it's gonna be localhost,
I put in port 3000.

38
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.139
So that'll be the url,
and then the path that I

39
00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.110
want to hit is just gonna be right here,
/root as in nothing.

40
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.380
So it's just gonna be
the entry point to the server.

41
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.310
So the url is just gonna be exactly this,
3000.

42
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.570
There's nothing after it.

43
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.190
It's just that.

44
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.260
So I'm gonna go ahead and
run that request.

45
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810
And it messed up because
I misspelled localhost.

46
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.680
So I'm gonna run that again.

47
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.840
And there you go.

48
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.950
We get our message.

49
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.690
Message, hello.

50
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.320
Which is exactly what I put here, or here.

51
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.870
So that's our GET request.

52
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.660
And then for the post requests
it's exactly the same thing so

53
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm just gonna copy this,
I'm gonna duplicate it.

54
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.083
And now I'm gonna change it to a post.

55
00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:46.410
And then I need to send
some data to the API.

56
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.950
So in this case in the Sami I can just
post a body if you're using any other

57
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.170
API tool to do a post request.

58
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.570
It's however, they allow you to send json.

59
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.280
This is where you would type in that json.

60
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.350
So in this case I can put whatever I want.

61
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.130
So I'm gonna change this to json.

62
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.690
I'm gonna say message.

63
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.190
Yeah.
It's gonna do that then I'm gonna send it.

64
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.600
So one thing to note is we got
back a message that says okay and

65
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.830
then we should see a log on
a server that says message.

66
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.060
Yo, and we do.

67
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.580
So that's what we sent, this message yo.

68
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.855
And we logged it right here on line 20.

69
00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:27.400
Rec.body.

70
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.510
And then we responded back with just
message ok which is what we got back here

71
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.210
in the response.

72
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.810
So it looks like our server's working.

73
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.230
We were able to get some data and
send some data.

74
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.400
So if you followed along you
should have this going, but

75
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.420
what I wanna do now is just take a ten
minute break and to give people time to

76
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.390
actually experiment with this and go
a little further, see if you can make some

77
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.929
more routes that aren't just slash,
maybe add some other stuff here.

78
00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.139
Some other stuff here,
see if you can maybe even break something,

79
00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.679
just experiment with
the express load of it.

80
00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.669
It's only gonna be ten minutes.

81
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.019
And then we'll continue
with our next lesson.
