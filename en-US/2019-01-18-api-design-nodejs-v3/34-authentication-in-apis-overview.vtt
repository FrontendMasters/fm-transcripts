WEBVTT

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All righty, so what good
would API be if we couldn't lock it down?

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.700
So that's what we're gonna talk about.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.650
We're gonna talk about authentication
with json web tokens or JWTs or

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.240
jots, whatever people want to call them.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.350
Anybody ever heard of those before, JWT?

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.990
Anyone ever used them?

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.740
Okay, there we go, that's good to know.

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.180
All right, yeah, so Auth basics.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I set them up,
but I don't actually use them.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.410
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] But you set them
up, and that's the most important part.

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.400
That's harder than using them.

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.380
Auth basics.

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.720
Basically you can never
truly protect an API.

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.550
I mean you just really can't.

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310
There just really isn't a way.

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.280
But requiring authentication
makes it a bit safer.

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.640
So yes,

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.340
you can lock down an API with JWTs or
something like that.

19
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.070
But at the end of the day, people
are gonna find a way to get to it anyway.

20
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.960
There's nothing, cuz your
vulnerability are gonna be your users.

21
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.090
They're always gonna be vulnerable, so
people can get to the API through them.

22
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.050
So there really is no way you can
lock it down because a person has to

23
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.370
use it eventually.

24
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.450
Or an application that you're using,
their application is insecure.

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.410
So either way,

26
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.690
your application is just gonna be
hacked by somebody if it wants to be.

27
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.600
So there really isn't a safe way,
but you can just make it harder for

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.300
them, and
that's what authentication is gonna do.

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.720
So authentication is controlling if
an incoming request can proceed or

30
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.806
not, that's basically it.

31
00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:36.510
Can this request go forward and
do what it's trying to do?

32
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.410
That's authentication at its finest.

33
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.760
At least in the context of
what we're gonna be doing.

34
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.950
Authorization is controlling if
an authenticated request has the correct

35
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.890
permissions to access a resource.

36
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.630
So after you even authenticate it,

37
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.940
we need to see if you're authorized
to do what you're asking to do.

38
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.490
Are you authorized to delete work spaces,
are you authorized to

39
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.070
change their credit card information,
although you are authenticated?

40
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.800
So that's the difference.

41
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.530
So that's like you're using like some
type of roles or something like that.

42
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.560
That's like authorization.

43
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.670
Identification is basically,
who is this requester?

44
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.540
What user is it, what application is it?

45
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.550
I need to identify what,
who this request is.

46
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.820
So, those are the three different things
when people, when I hear people say about

47
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.260
authentication, they're really
talking about all three of those.

48
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800
They're just summarizing
it with the word Auth.

49
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.100
So, that's basically what it is.

50
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.966
What we're going to be doing is,
yeah, basically all three of them.

51
00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.870
But we're gonna let JWTs do it for
us and you'll see how.
