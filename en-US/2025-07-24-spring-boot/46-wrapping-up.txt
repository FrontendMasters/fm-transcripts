>> Josh Long: Okay, my friends. Well, hopefully that kind of gets you where you needed to go. Hopefully, if you didn't know Spring before you do now. Hopefully you can see the possibilities. We've spent only a little bit of time together. I wish we had a lot more time in which we could like hang out and kind of answer questions or whatever.

[00:00:14]
But yeah, I think we did it. We did pretty good. We start off with the basics. We did a desk check. We looked at the things you need to be efficient in any context. We looked at building Spring apps writ large. We did a quick exercise there. We looked at beans and auto configuration and how Spring's component model works.

[00:00:35]
We then looked at how to make that really efficient and ruthlessly scalable with GRAALVM and virtual threads. We then looked at how to do bread and butter data access with Spring data and the Spring ecosystem there. Then we looked at how to do all the things you'd ever wanna do on the back end of an HTTP request, including GRPC, GraphQL, hypermedia, REST and so on.

[00:00:55]
And then of course, we looked today at. I don't even remember. We looked at integration. We looked at Kafka. We looked at building AI stuff. We looked at security and passkeys and webauthn and one time tokens and magic links. And what else did we do today? Anybody remember?

[00:01:09]
We did a good exercise this morning. That was a lot of fun. It's been a journey. I think we got somewhere though. It's been fun. I hope you had some fun. I hope you learned something. And as usual, I'm very happy to take questions now. And you know, eventually I have to go home and see that terrible, terrible dog.

[00:01:25]
I can't wait. Thank you.
