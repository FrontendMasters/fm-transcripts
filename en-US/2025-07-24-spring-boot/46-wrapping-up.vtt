00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.040
&gt;&gt; Josh Long: Okay, my friends.

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.160
Well, hopefully that kind of
gets you where you needed to go.

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.640
Hopefully, if you didn't know
Spring before you do now.

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.000
Hopefully you can see the possibilities.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
We've spent only a little
bit of time together.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.584
I wish we had a lot more time in
which we could like hang out and

7
00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:14.440
kind of answer questions or whatever.

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.560
But yeah, I think we did it.

9
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.080
We did pretty good.

10
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.520
We start off with the basics.

11
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.680
We did a desk check.

12
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.760
We looked at the things you need
to be efficient in any context.

13
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.790
We looked at building
Spring apps writ large.

14
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.230
We did a quick exercise there.

15
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.190
We looked at beans and auto configuration
and how Spring's component model works.

16
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.623
We then looked at how to make
that really efficient and

17
00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:40.230
ruthlessly scalable with GRAALVM and
virtual threads.

18
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.842
We then looked at how to do bread and
butter data access with Spring data and

19
00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:45.310
the Spring ecosystem there.

20
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.219
Then we looked at how to do all the things
you'd ever wanna do on the back end of

21
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.480
an HTTP request, including GRPC,
GraphQL, hypermedia, REST and so on.

22
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.520
And then of course, we looked today at.

23
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.400
I don't even remember.

24
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.720
We looked at integration.

25
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.600
We looked at Kafka.

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.920
We looked at building AI stuff.

27
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.270
We looked at security and passkeys and
webauthn and one time tokens and

28
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.960
magic links.

29
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359
And what else did we do today?

30
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.128
Anybody remember?

31
00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:10.440
We did a good exercise this morning.

32
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.320
That was a lot of fun.

33
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.200
It's been a journey.

34
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.360
I think we got somewhere though.

35
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.040
It's been fun.

36
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.160
I hope you had some fun.

37
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.200
I hope you learned something.

38
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.330
And as usual,
I'm very happy to take questions now.

39
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.530
And you know, eventually I have to go
home and see that terrible, terrible dog.

40
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.370
I can't wait.

41
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.410
Thank you.
