00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:03.369
&gt;&gt; Josh Long: Now I'm going to back
this change out because remember,

2
00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.582
this is supposed to be conversational,

3
00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:08.880
so you might do strongly typed
things in a specific case.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.855
But for this case I'm going to
make it conversational again.

5
00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:16.646
By the way, if you do this, remember to
register at GraalVM Native Image hint for

6
00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:20.880
this type, right,
because this needs to be reflected upon.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.185
Okay, content, so
now we've got our system,

8
00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:28.320
we've got the ability to find Prancer,
which is great.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.720
But what's the natural next step here?

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.360
The natural next step is gonna
be you want to adopt this dog.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.760
Surely you wanna take this dog
home as quickly as possible.

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.921
So we need to give the model the ability
to talk to your tools, to talk to your

13
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.840
local APIs, to ask questions about
scheduling a pickup for this dog.

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.360
Okay?

15
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.806
So let's create a patent pending,
super-unique,

16
00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:54.570
industry-unique dog adoption
scheduling thing, okay?

17
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.290
Scheduler.

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.010
Okay.

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.340
And we're going to have a method here that
given the dog ID and the dog name will

20
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.850
return a time when you can come and pick
up the doggo from a particular location.

21
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.530
Okay.

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.327
So plus three days or.

23
00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:11.571
No, not days.

24
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.450
Yeah, days.
Let's do that.

25
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.820
That way it's three days from now,
so we'll know whether this worked.

26
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm gonna say scheduling dogId and
dogName, okay?

27
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.470
I'm gonna export this as a tool.

28
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.233
Now, when your mom always told you
to use your words when you're angry,

29
00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.790
it's true for everything now, right?

30
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.791
If you want to do,
if you want to be a good programmer,

31
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.310
you also need to use your words, right?

32
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.350
So here's how we do that.

33
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.563
Schedule an appointment

34
00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:46.773
to pickup or adopt a dog at

35
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:52.800
a Pooch Palace location.

36
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.600
There we go.

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.483
And obviously this is one of those
cases where multi line strings in Java,

38
00:01:58.483 --> 00:01:59.760
long overdue.

39
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.720
I'm glad they're here, is really nice.

40
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.680
Okay, so that's my description.

41
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.350
And you know,
I'm going to annotate these tools as well.

42
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.394
I'll say the name of the dog, ToolParam,

43
00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:17.718
(description = "the id of the dog"), okay?

44
00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.530
That's terrible formatting.

45
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.570
There you go.
That's a little bit better.

46
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.330
Whatever.
Okay, so that's my tool.

47
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.710
I'm gonna tell my model to invoke
this method to answer the question,

48
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.530
when can I pick up this dog,
whenever it needs it, right?

49
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.813
So I'm going to provide
that as a tool here.

50
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:34.010
I'll just inject that in the constructor,
Scheduler.

51
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.780
And then down here, when I make this call,
I'll say Tools, Scheduler, okay, restart.

52
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.381
And also, like I said, I'm doing some
things as the default globally for all

53
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:49.140
uses of this chat client, and some are per
call site, and you can pick and choose.

54
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.140
I could have specified the tools
down here at the call site as well.

55
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.380
Just your preferences of lifetime and
scope and all that.

56
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.940
Okay.
Do you have any neurotic dogs?

57
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.900
Yes, we got Prancer.

58
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.540
Fantastic.

59
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.832
When can I adopt Prancer from

60
00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:12.130
the Minneapolis location?

61
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.830
Am I spelling that correctly, by the way?

62
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.510
Is there two P's or anything like that?

63
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.950
That would have been awkward.

64
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.190
Okay.

65
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.950
Whoops, forgot the quote.

66
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.135
Okay.
It says I can pick up Prancer on April

67
00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:37.560
26th, which is three days from now,
okay, so scheduling 45 and Prancer.

68
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.160
So the method,
the AI model was smart enough to know.

69
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.000
Okay, I need to call this method.

70
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.188
I need to give it the ID and the dog name,
and then I need to take the response and

71
00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:49.200
incorporate that into my response.

72
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.973
You can also return
strongly typed objects.

73
00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:54.011
I'm just returning a string to make it
easy to kind of grok what's going on

74
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.680
here, okay?

75
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.480
Okay, so this is all well and good.

76
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.709
This is tool calling.

77
00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.380
Super powerful.

78
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.649
Hopefully you can see you can let your
model talk to both your business logic

79
00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.140
through these tools and through your
data through the vector store and stuff.

80
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.652
That process, by the way, that pattern of
taking data that's in your database and

81
00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:15.197
using it to inform the response,
that's called RAG, R-A-G,

82
00:04:15.197 --> 00:04:17.660
retrieval-augmented generation, okay?

83
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.545
It's a very common pattern, and
90% of the use cases are just that, right?

84
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:25.370
When you hear about AI engineering,
it's doing stuff like that.

85
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.555
It's doing that and tool calling,
which I just showed you.
