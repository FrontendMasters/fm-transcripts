00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
&gt;&gt; Josh Long: My name is Josh Long.

2
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.960
I work on the Spring team as
a Spring developer advocate.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.040
I have been a former
Kotlin Google developer expert.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.360
I am a Java champion.

5
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.120
And look, we all do things that we're
not proud of sometimes, regrettably.

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.880
And I'm a YouTuber, okay?

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.720
So there's a, there's a YouTube
channel there called Coffee Software.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.520
It's not great.

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.118
It's not, it's not going to be
the best thing you do this year, but

10
00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:23.040
it won't be the worst.

11
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.290
I would almost guarantee that probably.

12
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.250
I mean, it's not.

13
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.930
Anyway, like.

14
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.010
And subscribe.
Do the thing right.

15
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.650
Join me there.

16
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.450
It's fun.

17
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.730
We can hang out.

18
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.970
I'm achingly online.

19
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.086
So should you have questions,
comments, feedback,

20
00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:38.387
whatever, you can find me on
email on the Blueskies there.

21
00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.450
And then, of course,
the Bird website, okay?

22
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.930
And then if you want to play the home
game, we have the code and it's all here.

23
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.490
So I would definitely make sure you.

24
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.730
If you're going to take a screenshot,
a shot of a screen, then this is the one.

25
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.240
Cuz this has a code that you're
gonna wanna follow along.

26
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.637
Not now, but you're going to want
to follow along as we go and

27
00:00:56.637 --> 00:00:58.320
kind of understand what's happening.

28
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.400
I'm not going to give you
too many specific exercises.

29
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.099
I did lay out everything in that git
repository so that each sort of lesson

30
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.023
has a corresponding folder and then you
can follow along in that folder and

31
00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.120
kind of see the finished code and so on.

32
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.566
When I talk about Spring, it's kind of
important to remember that Spring is a,

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:23.040
a technology that's been around since
2004 in its 1.0 GA incarnation.

34
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.880
It was early Access, people like me
were using it in 2003 and so on.

35
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.280
But it came from a book.

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.640
It came from Rod Johnson's book.

37
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.934
A guy named Rod Johnson,

38
00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:35.280
he wrote this book that talked
about a better way forward.

39
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.040
He wrote this book saying basically the
enterprise Java emperor had no clothes.

40
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.880
And this book, it espoused a better way
forward and it had a bunch of sample code.

41
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.530
That sample code became very popular and
it became what is now Spring Framework.

42
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.723
So this is one of the rare instances of
the documentation preceding the source

43
00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:53.570
code, right?

44
00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.490
And that has resulted in 20 plus
years of change and keeping up.

45
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.290
And the reason Spring is so predominantly
popular today is because it keeps up.

46
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.730
It's really good at what it does.

47
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.610
It's really good.

48
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.446
So this is mostly a back end technology,

49
00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:12.334
which is a little awkward Given that we're
at front end Masters, I think just today,

50
00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:15.530
in honor of Spring Boot,
we should rename it Backend Masters, okay?

51
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.810
Just today you can keep your front
end Masters after we're done.

52
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.010
This technology has been very,
very comprehensive.

53
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.810
It's kept up and I'll show you a little
bit of what you can do with it.

54
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.050
Right, let's just take
a little example here.

55
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.875
But just keep in mind, Spring has been
this thing that's been around for

56
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:36.210
20 years, plus it has a second
technology that came out in 2014.

57
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.490
So spring was already very, very
popular by the time 2014 rolled around.

58
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.199
By that point,

59
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.970
it was already the most well entrenched
technology in the Java ecosystem.

60
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.973
But it had begun to falter a little bit in
that it didn't have support for some of

61
00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:53.050
the opinions that you could get from
some of these other technologies, right?

62
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.970
We had seen at the time things
like Ruby on Rails, right?

63
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.530
Ruby on Rails came out, they talked
about convention over configuration.

64
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.037
This is the idea that you get some very,
very opinionated defaults, but

65
00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:04.970
as a result you can move very quickly.

66
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.087
The drawback, of course, to this is that
you're sort of stuck in whatever Rails

67
00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:10.610
that technology puts you on.

68
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.720
If you don't agree with it,
if you wanna undo or do a different thing,

69
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.090
then you're very much back to square one,
right?

70
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.297
So Spring Boot was looking for

71
00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.570
a way to sort of give you
the best of both worlds, right?

72
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.890
And it gives something
called AutoConfiguration.

73
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.850
We'll talk about all this in a bit.

74
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.803
But basically that technology
sparked a renaissance and

75
00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:30.000
it happened to coincide with Java
8's release back in 2014, right?

76
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.080
So these two technologies, I think they're
symbiotic, they needed each other.

77
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.576
Java 8 was a huge Java release and

78
00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:37.200
Spring Boot was a huge gain
in the backend technology.

79
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.280
And from that point, Java's mind share
has grown, you know what I'm saying?

80
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.000
It's gotten bigger relative to
where it was in 2013, for example.

81
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.640
So it's just been a very
interesting few years since then.

82
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.240
My goodness.

83
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.440
I mean, it's easier to talk about who
doesn't use Spring Boot at scale, right?

84
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.159
When you wanna build a big website and
you wanna scale, you're gonna use Spring,

85
00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.320
you're gonna use Java.

86
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.280
So I don't know that Twitter,
I don't think they're using Spring for

87
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.480
their core infrastructure, right?

88
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.120
I don't know.

89
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.145
I know Google doesn't,
because they came before Spring,

90
00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:12.000
before a lot of that stuff was there,
but everybody else does.

91
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.647
Literally everybody else, except for.

92
00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:15.000
No, Facebook, I forgot about them.

93
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.880
They're probably not using it.

94
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.800
They have this hackneyed stack based
on PHP about which we don't talk.

95
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.510
Okay, but, yeah, Netflix,
ebay, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba.

96
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.230
Every large hyperscaler on
the planet is using Spring.

97
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.110
And you can just confirm this by looking
for jobs in these various companies.
