00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.416
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
those of you who are online,

2
00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.506
you're already in the HTML Slack room.

3
00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:09.703
Those of you here in the classroom,
you can go on ahead and

4
00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:12.599
hop on here into Slack in the HTML room.

5
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.898
Take a look at that picture there.

6
00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.862
If you click on the link at the top here.

7
00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:21.957
That should open up and
a new tab where you'll see your picture.

8
00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:26.551
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
if you go on ahead and

9
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.895
just hit the download
button up here on the top,

10
00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:35.902
there's a download button
up here over that picture.

11
00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:39.023
That puts you in yet another view, okay?

12
00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:43.715
And so here all you need to do
is now right-click if you're on

13
00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:47.947
a Windows computer or
Ctrl-click if you're on a Mac.

14
00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.353
And then just pick Save As, Save Image As.

15
00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:59.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're gonna save
that right into your day1 folder.

16
00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:05.711
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make a new
folder inside of that.

17
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:07.164
Call it images.

18
00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.885
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so make a new
folder inside of the day1 folder.

19
00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:23.024
Call it images.

20
00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:26.305
And once you've done that, go on ahead and
save the picture right there.

21
00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:41.753
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Depending on how your
computer is set up, if you right-click on

22
00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:45.042
it and you say Save Image,
maybe it goes to your Downloads folder.

23
00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:49.014
If it does, look in your Downloads
folder and pull it out of there and

24
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:52.932
put it into your images folder
inside of your day1 folder, okay?

25
00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.847
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So by the time you're
done here, inside of your day1 folder

26
00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:03.355
on your computer, you should have
a folder here called images, and

27
00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:05.821
inside of that should be your image.

28
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:12.722
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so if we're
gonna link to an image from our computer,

29
00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:14.429
we can do that as well.

30
00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:19.325
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's put it on
our hobbies page, just for fun,

31
00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:21.021
if you have a hobbies page.

32
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.902
If you haven't managed to make a hobbies
page yet, don't worry about it.

33
00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:27.656
Just put it on your homepage
as you're continuing along.

34
00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:31.464
And,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

35
00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:36.149
I'm gonna once again put this
up at the top of my document.

36
00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.817
And so what do I need to type in
to put an image into my documents?

37
00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:45.995
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: IMG.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: IMG, right,

38
00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:48.754
then followed by what?

39
00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:49.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Source.

40
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.863
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Source.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Source, src =.

41
00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:56.959
All right, so here's the hard part.

42
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.541
What is my source for this image?

43
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.332
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Dot dot?

44
00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:07.219
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are there any of
those dot dot slashes involved?

45
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.296
Take a look at your file
structure over here on the side.

46
00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:14.203
We're in hobbies.html,
where do we wanna go?

47
00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.987
Hang on a second, where do we wanna go?

48
00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:18.726
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: We wanna go up.

49
00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:21.514
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Into the images folder,
right, which is at the same level.

50
00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:24.540
So we don't need any dot dot slashes,
right?

51
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.679
What do we need here?

52
00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:26.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Images.

53
00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:30.242
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Images, right, slash?

54
00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:30.943
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Filename.

55
00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:34.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the filename,
which is blog1.jpg.

56
00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:42.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, does everyone
understand why the path looks like that?

57
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.022
Let's talk about that for a minute.

58
00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.816
Why does it not start with HTTP?

59
00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:49.109
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Because it's
saved on your computer.

60
00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.482
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's on your computer, it's
part of this website, it's in a folder.

61
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:57.202
It's all part of the same website so we
don't any need of that HTTP stuff, right?

62
00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:57.906
Yes, Dylan?

63
00:03:57.906 --> 00:04:01.306
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Is there
an easy way to resize it?

64
00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:04.022
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The best way to resize
it will be in your image program

65
00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:04.895
whatever it is.

66
00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:06.201
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Okay, and then re-save?

67
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.935
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, re-save it, yeah.

68
00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:12.241
So if the image is the wrong size, you'll
wanna have software on your computer

69
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.344
that's designed to resize an image.

70
00:04:14.344 --> 00:04:19.732
Or there are lot of websites out there,
just Google for image resizing program.

71
00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:23.508
And there are tons of websites that
will resize that image for you, yes?

72
00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:25.932
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There are, I don't know
if you don't want me to mention this.

73
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.693
There are width and height attributes-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There are.

74
00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:30.253
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that not the best way to?

75
00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:32.017
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is not
the best way to do it.

76
00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:36.798
There are width and height add attributes
that are out there for image tags.

77
00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:39.092
The reason you don't wanna use them is,

78
00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:41.733
say you pull an image
off your digital camera.

79
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:44.464
How big is it?

80
00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:47.596
It's about this big,
how big is your web page?

81
00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:48.888
About the big.

82
00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.908
Okay, so that's huge, right?

83
00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:54.241
And it takes megabytes of data
to display that picture, right?

84
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.485
That's why your camera keeps filling up so

85
00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:59.302
fast because of all those
pictures you take, right?

86
00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:01.022
So when you put that on a website,

87
00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:03.980
what happens when somebody
comes to visit that web page?

88
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.861
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Slow level.

89
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You have to wait for
that whole thing to download.

90
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.223
And that's really bad if you happen
to be on your phone somewhere, right?

91
00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:14.746
Not only does it eat your entire
data plan, it takes forever, and

92
00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:16.169
you can't even enjoy it.

93
00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.990
So it's way better to go ahead and

94
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.797
resize these things before
you put them on the web.

95
00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:23.081
Okay, what else do I need
here in my image tag?

96
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:27.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Alt tag.

97
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.067
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Alt tag,
alt-'weird alien eating popcorn',

98
00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.830
because as aliens do I guess.

99
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.372
All right, and
if you go ahead and save that,

100
00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:45.111
you should be able to look
at your hobbies page.

101
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.686
And hopefully you see
a picture just like this.

102
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.661
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, did it work for
everybody here in the room?

103
00:05:57.498 --> 00:05:58.899
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everybody good?

104
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.196
Fabulous, all right.

105
00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:03.130
For those of you online,
if it didn't work,

106
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.151
make sure that it is in
a folder called images.

107
00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:08.563
If you called your folder something else,

108
00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:12.788
if you called it IMG instead of calling
it images, that would be a problem.

109
00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:15.000
You'll need to make sure
that that's the same thing.

110
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.181
Make sure maybe you didn't
save your image folder at all.

111
00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:20.809
Maybe you saved it right into your folder,

112
00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.440
in which case you need
to adjust that path.

113
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.572
Remember we talked a lot about paths and
files in the Internet fundamental scores.

114
00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:30.032
If you didn't get that, go back and

115
00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:32.720
review those videos, and
make sure that you've got that right.
