00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So moving on here.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.420
Here's the book chapter.

3
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.150
That's the way mine looks,

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.835
not that looks really have a whole
lot to do with this, okay?

5
00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:13.660
But it looks kind of like that.

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.710
And, so I wanted to show you my code and
talk to you about what I did and why.

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.955
Now, there are some right and
wrong answers to this, but

8
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.870
there's also a whole lot of gray
area when it comes to writing code.

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.720
A lot of this is very subjective.

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.878
And so what I tell my students is,
if you can justify why you

11
00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:38.738
did what you did,
maybe I'll buy into your argument.

12
00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:42.880
Because sometimes, this markup depends
on what you're trying to communicate.

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400
So here's the way I did it in mine.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.920
So we start with our h1,
what's it all about?

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.300
That's kind of the chapter title,
and so that gets a heading tag.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.600
Then we have a whole bunch of paragraphs,
or anyway, two of them.

17
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.300
And then we're gonna go
here to our first quote.

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
Now, there were a lot of dashes
that were involved here,

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.160
I was trying to set that off on the page,
so that your eye was drawn to it, and

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.540
you would know what I was talking about.

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.710
I took those dashes out.

22
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.140
If you left them in, that's fine too.

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.390
And, so here I have the block quote.

24
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.960
And this is the way I mark that up.

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.590
So I have a block quote going
around the whole thing.

26
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.670
I have the actual question,
the actual thing that's being said.

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359
This book is a practiced or
practical up to the minute,

28
00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.620
answer to the question,
how can I make my camera work profitable?

29
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.389
And then I have the citation.

30
00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.789
And there's actually two parts to this
citation, we have the man's name and

31
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.980
then we have what he's doing for work.

32
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.990
And I've divided those using a tag that
I didn't introduce in class today, but

33
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.970
some of you may be familiar with.

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.280
It's the br or the line break tag.

35
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.988
And so, the line break tag is designed
exactly for this kind of purpose where

36
00:01:55.988 --> 00:02:01.166
you would expect some of this information
to be on different lines, okay?

37
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.550
And we would expect the person's name
to be separated from their job title.

38
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.550
You could potentially put it all on one
line, that wouldn't be a problem at all.

39
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.438
But if you took out that br,
like that, and

40
00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:16.330
had this all on one line,
that's just fine.

41
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.370
It's not a problem at all.

42
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.780
But, I thought it might work better
if I put those on separate lines,

43
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.541
but also within the cite tag, okay?

44
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.169
That is we scroll along, we have some
more paragraphs, some more paragraphs.

45
00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.656
And then we have,
as in this paragraph as it says,

46
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:42.050
read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself
a success at selling his photographs.

47
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.010
So we have a sentence that's
leading into a quote, right?

48
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.800
We're reading what
Waldon Fawcett had to say.

49
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.750
So here is our quote.

50
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.690
Once again that's a block quote, and

51
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.190
then I think I had you put
in some emphasis text.

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.760
I use the m tag here, so
that it's just sort of emphasized.

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.766
But if you had strongly emphasized,

54
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:07.164
you wanted to make that decision to use
the strong tag here, you heard it as like,

55
00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:10.028
this is really strong and
powerful, that's okay.

56
00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:11.940
The strong tag would
have worked here as well.

57
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.580
Either of those it's just fine, okay?

58
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.180
Then we have a paragraph here, and
then we go on to our next quote,

59
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
because this is, here is what one
prominent writer says about it, right?

60
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.610
So we're quoting somebody again.

61
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.210
So here's our block quote.

62
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.380
Once again,
there's a paragraph inside of that, but

63
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.830
notice that there's no citation here,
okay?

64
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.330
No citation.

65
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.596
We just have the block quote
around the paragraph, okay?

66
00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:44.020
And as we keep on scrolling,
we have another paragraph.

67
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.300
Then we have, is the field overcrowded?

68
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.400
I felt that was strongly emphasized,
regular emphasis would have been okay too.

69
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.430
So either the strong or the tag.

70
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.440
Going down a little further,
we have our next paragraph.

71
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.118
I did making and selling, I did those
both as regular models of emphasis,

72
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.135
if you did them as strong,
that would be okay too.

73
00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:08.050
I think stylistically speaking,

74
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.274
it would have been kind of awkward if you
were making one level of emphasis and

75
00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:16.910
selling a different level of emphasis,
I just think that's not natural.

76
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.663
Technically, you would've
been perfectly correct, but

77
00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:23.469
I think stylistically you probably wanna
keep them at the same level of emphasis.

78
00:04:25.274 --> 00:04:27.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we have
our big ordered list, right?

79
00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:30.242
We had all those numbers
in the parenthesis, so

80
00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:32.710
you can just take those right on out.

81
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.860
The browser will put those in for you,
as part of its styling of this document.

82
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.740
So all you have to do now is just say,
the ordered list,

83
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.840
and here's all of
the individual list items.

84
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.133
Take out all those numbers in parentheses.

85
00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:51.202
And we have another paragraph, and another
paragraph, and another paragraph, and

86
00:04:51.202 --> 00:04:52.229
another paragraph.

87
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.071
Down here towards the bottom,
I'm at line 64 now.

88
00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:04.190
We have hard work,
being emphasized down here at the bottom.

89
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.206
And another paragraph, and then we had
this last paragraph, which can be,

90
00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:10.480
I think a little bit confusing.

91
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.820
So clearly, this is a citation
of this particular book, right?

92
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.040
So somehow we're crediting who the book
is, and the title, and the author, and

93
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.020
the publisher.

94
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.350
But what is actually
the citation of all of that?

95
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.570
So the way I marked it up was I said
that the actual making your camera pay

96
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.360
by Frederick C Davis, copyright 1922,
Robert M McBride and company, New York.

97
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.660
That's really the whole citation, right?

98
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.190
If you are writing a research paper and
citing this book, that is what you would

99
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.490
put in your references at the end
of your paper, that whole thing.

100
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.090
So, I've put the side tag
around that part of it.

101
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.210
You may have put the cite tag around
the entire and called the whole paragraph,

102
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.650
a citation, and that's probably okay too.

103
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.660
I might be over thinking it, okay?

104
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.220
But I think either of those would be okay.

105
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.350
But think about, let us again, since this
is HTML, and we're thinking about what

106
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.854
we're trying to convey, in this case,
I'm just conveying that this citation

107
00:06:08.854 --> 00:06:13.980
is really just the citation, rather
than some of the extra book around this.

108
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.540
And then of course at the end we have
the full book is available online and

109
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.770
I put a link into the Gutenberg Project.

110
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.970
And, there is a target equals blank,
there at the end of the link.

111
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.320
You didn't have to have that,
but I went ahead and

112
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.420
put it in since it's going to
a cite that's not this one.

113
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.230
Mark, you had a question?

114
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.205
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah, from online,

115
00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:39.552
Elena suggests putting the last
paragraph in a footer tag?

116
00:06:39.552 --> 00:06:41.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A footer tag.

117
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.351
Yes, that would be a great option also,

118
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:47.556
Elena haven't talked to you about
footer tags, yet at this point in time?

119
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.889
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But, I mean shockingly,

120
00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.260
I did not tell you about
every HTML tag today.

121
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.020
I know you're really
surprised to hear that.

122
00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.430
There are a whole lot of HTML tags that
are out there, including a header tag.

123
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.950
We talked about the head tag today, head
and body, but there's also a header tag.

124
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.390
The header tag is all about like,

125
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.600
the top bar of the website,
like cite identity and stuff.

126
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.250
We'll go through some of
this later in the course.

127
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.660
But the footer tag would definitely work
here, that would be perfectly acceptable.

128
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.514
You could put the footer tag around this,
and

129
00:07:22.514 --> 00:07:27.339
then put everything else inside of your
paragraph [COUGH] within the footer.

130
00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:32.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
it would wind up looking like this.

131
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.800
Great point Elena, nice.

132
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.810
&gt;&gt; Elena: So would there be a reason to
put in the paragraph tag within the footer

133
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.630
if you don't have like
more than one paragraph?

134
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.240
That seems redundant right there.

135
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It seems redundant to
say both footer around the paragraph.

136
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.970
Well, footer is kind of this
this area of the website and

137
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.030
then this is actually
a paragraph of information.

138
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.229
So I'm trying to convey both of those
things, so I'm using both of those tags.

139
00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:56.804
Yes.

140
00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:01.004
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Please scroll up to,
it's like four paragraphs up, it says, and

141
00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:02.100
how does it pay?

142
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.150
That's how it starts.

143
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.394
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And how does it pay.

144
00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:05.521
And how does it pay?

145
00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:06.892
Yep?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, there's quotes in there,

146
00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:08.390
but we're not blockquoting at all?

147
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.160
There's no reason to.

148
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's a good question.

149
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.130
These are very short quotes.

150
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.664
So, technically speaking, I don't think
I would use the blockquote tag for this.

151
00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:23.347
You could,-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH] Yeah,

152
00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:27.762
It does check it up slightly odd
when it shows on the website.

153
00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:29.626
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It looks really
odd in terms of its formatting.

154
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:30.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, it does.

155
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's another
tag called q, believe it or not,

156
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.137
that is perfect for
this kind of situation.

157
00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:39.899
And we could use q to
go around these quotes.

158
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.801
So q is a topic I'm gonna talk to
you about later in the course,

159
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.610
there is the concept of block
versus inline elements.

160
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.560
Inline elements are those that
are right in line with the text,

161
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.590
like your links, your strongs, your ems.

162
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:02.027
In other words, we put those tags in and
the text just continues to flow on, right?

163
00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:06.179
As opposed to something like,a block quote
or a paragraph, where it pulls on out and

164
00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.180
it's its own thing in space.

165
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.420
So q is a tag that is designed to go
inside of a paragraph just like this.

166
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.750
It's not as a meaningful as a block quote,
in terms of pulling it out and

167
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.940
featuring it prominently on the page.

168
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:25.125
But if you wanted to put a q tag around
this, I think that would be acceptable.

169
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:30.840
Great point, and of course I didn't
introduce you to that tag today either.

170
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.010
As one of the more obscure ones,
it's very seldom gets used.

171
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.647
Yes, Jenna.

172
00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:40.402
&gt;&gt; Jenna: Third and fourth paragraph.

173
00:09:40.402 --> 00:09:47.084
There as Waldon Fawcett says,
can you use like a cite around that

174
00:09:47.084 --> 00:09:52.631
because he's gonna say something and then-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

175
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:57.376
&gt;&gt; Jenna: I mean, I guess,
I'm wondering the reasoning on that, and

176
00:09:57.376 --> 00:10:01.376
then I was also thinking
about just if it has quote,

177
00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:05.490
should we be putting those
quotes there every time?

178
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.712
Or the q, I'm sorry, the q tag.

179
00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:13.110
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It sort of,
well it depends.

180
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.478
&gt;&gt; Jenna: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends.

181
00:10:14.478 --> 00:10:15.952
&gt;&gt; Jenna: That's the way I was doing it.

182
00:10:15.952 --> 00:10:16.581
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

183
00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:20.186
So here in the case of this blockquote,
we wouldn't use the q tag at all.

184
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:24.018
You've used blockquote, so
you don't need to put the q tag in.

185
00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:27.259
This is not part of a paragraph,
this is a separate,

186
00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:30.071
here is a big thing that
Waldon Fawcett said.

187
00:10:30.071 --> 00:10:35.317
I did not put the cite tag
up around Waldon Fawcett,

188
00:10:35.317 --> 00:10:40.326
and I actually have to
think on that a little bit.

189
00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:43.422
&gt;&gt; Jenna: It's just spelt like it's
saying styles, it makes me think-

190
00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:44.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

191
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.542
&gt;&gt; Jenna: It should be there.

192
00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:48.991
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, he is the person
who said it, so yeah, I mean,

193
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.601
I totally see your logic and reasoning,

194
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:56.705
I would actually have to read up on
the cite tag to determine if that's, yeah.

195
00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:58.518
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

196
00:10:58.518 --> 00:10:59.591
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,

197
00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:04.392
cuz usually I've seen the cite tag used
directly tied to the quote, as opposed,

198
00:11:04.392 --> 00:11:06.524
this is kind of separated in space.

199
00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.645
So let me do some more reading on that and
see.

200
00:11:08.645 --> 00:11:11.400
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.680
I mean, and
this is what I'm talking about,

202
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.700
where the art comes into HTML, like,
what is really the right answer?

203
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.371
We can talk about it,
we can have that debate, okay?

204
00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:25.378
Other comments, questions online,
here in person?

205
00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:29.103
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Paragraphs and
citations seems to do the same thing,

206
00:11:29.103 --> 00:11:31.186
they both the display texts.

207
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.760
Is it a matter of how they do it, or?

208
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Where exactly
are you talking about?

209
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I mean, just the two tags,
the paragraph tag and the citation tag.

210
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: They're both display

211
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.160
tags, right?

212
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.710
So can you interchange to them, or?

213
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.196
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,
they're not interchangeable,

214
00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:49.708
a paragraph is a paragraph, so
like, these are paragraphs of text.

215
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.910
We would not put the cite tag here.

216
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.151
This would be totally wrong.

217
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.332
Does that make sense as to why that is?

218
00:11:57.332 --> 00:11:57.845
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah.

219
00:11:57.845 --> 00:12:01.721
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, cuz this is,
we're not citing anything here.

220
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.951
We would wanna leave that as a paragraph,

221
00:12:03.951 --> 00:12:07.610
cuz that's clearly just
a paragraph of information.

222
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.140
Yeah, so they're not interchangeable.

223
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.420
Other questions?

224
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.690
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Do the lines, like the,

225
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.580
I don't know what they're called, but
those lines three lines on the side,

226
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.950
the indentation I guess, do they matter or
are they just stylistic to help us?

227
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great question.

228
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.280
So, they are stylistic here so
you can read your code.

229
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.140
And they're helpful cuz,
if you noticed, like,

230
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.490
let's look at something complicated
like this block quote thing here.

231
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.850
See, we can easily find the beginning and
the end of the tag.

232
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.450
We can easily find
the the paragraph here and

233
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.820
the citation that they're
inside of this block quote.

234
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.320
So it becomes much easier
to read your HTML and

235
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.270
understand how things fit together.

236
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.780
So I think that's pretty much it, though
we needed a talk about here in terms of

237
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.880
the book chapter, in terms of images, and
getting images ready for the website.

238
00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.860
We'll be moving on to CSS very shortly.
