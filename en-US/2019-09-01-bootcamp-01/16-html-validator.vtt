00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.202
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the validator is
something that I should tell you

2
00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:02.853
about right now.

3
00:00:02.853 --> 00:00:06.275
The validator is a really important
thing that will check your HTML and

4
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:08.547
make sure that you didn't
make any mistakes.

5
00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:10.427
[NOISE] How cool is that?

6
00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.127
A mistake checker, okay?

7
00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:16.533
So let's look at how this works.

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.298
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is the link
right from our lecture notes,

9
00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:27.562
just before exercises,
this is validator.w3.org,

10
00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:30.961
and if you hop on into here,
this is the W3C.

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.030
These are the people who write all
the specifications for the web.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.188
These are the ones who create all the
standards, such that web browsers work,

13
00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:42.540
that we write code that is understandable,
these are the guys that establish it.

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.220
And they are going to,
probably the best way for

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.520
you to do this today is just
validate by direct input.

16
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.503
So here on this webpage,
come to Validate by Direct Input,

17
00:00:54.503 --> 00:01:00.618
and then you can go to your code,
highlight it all, copy it.

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.321
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Paste it into your box.

19
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.889
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And say Check, and
it's gonna check your HTML, and

20
00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.270
see if you made any mistakes.

21
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.760
Now this is gonna tell me that
I didn't make any mistakes.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.340
So, yay.

23
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.840
All right?

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.548
But the validator has limitations.

25
00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:26.091
What are its limitations?

26
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:31.861
Can anyone think of limitations that
a robot might have in looking at code?

27
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.038
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Misspelling.

28
00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:34.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's not gonna
catch your misspellings.

29
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.220
It is not a spell checker.

30
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.640
What else?

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.227
Is it gonna catch bad file paths?

32
00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:42.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Probably not.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nope.

33
00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:44.770
It could care less what
your file paths are.

34
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.040
It's not gonna check those.

35
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.120
Is it gonna check that you used
the right tag, that you used

36
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.320
an ordered list where you should, or
un ordered list where you should?

37
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.150
Is it gonna catch that?

38
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.140
Nope.

39
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.720
It's just gonna say yep,
it looks like a list.

40
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.210
You wrote it correctly.

41
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.410
Good job.

42
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.607
So there are some limitations here, but
if you get stuck writing your HTML,

43
00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:11.016
the very first thing I tell you to
do is to check and make sure you

44
00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:15.300
haven't made any mistakes, and this is
a very quick and easy way of doing it.

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.137
Sometimes it'll find that tag you didn't
close, or the misspelling that you

46
00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:24.986
have in your tag, a misspelled attributes,
that'll find an answer for you.

47
00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:25.904
Makes sense?
