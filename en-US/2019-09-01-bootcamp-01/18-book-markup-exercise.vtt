00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:02.091
&gt;&gt; Jen: What's gonna happen now here for

2
00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:06.116
this boot camp is that you are gonna
work on some stuff on your own.

3
00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:11.326
Because part of learning code is working
with the code by yourself, okay?

4
00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:14.930
You can follow along with me all day long,
and you'll be just fine.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.525
But when it comes time for you to actually
work through a problem by yourself,

6
00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.755
you're gonna go, wait a minute,
what was that thing she said?

7
00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:26.830
[LAUGH] Okay, so I want you to refer to
this document that I've given you here.

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.399
All the tags are in here
that we covered today.

9
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.135
You can look at this any time.

10
00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.408
There is nothing wrong
with cheat sheets in code.

11
00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:38.091
The pros use cheat sheets all the time.

12
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.748
It's the only way we survive.

13
00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.972
Google is your friend, Google for
whatever it is you need.

14
00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:45.778
You can find all kinds of
documentation out there on the web.

15
00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:49.511
Nobody has all this stuff memorized, okay?

16
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.033
And if you scroll to the bottom
of today's lecture, in HTML,

17
00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.575
you'll see some additional
stuff that I've given you here.

18
00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.345
So first of all,
here's some references, okay?

19
00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:06.099
So all the references that you can go and
read more about this stuff.

20
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.764
More about basic web pages, more about
links, little bit more about everything.

21
00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:14.108
So first of all,
I'd like you to mark up a book chapter.

22
00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.542
So I've given you a book
chapter from long ago.

23
00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.098
This book was published in 1922.

24
00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:23.855
It's out of copyright and it's a book
about how to make money doing photography.

25
00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.823
So it's kind of interesting.

26
00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:33.206
All right, so going ahead and
you'll copy off this plain old text here.

27
00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:37.716
And you're gonna need to mark this up
somehow so it'll go on your web page.

28
00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:41.986
You're going to have to give some thought
as to what the right tags are for

29
00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:43.464
all of this text, okay?

30
00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:46.245
And I made some notes in here too.

31
00:01:46.245 --> 00:01:50.963
Like here on line 27 it says,
emphasis, okay?

32
00:01:50.963 --> 00:01:54.468
Start your emphasis tag here and
end it here,

33
00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.630
no as a no if the field is
not overcrowded, all right?

34
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.991
There is a few of those
little notes in here.

35
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.918
But otherwise, I just want you to go
ahead and take this and mark this up.

36
00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:06.907
So that's something
you're going to work on.

37
00:02:06.907 --> 00:02:10.483
There's also here,
some additional HTML practice.

38
00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:14.550
So if you go to the W3 School's website,
there's some,

39
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.716
it's like kind of like a quiz.

40
00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.359
So to help reinforce
your learning from today,

41
00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.807
you can work through these
exercises here that I've listed.

42
00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:26.705
This is gonna cover stuff that I talked
to you about here in class today.

43
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:31.099
You're welcome to do more if you want,
but I probably haven't talked about it.

44
00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.134
Okay, so if you don't know the answer,
there's a reason why.

45
00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.741
All right, but all of those you
should be able to complete.

46
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.579
And then, if you still need more to do,

47
00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.202
keep on working on the pages
that we started here.

48
00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:45.250
A little bit of information about you.

49
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.129
More information about your hobbies and
your activities, okay?

50
00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.646
Just go on ahead and
keep working on that kind of stuff,

51
00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:53.464
that's what we're going to be doing.

52
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.607
Are there any questions?

53
00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:59.057
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I hate to use the word
formatting, but I think it's accurate.

54
00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:04.414
When we're doing VS code I
think it looks really good.

55
00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:08.693
I don't remember making it look
quite as what I would assume as

56
00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:09.993
accurate-
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah.

57
00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:11.692
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: As it should be
as far as indenting and stuff.

58
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:12.393
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah.

59
00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:15.256
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it doing that
while I'm not looking or?

60
00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:15.868
&gt;&gt; Jen: Mm-hm, it's really nice, isn't it?

61
00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:18.457
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Good,
I'll just not worry about it too much.

62
00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.229
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, don't worry about it.

63
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.746
It makes it nice an readable.

64
00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:25.877
Phew, what else, yes, Mark?

65
00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:29.975
&gt;&gt; Mark: With the image tag,
that is actually content, so

66
00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:33.791
should that be wrapped
in a paragraph as well?

67
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:38.106
&gt;&gt; Jen: It can be, it doesn't have to be.

68
00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:40.818
It validates just fine
if it's not in a tag.

69
00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:42.544
So it can be outside of a tag.

70
00:03:45.647 --> 00:03:47.774
&gt;&gt; Jen: Other questions?

71
00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:51.151
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If it was in a paragraph,
it would just add extra space above and

72
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:51.928
below right?

73
00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:54.409
&gt;&gt; Jen: Correct, yeah, yep?

74
00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.055
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I'm working on if you were
to add a video is there like a preferred

75
00:03:59.055 --> 00:03:59.752
format?

76
00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:04.058
&gt;&gt; Jen: For adding a video, we're going
to cover that later in the course.

77
00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.738
Later in the course,
no videos today, just pictures.

78
00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.444
&gt;&gt; Mark: How do you add a comment in HTML?

79
00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:12.038
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes, adding a comment in HTML.

80
00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:16.412
Sometimes you wanna make notes to
yourself as you are working in HTML.

81
00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:19.254
It's really nice to be able to
write yourself little notes.

82
00:04:19.254 --> 00:04:24.464
And so if you want to write yourself
a note, it's called a comment.

83
00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.765
And so here's the way that you do it.

84
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:32.666
You're gonna put in an &lt;!--.

85
00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:36.272
Okay, and that is actually,
there's space in between those two things.

86
00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.467
So that's what a comment is.

87
00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:41.712
That's how it starts, &lt;!--,

88
00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:47.351
type whatever you want in between and
then --&gt; will end it.

89
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.169
So I could write myself a note here,

90
00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.962
remember the right file path to the image.

91
00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:01.163
Okay, that is not gonna
show up on your web page.

92
00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:10.752
&gt;&gt; Jen: It will only show when you
take a look at the code itself, okay?

93
00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:15.676
So if I go ahead and
do that really quick and

94
00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:19.756
refresh my web page, my web page,

95
00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:24.305
you'll see here,
&gt;&gt; Jen: My

96
00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:27.792
comment does not show on my web page,
all right?

97
00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:33.207
However, before you start putting
a bunch of four letter words and

98
00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:36.313
mean things in your comments, okay?

99
00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:42.001
Note that if you right-click on
this web page, if you're on a PC or

100
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.995
Cmd+click if you're on a Mac,
and say view page source.

101
00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:50.808
You can actually view your HTML that
you've written right here in your web

102
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:51.370
browser.

103
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.987
You may not have known that that existed,
okay?

104
00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:59.212
And here you can see your comments.

105
00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:03.912
And people do look at your code, and
they do crazy things with comments.

106
00:06:03.912 --> 00:06:07.392
All right, so just be aware, be nice.

107
00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:11.592
[LAUGH] people can still
see what you're doing, yes.

108
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:14.681
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: If you were to just add
a bunch of comments throughout there,

109
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:18.631
would it slow down the speed of your
website or would it just get skipped over?

110
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:20.665
&gt;&gt; Jen: There's no
rendering of the comments.

111
00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:24.009
So typically,
that's not going to put a huge drag,

112
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.512
especially at the level
that we're commenting here.

113
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:32.660
There are,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Scripts

114
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.982
that are designed to go through code and,
quote, optimize it.

115
00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:38.882
That's especially true with CSS.

116
00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:41.143
So its called minification.

117
00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:43.699
It will take all of that code,
take out all the spaces,

118
00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.047
take out all the comments and
make it basically machine readable only.

119
00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:51.362
And that will reduce file sizes and
make things load a little bit faster.

120
00:06:51.362 --> 00:06:55.737
So you'll occasionally see that kind
of thing, not so much with HTML.

121
00:06:55.737 --> 00:06:59.133
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah, in general,
just to add on with what you're saying.

122
00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.801
HTML is fast, very, very, very, very fast.

123
00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:03.944
So if you add thousands of comments,
it's not gonna slow down

124
00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:05.624
&gt;&gt; Jen: It's not going to take a while.

125
00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:11.328
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: The big things are the the
images and your JavaScript and your CSS.

126
00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:14.547
These kind of external assets that
you're loading into your website.

127
00:07:14.547 --> 00:07:15.055
&gt;&gt; Jen: Absolutely.

128
00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:15.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: It'll slow it down.

129
00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:18.532
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yep, that's the things
you really have to worry about.

130
00:07:18.532 --> 00:07:22.544
By the way, let me show you my favorite,
my favorite comment of all time,

131
00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:24.053
she better have left it up.

132
00:07:24.053 --> 00:07:27.183
This is lingscars.com.

133
00:07:27.183 --> 00:07:32.303
Ling is a person who rents
cars in the United Kingdom.

134
00:07:32.303 --> 00:07:36.771
And she makes an awesome website.

135
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:41.668
[LAUGH] Okay,
she's coded this whole website herself.

136
00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:45.811
And it is absolutely phenomenal, okay?

137
00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:47.614
And it goes on forever.

138
00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:52.000
Yeah, this is not 1998, this is 2018.

139
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.957
And she has made $130
million on this website.

140
00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:58.532
So it works, okay, it's a successful site.

141
00:07:58.532 --> 00:08:02.561
But my favorite thing of all
here is in her comments.

142
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:04.544
So if you view her page source.

143
00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:14.544
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: [LAUGH]

144
00:08:15.751 --> 00:08:20.895
&gt;&gt; Jen: So
be aware people can see your code, okay?

145
00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:22.137
It's there.

146
00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:24.925
Sometimes they'll leave you a message,
all right?

147
00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:27.885
So, yeah, Ling.

148
00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:28.533
Okay, and

149
00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:33.364
you can spend hours on here, you can have
a ton of fun even if you never rent a car.
