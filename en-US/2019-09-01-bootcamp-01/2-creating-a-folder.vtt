00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, we'll go ahead and
start writing some HTML.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.840
The first thing that I'd like for
you to do is go to your desktop.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.320
And I'd like you to go ahead and
make a folder here.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.880
You can call your folder
something like day one.

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.760
That's a great name.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.534
You could call it HTML, if you wanna
call it HTML, or anything else.

7
00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:26.018
And what we're going to
do then [COUGH] is if you

8
00:00:26.018 --> 00:00:29.683
simply take that folder and drag it.

9
00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:33.436
Click and drag it right on top
of VS code and then let go.

10
00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:39.334
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is gonna go ahead and
show you your day one folder and

11
00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:42.782
its contents,
which probably have nothing in it,

12
00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:45.689
over there on the left-hand side, okay?

13
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:50.151
So, this is a way of setting up a really
simple work environment for VS code.

14
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:53.463
And this is gonna show you where
all your files and folders are so

15
00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:56.417
that you can access easily
while you're writing code.
