1
00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.855
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Time for a pop quiz.

2
00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.490
Yay!

3
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.409
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

4
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:10.475
I am looking at the course website.

5
00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:12.912
This is the HTML page of that.

6
00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:18.407
Remember the course website's
frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp.

7
00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:20.463
We are looking at the very
top of this document.

8
00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:25.459
So somebody tell me again, what is HTML?

9
00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.223
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Hypertext.

10
00:00:26.223 --> 00:00:27.443
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Markup language.

11
00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:28.873
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hypertext markup language.

12
00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:30.206
You guys gotta say it louder.

13
00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Be proud.

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.255
Hypertext markup language.

15
00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:37.675
Does that have anything to
do with how things look?

16
00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:38.355
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

17
00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:39.895
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No!

18
00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:43.820
Where is any of the look that we're
working with right now coming from?

19
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.501
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The browser.

20
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.970
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The web browser!

21
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.899
It's built into the web browser.

22
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.697
Okay, we could override it with CSS.

23
00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:51.450
We're gonna do that later.

24
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.240
All right, tag.

25
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.559
What is a tag?

26
00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.798
If you don't know what a tag
is give me examples of tags.

27
00:00:58.798 --> 00:00:59.827
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Paragraph.

28
00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:01.663
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Paragraph tag.

29
00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:04.047
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Tag,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Tag.

30
00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:09.092
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I was gonna sat it
identifies a portion of the text.

31
00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:10.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
actually the definition.

32
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.492
Yes, it's identifying portions
of the document, right?

33
00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:17.210
This is a heading, this is a paragraph,
this is a list, this is a link.

34
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.710
Good.

35
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.303
We talked about the browser
display of HTML already.

36
00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:23.710
What is that weirdo banged up type thing?

37
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.210
What is that?

38
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: HTML5.

39
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is indicating our
document type, which is often HTML5.

40
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.070
We have two parts of our HTML document,
the head and the body.

41
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.781
Which part actually displays
things on the webpage itself?

42
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:40.474
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Body.

43
00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:41.604
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The body.

44
00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:42.760
What does the head do?

45
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: It shows the, in the tab.

46
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's the title it shows
in the tab, and everything else is all

47
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.550
about the programming and
stuff the browser needs to know.

48
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.855
What's an element?

49
00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:57.680
I haven't actually introduced that
term yet, so if you look lost,-

50
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.259
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

51
00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.458
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An element is kind of

52
00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:03.122
the same thing as a tag, okay,
so an HTML element an HTML tag,

53
00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.740
we often use those words interchangeably.

54
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.838
An attribute, what's another,
what is an attribute?

55
00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:11.464
If you don't know what it
is give me an example.

56
00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Href.

57
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.889
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Href is an attribute, good.

58
00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: They're like arguments
to tags, the extra things that you-

59
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The computer

60
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.480
science explanation is that
they're arguments to the tags.

61
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.020
Very well done.

62
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.341
The English version is
they're descriptions,

63
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:30.014
additional descriptions in that tag.

64
00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.504
So, not to pick on
the computer scientists.

65
00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:33.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is exactly true,

66
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.110
they are arguments to tags.

67
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.230
But they are descriptions of something
more we need to know about the tag,

68
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.230
and the classic example
is the A tag itself.

69
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.958
A by itself does nothing,
we need href in order to go somewhere.

70
00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.726
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Do they
follow the same format,

71
00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.930
like you have href =, and then the code's-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,

72
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.780
all of our attributes will follow that
same, and we're gonna get more into

73
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.010
attributes as we go through the bootcamp,
but as we start off, we keep it simple.

74
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.410
Okay, so here on this HTML page,
you're gonna find lots and

75
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.770
lots of examples for
what we've already covered here.

76
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.680
So you'll see, we have paragraphs, we have
headings, and we have our unordered lists,

77
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.623
our list item, our ordered lists.

78
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:21.948
Some things I haven't talked about yet,
which I'm going to talk about here,

79
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:24.120
momentarily, images, and so forth.

80
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.450
So there's lots of stuff in here for
you to read and refer back to.

81
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.194
Some of you,

82
00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:33.605
on the Slack chat, online, mentioned
that you might be a little bit behind.

83
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:35.765
Don't worry about it,
you're doing just fine.

84
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:37.730
Everybody's doing great work.

85
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.822
You can always refer to this document.

86
00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:44.378
All that my purpose of what I'm talking
about here today is to introduce each one

87
00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:46.626
of these tags and use it in our webpage.

88
00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.931
Okay, so
that's all we're doing here today.

89
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:53.821
If you get behind in what exactly I'm
doing, don't worry about it so much.

90
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:55.911
It's all right here in this document, and

91
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:59.081
you can take a look at what's going on,
and catch up.
