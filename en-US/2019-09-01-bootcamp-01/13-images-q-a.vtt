1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, Dylan?

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.850
&gt;&gt; Dylan: So in my source, on the web
page, I see the alternative language.

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.599
But since I see the photo, is it hidden?

4
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:08.388
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

5
00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:09.355
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

6
00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:13.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you actually ask that
question again, after they're done?

7
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:14.172
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep?

8
00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:15.514
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'll take that one-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hold that question,

9
00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:16.086
just a second.

10
00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:18.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE].

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.189
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
cuz it's a great question.

12
00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cool.

13
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Typo,
typos will get you every time.

14
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.770
When they make create
a computer that fixes typos,

15
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.620
it will be a beautiful day, okay.

16
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.700
So Dylan, go ahead and
ask your question one more time.

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Okay, since I see
the kitten is the alt text hidden.

18
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,
the all text is actually it is here.

19
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.550
And doesn't display on the page,

20
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.190
it displays only if it
can't find this picture.

21
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.430
So for example, let me break my kitten.

22
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.610
I'll take a few characters
out of my URL here.

23
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.650
Hopefully nothing exists at that website.

24
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.930
So I'm deliberately trying
to break my picture.

25
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.210
Okay, so when you have a broken picture,
look what happens.

26
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.820
Right now I broke my picture.

27
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.040
Okay, so right here on the website,
it just says cute kitty cat.

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.090
That's my alt text.

29
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.980
Okay, so for people who can't see
the picture, can't download it.

30
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.510
And for when we make typos and

31
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.620
we blow things up, you may see
something that looks just like that.

32
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.650
Now, this may look different
in some other browsers.

33
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.680
Sometimes you see a broken image icon.

34
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.830
So let me let's look at it quick here
in Chrome and see what that looks like.

35
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.750
Yeah, so here in Chrome, over here
on the side, see how we, actually,

36
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.490
have a little broken icon right here?

37
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.190
So that's an indication to you, as the web
developer, that you did something wrong or

38
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.720
something happened.

39
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.650
The Placekitten website blew up,
blew away, it's gone.

40
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.920
That picture doesn't exist anymore.

41
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.480
You deleted it off your website and
you forgot that you deleted a picture.

42
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.580
It could be a lot of things that happened,
but you need to look into your code and

43
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.470
find out what happened.

44
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.350
Does that make sense?

45
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.160
Okay, yes.

46
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is there a way to make the
alt text show up like when you hover your

47
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.770
cursor over the image?

48
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, there is.

49
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.280
That is a great question also.

50
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.140
Okay, so let me go back to my code, here.

51
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.940
Let me fix it.

52
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.062
Undo is your friend.

53
00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:33.387
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so, the question is,
can we actually get this text to show,

54
00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.640
when you hover over the image?

55
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.910
And that sometimes works,
in some browsers.

56
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.620
Let me go back to Chrome, here.

57
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.488
So, I'm looking at Chrome.

58
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:47.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That says I'm
an Android developer, AndroidPub.

59
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.600
I wonder where that comes from.

60
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.820
So sometimes in some browsers,
that will do that,

61
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.910
in other browsers it
won't with the alt text.

62
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.760
So here in Firefox, when I roll my mouse
over the picture, it doesn't say anything.

63
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.067
Okay, so sometimes you have to add another
attribute in order to make that work,

64
00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:13.674
and there is an attribute
called the title attribute.

65
00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:21.704
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And sometimes this
attribute will show when you roll your

66
00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.311
mouse over the picture.

67
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:24.550
It depends.

68
00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.464
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Welcome to your
world is front end web developers,

69
00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:30.800
not all browsers work the same way.

70
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.773
It is part of the world that we live in,

71
00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:35.819
is the reason that most front
end web developers are bald.

72
00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.778
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pulled out all of our hair

73
00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:40.530
trying to figure out these two browsers.

74
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.135
Okay, so if I do that,
if I add that title attribute there,

75
00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:49.220
[COUGH]
and I refresh this.

76
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.450
So now in Firefox,

77
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.360
I do indeed get the little text that
shows up when I roll my mouse over, okay.

78
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.590
And we'll see what happens in Chrome.

79
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.430
It also says cute kitty cat.

80
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.621
&gt;&gt; Dylan: A lot of times
when I have broken images,

81
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.140
it's because I put
the wrong file extension.

82
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.970
Instead of .jpeg, I accidentally
did .png or instead of .png, .jpeg.

83
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.880
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, so, it depends on
where you're getting the image from.

84
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.280
Right now, I've just gotten the image
right here off the internet.

85
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.860
If you can also put up your
own pictures if you want.

86
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.430
If you put up your own pictures,
they need to be in a certain format.

87
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.408
They need to be jpegs, pngs, or gifs.

88
00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.030
Those are the only three image
formats that work on the web.

89
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.640
I think that's in your notes.

90
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.790
And it's easy to confuse those formats.

91
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.702
So you type in that it's a PNG image,
and it's actually a JPG image and

92
00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:47.770
it doesn't show.

93
00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:54.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so let's go
through just a couple of other items here.

94
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.375
So, remember here, under the image tag,
there it is JPG, GIF, and PNG.

95
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:03.010
Those are the formats that
will work on the web.

96
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.200
Sometimes you'll also see a format
called SVG which stands for

97
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.664
scalable vector graphics.

98
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.390
These are two different kinds of images.

99
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.640
Those of you who are familiar with
graphic design and image illustration.

100
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.106
You'll know that we have Photoshop
images and Illustrator images, right.

101
00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:25.530
Photoshop images are called raster images.

102
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.480
They made up a whole bunch of little
dots called pixels over and over again.

103
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.900
That makes a picture, right?

104
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.400
Those are the pictures
you make on your camera.

105
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.337
You also have those Illustrator
images that are, they're math,

106
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.810
basically, they're series of math
equations that draw curves and so forth.

107
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.310
Color things in.

108
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.860
So, we have them on web as well.

109
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.540
JPEG given PNG a raster images, series of
pixels, SPGs or mathematical equations,

110
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.440
and so occasionally,
you'll see these used as images as well.

111
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.240
Advanced topic, that's all you get on
that in this boot camp, all right?

112
00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.740
Look it up.

113
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.960
And then as I went through already,

114
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.730
the source in the alt text are the two
very important attributes that you need.

115
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.540
And you have an example here.

116
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.340
Also note that I've given you links to
where you can read more on this stuff.

117
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.720
So this is a link to the Mozilla Developer
Network website where you can read more

118
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.980
about the image tag as well.

119
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.080
Okay, any questions on images?

120
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.050
Yes?

121
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I was just wondering
because of accessibility.

122
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.695
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is it becoming more of

123
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:36.580
a standard to make better descriptions for
the alt tag or

124
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.770
people not really going that way?

125
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

126
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.660
The alt tag is critical for
for accessibility purposes.

127
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.840
And the description should be very
relevant to whatever the picture is.

128
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.540
So historically, people have done all
kinds of crazy things with alt tags.

129
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.450
It should really, truly be
a description of what that picture is.

130
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.470
And in fact, cute little kitty cat
is probably what we get [LAUGH] for

131
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.010
the one that we just put in.

132
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.480
But you could you could write
more about that if you wanted.

133
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.399
We could say whatever kind of cat that is.
