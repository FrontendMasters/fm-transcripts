WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So let's go on ahead back
to our index dot html document here.

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.822
And one of the things I was just
saying here right before the break,

3
00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.761
wouldn't it be nice if we had some images.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean,
it's a really boring webpage, right?

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.490
And it's really ugly.

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.480
But at least an image would
make it prettier, wouldn't it?

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.617
Okay, so you may have images
from a lot of different places.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.487
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But one of the things
that you can do with images,

9
00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:33.387
there's my web page,
is you can get them online.

10
00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.890
And there are certain websites
that are designed for

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.322
you to just go on ahead and
use images as they exist.

12
00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:42.577
Important things know about images, right?

13
00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:47.124
Is that there's copyright
associated with images, yes?

14
00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:51.184
Can I just go into Google and
Google for cool picture, and

15
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.730
just take that picture and
drop it in my web page?

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.355
Am I golden?

17
00:00:55.355 --> 00:01:00.022
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No, no, that is bad, okay?

18
00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:02.420
In the United States,
that can get you sued.

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.630
In other countries, they have copyright
laws that are somewhat different.

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.498
But not only is it just bad,
it's just rude, isn't it?

21
00:01:09.498 --> 00:01:12.705
If you spent all that time going out
there and taking a beautiful picture,

22
00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.787
wouldn't you at least wanna get credit for
it?

23
00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.956
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
some people make a living on this, and so

24
00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.750
they'd like to get paid also.

25
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.055
So you can't just do that.

26
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.850
But there are some websites
that are out there and

27
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.520
available for you to use their images.

28
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.493
And one of these we're gonna take
a look at is called PlaceKitten.

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Place kitten dot com
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And so, these are nice.

30
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.540
These are just sort of image placeholders.

31
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.940
So when you find your real image,
you can put your real image in.

32
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.788
But let's go on ahead and
start with one of these.

33
00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:50.854
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And it'll give you, look
at this little bit of code right here.

34
00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:52.761
Anybody recognize what this is?

35
00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:57.655
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What is this
little bit of code right here?

36
00:01:57.655 --> 00:01:58.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A link to a file, isn't?

37
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It's a link to something,
right?

38
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.500
It's a link to something.

39
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.172
So we're gonna need this.

40
00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:08.120
Go on ahead and just copy the first
line of code right there.

41
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.113
The one that say http colon slash slash
placekitten dot com slash 200 slash 300,

42
00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:15.742
just go ahead and copy that.

43
00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:25.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then, what we're gonna
do is we'll add a picture to our document.

44
00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
I'm gonna work on my home page some more.

45
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.070
I'm gonna put this up
towards the top of the page.

46
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.253
So again, you can see it, pretty easily.

47
00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:43.495
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And I'm just gonna put
in here is a picture of a kitten.

48
00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:48.710
[LAUGH] Because my page

49
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.378
is boring without a photo.

50
00:02:55.378 --> 00:02:59.318
Okay, so little bit of introductory text.

51
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:04.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then, we can go on ahead
and put in our picture of our kitten.

52
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.440
Anyone wanna take a guess at what tag
might put the picture of the kitten

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.330
in, yes?

54
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I, I is a good guess,

55
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.470
but not the right one.

56
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.700
Anyone else wanna guess?

57
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Image.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Image, spelled how?

58
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: img.

59
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.447
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: img.
I-m-g.

60
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.762
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now, the img tag is
a little bit unusual in that it is

61
00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:30.230
just like this, it is just img.

62
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.010
There's no slash img
associated with the image tag.

63
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.760
I have no idea why that is,
but it is that way, okay?

64
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.470
It's just img.

65
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.415
Then, we're gonna need clearly,
if we just put in img, what's gonna show?

66
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nothing,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Nothing.

67
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.090
Why?

68
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's no link.

69
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We haven't
said what to show, right?

70
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.135
We just said put an image in here.

71
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:56.438
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Computers are good, but
they're not that good, all right?

72
00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:57.760
We gotta tell them everything.

73
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.034
So we need to put in here
some kind of what we show.

74
00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:07.880
And this is gonna be through src,
which stands for, anyone wanna guess?

75
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.936
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Source.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Source, okay, so

76
00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:13.330
this is the source of the image.

77
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And into that,
you can paste that placekitten link.

78
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.090
So src.

79
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.340
So just like Mohammad was noting earlier,

80
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.900
all of our attributes have
the same kind of formatting.

81
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.870
So inside of our image tag, we have src,
that's an attribute, equals,

82
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.460
and then inside of quotes goes
the value of that attribute.

83
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.180
In this case, it's the place kitten link.

84
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.040
Now, this is good.

85
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.010
But what happens if there are a number of
people who are out on the Internet who

86
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.480
have visual difficulties,
they can't see or they have low vision?

87
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.660
Or they're a search engine.

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.760
Can search engines see?

89
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.369
No, Google can't see your pretty pictures,
all right.

90
00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.886
Or they have a horrible
Internet connection, okay, and

91
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.048
they can't get your pictures either,
all right?

92
00:05:06.048 --> 00:05:10.913
So what we need to do is we need to put in
a text description of this image in case

93
00:05:10.913 --> 00:05:12.520
somebody can't see it.

94
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.210
And that's called alternative text.

95
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.690
Alt Text.

96
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.350
You may have heard the Alt Text before.

97
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.300
So this is Alt is our attribute.

98
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.975
And in the quotes here,
you put in a description of this picture,

99
00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:29.555
cute kitty cat.

100
00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:30.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Just like that.

101
00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:33.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So there's your picture.

102
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah?

103
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you
need to close the tag?

104
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You do not
need to close this tag.

105
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.890
There is no slash image tag.

106
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.580
It's just, this is a weird one,
it's kind of like in grammar,

107
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.090
sometimes you have exceptions
to those grammar rules.

108
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.480
This is one of those exceptions
to the grammar rules.

109
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not to get all technical,
but it's what's called a self-closing tag.

110
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.850
So if you wanna add a slash at the end,
you can, but you don't need to.

111
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.451
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Right, right.

112
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:07.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, everybody good?

113
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.509
Go ahead and save, and
let's take a look at our web page.

114
00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:17.401
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Make sure you're looking
at the page where you put the kitty cat.

115
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:21.126
If you're looking at your hobbies page,
there may not be a kitty cat there.

116
00:06:21.126 --> 00:06:25.372
It worked just fine,
you're just looking at the wrong web page.
