00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.233
&gt;&gt; Jen: I'd like you to add one thing
to this that was not in the Internet

2
00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:04.457
fundamentals course.

3
00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:08.109
So go on ahead and
open up your VS Code right now.

4
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.967
[COUGH] And
your screen should look just like this.

5
00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:19.810
&gt;&gt; Jen: Go ahead and open up that VS Code.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.310
You should see a whole lot of nothing.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.551
If you're there you're good.

8
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.397
All right, where we're gonna go, is we're
gonna go over here to this funny looking

9
00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:29.903
button that's down here on
the bottom left hand side.

10
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.126
If you roll your mouse over it,
it says extensions.

11
00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:35.151
Go ahead and click on that.

12
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.773
And this is a way of adding additional
little pieces of functionality to VS Code

13
00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.095
that might make it more helpful to you.

14
00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:45.954
And, it could be that Brian Holt who'll
be teaching next week may have some other

15
00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:49.812
additions here for you, but I found one
that I think is really super helpful, and

16
00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:51.612
this one's called Open in Browser.

17
00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:55.780
So, go ahead in the search box,
type in Open in Browser.

18
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:04.180
&gt;&gt; Jen: And so this is gonna search all of
these extensions that are available for

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.812
VS Code.

20
00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:09.709
Hopefully the very first one up here
at the top, which is from TechER,

21
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.282
it says Open in Browser 2.0.0.

22
00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:14.818
Go on ahead and
click on the Install button.

23
00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:20.020
&gt;&gt; Jen: And that should go ahead and
install this.

24
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.410
So what this is gonna allow us to do
is it's going to allow us to open

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.172
our HTML that we're writing directly
into our web browser, super handy, okay?

26
00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:36.427
So if you've gone ahead and
done that at this point,

27
00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:39.823
go ahead and click on Reload to Activate.

28
00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:45.207
It'll think for a minute, and then you
should see a screen that looks like this.

29
00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:48.645
How's everybody doing so far, all right?

30
00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:52.741
Fabulous, okay, good.

31
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:58.609
So we're ready to go on ahead and
get started then with some basic HTML.

32
00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.579
So, one of the things that I have noticed
about the people who are here in class

33
00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.245
today, we have people who have computer
science degrees or almost have

34
00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:10.487
computer science degrees, and we have
some people who know absolutely nothing.

35
00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:14.062
And it's likely that those of you
who are out there online you're

36
00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:16.016
somewhere in between that, okay?

37
00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:20.769
And so, I'm really teaching this to
people who have no background at all.

38
00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.082
So you may find that this course
is gonna go a little bit slow for

39
00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:28.048
some of you who have some programming
background, and that is by design.

40
00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:31.759
Because there are no prerequisites for
this class,

41
00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:36.156
and I am teaching to the people
who have no background in this.

42
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.158
If you do need some extra work,
please go on ahead and ask in slack.

43
00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:44.148
I'm always happy to make things harder,
but one of the fundamental

44
00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:47.718
things about teaching is that
it is easy to make things hard,

45
00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:49.970
it is really hard to make things easy.

46
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.638
And so my goal is to make things easy here
for all of you, so that you feel like

47
00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:57.790
you're competent and capable, and that
you can totally do this, because you can.
