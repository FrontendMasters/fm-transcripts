1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.590
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, fabulous.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.100
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.639
We'll go ahead and say File &gt; New file.

4
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.570
File &gt; New file, you should see
a whole lot of nothing, all right?

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.177
Then we're gonna go ahead and
we're gonna say File &gt; Save.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.370
And I'd liked you to save
this as index.html and

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.980
save that right inside
of your day one folder.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.982
So make a new file by going to File,
New File, save it.

9
00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:38.590
File, Save.

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.568
We're gonna call it something
like index.html, and

11
00:00:41.568 --> 00:00:45.540
you're gonna save it right
inside of your day one folder.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.904
Go ahead and safe, save.

13
00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.447
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Everybody got it?

14
00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:55.337
[SOUND] You've made your first web page.

15
00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:58.811
You can actually display this and
you'll see a whole lot of nothing.

16
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:02.940
The easiest way to do this now If
you come over to your index.HTML,

17
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.610
right click if you're on a PC,
if you're on a Mac, you can control click.

18
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.770
And you'll notice the down here, you'll
have this new these new buttons that

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.890
are just came through from that open and
browser thing that we installed.

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.520
It'll say, open in default browser or
open in other browsers.

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.580
Your default browser is the one that when
you just click on a link somewhere on your

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.870
computer, that's the browser that opens.

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.800
So by default on a Mac that's Safari,
by default on a PC that's Edge or

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.660
Internet Explorer,
depending on how old your machine is.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.113
[COUGH] You can also choose open another
browsers that will let you pick some other

26
00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:39.070
browser.

27
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.810
My computer is configured to have
Firefox as my default browser.

28
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.770
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
say open and default browser.

29
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.840
And this is going to go ahead and
open up Firefox for me and

30
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.530
I see a whole lot of nothing if
you got nothing, you did great.

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.780
Good job.

32
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.850
All right, so, now that you have your
file created ,now that you have saved it,

33
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.730
make sure you have saved it.

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.030
The next thing you do
is a little bit weird.

35
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.050
You're gonna type an exclamation point.

36
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.290
A single exclamation point and hit Tab.

37
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.256
And a whole bunch of stuff
is magically going to appear

38
00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:20.672
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Did it happen?

39
00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:26.274
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool, go on ahead and
save that and you can go ahead and

40
00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:33.510
look at that in your web page and you'll
probably see still a whole lot of nothing.

41
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's a lot of code for
nothing isn't it?

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The title
is changed on the tab.

43
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But if you notice
the up there on the tab, yeah,

44
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.480
the title has changed.

45
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.690
It's now called document.

46
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.420
The very exciting document, okay?

47
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.430
So let's take a look at what this code
is that does a whole lot of nothing.

48
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.220
One of the things you might notice
about your code is that it scrolls

49
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.430
off the side of the page
right here a little bit.

50
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.390
Or you may not have even noticed,
it kind of looks like maybe it's fine.

51
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.930
If yours is like mine,
if you go to the view tap.

52
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.018
Oops, make sure you are in.

53
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:12.520
VsCode, go to the View tab and look for
the item called Toggle Word Wrap.

54
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.360
Toggle Word Wrap.

55
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.030
And that'll wrap things onto another
line so you can see everything.

56
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.650
So let's look at this line by line and
figure out what we're doing here.

57
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.450
So line one.

58
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.790
Okay, notice that we have
the numbers that go down the side.

59
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.040
These are our line numbers,
so we can talk about code.

60
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.990
So in line one, we have this thing
here that says, doc type HTML.

61
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.090
Does anyone know what that means?

62
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.050
Anyone want to take a wild
guess what that means?

63
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.560
Yeah, Dave.

64
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.680
&gt;&gt; Dave: It means that the browser
should think of it as HTML5.

65
00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Dave's
been doing some research.

66
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.998
Yes, this is the line of code that says,
we are writing HTML5.

67
00:03:49.998 --> 00:03:52.560
It says Hello, I'm an HTML5 document.

68
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.300
That's all that line of code says,
all right?

69
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.360
HTML5, that implies that there
are other levels of HTML right?

70
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.389
There is in fact, in HTML 4 and
HTML 3.2 and HTML 2 and HTML 1.

71
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.240
HTML has been around now for
almost 30 years, okay.

72
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.620
And so we are up to level five.

73
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.280
That's what that says.

74
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.430
Anyone want to guess what line two says?

75
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.940
Yes?

76
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'm guessing it's
saying that we're writing in

77
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.990
the English language.

78
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We are definitely
writing in the English language,

79
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.860
that is part of it.

80
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.570
And what else?

81
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.330
Anything else?

82
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Displaying in
the English language too?

83
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The content should
probably be in English according to this.

84
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.830
Yes?

85
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Does it set the default?

86
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's setting up the default
and it's establishing our HTML document.

87
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.980
So line two starts our HTML document.

88
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.424
Where does this document end?

89
00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:48.690
Anyone wanna guess, yeah?

90
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.247
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Line 12.

91
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Line 12.

92
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.740
Right down here.

93
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.020
So you see how our HTML tags start
with an open tag just like this.

94
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.530
See down there at the bottom,
they end with a / and

95
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.379
the name of that tag, see how that goes?

96
00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.280
Okay, and so
then these are just nested together.

97
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.690
We're gonna work in and

98
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.290
work out these are like those
Russian wooden nesting dolls, okay?

99
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.910
HTML is just like that,
we have different levels of tags.

100
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.290
These things are called tags, okay?

101
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.460
So that's the HTML tag and they are nested
at various levels along the way.

102
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.680
Now, for those of you who are online,
everybody here in class,

103
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.600
we're in Minnesota, we're in America,

104
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.440
we speak English, our VSCode is
configured to load in English.

105
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.100
If you have a VSCode version
that's loading other languages,

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.300
you may have a different
character setup there for Lang.

107
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.430
So our says EN for English,
yours may say FR for

108
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.970
French or DE for German or ES for Spanish.

109
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.950
So that language up there is referring
to the content of the document.

110
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.290
And very interestingly, you might've
noticed before in, anybody ever looked at

111
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.630
a page in another language other than
whatever one you have specified up there?

112
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.790
Anyone ever done that before?

113
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.900
You ever see, maybe in Chrome,
that bar across the top that says,

114
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.030
this page is in whatever, this page is in
German, would you like to translate it?

115
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.940
You've seen that before?

116
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.520
That little bit of code
is what drives that.

117
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.946
So Chrome knows that you are an English
speaker in the case of this classroom.

118
00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:27.481
It knows that that page is in German
because somebody coded it and

119
00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:29.730
it says the Lang is DE, right?

120
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.640
And so then it puts up the little
Google Translate button for you.

121
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.038
How cool is that?

122
00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:35.538
So sweet.

123
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.430
All right, so then we're gonna go on.

124
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.800
Now there's two parts
to our HTML document.

125
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.280
Once we actually declare that we have one.

126
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.640
There's the head and the body.

127
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.400
Anyone know where the head starts?

128
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.770
Line number?

129
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Line 3.

130
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.998
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Line 3.

131
00:06:50.998 --> 00:06:52.744
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Where does the head end?

132
00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:54.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: 8.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Line number 8.

133
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Very good,
inside of the head.

134
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.130
We have a bunch of things
that are going on here.

135
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.330
The very first line here at line 4
indicates the character set that we happen

136
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.980
to be using.

137
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.865
Character sets are way too
complicated to talk about.

138
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:14.373
But you can kind of relate right, if you
were writing in a language like Farsi or

139
00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:15.878
Chinese or something like that.

140
00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:18.358
You would have different characters
on your keyboard, right?.

141
00:07:18.358 --> 00:07:22.820
We're using UTF-8,
which works for English.

142
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.180
The second line there,

143
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.800
line 5, this is an indication that
we're writing responsive design.

144
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.590
It's actually not required for
what we're gonna be doing.

145
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.540
But that's the line that says,
this is a responsive design document.

146
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.120
More on that later, maybe the weekend.

147
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.226
And then the next one here.

148
00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:45.007
Actually I am not sure
what this line does.

149
00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:46.481
Anybody know what this line does?

150
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:51.745
You guys in the back the IE Edge.

151
00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:54.994
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's just saying to
us the latest rendering engine.

152
00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:56.715
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, [CROSSTALK].

153
00:07:56.715 --> 00:08:00.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And there are certain
browser this will go away.

154
00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:01.629
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But like IE8 or

155
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:05.169
whatever it was like it would render in
the old rendering engine unless you put

156
00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.980
this tag here and
then it would render in the new one.

157
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
then the last one, there is line 7.

158
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.960
This is the title of our HTML document.

159
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.040
Okay, and we saw where that displays
already right here in our web browser

160
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.230
that displays up there in
the upper left corner.

161
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.990
See, there was a document.

162
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.320
Go on ahead and change that.

163
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.170
The way we change that is we're gonna
add it right in between the tags here

164
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.260
where it says document.

165
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.851
I want you to change it
to my first web page.

166
00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:36.616
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then go on ahead and save it.

167
00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:40.773
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And refresh your web page.

168
00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:48.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
any questions on that so far?

169
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.730
That's the head.

170
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.830
So notice that none of the things that I
said about the head of the document have

171
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.810
anything to do with showing up on the web
page itself, except for line 7, the title.

172
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.509
And that only shows up in
that tab part of the browser.

173
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.340
Everything else is sort of like
background about programming.

174
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.900
And that is why in VSCode, all we had
to do is type an exclamation point and

175
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.950
hit Tab because no one remembers
how to write all this code.

176
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.100
Nobody, if you put me in a room and

177
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.910
ask me a quiz and said, write all
that stuff at the top of the page I

178
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.820
would fail miserably cuz I never
remember where all that stuff is.

179
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.880
So nobody ever wants to
remember how to write it.

180
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.130
It's the same for
every document you ever write.

181
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.020
So exclamation point, tab.

182
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.210
But remember that your document
needs to be saved first.

183
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.200
So if you're struggling with that right
now, you're trying the exclamation point,

184
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.220
you're trying the tab and

185
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.620
nothing is working You didn't save
this as an HTML document first.

186
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.844
You must save this as index.html, so

187
00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:53.790
that VSCode knows this
is an HTML document.

188
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.227
Otherwise, it won't work, make sense?

189
00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:02.740
Okay, good, now that we got the head out,
yes, Muhammad?

190
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.159
&gt;&gt; Muhammad: So different websites,
have different structures and

191
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:11.478
they display different content, does that
mean that the same like beginning as this?

192
00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:14.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All webpages will
start with something like this.

193
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.500
The heads could be much bigger, there
are other things that will wind up and

194
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.290
like tomorrow we'll add CSS
to the head of this document.

195
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.669
Sometimes there's JavaScript up there,

196
00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:27.244
these things that start with meta,
they're called metatags.

197
00:10:27.244 --> 00:10:29.516
Sometimes there's other metatags.

198
00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:31.524
So we can make our head
really really long but

199
00:10:31.524 --> 00:10:34.570
this is fundamentally what you're
gonna need to write a website.

200
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.510
Great question.
