00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.197
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So go on down now and
put your cursor in between the body and

2
00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:07.526
the slash body tags
right there on line 10.

3
00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:10.019
And if we write, Hello, world!

4
00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:16.198
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hello, world!

5
00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:17.450
My name is Jen.

6
00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:22.051
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I live in Boston.

7
00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:29.405
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Minneapolis is awesome.

8
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.686
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I don't know,
whatever else you wanna write here, okay?

9
00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:39.288
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go on ahead and save that.

10
00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:43.498
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Refresh your web page.

11
00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.293
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hopefully it shows up.

12
00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:51.226
Did it show up?

13
00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.605
Whew, my work here is done.

14
00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:54.834
See you all later.

15
00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.122
[COUGH] Okay?

16
00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:02.302
So it's that simple in terms of
getting texts up on your web page,

17
00:01:02.302 --> 00:01:03.680
that simple, okay?

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.753
Well all you have to do is type some
text in, and it will show up for you.

19
00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:10.707
All right, let's say I'm going on here.

20
00:01:10.707 --> 00:01:17.288
One of my hobbies is playing the flute.

21
00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:24.458
I play in an orchestra back in Boston.

22
00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:30.765
We have a concert coming
up on November 11.

23
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.721
I don't expect anyone to
type what I'm typing.

24
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:34.057
I'm just blabbing away here.

25
00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:36.105
You do the same thing on your web page.

26
00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:40.740
So clearly I have two paragraphs
going on here, right?

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.503
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and save that.

28
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.013
And I'm gonna refresh my web page.

29
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:02.265
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

30
00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:05.033
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you wanted to format
it to actually look like two different

31
00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.271
paragraphs, would that
just be like a br break?

32
00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.110
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, isn't it interesting?

33
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.994
So Dylan notes that I wrote two
paragraphs over there in my code,

34
00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:17.533
but if you look at my web page,
what happened?

35
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.047
I have what looks like one paragraph,
right?

36
00:02:21.047 --> 00:02:25.493
[COUGH] Okay, so just because
you write code into the body of

37
00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:30.134
the document doesn't necessarily
mean it has formatting.

38
00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:34.174
All right, formatting is a dirty
word when it comes to HTML.

39
00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:37.983
We don't talk about formatting with HTML,
all right?

40
00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:41.644
Expunge it from your memory,
no formatting in HTML.

41
00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.969
What does HTML stand for?

42
00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.249
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Hypertext Markup Language.

43
00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.754
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hypertext Markup Language,
what on earth does that mean?

44
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:51.759
What is language?

45
00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:53.730
Let's start there.

46
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.692
What is language?

47
00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:56.901
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Communication.

48
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.463
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Some kind of communication,
right?

49
00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.101
We have spoken languages and
written languages,

50
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:03.372
we also have computer languages, right?

51
00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:04.699
You've probably heard of some of these.

52
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:10.496
C++, Java, JavaScript,
Ruby, Python, right?

53
00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:12.601
These are all languages, right?

54
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.826
So this is also a language of a kind.

55
00:03:15.826 --> 00:03:17.498
Then we have markup.

56
00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:20.711
What does markup mean?

57
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.133
Yeah?

58
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:26.111
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It came
from editors of books,

59
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:31.776
when they would mark up the author's work.

60
00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:34.683
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,
it comes from the concept of long,

61
00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:37.601
long tradition of publishing, right?

62
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.403
Where editors would mark up books about
what the author should be doing and

63
00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:43.313
how we should change things around.

64
00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:45.444
You've all seen that before, right?

65
00:03:45.444 --> 00:03:48.041
You've been to school before,
you've seen it on a paper somewhere.

66
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:50.904
Some teacher marked up your assignment.

67
00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:53.911
Okay, same kind of thing here.

68
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:58.165
So markup is the concept that
all we're doing here is we're

69
00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:01.406
identifying the structure of our document.

70
00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:04.025
So what is the title of this document?

71
00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:05.441
What is a paragraph?

72
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.672
What is a heading?

73
00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:09.014
What is a list, okay?

74
00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.836
This has nothing to do with how it looks.

75
00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:15.361
How it looks it's gonna come from what?

76
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:15.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: CSS.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: CSS,

77
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.698
Cascading Style Sheets.

78
00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.629
That's all about making things pretty and
we are gonna do that tomorrow.

79
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:25.129
Today we are gonna make the ugliest
web pages you have ever seen, okay?

80
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.039
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So do web developers
not think of making lists or

81
00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.797
paragraphs as formatting?

82
00:04:29.797 --> 00:04:30.770
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They shouldn't.

83
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.081
[LAUGH] They shouldn't.

84
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:34.498
They often do.

85
00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:35.780
But you should not.

86
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.218
You should think about,
what am I trying to communicate here?

87
00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:42.065
We're gonna talk a lot about this today.

88
00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:43.540
What am I trying to communicate here?
