&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I was hoping peanut butter
and jelly made it to all 35 countries.

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.595
But if not, hopefully you
made a list of directions for

3
00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:11.280
how to do something else that is
pretty simple and straightforward.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080
For those of you who are wondering how to
make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.520
we do have directions here for you.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.780
So hopefully,
your code looks something like mine.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.330
So I have a heading.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.160
So here's what this list is gonna be all
about, how to make a peanut butter and

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.330
jelly sandwich.

10
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.500
And then, I have my SIPS.

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.790
We're gonna use the OL,
which is the ordered list tag.

12
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.440
Inside of that, we have a series of LIs.

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.810
If you had a problem somewhere along the
way and it quote doesn't work, all right,

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.360
chances are the places to usually look for
these kinds of things.

15
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.910
One is,
people often make these syntax mistakes.

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.420
So syntax is all of the punctuation and
so forth that makes up your code.

17
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.750
And so, it's pretty easy to make a typo.

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.850
So instead of LI for list item,
you make a, I don't know, II, or

19
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.430
KI, or some other key that's nearby,
you get it wrong somehow.

20
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.490
So look to make sure you type
the right thing in all the places.

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.310
Make sure that they're nested correctly.

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.730
So that you close tags appropriately.

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.020
That's the other thing that
people often get wrong.

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440
They open the tag but
they forget to close it.

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.540
Hopefully, our editor will
help with that problem.

26
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.050
But that could be something else
you get wrong along the way.
