00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's go back on
over to, Hobbies page has more room,

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.790
let's continue on the Hobbies page.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.310
One of the things that you may
occasionally want to do is put in

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.100
a quotation from somebody.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.590
Somebody said something smart, right, and
you wanna put a quote in on your webpage.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.030
There are tags for this.

7
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.031
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The blackquote
tag is one of them.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: blockquote, that's our tag.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.760
That's for
somebody who said something, okay.

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.250
The blockquote tag.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.436
Inside of that,
we need the thing that people said, right?

12
00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.580
Anyone who wanna take a guess at
what kind of tag it might be the,

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.120
be a good tag for that?

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.381
Hint, you already know it.

15
00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:49.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a paragraph tag,
yeah?

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.880
Some smart person said
a really smart thing.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.980
Okay, so that's our quote.

18
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.280
Whatever it is that they said, all right?

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.856
And then we're gonna use the cite tag,
C-I-T-E, that is a citation.

20
00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.140
In other words, that's the attribution,
who said that smart thing.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100
So this is a very common thing,
we quote people all the time.

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.842
You can take some CSS styling,

23
00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:25.125
you can make this look absolutely
beautiful on webpages.

24
00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:28.610
You actually see that trick
all the time in newspaper.

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.850
Have you heard of a thing called
the poll quote in newspapers?

26
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.977
Sometimes the newspapers will
take some thing from an article,

27
00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:38.260
that they sort of pull out
a couple of sentences and

28
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.260
they make them really big and
scripty and kind of pretty looking?

29
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.710
This is the fundamental part of that,

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.850
the first part of getting
that kind of thing started.

31
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.995
So you gotta quote what
it was that they said.

32
00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:55.821
All right, if you save that and
look at your webpage.

33
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.596
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mine's right
there under the picture.

34
00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:11.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Some smart person said
a really smart thing by smart person.

35
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.520
And two more little tags for you.

36
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.858
Now, these two tags are the most
abused tags in HTML,

37
00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:22.180
the last two that I want to talk about.

38
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.600
I am talking to you here today.

39
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.730
I am here talking to you today.

40
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.960
You heard the difference
in those sentences, right?

41
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.200
Okay, so, what did I do differently?

42
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.770
I am here talking to you today.

43
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
Those are emphasized words, aren't they?

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.860
We have tags for
emphasizing those words in sentences or

45
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.630
strongly emphasizing those words.

46
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.150
I am strongly emphasizing this concept,
okay?

47
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.950
These two tags are called,
shockingly, the strong tag for

48
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.130
strong emphasis and
the tag for regular emphasis.

49
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.620
They are horribly abused because they
are thought of as the bold tag and

50
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.280
the italic tag, okay?

51
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.780
But they're not.

52
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.277
They're the strongly emphasized and
the emphasized, make sense?

53
00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:25.740
Okay, so if we were to emphasize
the really smart thing

54
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.602
that somebody said,
we would put in a strong tag around it.

55
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.528
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So some smart
person said a really smart thing.

56
00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These
are really smart thing.

57
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.300
We're gonna really emphasize that.

58
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.150
Okay, so that's what the strong tag is for
and then down here where I say.

59
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.367
I enjoy doing many things
with my spare time.

60
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:58.280
I'm just going to emphasize that so
that's just the &lt;em&gt; tag.

61
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.850
Yes,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you had a browser

62
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.950
extension that read this aloud,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes

63
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Actually read it like that.

64
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I would hope so.

65
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.810
I don't actually know
the answer to that question.

66
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.935
There are some screen readers
that are out there and

67
00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:14.054
available that will read webpages.

68
00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:16.804
Hopefully that it would put
in that kind of emphasis, but

69
00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:18.614
they're often computer voices and

70
00:04:18.614 --> 00:04:21.494
I don't know how far computer voices
have come whether that's a thing yet.

71
00:04:22.724 --> 00:04:23.394
But maybe one day.
