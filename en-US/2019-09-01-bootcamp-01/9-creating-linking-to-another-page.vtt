WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.898
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'd like you to
start a whole new web page.

2
00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:06.950
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Start
a whole brand new web page.

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.443
So everything that we've done today
is gonna come into play here.

4
00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.980
Start a whole new web page.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
Remember File &gt; New File, right?

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
Start a whole new web page.

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.064
And I would like for
you to go on ahead and

8
00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:24.802
put in some information
on this web page too.

9
00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:29.287
If you wanna just copy over your
hobby information, My Fine Hobbies,

10
00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:33.400
we can just copy that over from
this page into the other one.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.988
You can write a little bit about
your hobbies, make some links okay?

12
00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:41.289
Just go on ahead and
start a whole new page,

13
00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.139
as much as you can do in five minutes.

14
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.440
And then we'll wind up linking these two
pages together, once you've gone ahead and

15
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.064
put some stuff on another page.

16
00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:51.502
Sound good?

17
00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:54.732
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do we need to
name it a .html file in order-

18
00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:55.386
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

19
00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:56.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Absolutely,

20
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.613
you need to name it as a .html file.

21
00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:01.246
All right, so go on ahead and
make a new file.

22
00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:04.749
We'll go to File &gt; New File.

23
00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:08.024
Okay, so here's our new web page.

24
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:10.911
Now we're gonna go File &gt; Save.

25
00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:16.666
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And here inside,
it's gonna save to your day1 folder.

26
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:23.801
Let's call it hobbies.html, okay?

27
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.416
Here we go.

28
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.513
What do we do next?

29
00:01:27.513 --> 00:01:28.768
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Exclamation point tab.

30
00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:30.629
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exclamation point tab,

31
00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:34.622
that puts in all the crazy
stuff at the top of the page.

32
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.169
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's the next
thing that we should do?

33
00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.194
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody know?

34
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:46.034
Yeah, Jen?

35
00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:47.824
&gt;&gt; Jen: A title?

36
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:52.255
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change the title,
all right,

37
00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:56.010
My Great Hobbies, okay?

38
00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.297
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then you can either
type here in between the body tags, or

39
00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:08.213
you can just copy and paste over
from your other page, that's good.

40
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can throw in, so
this is probably no longer an h2 now.

41
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.290
This is probably an h1, since this
is the title of my web page right?

42
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.850
Maybe I want to put it
a little paragraph at the top.

43
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.360
I enjoy doing many things
with my spare time.

44
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.212
I don't have much spare time,
but when I do,

45
00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:59.611
you can find me doing one of these things.

46
00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:03.338
And remember, if it goes way too long and
it runs off the page,

47
00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:04.720
you can word wrap it.

48
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.893
Go to View &gt; Toggle Word Wrap.

49
00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:12.382
It'll all come back onto one screen again.

50
00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:14.579
View &gt; Toggle Word Wrap.

51
00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:18.748
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

52
00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:21.876
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So I know that a lot of
of websites, for their HTML documents,

53
00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:23.388
will be called index.html.

54
00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:26.959
Is that just a convention or
is there a particular reason for that?

55
00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is a reason for that.

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.740
We actually don't get to
that reason until day five.

57
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.745
But the reason for
that is that that is your homepage.

58
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.970
A homepage is always called index.html.

59
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.170
All your other pages will
be called something else.

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560
Okay, so you have sort of a,
kind of a start of a web page here.

61
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560
There's not a whole lot, but that's okay.

62
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.110
That's where we are today, all right?

63
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.640
So we now have two pages.

64
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.852
We have a homepage, that's our index.html.

65
00:03:53.852 --> 00:03:55.910
And we have a hobbies page, right?

66
00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:01.853
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
get from one page to the other?

67
00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:03.410
Gosh, it'd be great if we could do that?

68
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.300
Okay, so let's go on ahead and
make that happen.

69
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.642
Down here on your homepage, let's go on

70
00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:21.020
ahead, and I'm trying to decide if I want
to put this at the top or the bottom.

71
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.940
It probably makes more sense at the bottom
of the page, in terms of the content.

72
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.670
But I'm gonna put it at
the top of the page, so

73
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.150
that you all can see what I'm doing.

74
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.290
So I'm gonna put this just after my h1.

75
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.430
And if you wanna put yours at the bottom
of your web page, that's cool, too.

76
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.480
The code will be the same,
no matter where you wanna put it.

77
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.520
And I'm gonna put mine in here,
and I'm gonna put in a paragraph.

78
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.496
And I'm going to say, Visit my, right?

79
00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:56.089
Visit my, and
then we're gonna put in our, which tag?

80
00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.780
Which tag is going to make
a link from one page to another?

81
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.831
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: a?

82
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:02.296
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The a tag, right?

83
00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:05.617
So I'm gonna put in my a tag.

84
00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:08.097
a, what comes after a?

85
00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:09.349
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: href?

86
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.765
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: href equals.

87
00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:15.243
All right, so now comes the hard part.

88
00:05:15.243 --> 00:05:20.400
How do we get from our web
page to the other web page?

89
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.295
And our pages are not on the Internet,
so what are we going to do?

90
00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.563
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are we just gonna put

91
00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:31.508
the name of our other page-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We are gonna just put

92
00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:33.453
the other name of our page.

93
00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:36.061
So if you take a look in your folder now,
right,

94
00:05:36.061 --> 00:05:38.945
we have our two pages there
right next to each other.

95
00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:41.760
They're in the same place in the folder.

96
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.270
So all we need to do is link one to the
other just by typing the name of the page

97
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.690
where we want to go.

98
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.881
So this will be hobbies.html.

99
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:53.381
And in fact,
the code editor will help you.

100
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:53.931
Yes?

101
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:56.818
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: If we did have
a web page already made,

102
00:05:56.818 --> 00:06:00.978
would that still link the pages
if a user clicked on it?

103
00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:02.293
Or would you have to put the URL?

104
00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:05.497
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so if you already
have a web page that is already in

105
00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:08.810
existence, is that on your computer also?

106
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.167
Or is it somewhere out
there on the Internet?

107
00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:13.274
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Some place on the Internet.

108
00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:14.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Somewhere
out there on the Internet.

109
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.670
Okay, so if it's anything but in the exact
same website that you're currently working

110
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.890
on, we're working on one website, right?

111
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.600
So if it's anything that's
not this website right now,

112
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.080
you're gonna need that whole
HTTP in order to link to it.

113
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: What if all the web
pages were part of the same domain?

114
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.402
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
if they are all in the same folder,

115
00:06:33.402 --> 00:06:36.052
we're all working on them all together,

116
00:06:36.052 --> 00:06:40.460
then you can use this methodology
to link the pages together, okay?

117
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.767
All right, hobbies.html,
do we want this open in a new window?

118
00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:50.397
Typically, what we do when we're linking
to a page that's the same one on

119
00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:54.000
our same website,
we wanna link to it in the same window.

120
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.890
It's when we link to pages that go to
other websites that we open them in

121
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.880
new tabs.

122
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.330
So we're not gonna put in the whole
target equals blank thing.

123
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.150
We're not gonna do that here.

124
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.817
We're just gonna end our tag here,
hobbies page.

125
00:07:09.817 --> 00:07:11.420
Just like that, okay?

126
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.320
Visit my hobbies page.

127
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.060
So if we go on ahead and save that, and

128
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.850
let's look at that link.

129
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.690
See now, that my Visit my
hobbies page link is blue,

130
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.270
cuz I have never been there before, right?

131
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.370
And when I click on it,
I got my hobbies page.

132
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.294
If it didn't work, chances are you
made a typo in here somewhere.

133
00:07:39.294 --> 00:07:43.577
You said .htm instead of .html for
your file name.

134
00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:45.984
You spelled hobbies wrong.

135
00:07:45.984 --> 00:07:47.924
There's a space in there somewhere.

136
00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:51.740
Usually, it's that kind of thing
that's going to break your link.

137
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.900
Okay, so why don't you guys now take, you
know what I'm gonna ask you next, right?

138
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.020
Now you're on your hobbies page, and you
can't get back to your homepage, right?

139
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.316
Go ahead and take two minutes and

140
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.388
write a link that will take you from
your hobbies page back to your homepage.
