00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.620
&gt;&gt; Jen: Ryan just asked
a question about headings.

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.030
And he asked the question about, what
headings should be used with which lists?

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.790
So in other words, here on my

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.960
Hobbies page I have an h1 up here on
the top, and then I have some paragraphs.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.115
Yeah, and then I have my list of hobbies.

6
00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:23.420
Here on my homepage, I have an h2 for
my make my peanut butter,

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.860
and jelly sandwich, right?

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.960
So Ryan is asking,
what heading should be use with the list?

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.690
And the answer is, it depends.

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.420
Which is the multimillion dollar
consulting answer to all things.

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.700
Just look thoughtful and say,
it depends, and make millions.

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.524
So what's gonna matter here is in
the structure of your document.

13
00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:48.920
Where is this list occurring, and
what function is it performing, right?

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.620
So in this case, we already had a title
of our web page, each one all about me,

15
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.730
up here towards the top.

16
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.280
And then further down on the page,
we put in an h2,

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.910
to describe this part of our page,
the section of the web page.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.190
And then we have an h2 down here
that talks about some links.

19
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.635
Yeah, okay, so if I have another,

20
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:16.573
sub section here under links,
let's say h3.

21
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.763
&gt;&gt; Jen: H3, and
this is gonna be more links, but

22
00:01:22.763 --> 00:01:27.490
it's gonna be a subsection of my links,
right?

23
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.860
So my favorite music links,
they're part of my links.

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.270
These just happen to be,
my favorite music links.

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.660
So this is now in h3, and
maybe I have a list under this

26
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.630
about with a whole bunch of links
to my favorite music websites.

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.810
And it's under that, then I have an h4,

28
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.410
my favorite classical music websites,
yeah?

29
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.586
And then we can go to an h5.

30
00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:09.277
&gt;&gt; Jen: My favorite Beethoven

31
00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:13.670
music websites.

32
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.738
And then we can go to h6.

33
00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:30.126
&gt;&gt; Jen: My favorite websites about

34
00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:36.260
Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

35
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.770
See, how I made that more,
and more, and more specific?

36
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.270
It's just like headings that you use all
the time when writing papers in English or

37
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.550
anything else, right?

38
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.340
So you can have a whole series of these.

39
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.514
In practice, you rarely get
past an h3 on a web page, okay?

40
00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:55.880
It would be a pretty detailed page to
actually get all the way down to an h6.

41
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.473
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the a tag have to be
in another tag, usually, or it can stand-

42
00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:01.540
&gt;&gt; Jen: The a tag can stand by itself.

43
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.800
You could have an a tag just sitting on
out there in space, as a link by itself.

44
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.640
But it is typically inside
of something else, yes?

45
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Blank lines like 26 and
28 don't mean anything, do they?

46
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.320
&gt;&gt; Jen: They don't mean anything,
that is a great question.

47
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.640
So the question was about some of these
blank lines that I have in my HTML.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.330
And the fact that they are not reflected,
let me save my page.

49
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.420
They're not reflected at all
in the web page that I have,

50
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.040
going on over here on the side.

51
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.540
Are they?

52
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.450
Okay?

53
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.220
So you can have as many spaces and as many
returns as you want inside of your HTML,

54
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.730
they have no reflection at all
whatsoever on your webpage.

55
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.050
In fact, if we were To just sort of
hold down the space key for a while.

56
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.700
You might think that we're
going to have peanut butter,

57
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.160
and then we're going to wait for
a long time for and jelly, aren't we?

58
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.920
Okay?

59
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.150
But if we take a look at our web page,
there's actually no effect at all here.

60
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.745
So HTML Is not affected by your spaces.

61
00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:10.235
The first space yes,
the second space and beyond, not so

62
00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:14.015
much doesn't care about him.

63
00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:16.515
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What if you
untap two spaces there?

64
00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.865
&gt;&gt; Jen: If you wanna have two spaces,
there's an actual code for

65
00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:22.385
making additional spaces,
we'll get to that later.
