00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.354
Now we're into the React components, and
I'm gonna close everything else out.

2
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:10.884
So, there's a common thing you're gonna
need to do if you're working with React

3
00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:12.985
and that specify your base class, right?

4
00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.237
So here, I am simply saying that,
I have a function and

5
00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:19.582
it takes an object with
the channel on it as an argument.

6
00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:23.844
Well, there are more things
that React to components take,

7
00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:27.532
it have to do with the way JSX works,
like children.

8
00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:31.878
Children are part of a React components
interface with the outside world.

9
00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:35.719
So we're gonna end up adding,

10
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.640
React.FunctionComponent to
a lot of things.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.246
Actually, let's make it a
React.FunctionComponent generic over any.

12
00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:53.441
And if you've ever used TypeScript
with React before this interface here,

13
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:58.375
this is for sorry,
this type parameter is the where you would

14
00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:03.044
specify the type of props
that this component receives.

15
00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:06.693
So the things that it receives from the
outside world, I'm going to put this on my

16
00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:09.873
clipboard cuz we're gonna have to go
run add this in a bunch of places.

17
00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:12.443
So I'm just gonna keep it handy.

18
00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:13.477
All right, loading.

19
00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:14.836
What's wrong with this?

20
00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:19.998
Children is missing,
I bet it just needs this.

21
00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:20.864
Let's see.

22
00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:26.276
Turns out that was it.

23
00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:31.663
Right so for the JSX invocation to work,
children has to be there and

24
00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:36.295
you have to get that
React.FunctionComponent type, and

25
00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.907
the thing being exploited
to make that work.

26
00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:44.043
So now I basically determined that we
need this for every React component.

27
00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:46.510
So I'm just gonna go through,
and add it everywhere.

28
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.048
Just add it to each component, and save.

29
00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:58.781
All we have here are function components,
they're basically stateless or most of

30
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:03.730
are, unless they're making an API call,
in which case there's a little use effect.

31
00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:10.509
All right, that already has it, so
that's a different problem there.

32
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.644
I'm just going through each component and
adding this type to it.

33
00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:18.725
And we're not defining props yet,

34
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:23.664
cuz that's,
we're likely just do that in a later step.

35
00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:27.137
We've survived this long without
a type for our props and so

36
00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:29.648
it's not harmful to leave that for later.

37
00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:36.239
Okay, last one.

38
00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:40.915
So now everything is a function component,
and

39
00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:42.925
we still have some things
here that are red.

40
00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:50.930
So here all right,
I have a callback with it's

41
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.073
like a function that receives an argument,
and

42
00:02:56.073 --> 00:03:02.908
it's an any so, I need to state it.

43
00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:20.176
Now, Getting real close, so these

44
00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:24.207
are all like array functions where I just
need to do something with the callback.

45
00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:30.313
So all I've done just now, I know it
seemed like I changed a lot of code,

46
00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:31.536
it was two things.

47
00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:36.930
I typed my React components to
FunctionComponent, generic over any.

48
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.814
And then, for array higher,
like higher order functions,

49
00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:44.608
I have to add a type to my callback.

50
00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:46.315
So we're now down to two errors.

51
00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:54.503
And my problem here is let's
see messages is undefined.

52
00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:58.199
And that's because I am
using React.useState,

53
00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.863
and I'm not specifying that this
should be an array of things.

54
00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:11.315
That might do it.

55
00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:15.269
Now you can see that I'm sort
of encountering these in layers,

56
00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.265
cuz when you make it through some piece
of code that, you clear the errors away,

57
00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:22.295
others are revealed behind it.

58
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:27.315
And now it looks as if we
are free of errors and

59
00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:32.490
let's see what our built
output looks like.

60
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.440
Let's remove our dist folder
just to convince ourselves that

61
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.540
output is actually we'll
run yarn build instead.

62
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.029
Because Parcel is actually
doing the building for us here.

63
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:48.194
So we just want to make sure that we're
actually getting a built output for

64
00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:50.956
this and
I see it's building like the TSX files.

65
00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:54.398
This is this is all good sign,

66
00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:58.949
and let's see that disk folder pop up.

67
00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.237
And there it is.

68
00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:03.582
So, we're in good shape,
this is where I'm going to make a commit.

69
00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:08.780
This is phase one, we've gone from
JavaScript to TypeScript files.
