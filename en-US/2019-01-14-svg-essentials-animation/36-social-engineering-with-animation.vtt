&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So, Viget did
an experiment that despite some individual

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.310
variation, novel loaders
had a higher wait time and

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.980
lower abandon rate than generic ones.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.620
If you know Val Head, she has a whole book
where she goes into all of these details

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.810
of these kind of things, so if like to
nerd out about this kind of information,

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.030
you should go buy her book,
because it's super, super good.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.050
So she talks about this in that book, too.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.980
This is kind of a custom
loader that you'd find,

9
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.640
if you wrote loader GIF on the Internet,
you would go find that GIF.

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.350
People waited for 14 seconds for
this GIF, just indefinitely.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.810
This is not a fancy animation.

12
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.350
This is not that crazy.

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.430
They just took their logo and
have some dots.

14
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.840
But people were willing to
wait twice as long, and so

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.930
they had a lower abandon rate just by
caring like this much about the animation.

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.890
When you think about the kinds of
animations that you have on your site,

17
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.810
you can think about accents and

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.390
eases the same way that you'd
think about accents and pallets.

19
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.030
So, if you have an all green site,
and a bright red button as an accent,

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.580
you can do the same kind of
things with your animation.

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.110
You can have all sign eases and

22
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.720
then only in the part where you tell them
I got your information you do a bounce.

23
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.170
So, having a different kind of ease or
a different kind of event occur

24
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.380
can help people get like a dopamine
rush and say, something was different.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.200
This is really good.

26
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.870
So if we're working with SVG
as like an aid to our website,

27
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.800
we could have it just like
a regular SVG as an image.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.550
So you don't actually even
have to do much at all.

29
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.100
We could just have this
be an animated SVG, and

30
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.150
then it just kind of scales for
mobile, that's it.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.280
It's just like a normal image.

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.670
You don't have to do all those fancy,
crazy, sprite things.

33
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.310
You might be like,

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.600
I don't want to work with SVG because then
I have to make a crazy thing, you don't

35
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.840
have to, you can just have it be just like
a normal, kind of, but animated image.
