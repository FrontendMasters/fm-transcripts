00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: SVG anatomy overview.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.880
Let's talk a little bit about what SVG is,
why it's cool, why we use it.

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.610
And then we're gonna talk about
what the internals are because

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.990
before we even animate, we really need
to figure out what's in that DOM.

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.070
Sometimes when you open an SVG and
you've never seen an SVG before,

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.090
you're like,
what is all of this number garbage?

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.950
And we're gonna break that down so that
that doesn't seem intimidating for you.

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.910
SVG, it's crisp on any display.

9
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.070
It's in a vector format, so basically,
we're drawing these points with math.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.990
And no matter how big or small it gets,
it's gonna stay completely crisp.

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.060
So that's really nice.

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.580
You know how when you're
doing responsivedev,

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.854
sometimes when you have a png of
the cut up many multiple images.

14
00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:51.550
You use a picture element or source set,
and you've gotta add all of them,

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.590
get them from the designer,
all this stuff.

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.770
With SVG, you're delivering one asset and
you can make it scale for all the devices.

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.870
We're gonna do some really tricky
fun stuff with responsive SVGs.

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.190
It's less http requests to handle.

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.640
In fact, it can be no more http requests
to handle cuz you can put it directly in

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.010
line in the HTML.

21
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.700
So you can actually have it
not incur that extra cost.

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.430
It's easily scalable for responsive,

23
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.210
that's in the name,
scalable vector graphics.

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
So it's very squishy and
organized, like show and

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.090
learn what we can do with
that squishyness today.

26
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.730
It's a really small file size
if you design for performance.

27
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.030
If you design for
performance is a major piece of that.

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.370
So we're going to talk a little bit about
how to make sure your SVGs are built

29
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.330
appropriately and not abusing the DOM
while you're building them out.

30
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.780
But some of the stuff that you can do

31
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.110
in just a few kilobytes of
data is really amazing.

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.410
It's incredible, especially if you
compare to a giant PNG or a giant JPEG.

33
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.040
So that's really cool.

34
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310
It's easy to animate,
that's part of the reason why we're here.

35
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.110
It has a navigable DOM.

36
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.870
This is so cool because with a PMG,
you basically have this flat image.

37
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.290
So if you see a picture of me,
then in order to move my hand,

38
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890
you would have to cut out the hand.

39
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.450
Then you'd have to figure out what
would be in back of the hand.

40
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.382
And then you'd have to absolutely
position it on top of there.

41
00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:25.510
Then you'd have to then move it,
but then if it was responsive,

42
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.490
I'd have to change all
of those parameters.

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.620
SVG already has navigable DOM.

44
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.710
That arm is already ready for
me to just move independently.

45
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.150
And it's not different from other HTML.

46
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.400
You can slap a class on it and
move it around with CSS.

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.420
And you can move it
around with JavaScript.

48
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.370
All of those same things that
you already know how to do

49
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.090
from being a web developer
apply to SVG as well.

50
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.390
It's easy to make accessible,
I love this part.

51
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.020
There's like many, many tiers of how
accessible you can make your SVG.

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.160
I'm gonna show you the base thing that
pretty much most things would be.

53
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.300
There's a whole slew of other
ways of making SVGs accessible.

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.020
I'll also give you resources, so

55
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.640
you can check out more crazy things
you can do with SVG accessibility.

56
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.730
Especially if you're making data
visualizations or something like that,

57
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.340
you might wanna make things a little
bit more screen reader happy.

58
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.930
But I'm just gonna show you what you
probably want nine times out of ten,

59
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.670
maybe more than that.

60
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.130
And it's fun.

61
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.470
Remember fun?

62
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.860
I like fun.

63
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.700
It's been a while.

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.550
[LAUGH] We're gonna have
a lot of fun today.

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.660
I really have a great time
making these SVG animations.

66
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.570
Sometimes if I'm hanging out on
the weekend watching a movie,

67
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.064
that's what I do for fun,
is make these SVG animations.

68
00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:53.130
So it's really great for
web development but it can also be

69
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.010
something that you do on the side, just to
replenish your love for a web development.
