00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.812
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, live code,
this is how I feel when I live code.

2
00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:05.860
[LAUGH] All right, live code.

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.290
We make the text a little bit bigger.

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.260
We've got some boxes here and
we've got our new box here.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.060
I'm actually going to, yeah.

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.090
Let's start by just animating
the boxes and not the new box.

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.164
So I'm gonna take this,
I'll say TweenMax.to and

8
00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:32.700
then we already have a query selector for
all the boxes and

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
then I'm gonna say, okay, one second.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.670
And then I'll say y 200 and
what happens when I do that?

11
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.590
And it will all fall down, right?

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.840
Cool, not very exciting,
maybe we want to have an entrance though,

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750
maybe we wanna have all of these things.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.520
Actually, I'm gonna get rid of new box for
now.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.063
Let's just comment this one out for
a second.

16
00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:03.749
Maybe I wanna have it come from the top
and have a grand entrance onto the page.

17
00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.160
That kinda makes more sense, right?

18
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.985
So we can have all of the boxes and
we're gonna say from and

19
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:14.220
then we're gonna say, y is -300,
I think that will work.

20
00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:20.128
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, so it's
coming from, it's making an entrance but

21
00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:22.140
that's still not very exciting.

22
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.649
So maybe we can do one
of those things that we

23
00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.420
saw earlier and
we can say bounce.ease out.

24
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.940
And then we have all of the boxes and
they go bump, bump, bump, nice.

25
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.260
Okay, that's a little bit better.

26
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.828
Now maybe we want to make
them stagger a litte bit so

27
00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:43.252
we can say stagger from but
we have to also have a delayed amount like

28
00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:45.900
the amount between each one
of the boxes coming in.

29
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.540
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: [SOUND] Okay,
that's a little bit cooler.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.992
All right, maybe we want to make
it like just a little bit less so

31
00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:57.860
that we can see them coming in together.

32
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.466
Yeah, that's a little bit better,
okay cool.

33
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:05.260
So maybe we wanna make them rotate and
just turn over one after another.

34
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.460
So we can kind of do this and we can say,
okay, take all of these boxes and

35
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.440
rotation 90 and
we're also gonna use a bounce.

36
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.910
in CSS it's rotate, in GreenSock
it's rotation, in Mo.js it's angle.

37
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.850
I don't know why everybody
needs their own name for this.

38
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.449
But the naming isn't very consistent,
so if you get stuck on that,

39
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.460
you're not the only one.

40
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.050
That happens to everybody.

41
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.190
So we go and we have this but
they're all bouncing together.

42
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.848
So what I could do is
I could say delay one.

43
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.940
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And
they go and then they rotate.

44
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.090
But really we talked about
the timeline a bunch, right?

45
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.070
So maybe we want to use
a timeline instead.

46
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.606
So I would actually probably remove
this delay and change this to tl.

47
00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:05.896
Tl and change this to tl.

48
00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:13.390
So now they bounce and then rotate.

49
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.020
But we talked a little bit about
the overlapping action, right?

50
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.385
That's not super great
because we're waiting for

51
00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:21.650
all of them to stop before
doing something else.

52
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.605
So what will we do here to make
them kind of overlap a little bit?

53
00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:30.960
Does anybody remember?

54
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Give it a negative delay?

55
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's right,
we would give it a negative delay.

56
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.530
So I would go after this
kind of delayed amount and

57
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.030
I would do a string
that has a decrementor.

58
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.900
We'll start with one but
thatâ€™s probably not right.

59
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.220
Yeah, that's too much so let's do 0.5.

60
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.460
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Yeah,
that's looking a little bit better.

61
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.838
So what if we wanted the boxes to
turn over and then kind of not

62
00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:06.760
be sure that they're gonna turn over,
and then really turn over?

63
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.070
What if we want to have a little
bit more kind of emotion in there?

64
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.480
Well, we could have
the boxes turn over again.

65
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.707
I'm actually gonna remove this one for now
because maybe you want to see the whole

66
00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:23.060
kinda overlapping action happen for that.

67
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.420
So I'm gonna change this to 180 and
we're gonna have those boxes.

68
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.460
They're gonna go and
then they're gonna go again.

69
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.090
So they fall down, they go,
and then they go again.

70
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.880
But they're not really like waiting or
there's no tension there.

71
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.580
So we have these bounces for ease out.

72
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.580
Ease outs are good for entrances and
ease ins are good for exits.

73
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.539
I know that that doesn't sound right but
I'm not lying to you and

74
00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.550
I didn't make it up, you can't blame me
for the naming this time, maybe later.

75
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.650
So what we might wanna do to have that
kind of tension is to have dueling

76
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.890
eases to have eases that don't
work in different directions.

77
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.850
The other thing we might
wanna do is we might want to

78
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.170
have one take a little bit
longer than the other one.

79
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.890
If I'm waiting and delaying, I might take
a more of a second and then kinda go.

80
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.540
So let's remove that and
then see where we're at.

81
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.970
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Fall.

82
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.536
[SOUND] All right, so now,
we've got it, it falls and they go and

83
00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:37.740
they're not sure of themselves,
and then they go over, yeah, okay.

84
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.250
So what if we wanna reintroduce new box?

85
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.554
New box is just gonna chill there while
all this other action is going on.

86
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:50.067
[SOUND] Okay, so new box just

87
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:54.980
gonna wait for just a second.

88
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.228
I want new box to just
stay on the page and

89
00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:03.650
not come in with an entrance but
also rotate with everybody else.

90
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.970
So how might I do that?

91
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.918
If I add them all to the timeline, I mean
I could do that, what would I have to do?

92
00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.154
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I will write a label.

93
00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:21.618
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's right.

94
00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:23.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then animation
ends then restart.

95
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.490
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Perfect, so rather
than I could bring the new box on and

96
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.840
I could say go back in time
to a certain point in time.

97
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.330
So I could, okay,
3 minus 0.5 and calculate

98
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.440
backwards to the point in time
on the timeline where it starts.

99
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.710
But we talked about labels,

100
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.320
if we want all those things to stay in
sync, then it makes a lot more sense for

101
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.110
me to just apply a label so
that they can all move together, right?

102
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.770
Does that make sense?

103
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.706
So I'm gonna give myself a little space
here and say, tl, add and then rotate.

104
00:07:03.706 --> 00:07:09.210
Sounds good and then this one is
gonna come off of that rotate label.

105
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.970
And then this one is going to
be now an incrementer instead.

106
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.960
I'm gonna change the timing of this to
come off of rotate and this was two.

107
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.040
But then I walked it back a little bit so

108
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.470
it's actually a little too much cuz you
could see some tension was overlapping.

109
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.890
So I'm gonna go plus equals 1.75,
all right.

110
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:37.600
Let's just see where we're at before
we start adding any more things,

111
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.266
before we break it and
we can't find our way back, right?

112
00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:45.830
So [SOUND] okay, cool.

113
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.200
Now, we can take this and duplicate it.

114
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.970
And we can say, all right,
I want that to happen for new box too.

115
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.350
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And grab this and
we do it for new box.

116
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.890
But something's wrong.

117
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.950
Does anybody know what's wrong?

118
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it shouldn't be
stagger from, should be stagger.

119
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Well,
we would have to remove to stagger,

120
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.270
you're absolutely right.

121
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.050
Because we're not staggering,
it's only one element.

122
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.190
We've just got one box.

123
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.950
So we would change this back into from and
remove this because that wouldn't work.

124
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.030
There's not multiple elements there,
there's just one element.

125
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.680
All right, let's try this again.

126
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.709
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Bounces.

127
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:40.880
[SOUND] So they all move together.

128
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.570
Now, if I decided to like, I don't know
change this to five seconds longer.

129
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.434
If my PM comes in and says,
we want that entrance to take forever but

130
00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:52.780
the rest of the animation to be the same.

131
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.378
Now I can do this.

132
00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:58.390
The fox goes [SOUND] and

133
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.750
then everybody's moving together.
