00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.570
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Here's the last thing
that we're gonna cover which is svgOrigin.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
svgOrigin is super cool
because look at this,

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.260
I've got this cow jumping over the moon.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.530
I'm gonna throw it and
he scares the little guy, right.

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.870
My friends were making fun of me because
they could do this better than I could.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.974
So cow scares the little astronaut,

7
00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:29.230
and, of course, it's SVG so
it works well on mobile too, and

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.360
also that's draggable, so
it's draggable and then it's 360.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.120
So I wanted the cow to jump over
the moon and rotate around the moon.

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.730
There didn't used to be SVG Origin
in GreenSock, but now there is.

11
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.870
Now, SVG Origin,
you can pick out two points

12
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.610
inside the SVG and
have everything rotate around that.

13
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.630
So really, transform origin wouldn't
allow me to do that, right,

14
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.710
because SVG, I'm rotating around another
piece of the SVG somewhere else.

15
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.370
So you can pick any
point inside the SVG and

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.050
have things go around that thing,
it's super cool.

17
00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:15.072
Whoops.

18
00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:18.000
So instead of they don't have the x, y.

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.400
So for the view box, it would be x,
y, width and height.

20
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.790
They don't have those points.

21
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.430
They just find the point like x and y and

22
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.620
we're gonna rotate everything
around that point.

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.246
So I found the midpoint of the moon and
it's rotating around that.

24
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.353
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if they didn't, man,

25
00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:39.550
the transform origin issues in
those embeds is really crazy.

26
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.820
So if that didn't exist, how was I
trying to do it before it existed?

27
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.640
Well, I thought I would make this
long pole and take the cow and

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.450
put it in a group with the long pole,
and then make the fill

29
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.390
transparent of that pole and
then I would around this way.

30
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.260
But it was constantly firing.

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.742
It was just like I did like a test like
a hit test between these two things and

32
00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:12.138
was like, well,
when they hit do this other thing, but

33
00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:16.750
it was like constantly firing and
I'm like, there's a bug in GreenSock.

34
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.630
No, there's not a big bug in GreenSock,
what it thinks is happening and

35
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.920
the reason why it's constantly firing,
is that there is no diagonals in the DOM.

36
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.890
So this is the group,
this is what the DOM sees.

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.880
And that's the little head that
it is trying to check against.

38
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.360
So it is almost constantly
over that head really.

39
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.894
I'm thinking of it like this thing.

40
00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:41.950
What's going on?

41
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.700
And then it wasn't until I put
a border around the whole thing.

42
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.300
Go, okay that's what it's seeing.

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.530
So that's what the DOM sees for
that piece.

44
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:56.555
And here's the problem with hit tests for

45
00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:02.415
SVG I kind of touched on this before but
I didn't fully explain it with visuals.

46
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:08.155
If I check the bounding box stroke of all
of these shapes while they're turning

47
00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:09.605
that's what we get.

48
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:12.585
So all of these things
are moving even the circle.

49
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.590
Look at how weird that is.

50
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.730
What?

51
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.390
What is going on?

52
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.330
That is so bizarre.

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.440
But that diagonal is really
the thing that like, caught me.

54
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.700
So, you can see if you have that
hit test and you have two stars,

55
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.790
and you're trying to see
if they hit each other,

56
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.580
they'll hit each other way before it
visually looks like they hit each other.

57
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.810
So that's why that overlap thing,

58
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.160
that overlap threshold
becomes really important.

59
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.260
So if you do decide to make a game, which
you should, then you can kind of check.

60
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.490
There's probably no better way
to really understand the DOM and

61
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.370
everything inside of it than
making a game in the browser.

62
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.490
It might seem like a funny task, but

63
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.480
you have to dive into all of the kind
of what the DOM sees and everything.

64
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.689
So definitely play can be
a really cool way of learning.
