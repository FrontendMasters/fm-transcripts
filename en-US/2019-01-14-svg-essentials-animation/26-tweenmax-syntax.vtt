00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.929
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, GSAP overview.

2
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.887
Let's learn how to animate with Greensock.

3
00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So here's the syntax.

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.150
We have TweenMax, and
if you hear people say like,

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.060
TweenMax TweenLight and
Timeline Max, Timeline Light.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.200
It's all the same thing, right?

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900
TweenLight is a lighter
version of TweenMax.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.680
TweenMax gives you some extra features
like some more CSS properties to animate.

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.430
It also allows you to loop things.

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.970
And TweenLight does not.

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.160
So if you're really weight conscious
you could start with TweenLight,

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.660
see how far you get and then maybe
switch to Tweenmax when you need to.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.240
I usually start with Tweenmax these days
cause I think it's only 27 kilobytes or

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.330
something like that.

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.705
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, and I looked up
if they are using ES modules now so

16
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:49.299
you can use it with Webpack and
get the tree shaking as well.

17
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.919
So you know.
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Totally, totally.

18
00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:56.883
So you can,
you basically bring it in by the too.

19
00:00:56.883 --> 00:01:01.144
So you'll bring in TweenMax or
TweenLight, whichever one you need, and

20
00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.389
then you would also say sign,
or bounce, or whatever.

21
00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:06.978
And then yeah,
you get tree shaking and that.

22
00:01:06.978 --> 00:01:14.168
So you would say npm igsap or
yarn@gsap, exactly.

23
00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:19.126
So we'll start with TweenMax and
if you here me say GreenSock or gsock,

24
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:23.400
that's the company that makes it,
and TweenMax is the library.

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120
So it's kinda like, Facebook makes React.

26
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.150
So GreenSock makes TweenMax, yeah.

27
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.500
So TweenMax, and
then you'd say to from or from to.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.140
So, basically you say
it's like a sentence.

29
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.390
If you take this element and
you're saying go to that location.

30
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.890
Or you take this element and
you say come from this location.

31
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.900
Or you say from to.

32
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.110
And from to is really good for
entrances, it's good for like,

33
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.240
if you're saying like, come from
over here and then go to over there.

34
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.210
Then we have the element, the duration,
the property and the amount.

35
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.042
So instead of applying it in two places,
instead of saying got key frames and

36
00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:13.027
then applying the animation to something,
this is actually kind of one line of

37
00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:16.426
code but I'm writing it in
to three different lines so

38
00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:19.019
you can see it a little bit more clearly.

39
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.570
So TweenMax to I grab some div and
this is the same as a query selection.

40
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310
Think of it like a j query thing.

41
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.160
You can put ID's in there or elements.

42
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.180
Duration and
then I have a bunch of things here.

43
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.070
You might notice that it says scaleY,
scaleX, y.

44
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.730
It's transform, translate X, transform,
translate, it's all of those things,

45
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.160
but they shorthand it, because they
assume, they're like, okay, we get it.

46
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.718
Just Y, Y is fine.

47
00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:59.550
[LAUGH] You don't have to write transform,
translate X all of those things.

48
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.820
Scale Y, Scale X, opacity.

49
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.480
You also don't have to put the unit
unless it's a default unit.

50
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.368
So it's going to assume
you mean 100 pixels.

51
00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:12.574
It's just like don't worry
about writing the pixels.

52
00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:16.320
So then you can have.

53
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.510
I mean this is one line of code.

54
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.890
That's kinda crazy.

55
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.678
Think about how many lines
a code that would be in CSS.

56
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.760
I've written bounces in CSS,
its not one line of coded.

57
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.690
It's many, many lines of code.

58
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.920
So this is pretty cool.

59
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.560
And in the repo I did a little cheat sheet

60
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.460
of all of those properties in case you
need to look at them or check them out.

61
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.260
So this is what it is in GreenSock land.

62
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.520
And this is what it is in CSS land,
the CSS counterpart of these things.

63
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.610
So if you wanted to check that out
while you're making things then it

64
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.400
makes a little easier.
