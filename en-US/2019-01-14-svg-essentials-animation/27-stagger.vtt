00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:01.980
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's talk
about staggers for a second.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.808
So there's CSS, there's SASS,
and there's GSAP.

3
00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:10.300
It's the same animation for
both, for all three.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.410
So how do we write it in each?

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.741
I have some HAML to
just spin up some bars.

6
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:18.038
If you don't know what HAML is,
don't worry about it.

7
00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:22.334
[LAUGH] CSS, I would say,
@keyframes staggerFoo to

8
00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:27.422
background: orange;
transform: rotate(90deg);.

9
00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:32.167
And then I would say nth-child(1),
and I have staggerFoo and

10
00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:36.700
then I have this delay that
increases per unit, right?

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.110
One, two, three, four.

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.380
And one of the problems with this is that
if I add more units, I have to add more.

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.260
And it's very repetitive, right?

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.810
It's kind of against those DRY
principles that we talk about sometimes.

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920
SASS is a little bit better.

16
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.520
We've got the same keyframes,
and then I can use a SASS for

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.310
loop to kind of apply
that to every nth child.

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.420
This starts to look a little squirrely.

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.521
I mean, it's fine, but

20
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.020
it's not the most legible thing if
you don't work with SASS a lot.

21
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.770
And we have that same problem of,

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.660
if I wanted to add more units I
didn't have to go change this, yeah?

23
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.313
Here's what it is in GSAP.

24
00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:23.090
It's just one place TweenMax.staggerTo I
go grab all the bars.

25
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.026
And in this case,
can be any amount of bars.

26
00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:30.197
You can add 100 more bars and
it's the same code.

27
00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:36.152
One backgroundColor: orange,
rotation: 90, ease: Sine.easeout.

28
00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:42.200
And then we say 0.1,
0.1 is the amount in between each one.

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.565
So remember how we increase
the delay every time by 0.1,

30
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.390
this is the delay that
we have between them.

31
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.820
Pretty cool?

32
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.020
So that stagger,
I'm gonna go over these just a few times,

33
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.074
just a few little repetitions,
because this is the most important part.

34
00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.620
All of the things that we learn towards
the end of the day is all based on you

35
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.690
understanding this syntax and
this timeline so

36
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.920
you can do more cool, cool stuff.

37
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.690
Okay, so stagger, so things like stagger
are kinda complicated to do in CSS

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.650
animation and
in GSAP are one line of code.

39
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.110
So we can do all of those boxes.

40
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.253
I mean, again, this code does all of that.

41
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:28.517
And it looks really classy, right?

42
00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:31.390
I didn't do that much to make it look so
classy.

43
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.030
I have an ease, that's an elastic easeout,
and I have a stagger, too.

44
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.140
So I'm grabbing all the squares,
again, could add more squares,

45
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.700
could get less squares.

46
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.780
This is the delay between each one, and

47
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.560
then I rotate them, and
basically they all just kinda fall.

48
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.558
So I have a delay here,
I have two of these two tween maxes,

49
00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:56.463
they happen at the same time.

50
00:02:56.463 --> 00:02:59.973
So in order to add another one,
I can either delay it or

51
00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:02.163
we can start to use the timeline.

52
00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:06.250
And the timeline will allow us to
just kind of follow each other.

53
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.960
So you can write it like this if you want,
but

54
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.365
I'll show you how the timelines
work in just a second, too.
