&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Motion along a path.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.850
Motion along a path is really
important for realistic motion.

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.600
If you're gonna try to animate something
that looks realistic in real life,

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.590
there are very few things that just
go straight through things and time.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.460
Even if you're making
a truck go down a street,

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.900
you might want to bounce it along or
have something happen to it.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.530
So this is one of the coolest
things about SMIL.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.080
If you know what SMIL is,
it was the native way to animate an SVG.

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.190
But SMIL is never gonna be supported.

10
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.960
Basically, Microsoft browser said that
they were never gonna support it and

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
Chrome has put it into, well,
first they put it into deprecation,

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.480
then they took it out of deprecation and
just said,

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.880
we're never gonna work on it again, so
it's just not, nothing's going on with it.

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.620
Like, it's just not something
you should bet on using.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.730
But it had motion along a path,
and there is a motion path module,

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.240
but it's not really well supported either.

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.230
So, the nice thing about using GreenSock's
motion along a path is, first of all,

18
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.310
it's in GreenSock,
the open source version.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.980
So you don't have to load a plugin.

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.330
If you do MPMIG sap or

21
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.990
load up GreenSock, this is in there,
you don't have to add something else.

22
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.930
So we have backwards compatibility and
it's cross browser, even old IE,

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.060
this I just said, but
it's also written in the [LAUGH] slides.

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
If you wanna vote for CSS support
in motion along a path in Edge,

25
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.940
you can vote on that here.

26
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.140
I think it has a lot of votes now.

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.990
But basically, this is how you use it.

28
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.068
I'm gonna grab some fireflies and
I say bezier, and

29
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:45.020
I'll say type is soft, and
I pass in an array of values.

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.510
We are getting pretty used to this
xy xy nonsense, right [LAUGH]?

31
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.577
Like, xy, xy, xy, xy, and
then autoRotate:true,

32
00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.490
I will show you what that is in a second.

33
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.050
It's pretty self explanatory,
it rotates with whatever curve it's on.

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.600
So if I have these fireflies,
actually let me come out of here, okay.

35
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.042
So I have this like lighting, does some
things, then I've got some fireflies, and

36
00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:17.030
they're kind of moving around.

37
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.990
Fireflies, if you watch them do this
weird thing, where they kind of like,

38
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.740
pop into different places and move and
kind of, I watched a bunch of YouTube

39
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.050
videos [LAUGH] of just fireflies
moving around to get the motion,

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.430
which you should do, if you're trying
to emulate something in real life.

41
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.360
But the people around you will be like,
what are you doing?

42
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.820
And your search history
will get super weird.

43
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.500
Like, your recommendations [LAUGH].

44
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.330
My recommendations for
YouTube are like, either code or

45
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.100
shattering glass, I don't like,
[LAUGH], it doesn't understand.

46
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.635
So when I'm talking
about that auto-rotate,

47
00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:58.270
you can kind of see how the fireflies move
around with the curve that they're on,

48
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.720
before they kind of, and they're kind
of flickering a little bit, too.
