00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There's another
way I could have made this.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.840
So, if I didn't wanna use morphSVG and
I didn't want to use a glue filter,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.990
there's a million ways you
can do all these things.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.690
You don't have to them just one way.

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.232
We talked about this with
the many element scene.

6
00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:20.120
Totally cool to make big div
over the whole thing, or a big

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.590
path over the whole thing and then change
things, adding a filter totally helps.

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.280
Or we could use HSL, they're both
totally valid ways of doing it.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.500
So, Blake Bowen is a really great
person to follow on CodePen.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410
He has all sorts of great CodePens, and

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.191
he did this CodePen sample to show
how a Catmull-Rom spline works.

12
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:44.040
Catmull-Rom spline isn't
something he invented.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.590
But this pen shows how
it works really nicely.

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
So he's got these kind of path values, and

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.520
he's using a Catmull-Rom spline
to soften those path values.

16
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.990
And this is what a Catmull-Rom spline
looks like in terms of code, and

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.130
if you wanna read more about it,
there's an article.

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.860
About the camel rhyme spline,
that if you go on and get super nerdy and

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.480
find out more about that.

20
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.220
It's kind of a similar premise to what we
were talking about before with that buzzy

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.060
A, the motion along
the path kind of thing.

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.130
Not the same, but similar concept.

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.300
So, here we've got a polygon
with a bunch of path points.

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.620
But we could totally change
these polygons around.

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.480
Like, what if we made a polygon that was
kind of like a flame with a bunch of

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.720
different path points, smoothed
that out and then changed, animated

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.720
the path points around, and then it's just
smoothing out that shape the whole time.

28
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.300
So we wouldn't necessarily need to use
a filter in morphSVG if we didn't want to.

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.890
Or we could apply the filter still.

30
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.630
And not need morph SVG,
cuz we know the path points.

31
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.990
So that's another way of working with it.

32
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.600
I could have made it more programatically.

33
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.470
And you can do all sorts of effects.

34
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.920
I made this the same way, basically,
which is just a bunch of different

35
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.670
gradients and shapes, and
then For you now the wick.

36
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.510
It's like that, you know,
wick looking thing and

37
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.080
then it kind of decrease in
opacity as the smoke goes up.

38
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.970
Again, lots of YouTube videos [LAUGH] And
watching smoke.

39
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.320
I got a bunch of candles and
I'm blowing them out and watching them.

40
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.620
And you look really crazy when
you do stuff like that, but

41
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.330
it's also actually a nice way of
seeing how things work and move.

42
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.190
So if you're thinking, where do I get
started, how do I get an idea for

43
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.100
an animation?

44
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.900
Definitely look around you, and get ideas
from the things that are around you.

45
00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:54.190
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So this pen,
I just fixed this to do the Start button.

46
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.776
You can't use audio now,
unless you have a Start button on the web.

47
00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:07.005
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: [LAUGH] so
this is an audio

48
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.910
file that I worked with.

49
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.330
I took two audio files, the static and the
booming, no, that's three audio files, and

50
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.480
I put them together.

51
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.720
And you know how the rest of these work,
probably.

52
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.570
I animated a filter, right, that was how
that kind of crumbly thing happened.

53
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.980
One of the things was DRAW SVG,
all of the Missiles.

54
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.800
Its Kind of a bumming pens
are mean to like bum us all

55
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.830
out before the end of the day.

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.320
And then that scattering apart with all
of the triangles what did I use for

57
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.560
that I know I'm really testing your
memory because there's like way back in

58
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.400
the beginning of the day.

59
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.150
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: It was cycle stagger.

60
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.020
So it was like, remember that pen
where things shattered apart?

61
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.590
So I basically said go in x,
that direction, that direction,

62
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.800
that direction, that direction.

63
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.400
Go in y, that direction, that direction,
that direction, that direction.

64
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.290
And then you get a burst really easily,
and

65
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.220
of course, by creating that burst,
I needed a few things to fire at once.

66
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.390
I need the filter to fire, I needed
the you know, thing to scatter apart.

67
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.010
I needed the color to change.

68
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.090
What did I do on the timeline to make
sure this all happen at the same time?

69
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Entered
all particular labels.

70
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.950
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's right,
I used a label.

71
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.470
So, I said, label of boom.

72
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.030
And then I made everything
happen at the same time.

73
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.210
So I could even adjust and I did, adjust
all the animation that came before it.

74
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.640
And that's, okay because I could go back
and the boom was always still the same.

75
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.729
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So here again, we've got
that base frequency, I'm changing some

76
00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.090
filter stuff around, but you see these
tl.call, the formatting got weird.

77
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.820
These are all lined up in real life.

78
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.320
I have this tl.call add attribute,
remove attribute.

79
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.750
These are functions.

80
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.890
So you can actually call functions
within a timeline by using tl.call,

81
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.360
and then adding the function in.

82
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.060
So what these calls are is that I'm
adding the filter into the, I'm applying

83
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.240
the filter when I need it, and then
I'm removing the filter when I'm done.

84
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.510
Because filters can be kind
of performance-intensive, so

85
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.680
I didn't want it on there while everything
else was happening, I don't need it yet.

86
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.130
So I add it, and then use it,
and I take it away so

87
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.370
that it's not affecting
the performance of anything else.

88
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.610
So here's the add attribute.

89
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.310
So I'm setting the attribute, and then I'm
applying it, and then I'm removing it.

90
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.360
And then here's this pen
that my friend Chris Gannon,

91
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.290
who's a really amazing animator that
you should totally follow on CodePen.

92
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.790
He says it's really creepy and
he hates it, so I gotta show it to you.

93
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.710
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

94
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.490
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
each key that I'm pressing, we'll do like

95
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.904
a different thing and
make different sounds pop in.

96
00:06:16.904 --> 00:06:18.450
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

97
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.390
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So you know how
this stuff is made probably too.

98
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.980
So this is Draw SVG, yeah I use that for
a lot of weird effects.

99
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.080
This F will kind of explore the code of.

100
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.670
The rest of these are just timelines.

101
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.790
I just retrigger it, I make a timeline
that has R tween max or something.

102
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.660
And then I retrigger it for
each one of these key presses.

103
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.270
And I've got some HSL going
on in the background.

104
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.860
I'm actually making it so
that you can keep playing with it, and

105
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.150
change the whole scene.

106
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.390
And it just stays weird,
that's just a choice.

107
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.200
So cool, for that balloon basically

108
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.250
what I'm doing is I'm, we've got the CX
and CY and the radius to make a circle.

109
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.550
So every time I hit the key
the radius gets bigger, the CY

110
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.680
adjust, so that it's like staying
in the same place basically.

111
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.820
And then ones the radius
gets to a certain pont.

112
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.590
Then I play a sound of it popping and

113
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.670
I have this whole timeline of the balloon
kind of scattering and stuff.

114
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.310
And then I have a set time
out that puts the radius and

115
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.420
see y back in the same place again.

116
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.717
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And, I played with this
on mobile and I had the keyboard and

117
00:07:42.717 --> 00:07:44.470
I had the keys doing it.

118
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.700
But the keyboard kind of covered some
of it, and it was really awkward, and

119
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.730
I didn't really like it very much.

120
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.663
So I just took the palette that I was
working with for the drawing, and

121
00:07:55.663 --> 00:08:00.360
I stuck in on the screen, and
I had people play with that instead.

122
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.104
So instead of using the ADSF keys,
they can play with this palette and

123
00:08:06.104 --> 00:08:09.980
push each button and
it activates it that way.

124
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:15.661
The palette is shown to
the screen through large and

125
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:21.090
very horrible regex,
like really I apologize.

126
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.947
But I really didn't wanted to be a media
query because I didn't wanted to

127
00:08:25.947 --> 00:08:30.260
ever show up on desktop,
I just only really wanted it on phones.

128
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.930
So in order to do that you apparently need

129
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.800
like seven lines of the most
horrible red jacks in the world.

130
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.210
So if you will look at the code for

131
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.980
that, I think there's
an apology in comments there.

132
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.290
So everyone smiles I gotta tweet
that's like it's okay you're fun.

133
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.160
But someone just read that code.

134
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.682
We talked about how

135
00:08:55.682 --> 00:09:00.820
you can use split

136
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.430
text to tell a story.

137
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.508
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So I made this pen and
Sarah Swedon showed it in one of her talks

138
00:09:21.508 --> 00:09:26.502
and said, how many introverts
are in the audience today, and

139
00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:28.755
nobody raised their hand.

140
00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:32.081
[LAUGH] Which is what we do [LAUGH].

141
00:09:32.081 --> 00:09:36.650
So, you can kinda play
around with things and

142
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.680
make short little scenes and create stuff.
