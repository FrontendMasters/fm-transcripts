&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Probably the biggest
thing that you need to understand before

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.806
we move forward and
in order to animate is transform-origin.

3
00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:11.610
Transform-origin is really like
the thing that keeps your animation or

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.340
can make or break your animation in
terms of whether it's believable.

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.905
So transform-origin,
when you're spinning something around,

6
00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:25.200
transform-origin wants to start here,
which is totally counterintuitive.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.200
You'd assume that when you're animating
something it would spin like that, right?

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.030
You would think that, that would be 50-50.

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.890
Most of what I'm doing is setting
50-50 [LAUGH] transform-origin.

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.500
But if let's say you
have an arm on a robot or

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.060
something that you're moving around,
you wouldn't want it starting here either.

12
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.730
You'd probably want it starting over here
so that it can swing around and stuff.

13
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.771
So this again is always,
it's always these x/y values,

14
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:57.240
x/y values, so
we're finding the percentage.

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.520
You can use things like top,
left, center, center.

16
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.119
I would suggest not doing that,
and using percentages instead.

17
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.608
Because if you need to knock something
into place, then you just change a number

18
00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:11.750
a little bit, rather than rewrite
the code, you know what I'm saying?

19
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.651
So instead of saying,
if I have center-center, and

20
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:18.711
I find out that I need to change the
transform-origin just a little bit I can

21
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.657
just modify those percentages by a little
bit and kind of put it in place.

22
00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:26.580
Whereas if I've used the named ones,
I'd have to rewrite it.

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.770
So this pen by Dan Wilson I think
does a pretty good job of showing you

24
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.714
where those transform-origins live.
