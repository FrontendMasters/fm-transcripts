&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Before
we go into timeline,

2
00:00:02.026 --> 00:00:05.629
I got a question during the break and
one of the question was,

3
00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.825
were I used GreenSock with D3 or
would I just use D3?

4
00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.089
I actually,
usually use GreenSock with D3, and

5
00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.521
even Shirley has started
using GreenSock with D3.

6
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:18.940
Green Sock in D3 play
really nicely together.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.029
So you get everything on the page like,
remember how I mentioned before, you get

8
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.660
everything there and then you can hide or
reveal things, or move things from there.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.833
So what I'll do is I'll get
everything on the page with D3,

10
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.335
snd then once it's in the DOM I'll
manipulate it with GreenSock.

11
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.558
And you can even like hide things away
with GreenSock and then bring them in.

12
00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:42.034
But D3 has a sense of things
that aren't there yet,

13
00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:44.540
in a way that GreenSock doesn't.

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.320
So D3 can kinda create things,
and make things from scratch.

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.240
GreenSock can't do that, it just knows,
once it's in the DOM already.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.440
So the only tricky part is making sure
that D3 is done mounting everything,

17
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.450
and then you have access to
it with GreenSock, right?

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.740
So you could use CSS to
hide things initially.

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.050
Get everything on the page,
like just opacity 0 it.

20
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.860
D3 gets everything on the page.

21
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.470
And then GreenSock you'd go draw
this on and do this cool stuff,

22
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.010
morph this stuff and stuff.
