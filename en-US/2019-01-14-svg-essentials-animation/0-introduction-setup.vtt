00:00:01.326 --> 00:00:03.493
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Hi, I'm Sarah Drasner.

2
00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:06.798
I work for
Microsoft as a senior developer advocate.

3
00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:12.774
I also work on the Vue Core team and
I work for CSS-Tricks as a staff writer.

4
00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:17.406
I'm so excited to be here with you today
talking about my favorite thing in

5
00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:19.658
the world which is SVG animations.

6
00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:24.777
And taking SVG and doing all of these
amazing things with this technology.

7
00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:31.087
I did give this workshop two years ago but
I have doubled the course content now.

8
00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:36.612
Not because there's so much more in SVG,
it's pretty stable actually.

9
00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:40.143
It kinda just goes along,
support is awesome.

10
00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:43.347
And everything that you could do then,
you can do now.

11
00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:45.894
But there's so many different ways to use

12
00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:50.567
it that I've expanded this course to
show all of these different insights.

13
00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:55.439
Especially, there's a few little
things that I'm going to show you with

14
00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.581
frameworks that I didn't
have in the last class

15
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:02.368
because frameworks weren't
as big of a thing back then.

16
00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:05.072
Cool, all right, let's talk about SVG.

17
00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:08.980
This is the repo,
if you need to check it out.

18
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.135
You don't necessarily have to download
the entire repo if you don't want to or

19
00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:19.996
fork it but the links to all of
the slides dex are in the read me.

20
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:24.698
They are password protected,
not to secure them or anything but

21
00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:29.573
just because I keep all of my slides for
other talks on my profile and

22
00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.461
there's a lot of workshop materials.

23
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.915
So if you go over there, there's
just like a little, in the read me,

24
00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.029
there's a password that you stick in and
you can get in there.

25
00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.145
Another thing that would be good for

26
00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:46.020
you to do is to get a free CodePen account
in order to play along with the exercises.

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.703
There's a lot of exercise and
a lot of CodePen demos in here.

28
00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:51.582
You don't have to use CodePen.

29
00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:56.449
You can use something else but all of the
exercises and all the collections are in

30
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.306
CodePen so it might be easier for
you if you use something else.

31
00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:03.154
You're gonna end up copy
pasting a lot of stuff.

32
00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:06.913
Great, so suggestions for
getting the most out of this course.

33
00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:10.577
I really thinks it's imperative
that you do the exercises.

34
00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:15.334
If you don't do the exercises, you're not
really getting all of the information,

35
00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.749
all of the things that
you can get out of it.

36
00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.299
I don't know if any of you have read,
Learn Python the Hard Way.

37
00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.766
But in that book, he talks a little bit in
the beginning of the book about how you

38
00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:30.235
should actually type out all the exercises
instead of just cloning the repo and

39
00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:31.270
looking at them.

40
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.788
Physically typing everything that he's
saying and trying everything out.

41
00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:40.211
And I think that that's so valuable,
not just for this course, but for

42
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:44.135
all of these kind of things where
you're learning how to code.

43
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:48.917
It might seem like it takes a longer time
to do all of the exercises that way but

44
00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.830
you're actually learning much
better if you do it yourself.

45
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.834
So we're gonna work with
CodePen a bunch today.

46
00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.608
So I'm gonna show you some things
that you can do in CodePen.

47
00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:02.459
First, I have this CodePen
propaganda poster.

48
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.540
I don't work for CodePen,
I just really like them.

49
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.283
Yeah, because in Soviet Minneapolis,
the CodePen is loaded with you.

50
00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:17.080
[LAUGH] Let's do, when we work inside
CodePen, I'm gonna change view here.

51
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.156
Notice that I'm in this Full View.

52
00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.612
I'm gonna change the view
to this Editor View and

53
00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:27.419
that's where you can see HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

54
00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.348
In JavaScript, you can see that you
can add a JavaScript preprocessor.

55
00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:34.889
I usually start my pens with Babel,

56
00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.456
you don't have to use Babel
if you don't want to.

57
00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:40.867
This is an older pen so it has jQuery.

58
00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.789
In CSS, I use SCSS as a preprocessor.

59
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.443
Again, you can use
whatever you like in here.

60
00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:51.564
I also have normalize autoprefixer,
prefixfree, all of those kind of things.

61
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:56.563
Suff for the head is in here if you
need to add classes to the HTML,

62
00:03:56.563 --> 00:04:00.375
that's here and
same with HTML preprocessors.

63
00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.400
There are assets here, I think you'll only
get assets if you have a paid account.

64
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.047
That's probably accurate.

65
00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:09.647
I can't remember, but
one of the cool things,

66
00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:11.928
you see this little star that I have here.

67
00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:14.174
You won't have that star probably.

68
00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:15.554
I'm a CodePen picker.

69
00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:20.397
So if you make a CodePen that you're
really proud of off of this class,

70
00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:24.992
you should let me know so that I can
maybe pick it for the homepage and

71
00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:26.406
feature your work.

72
00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:28.467
Cool, another couple of things to note.

73
00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.550
I have this extension that pops
this open in a debug window and

74
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.964
then it pops it back open over here.

75
00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:38.370
And that's what makes
the extension code open.

76
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.284
Full disclosure, my husband made that for
me because we're both nerds and

77
00:04:43.284 --> 00:04:47.190
he was watching me open different tabs and
stick the URL in.

78
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.882
So that was like an anniversary
present he made for me,

79
00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.787
cuz nerds, we like each other sometimes.

80
00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:58.327
[LAUGH] It is actually really
nice because this debug window,

81
00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:00.472
you notice that debug slug.

82
00:05:00.472 --> 00:05:04.776
I mean I can get between these two,
I can just write pen and

83
00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:10.750
then I can change the slug again and
write debug to get to the other window.

84
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.940
Really, what CodePen is doing,
it's actually a React application.

85
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.370
It has a bunch of iframes so
this is an iframe, iframe, iframe, iframe.

86
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.390
And so if you're trying to look at
the elements inside of this, you have to

87
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.470
navigate through all of the iframes and
it's really complicated and not so great.

88
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.400
So if we open it up in here,
inside here you can see the raw HTML,

89
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.220
and raw CSS, and raw JavaScript.

90
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.110
So it's really helpful to look
at it in the debug window

91
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.180
when you're going back and forth, cool.

92
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.170
Also, one other thing.

93
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.150
GreenSock, we're gonna be
working with GreenSock today.

94
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.730
GreenSock's base thing of TweenMax
that has a ton of features is free and

95
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.880
open source, but

96
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.820
there's a lot of extra things I'm gonna
show you today that are paid for plugins.

97
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.340
If you're working with CodePen,
you don't have to pay for them though.

98
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.420
You can play with them and try them out.

99
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.740
And this that's linked up here
this CodePen safe plugins.

100
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.870
This page has all of those things.

101
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.862
So it has a list that they keep up to
date, you can copy each one of them and

102
00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:20.657
there's also a collection for
each one of them of relevant pens, so

103
00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:21.947
that's really cool.

104
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.317
So if you don't wanna buy a membership,

105
00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:28.507
you can try out all of
those plugins there, cool.
