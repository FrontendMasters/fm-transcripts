&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if we have
a huggy laser panda factory, and

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.560
actually this looks really
weird on this screen.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.470
We should probably check
it out on another screen.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.470
There's not like white outlines for real.

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.006
So if we have a huggy laser panda factory,

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.023
which is the place where
huggy laser pandas are made.

7
00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:20.285
So if you ever wondered where
huggy laser pandas are made,

8
00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:22.160
they're made at this factory.

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.570
So this is a desktop view of that
huggy laser panda factory, and

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.950
a mobile view of a huggy
laser panda factory.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.770
And really, what they are, are three SVGs.

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.550
That's one SVG, this is another SVG,
another SVG, and

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.390
they lock together like Legos.

14
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.960
And this one, this one section is flipped.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.850
And interlocked into this piece.

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.580
So we have interaction plus responsive.

17
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.190
I think this is, yeah,
that kind of messes up the thing.

18
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.990
So if I want to make the panda lasered,

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.840
and make it a panda, and
then, I wanna make it

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.270
huggy and then I wanna change it for
responsive.

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.030
And then, it kind of interlocks and
changes, and

22
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.360
this works on like old Windows
phones that they no longer make.

23
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.290
It works like on all mobile devices,
the whole thing is 13 kilobytes.

24
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.930
So, basically what we have is this
like timeline that's repeated.

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.500
One function that's repeated and it has
all the, again, bloobie bits [LAUGH] and

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.380
we've got like all of these
gears turning around and stuff.

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.370
And for each one of these SVGs,

28
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.086
we have an interaction and
a thing that happens.

29
00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:53.585
So we have a function called Paint Panda,
and then the Paint Panda restarts,

30
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.360
so we start all of them.

31
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
So let's look at some of the code.

32
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.070
This function revolve has all the gears
and all the things that are repeated.

33
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.763
And the way it's repeated is
this thing called repeat:-1,

34
00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:10.170
that's how you loop in GreenSock.

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.878
So if I want just one piece to repeat:-1,

36
00:02:13.878 --> 00:02:18.816
I could just repeat:-1 on this tl.to,
that one.

37
00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:23.610
Or I can make the entire timeline for
this section repeat,

38
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.010
by passing it in as
a parameter to that timeline.

39
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.207
Now I'll make like a function paintPanda,
you know everybody's got paintPanda

40
00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:36.330
functions, and
what I'll do is I'll pause this initially.

41
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.850
So it kinda works
similarly to the repeat:-1.

42
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.590
I'm passing in as a parameter
to this timeline, paused true.

43
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.546
And then as soon as I click that one
piece on the SVG, it restarts this one.

44
00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:52.330
Yeah.
