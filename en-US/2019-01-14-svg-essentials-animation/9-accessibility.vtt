&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Accessibility,
let's talk about accessibility for

2
00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:04.467
just a second.

3
00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.087
There are a couple of
things you need to do.

4
00:00:06.087 --> 00:00:10.207
And this is like when I said, we're
going to just show you the really basic

5
00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:13.740
thing that you should be doing for
pretty much all of your SVGs.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.350
And if you want to make it more
complicated you can also do that.

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.603
Okay, so
we've got aria-labelledby="title" and

8
00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:28.310
then the first element beneath encased
inside that SVG has to be the title.

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.451
You can't put something else in
there first, like defs maybe or

10
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.670
something like that,
it has to be the title.

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.618
The title ID, in this case, is title,
which I should've just changed it to

12
00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:42.200
something else, I could say dancing tango
monkey pants, dancing tango monkey pants.

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.510
These have to be the same association and
only one per page too.

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.970
So we have ID, we have a role, which is
presentation, we can also say role image.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.449
The reason why you have the role on
there is because you're trying to tell

16
00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.370
the screen reader don't read
out everything in the SVG DOM.

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.016
So you can imagine if you were using
a screen reader to navigate a website how

18
00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:10.205
having it read it has the possibility for
all of these great accessibility things.

19
00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:11.880
Because it has a [INAUDIBLE].

20
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.499
But you also don't want it to read every
shape [LAUGH] to someone with a screen

21
00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.690
reader either, that doesn't sound great.

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.360
So making sure it has role presentation or
role image is really important.

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.626
Then within the title we have
to have the title in the ID,

24
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.350
actually Jaws won't pick
it up without that.

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.153
So if you leave the ID off you're,
basically, not even including a title,

26
00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:34.290
unfortunately.

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.583
I also include the language because then
if they are using the screen reader in

28
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:42.560
another language it will automatically
change the language for them.

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.090
That will be done for them, they don't
have to go look up the translation.

30
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.500
So you can just have a bit of text
there that describes what's going on in

31
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.320
that image.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.567
If you want it to traverse and
do crazy things,

33
00:01:55.567 --> 00:02:00.481
you could also say aria labeled by group,
and then it will go through,

34
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.840
and find the groups, and
kind of do it that way.

35
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.600
This one is the one that you should
be using for most things though.

36
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.040
There's a resource here
with support charts.

37
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.045
In this article by Heather,

38
00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:17.900
she did this great kind of community
service by making this article.

39
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.566
She went to the library every weekend and
tested all of these SVGs,

40
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:27.480
like embeds, and images, and
inline, and data visualization, and

41
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.250
all these different things,
on every device there.

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.540
Just out of the goodness of her heart.

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.156
So definitely take advantage of
this resource cuz she put so

44
00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.930
much work into it and it's a really,
really great resource.

45
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.538
So if you wanna learn more about
SVG accessibility that's definitely

46
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:45.400
the place to go.
