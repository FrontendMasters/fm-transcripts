00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.395
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Preserve aspect ratio,
you will probably almost never need this.

2
00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:06.962
[LAUGH] Like almost, almost never.

3
00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:10.868
But I cover it anyway because it's
important that you know about it in case

4
00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:15.110
you do wanna use or in case you wanna
do some advanced cropping techniques.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.250
But don't feel like you have to commit
this to memory in the same way that

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.080
you have to for the circles and recs, you
probably should commit to memory, this,

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.842
it's okay.

8
00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:29.756
So the default which is preserved
aspect ratio X mid Y mid meet is

9
00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:32.550
usually what you want in real life.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.370
That kind of uniformly scales, and

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.110
it's likened often to
background sized cover in CSS.

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.470
So if you ever have an image
that you make a hero image and

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.500
you like always great all the time,
that's the same kind of idea.

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.820
So, it takes three parameters, a line and
meetOrSlice, so we've got x Min,

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.070
Mid, Max, Min, Mid, Max,
Meet, and Slice, or none.

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.510
And don't worry if that
doesn't make sense,

17
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.910
I'm gonna show you
visually what that means.

18
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.716
Actually, let's show you visually what
this means before we even do this part.

19
00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:10.100
So Meet means that it's going
to constrain within the viewBox.

20
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.350
So nothing, no shapes are going to be cut
off it's just going to constrain within

21
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.810
the viewBox and it's going to go yMin,
yMid, yMax, xMin, mid and max.

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.720
So you can see if it's yMin and yMid,
it kind of stays in the middle, right?

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.201
If we've got Slice, then that's
kind of intuitively named actually.

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:39.660
It's actually blowing up so big that it,
the corners meet the edges of that frame.

25
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.020
And it's going to cut things off so
Min, Mid, Max, Min, Mid, Max.

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.880
So if we go back here, Meet,

27
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.670
the default, entire viewBox is
visible within the viewport.

28
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.900
The viewBox is scaled up as much as
possible meeting other criteria, and

29
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.060
the viewBox is smaller than the viewport.

30
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.980
Slice, the entire viewport
is covered by the viewBox.

31
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.490
The viewBox is scaled down as much as
possible meeting other criteria, and

32
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.740
the viewBox is greater that the viewport.

33
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.650
None is actually my favorite
because it takes all of

34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.770
the constraints out of that image.

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.610
And that might not be great for a face.

36
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.377
If it's a face, it's not super great to
have it just expand in every direction and

37
00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:25.321
be like [SOUND] and
it would actually make that noise too.

38
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.756
[LAUGH] And you can kinda see how
that would, for a regular image,

39
00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:33.580
not be so
great especially like icons and stuff.

40
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.960
But you don't necessarily
have to use it for

41
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.820
that, we could use it for
things like layout.

42
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.087
So I made this site with Valhead and
for each of these sections

43
00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:47.735
I have this section between
that's this triangle and

44
00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:53.330
you can see how it scales up and
back down as I make it responsive.

45
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.710
So basically what's going on here,
I come out of full page mode.

46
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.140
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So you see how this
triangle goes like this, same with this.

47
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.480
And it's just really
part of the layout right?

48
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.470
Really it's an SVG that where it
has preserved aspect ratio none so

49
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.150
it scales completely with the container,
and has an imposed height so

50
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.950
it always stays the same height.

51
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.940
But then the width just changes.

52
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.480
And it goes to a pointier triangle.

53
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.638
But if I wanted to make it like a smaller
triangle I could have put in a media query

54
00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:32.990
that said like, make it smaller,
or something like that.

55
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.450
I will literally expand to
whatever the container is.

56
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.670
And if you look at this,
it's just the color.

57
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.350
It's an SVG,
that's the color of this section above it.

58
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.382
preserveAspectRatio, None, and

59
00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:52.340
I just drew a path with drawing lines and
things like that.

60
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.710
And we're gonna talk
about paths in a second.

61
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.510
So you can do crazy things
with your layout, and

62
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.930
you're not beholden to sticking
to just boring boxes everywhere.

63
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.160
So this is another kind of pen that shows,
come on, Chrome.

64
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.600
Wait, I've gotta come out of full screen.

65
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.570
So if I take this,
this is done with React and React Motion.

66
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.772
You can see that these
triangles in the background,

67
00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:25.480
they're really just for design purposes.

68
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.352
They don't do anything exactly, but
they're squishing back and forth and

69
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.813
it makes the design a little less boxy and
a little bit more dynamic.
