00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.170
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: There's
also cycle stagger.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.476
So let's open this in Code Pen.

3
00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:12.676
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So we're kind
of changing all of the things and

4
00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:15.330
we're throwing them all over the screen.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.680
And this is all the code
it takes to do that.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.310
That is not a lot of code.

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.320
Cycle Stagger is really cool because
basically what it's doing is it's taking

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.160
each time you stagger, and it's saying,
well, maybe you wanna cycle through a few

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.740
different properties instead
of keeping them consistent.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.340
So for the staggerFrom it'll
cycle through white, yellow,

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.760
and this kind of red color, and
then it'll cycle through a few opacities.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.450
Every time it finds another element,
it'll go white, yellow, some red,

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.700
or, and then white, yellow, red,
white, yellow, red, like that.

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.510
We can also cycle through coordinates.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.890
So I can say like, throw it this way,
throw it this way, throw it this way,

16
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.740
throw it this way.

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.650
Or, I'm actually given
access to the index.

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.480
So, in this case,
I added a rotation using this index.

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.870
Could have written this as
an arrow function as well,

20
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.830
but I don't know what level you're at, so
I'll just write it like this at first and

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.498
then I'll write it as
arrow functions later.

22
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:23.590
So we have access to that index.

23
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.450
And then I can say for
each index multiply that rotation by 20,

24
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.520
and then it can do all
sorts of crazy effects.

25
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.280
Pretty neat.
