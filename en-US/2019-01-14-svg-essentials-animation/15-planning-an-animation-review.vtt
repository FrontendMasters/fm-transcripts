00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
these are some awesome storyboards.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.890
I'm so excited about all of these.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.150
Let's talk through some of them.

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.570
So Brandon, let's have you start,
we'll look at this starburst animation.

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.920
&gt;&gt; Brandon: Yeah, for sure, so
I tracked in an icon on the noun project,

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.260
that had this really kind of
interesting kind of explosive look.

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
And the first thing I thought when I saw
it is, I wanna mess with the rotation and

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.410
I wanna mess with the scaling of it.

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.778
So there are those three kind
of concentric circles there.

10
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.925
In the second frame I kind of
swamped the outer layer and

11
00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:38.270
the inner layer scaling and
then twirled it around a little bit.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.260
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Awesome!

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.030
That's gonna be really fun.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.880
Cool.

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.580
I'm so excited to see this
all animated and moving.

16
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.270
Christina Gordon does
amazing SVG animation work.

17
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.060
She's not in this room right now,
so she's not gonna explain them.

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.600
But you should definitely
check out her code pen.

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.720
Let's look at Andrea's.

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.790
&gt;&gt; Andrea: So Iâ€™m doing a dinosaur
scene where he sees a rabbit,

21
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.692
he eats the rabbit, and
hes chewing on the rabbit.

22
00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:10.730
And then there's the asteroid and then you
zoom out to see what happens to the earth.

23
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.005
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Awesome
[LAUGH] that's great, I love it.

24
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:20.169
It's like super like biodanger one
of those Animal Planet scenes and

25
00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.366
then just none of it matters [LAUGH].

26
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:27.570
Cool, all right, Hank.

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.550
Is Hank in the room?

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.200
&gt;&gt; Hank: Yeah, mine is pretty simple.

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.970
It's just a mobile menu.

30
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.390
But when you click on the menu button,
it'll open up.

31
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.310
And those hamburger menu lines
will actually morph into text.

32
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.110
And so they'll be some animation between
the menu and then the text as well.

33
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.180
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Awesome.

34
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.456
Yeah, and we're gonna play around
a lot later with those timelines and

35
00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:49.995
manipulating those timelines.

36
00:01:49.995 --> 00:01:51.830
So that'll be a really fun one, too.

37
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.120
Okay, one more.

38
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.190
Jamie?

39
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.920
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Yeah, mine's pretty simple too.

40
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.012
I was thinking about using that Q
attribute that you were talking about and

41
00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:03.858
kind of moving the waves
from side to side on an arc.

42
00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:06.348
And then moving a cloud in and out and

43
00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:10.020
maybe doing something
with the sunshine rays.

44
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.220
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool,
that looks awesome.

45
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.600
I'm so excited for all of these.

46
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.920
All right,
let's get cracking on animation.

47
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.930
We've done our due diligence here, right?
