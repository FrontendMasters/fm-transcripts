00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.200
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, great so we
actually took an SVG and we made it move.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.490
In the time of the break we
got a couple of questions so

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.060
I am gonna address those now.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.860
One of the questions was, whether or

5
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.530
not there was any open source
software that's free to use.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.150
I was using Illustrator before and

7
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.490
I mentioned SketchBook
both of them you pay for.

8
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.830
There is a thing called Inkscape.

9
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.260
Inkscape is free and
it's actually really good, and

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.750
it actually has really
good export settings.

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.060
There's some fancy bells and whistles it
doesn't have as you would expect between

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.530
paid products and
things that are not paid.

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.820
And I think there's less support,
of course,

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.890
than something that you use from Adobe or
something like that.

15
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.610
But if you don't wanna pay for

16
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.060
an SVG editor,
Inkscape is a really good way to go.

17
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.550
Another question that we got was, where
you might get ideas for an animation.

18
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.765
How do you start,
what's even causing that?

19
00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.375
I think that the first and

20
00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:02.275
foremost looking at the world around
you is always really helpful, like it's

21
00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:06.545
watching someone walking to the street or
like a bus move or things like that.

22
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.955
You can start with stuff that you're
actually seeing in real life.

23
00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:14.125
With that dev avocado,
you noticed that I worked off as a GIF.

24
00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.900
That's totally cool too,
I just looked on GIPHY.

25
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.520
For cool little animations that were
done before by somebody else and

26
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.630
I'm like as an exercise copying them or
maybe adding some of my own motion.

27
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.120
Of course, if I do that,
I always credit the thing that I did.

28
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.390
So in the codepen there's
a details section and

29
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.850
in the details section you would
say I got this from Dribble,

30
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.510
I got this from GIPHY and giving
credit to thing that you're copying.

31
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.840
Another thing that I think is really fun,

32
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.970
I don't know if any of you
are on Facebook Messager, but

33
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.010
they have these like really funny stickers
that are moving around and goofy.

34
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.060
Most of them are pretty good,
could fodder for SVG animations.

35
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.020
I mean,
even if you don't use them directly,

36
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050
just looking through some
of the stickers on there.

37
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.840
Most of them look like SVG animations,

38
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.110
like looking at these weird
rabbits showing you their armpits.

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.110
Or I don't know, something like that.

40
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.200
Maybe if you look at enough of those you
can start to get idea for your own stuff.

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.680
Another thing that you can do is look
at Free Pick and iStock Photo and some

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.030
of these sources for an SVG and sometimes
looking at the SVG will give you an idea.

43
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.130
So you might see a potted plant with

44
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.950
instead of vines it has flowers,
it has a house behind it.

45
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.090
That stuff kinda calls to
be in motion sometimes.

46
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.900
There's some critters on there that
you're like, hey, that one should move.

47
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.530
You could totally do that,
you can move stuff around.

48
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.360
So you don't have to start with an
animation or a SVG that you drew either.

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.590
You could actually just
take an existing animation.

50
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.210
Definitely optimize those cuz they're not
usually well optimized for SVG animations.
