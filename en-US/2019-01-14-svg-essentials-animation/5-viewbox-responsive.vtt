&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No more number garbage,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.050
you now know what all of those things are,
cool.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.800
So the viewbox and responsive,
I mentioned before that it's

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.040
a piece of graph paper that gets
shrunk and gets bigger and smaller.

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.580
But let's actually look
at what that looks like.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.720
So if I have this SVG
viewbox at 450 100 and

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.240
the width is 450px,
this is what it looks like.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.520
If I change that to 250px,

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.020
it's the same piece of graph
paper plotting the same points.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.310
It's just a smaller piece of graph paper.

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.910
Cool.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.430
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
if I move something out of the viewbox,

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.480
this is what we'll get.

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.450
That rectangle will all of
a sudden be clipped out.

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.810
And that means that you can actually
clip and mask things on the fly,

16
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.080
if you want to.

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.450
If you wanted to have things not
showing up for a little while and

18
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.890
then make their grand
entrance onto the SVG.

19
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.130
You can do that by pushing it outside and
bringing it back down.

20
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.350
The SVG still knows it's there,
unlike a JPEG,

21
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.000
where those things are literally cropped
out of the frame, they don't exist.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.860
It still exists, but
this is the other thing about that.

23
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.300
If you're working with a designer
who has a messy artboard and

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.680
there's all sorts of stuff [LAUGH]
on the side they might exporting.

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.190
Not necessarily, Illustrator has
gotten really smart about this and

26
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.830
it started cropping things
out better not in the frame.

27
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.300
But if they don't pay attention to
that stuff, you might be shipping

28
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.390
a bunch of that other gunk that
they're keeping off on the side.

29
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.080
So keep that in consideration, too.

30
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.950
So you can do stuff like this.

31
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.400
This is a really simple pen.

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.500
This is not fantastic or anything.

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.070
But it's just taking a bunch of clouds,
moving them off to the side and

34
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.650
then moving them across and
because of the viewbox, they're clipped.

35
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.930
They're not showing up until I've
brought them into the scene.
