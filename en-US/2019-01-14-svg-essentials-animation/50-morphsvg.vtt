00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: MorphSVG,
this is one of my favorite parts.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.420
Actually there was a question
way earlier in the day,

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.450
which was how to morphSVGs, so
now we're actually gonna talk about it.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180
I was like, just a minute!

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.210
Okay, cool, so
I used to live in San Francisco, and

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.300
there's a lot of hipsters
in San Francisco.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.550
So I made this pen about my friends
called Interchangeable Hipsters,

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.580
just like changes the glasses and
the beards randomly.

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
That's all done with morphSVG,
just a silly, goofy fun.

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.810
So remember that, design everything first,
slowly unveil things,

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.430
we talked about way back in the beginning,
in this CSS Tricks pen?

12
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.760
So before, you knew how we did
this in terms of strategy and

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.990
strategery, strategizing.

14
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.260
Now, you can find out how we
actually made this with code.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.830
So when we worked with that CSS Tricks,

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.750
a bunch of things morphed
from one thing to another.

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.880
There's also other little bits,
like this has some DRAW SVG.

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.893
When it went [SOUND].

19
00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:07.940
That was some DRAW SVG little stuff,
but the rest of this is morphSVG.

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.460
So let's talk about morphSVG.

21
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.869
It's really easy to use.

22
00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.034
You go morphSVG shape and actually
I think it still supports this, but

23
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:22.056
I think they've even changed it now so
it just says, morphSVG end,

24
00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:23.623
if I remember correctly.

25
00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:26.224
So you can use both, you can use either.

26
00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:30.740
And you're really pointing
from one ID to the other.

27
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
I believe it does have to be an ID,
it can't be a class.

28
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.620
You're pointing from one thing to the
other, and the way that it works really

29
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.700
under the hood, I'm explaining this
part because otherwise, you'll run into,

30
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.190
if I don't explain how it works
you’ll run into problems.

31
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.760
Is that it’s going and grabbing the point
data the path point data in the DOM and

32
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.470
using that to change
the existing path points.

33
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.450
So that thing that element
that you're starting out with

34
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.150
does not become the other thing.

35
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.450
It looks like it's
becoming the other thing.

36
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.710
It's not really,
it's just using it's path points.

37
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.850
So if you need to target that
first one again, that start again,

38
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.780
after this, it's still that still same ID.

39
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.910
It didn't turn into this ID, got it?

40
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.280
The other part of that is that you
don't want to show this shape, right?

41
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.750
You want to hide that in the DOM, so
that it's in the DOM for it to go grab but

42
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.020
that it's not readily apparent for
people to see.

43
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.960
Otherwise, it will look
like it's still in the DOM.

44
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.920
You don't have to leave the shape
in the DOM if you don't want to.

45
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.020
You could just grab the path points and
dump them into this string if you want.

46
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.930
It's just a little less messy.

47
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.310
I don't know, it's up to you.

48
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.000
It's totally up to you.

49
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.380
Sometimes it's such a small amount
of path points you might as well.

50
00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.030
The big deal here is that you can change
the amount of path points with SVG values.

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.870
But if they're not the same
amount of path points,

52
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.940
it gets really ugly really quickly.

53
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.850
So you could just grab the attribute D and
with JavaScript,

54
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.580
change it to another
attribute D path values.

55
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.830
But the morphs don't look very good.

56
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.580
GreenSock does a lot of
calculation under the hood

57
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.370
to make sure that that morph ends up being
really beautiful and kind of cohesive.

58
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.350
It only works on paths.

59
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.317
But they give you a method
to convert circles, rects,

60
00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.693
ellipse, lines, all of these other shapes.

61
00:03:36.693 --> 00:03:39.701
Two paths in order to
use it if you want to.

62
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:44.329
So if you want to work with a rect and
change it into some other shape, you’d

63
00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.370
have to go morphSVGPlugin.ConvertToPath
change it to a path and

64
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.520
than you could use it for morphSVG.

65
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.658
One thing about that though,
if you do convert it to path,

66
00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:59.117
you can't access it
then by calling circle.

67
00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:02.957
I can't then go, grab the circles out
of the dump because they're no longer

68
00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:05.560
circles, they're now paths.

69
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.650
You can also just grab it by
the ID that it actually is.

70
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.420
I usually do it this way,
because you don't want it

71
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.800
to run all those calculations
unless you really need it, right?

72
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.090
So another thing we can do is use
this thing called shapeIndex.

73
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.030
And shapeIndex is a thing
that they offer you so

74
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.090
that you can finely tune
your morphSVG animations.

75
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.410
It's a plugin that you'll load.

76
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.214
You're gonna load it into the DOM and play
with it and use it and find things out.

77
00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:40.180
But then you're gonna remove it,
you're not gonna ship it to production.

78
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.360
You're just gonna use it
as kind of a utility.

79
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.580
So let me show you what it looks like.

80
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.510
So if we go into CodePen,
I'm gonna comment this out for a second.

81
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.252
I have to run it.

82
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:57.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
that's what that looks like.

83
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.060
I've got a hex and I've got a star, and
I'm pointing from one to the other.

84
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.980
Hex to star, and it's going to animate.

85
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.340
And actually, I can probably do, well,
I won't spend that much time on it.

86
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.272
I was gonna do repeat negative one yo-yo
true, so it's continuously doing it,

87
00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:21.113
but I actually findshapeIndex
does that too.

88
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.645
So I load in findShapeIndex, right?

89
00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:27.210
MorphSVG loaded in,
findShapeIndex loaded in.

90
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.740
And then I say findShapeIndex hex and
star Save, Run, and

91
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.810
this GUI comes up, and
the GUI will start with what it thinks.

92
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.710
It'll try to figure it out for you and

93
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.670
it'll be like what auto
thinks we want is this.

94
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.880
So check out the way that it's morphing
right now, that kind of motion.

95
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.370
That looks pretty good, right?

96
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.890
Well, what happens if we change this?

97
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:59.380
Watch this,
that is a totally different animation.

98
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.600
That's not even in the same
ballpark of the same animation.

99
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.913
And you can kinda play around with it
like, that's not the same animation.

100
00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:12.669
So the way that you play around with this
can totally change the way that you're

101
00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.791
thinking about those shapes, and
the way that they're morphing.

102
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.270
And can be really important if you have
something like a rhino and a hippo.

103
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.540
Maybe one of them looks totally crazy, and

104
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.690
the other one looks like they're
actually changing shape together.

105
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.170
So some of it is about believability.

106
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.870
Some of it is about maybe taste or
something.

107
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.380
So again, this is why I'm so
enthusiastic about GreenSock

108
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.610
is because they don't just make your
life easy by having these plugins.

109
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.860
They always have these extra little
details that are really nice

110
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.230
that make these things
really easy to work with.

111
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.440
I made this CodePen where I live coded
the scene for Smashing Conference.

112
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.448
And this water here was something that I
live coded, so basically this is a bitmap

113
00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:07.230
that's inside of the SVG and I applied
a filter that I'm animating in it.

114
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.500
This is DRAW SVG, that rainbow, right?

115
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.300
That's DRAW SVG, and

116
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.740
then that's view in those coordinates
that we talked about earlier.

117
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.382
And then this arm right
here is not morphSVG.

118
00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:24.894
The arm right here is me playing
with cues, it's just cues.

119
00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.760
How I said I love those curves,
those cues.

120
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.288
So it's a queue from here to here,
a queue from here to here,

121
00:07:31.288 --> 00:07:35.860
a queue from here to here and
then I move a couple of different points.

122
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.740
And the way that I do that and

123
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.970
even the way that I do the filter
is to work with attributes.

124
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.394
So I wrote the attribute for
the arm by hand.

125
00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:52.675
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
I wrote out the arm by hand here, and

126
00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:57.342
then I wrote out the arm by hand here and
changed it from one to the other.

127
00:07:57.342 --> 00:08:00.140
So remember when I said
GreenSock is beautifully dumb.

128
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.400
It's kind of like, do you have numbers?

129
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.880
I can change numbers, give me numbers.

130
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.652
So in this case,

131
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.790
GreenSock can say, I am just changing
one of these numbers from here to here.

132
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.050
So you can grab attributes out of the DOM.

133
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.860
You can go grab a D and
change some numbers around.

134
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.040
It can also change that ripple effect.

135
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.240
Where did I code that?

136
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.380
I think it was up here, yeah, yes.

137
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.860
This whole thing was something
that I added in and coded and

138
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:39.190
then I change the attribute over
not in the view part, in here.

139
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.566
So I change the base frequency of
that turbulence and then it causes

140
00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:50.241
all of the filter and the filter
affects that bitmap image beneath it.

141
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:52.585
Kinda makes this neat, watery,

142
00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:56.360
rippley thing that's kinda
fun to play around with.

143
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.250
So SVG filters can be
super fun to play with.

144
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.573
So if you wanna see that live coding
session, it was like an hour long, so

145
00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:05.600
I'm not gonna do it as
part of the workshop.

146
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.469
We'd be here a long time, but if you want
to see a video of that, it was recorded.

147
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.560
We are going to talk through
this pen a little bit too.

148
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.850
So this was done with morphSVG as well.

149
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.060
I was trying to make a candle and
we talked about elemental,

150
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.080
how to work with elemental motion.

151
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.590
So this is done with
a combination of morphSVG and

152
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.430
changing the filter like we just saw.

153
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.590
So how is this done?

154
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.240
First, I just took some gradients.

155
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.010
I just drew a candle with some gradients.

156
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.610
That's a radial gradient.

157
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.740
This is another kinda gradient and
this is one more gradient.

158
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.950
So it's actually only three paths.

159
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.920
And then I drew a bunch of candles.

160
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.430
And these aren't actually blue and stuff.

161
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.610
I just did that so that you can see
the difference between all of the candles.

162
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.181
Kind of shapes I drew.

163
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.631
I have this one in the middle,

164
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:08.022
it makes it a little bit more stable
right in the middle of the pen.

165
00:10:08.022 --> 00:10:11.211
And then I have these
little bits that go up.

166
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:15.048
If you watch the candle for
a little while, there's these little,

167
00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:19.375
I don't know what they are, they are just
little sparks that kind of fly up.

168
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:26.240
And then there is this background oval
lips that gets bigger and smaller.

169
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.880
So I created a filter and
this filter is not something I thought of.

170
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.690
This is something that I learned
from a guy named Lucas Bever.

171
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.822
He created this filter
that's this GUI filter.

172
00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:44.921
Basically, he makes a contrast filter and
a blur filter work against each other.

173
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:48.690
And I guess they're natural enemies
out in the wild or something.

174
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:54.310
And this pen that he made is like
the most popular pen on co-video.

175
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.203
It's not much, right?

176
00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:57.461
It's just our menu opening and
closing, but

177
00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:01.630
everyone's mind was blown by using this
technique of these two filters together.

178
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.194
I think it's got like a million views or
something like that.

179
00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:10.428
So I learned that technique from him
which is you can take two SVG shapes and

180
00:11:10.428 --> 00:11:15.410
make them kind of malleable and
goo into each other which can be used for

181
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.860
all sorts of stuff.

182
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.161
Remember that smokey thing that we were
talking about earlier, with the balls and

183
00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:25.102
stuff, I could totally use one of those
filters to make that smoke effect.

184
00:11:27.282 --> 00:11:32.203
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I also made a bunch of
those paths that you saw with the kind of

185
00:11:32.203 --> 00:11:35.680
candle, and the first one is f-stable.

186
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.049
I don't know, you can [LAUGH]
call it whatever you want naming.

187
00:11:39.049 --> 00:11:43.812
F1, F2, and so on and so
forth for a bunch of them.

188
00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:47.232
And that's kind of important
because I just used a for

189
00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:52.450
loop to go through them and morphSVG from
one shape to another with that for loop.

190
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.770
But the other thing that the for

191
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.700
loop does is it plots it on
the timeline by using an incrementer.

192
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.841
So every time it finds one,
it goes through.

193
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:05.710
Opacity is mapped out random because
nature's just a little bit random.

194
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.485
It's just kind of if you don't
try too hard to make it perfect,

195
00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:13.491
it won't actually look perfect
cuz that's not how nature works.

196
00:12:13.491 --> 00:12:18.581
But here's that attribute again,
I went and found the standard

197
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:24.342
deviation of the filter and I'm
changing the amount of that goo effect.

198
00:12:24.342 --> 00:12:28.145
Because sometimes when you look a candle,
sometimes they're more stable and

199
00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:31.760
they look more full thing, and
then sometimes they look more gooey.

200
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.802
They kinda go in between,
looking like that depending on the air or

201
00:12:35.802 --> 00:12:37.480
environment around them.

202
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.180
This standard deviation is
not an animatable property.

203
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.130
It's not a property that
you're allowed to animate, but

204
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.650
you're using requestAnimationFrame and
just changing numbers.

205
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.510
You could do that with
the Vanilla Java Script too.

206
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.280
But GreenSock also is just like changing
numbers, I can change numbers, totally.
