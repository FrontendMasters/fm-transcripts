00:00:01.642 --> 00:00:03.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
so how was the last exercise?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.590
Fun?

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.495
Everybody is like, yeah!

4
00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:10.420
[LAUGH] It's gonna get more and
more and more fun from here, so

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.020
we did all the responsible work of
learning optimization and the SVG DOM and

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.990
all of this stuff.

7
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
Now you know GreenSocks syntax and
you're kind of like Superman.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.810
[LAUGH] And so
you can do all sorts of stuff.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.530
Now we're going to go even further and
start to manipulate that timeline.

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.560
All right, so now let's learn about
UI/UX animation versus standalone.

11
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.630
So we're going to talk about
interaction a little bit, but

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.305
also make some distinctions between
what we're going to make if we're making

13
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:44.990
UI/UX animation versus if we're making
a standalone kind of animation.

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.530
So, I can get started.

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.970
I have a repo full of sample icon system.

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.330
And it's done in Vue.js.

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.740
But if you're familiar with reactor,
you're familiar with angular.

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.170
It's not so
dissimilar from those kind of concepts.

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.880
That you won't be able to pick it up.

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.140
So If you're interested
in making SVG icons and

21
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.370
learning how they can be
styled along with text and

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.760
you can make any size icons and
stuff, you can come check this out.

23
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.240
So if I open up the kind
of live demo version,

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.839
here are all of the kind of
regular icons the tldr here

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.460
is that they're styled using
a thing called currentColor, so

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.420
any of the SVG icons in here,
say, fill="currentColor".

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.990
And if you say currentColor
with a camel case like that,

28
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.320
it will take whatever color
the text around it is.

29
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.600
So if you're trying to style icons, make
sure that you use fill current color or

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.210
stroke current color,
depending on what that icon is.

31
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.260
There's also animated icons.

32
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.070
So it shows how you would create an
animated icon for an icon system as well.

33
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.020
And I wrote a cookbook entry
that's in the view cook

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.400
book if you wanna dive in
to some of those things.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.500
That's a few more, that's like maybe
a few more minutes into talking so

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.030
I just point to that reference material
if that's what you're interested in.

37
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.740
So UI/UX animation and
things like icons and things.

38
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.000
There are pieces of the UI that move
together in what we call UX choreography.

39
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.500
So if you have something like this,
it's still an SVG animation.

40
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.180
I'm gonna open it in CodePen
cuz it's a little bit nicer.

41
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.480
So it's still an SVG animation
that's made and when I open it, it

42
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.090
creates all of the icons and it closes and
basically we're able to conserve space but

43
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.000
they're all moving together in a way
that kinda works for that site.

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.830
So it would be kinda branded
along with that site, and

45
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.020
that movement would kinda
complement that site.

46
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.450
We talked a little bit about
that yesterday in the Design for

47
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.280
Developers course, so, if you wanna know
more about like branding, and color,

48
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.930
and those kind of things,
you can check out that course as well.

49
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.440
Now when we look at
that pen in particular,

50
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.310
you can already start to
guess how it was made right?

51
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.470
You probably know that
I'm clicking something.

52
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.200
I'm starting up a timeline.

53
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.790
Everything happens and then when I click
it again the timeline is reversed right?

54
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.580
I'm not writing all of those things again.

55
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.559
I'm taking the same thing and
I'm [SOUND] turning it on its head.

56
00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.210
So, we're gonna learn how to do that.

57
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.580
So one thing that UI/UX Animation
is really good at

58
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.650
is helping with context switching.

59
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.680
So rather than something just popping
up in your face, something enters into

60
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.300
the screen and having transitions between
two different states is really good for

61
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.180
a human brain because usually things
don't just pop out of nowhere.

62
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.420
Usually that's a pretty bad sign if
I just appeared in front of you.

63
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.970
That's something out of a horror movie or
something right.

64
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.240
You don't want that, our brains
don't work with booleans like that.

65
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.630
That's something a computer understands
and humans don't really see in real life.

66
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.420
So if you can have things transition or
kind of enter into a space.

67
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.100
Then humans are like, I got it.

68
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.710
You came from over there.

69
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.220
There's not really an over there, right.

70
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.000
It's digital.

71
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.170
And things are just absolutely
positioned and things like that.

72
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.620
But the concepts of over there and

73
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.870
spatial maps help us feel like it's
a more native environment for our brains.

74
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.770
A standalone animation is one
that just lives by itself.

75
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.680
It's not working with something else.

76
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.170
So there are different considerations for

77
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.036
a standalone animation
than a UI/UX animation.

78
00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:46.840
In a UI/UX animation,
the goal is not to be,

79
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.460
whoa, I'm animated, everybody look at me.

80
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.890
It's kind of to be more invisible.

81
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.350
If you think about Stripe's checkout flow,

82
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.150
you're not going through the checkout
flow going, it's so animated!

83
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.640
What you're thinking is, things
are being revealed to me as I need them,

84
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.060
it's not to be overwhelming.

85
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.870
Whereas a stand-alone animation,
that's the whole thing.

86
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.280
Your whole attention.

87
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.140
That's like the zooming around
Hogwarts on the broom, kind of site.

88
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.180
Where, really,

89
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.520
the only job of that website is to get you
excited about Hogwarts and Harry Potter.

90
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520
It's not to get you to a contact form.

91
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.560
It's not to, you're not trying
to do something other than

92
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000
be part of that animation.

93
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.990
So there's different ways
of thinking about each.

94
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.430
If you're working with
a data visualization,

95
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.120
that's like a standalone animation.

96
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.380
The whole purpose is to get
people to understand that data or

97
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.480
understand how it transitions when
different things in time occur.

98
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.790
So that is a standalone kind of idea,

99
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.076
whereas a UI/UX animation
is a little more subtle.

100
00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:56.487
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So if we have
something like this contact form,

101
00:05:56.487 --> 00:06:01.440
we can write, that's embarrassing,
it's like, already like, I know you.

102
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.730
[LAUGH] So I can write my name.

103
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.510
I can write my email, and
then I say contact us today.

104
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.280
And while I'm communicating
with the server and

105
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.680
other things are going on,
I have something entertaining me,

106
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.970
something is going on to keep me occupied
and that actually took a little while.

107
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.640
If I had had nothing happened,
if I hit that summit button and

108
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.525
am just sitting there am not sure,

109
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.685
first of all if it worked, like if it's
actually communicating with the server.

110
00:06:28.685 --> 00:06:32.075
I'm not sure if,
I just gave it my information,

111
00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:34.415
I don't know where that information
went it's kind of weird and

112
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:38.195
scary to give your information
randomly to a website.

113
00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:43.370
So if you have something that goes on
in the background that occupies people.

114
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.900
And that's a really good thing for them.

115
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.580
They're like, okay,
first of all, I know you got it.

116
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.000
Second of all,
I know you're working on it.

117
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.400
And third of all,
I know you care [LAUGH] and

118
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.670
you're not just gonna take all my
information and do bad things with it.

119
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.550
So it's nice to kind of give people
that dopamine rush at the end and

120
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.400
let them know, okay, we got your stuff.

121
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.600
Everything's good.

122
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.080
Wait for a second, okay?

123
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.200
That's what would happen in real life.

124
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.175
If you handed me your business
card I wouldn't just stand there.

125
00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:17.000
[LAUGH] I know it sounds crazy,

126
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.530
but humans actually think of computers
as having the same kind of conversation.

127
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.020
The reason why Clippy was so

128
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.330
ineffective, because if Clippy was
a person it would be really rude.

129
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.870
Like you're a writing letter and
someones is like, hello.

130
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.840
[LAUGH] That's not a good person.

131
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.770
They did this studies where
they had Clippy talk to you and

132
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.275
be a little bit more, be like make
fun of himself and be like, man,

133
00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:45.580
you should just write a letter to
Microsoft and tell them how annoying I am.

134
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.500
And people started reporting
that they loved Clippy because

135
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.270
Clippy was a person who was likeable.

136
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.430
So when you're dealing with these human,

137
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.150
computer interfaces you can actually
start to think of them as a conversation.

138
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.250
If I handed you my business card I would
expect that you'd say, hold on a second.

139
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.510
Lemme find a place in my wallet for this.

140
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.150
And then I would get it out and
then I would put it away.

141
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.060
Okay, I've got it, thanks,
I'll talk to you later.

142
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.200
I wouldn't just like stand there and
hold it, or drop it on the floor and

143
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.990
look at it or whatever.

144
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.020
That's the same kind of concept
