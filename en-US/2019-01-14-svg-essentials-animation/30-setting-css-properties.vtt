&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: We can also
set different CSS properties so

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.520
we can also set transform perspective,
perspective in transform style.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.470
So I'm setting those properties on
the elements before I'm animating them.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.250
So I could also do that in CSS,
I could go grab all of those elements and

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.890
write it in CSS.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.430
Or I can have it right
before my animation codes.

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.580
So if I need to set transformOrigin for
a bunch of units.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.713
If I need to have
the transformStyle the preserve-3D.

9
00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:34.170
Because transformStyle preserve-3D isn't
something that we're animating really.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.600
It's something that has to be on the unit
itself before we start animating.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.510
Now people ask me why I do this
instead of writing it in my CSS?

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.640
I do that for
a couple of different reasons.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.510
One of them is, if I'm working on a big
system with a bunch of other engineers and

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.660
the CSS and JavaScript aren't
right next to each other, well,

15
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.150
people like to delete code.

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.120
They like to delete code a lot, so
if they see a bunch of things like this,

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.260
it doesn't actually affect the appearance
of that element until it's moving.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.810
So they'll remove,
they'll be like, what's this?

19
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.220
They remove it, looks the same.

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.080
And they'll be like,

21
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.270
great, I can delete that code,
that's definitely happened before.

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.810
So if it's next to each other, it's
near each other in the animation code,

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.520
it's a little more
implicit that I'm saying,

24
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.720
I'm about to use this here,
don't remove that.

25
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.260
The other thing is is that sometimes I
wanna change these things as I'm working.

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.030
Transform perspective and
perspective actually change how

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.750
that element is transforming in space,
the perspective of that thing.

28
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.370
So I might wanna change it
from 200 to 400 or something.

29
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.730
Then it's very easy for
me to do that all in one place.
