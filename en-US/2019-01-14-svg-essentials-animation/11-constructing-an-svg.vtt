00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so
let's go into Illustrator for a second.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.300
So I made this,
[LAUGH] dumb dev avocado thing.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.408
So I wanted to animate this,
there's a GIF that looks like this.

4
00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:18.050
And it's just this little avocado
smiling and rolling around.

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.570
And I was like, well, maybe I should
just make that thing cuz it's so cute.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.830
And so I traced it in Illustrator and

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.050
here are the faces, and
here's the other layer.

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.790
So basically the layer is like
the avocado background, and

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.910
here are all the faces along with it.

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.820
But you can see how each one is a layer,
here we've got Path, Eclipse,

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.240
Ellipse, and they're all in this thing
called sm-face, which is a group, right?

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.110
And then this is another group, yeah.

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.410
Cool, so if I go to File &gt; Save As,
that's when I get the really bulky output.

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.170
So we don't wanna do File &gt;Save As,
we wanna do Export.

15
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.120
And this Export is really good because
Dimitri Baronovski who works on

16
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.340
Snap who made Snap SVG
works on this Export.

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.800
So Illustrators Export is really,
really excellent.

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.330
Sketch unfortunately,
has really bad export.

19
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.520
And what you will find if you export from
sketch a lot of the times not very time,

20
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.800
but almost most times is a million
nested groups that you don't need.

21
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.000
But at sometimes you do need groups, so
its's tempting to remove all the groups.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.290
But then sometimes you'll need some of
them, so you'd have to add them back in.

23
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.690
The other thing it does is it makes
a lot of clip parts, where you

24
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.730
don't need clip parts, or creates
used tags where you don't need them.

25
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.950
So you end up using different, you've got
like nested view boxes, that's not great.

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.370
That sounds tricky, right?

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.492
It's tricky and it's not good, and so

28
00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:58.174
then people who export from Sketch
sometimes are like, I hate SVG.

29
00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:01.860
And I'm like, no, you hate Sketch.

30
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.200
I've written them unsolicited emails
asking if I could help with their

31
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.350
Export tool, and they haven't responded.

32
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.070
If you're watching,
let me help you, [LAUGH].

33
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.728
So if you go to Export &gt; Export As, and

34
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:18.559
you can go all of these different options,
but of course we want SVG.

35
00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.128
And I'm gonna go into, let's do Recent and

36
00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:27.830
Export and
then this SVG option will come up.

37
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.673
The styling is kind of interesting,
so you've got internal CSS.

38
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:36.050
Basically that means that,
SVG is actually a document.

39
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.420
So it has this style tag, and then it
puts all the styles inside the style tag.

40
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.190
That can be nice if you wanna
put it all in that one place and

41
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.250
then move it into like a CSS file or
something like that, that's cool.

42
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.590
In line style can be great if
you're working with like React and

43
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.340
you wanna do some especially like
React motion or something like that,

44
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.180
React spring, those in line styles can
be helpful when you're using that.

45
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.380
And presentation attributes,

46
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.520
I usually use presentation attributes,
it kind of depends on what I'm doing.

47
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.020
Sometimes with the internal CSS,
if I have a lot of repeated color,

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.010
the internal CSS will be smaller cuz it'll
apply a class and grab them all at once.

49
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.490
Instead of saying it redundantly across
all of those presentation attributes.

50
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.279
So the presentation attributes will
put them directly on the elements,

51
00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.529
whereas the CSS will apply a class and
put it inside CSS instead.

52
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.590
So that's what those do.

53
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.150
We've got object id's, our layer names,
you probably want this most of the time.

54
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.980
So that means that all of the groups and

55
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.730
all of the paths will have the ids match
whatever names I named it here, right?

56
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.220
You could say Minimal or Unique.

57
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.090
Minimal will make everything like A,
B, C, hard to work with.

58
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.660
I don't really suggest it,
[LAUGH] decimal is important, too.

59
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.930
It's basically an optimization thing,
right?

60
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.040
If you have less decimals, it's gonna

61
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.250
kind of figure out where it is on
that Canvas with less precision.

62
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.730
So if I say zero and

63
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.690
it's a really small canvas,
it's gonna move those things around.

64
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.510
So if you ever optimize and
you're decimal is zero and

65
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.830
things are all over the place,
go back in and

66
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.450
change the decimal to something like two,
it will probably look better.

67
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.510
That's probably what's going on.

68
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.310
And what is neat is you can
kinda show code here, and

69
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.260
see what you got going on,
and see if you like it.

70
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.350
So, you can see here, I've got, my path is

71
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.390
ID ARM L we named it that before.

72
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.030
So, if I went back and I said, Object IDs,
layer names minimal, and then I show code

73
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.140
instead it has no path ID on there.

74
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.120
So that's not as helpful because
I can't go grab it, right?

75
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.150
And cool, so
the difference between minify and

76
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.110
responsive, responsive just removes
width and height off of it, that's it.

77
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.710
That's all it does.

78
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.930
So minify just kind of makes it all

79
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.250
smashed together into one big glob,
that's all that does too.

80
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.860
It's just like un-prettified.

81
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.290
So if you're gonna animate, you don't
want this part to be like this and

82
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.070
if you're not gonna
animate then that's fine.

83
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.910
So I can say okay,
now lets go into SVGOMG.

84
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.620
So we can open an SVG we’re gonna go
into Recent, there’s our dev avocado.

85
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.010
And its already pretty small
cuz I drew it by hand,

86
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.180
a lot of time like you
can use this demo one.

87
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.780
And you can see how much savings you get.

88
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.620
If you're using something from
iStock Photo, Shutterstock,

89
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.100
Freepik, one of those kind of things,
sometimes the savings are incredible.

90
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.740
You're like, whoa, if you drew it by hand,

91
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.830
it's probably gonna be
pretty small though.

92
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.690
So here's the markup.

93
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.230
You can see all the div, and
it's kind of prettified, and

94
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.818
if I untoggle that then it does
that same thing as midify, right?

95
00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:20.121
It's prettifying.

96
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:25.270
Here are a bunch of different
settings to toggle.

97
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.660
For these settings to toggle,

98
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.700
I have a post called high
performance SVGs on CSS-Tricks.

99
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.590
I give you some recommendations on there,

100
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.990
I'm gonna go through just
a couple of them right here.

101
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.840
So clean IDs is the same
thing as you saw earlier.

102
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.790
If I clean IDs, you can see that the names
of those layers, see GID layer1,

103
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.300
that is removed, so you probably don't
want that if you've named layers yet.

104
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.900
Another thing is round/rewrite numbers,
sometimes you have like

105
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.550
multiple things that are different,
lets say there's two different circles.

106
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.480
And it has round/rewrite
numbers it will round and

107
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.660
rewrite them to be in one path instead and
then if you need to move those circles

108
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.800
independently you can't do it anymore
cuz they've just one big path then.

109
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.600
So if you find something
like that happening,

110
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.500
where you're like, wait,
why's it just one big globe?

111
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.220
That's probably the one
that you need to undo.

112
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.460
There's all sorts of things, like remove
view box, probably don't wanna do that.

113
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.950
Collapse useless groups, I mean,
you can kinda see if that changes.

114
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:34.060
Round and rewrite paths is another one,
where if you do that,

115
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.000
things might glam together.

116
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.210
So that's another thing to check out.

117
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.980
So you can kind of check out all
of these different things and

118
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.150
toggle and kind of play with the markup
and see what you're getting between that.

119
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.610
And make sure that the image isn't
affected by what you're doing.

120
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.170
So you can kind of play with all of these
things, and then if you like do something.

121
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.680
I think there's one of these that
will completely destroy this image,

122
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.190
I've done it before, [LAUGH] and
then it will just kind of break apart.

123
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.700
Also, if you have those drop shadows
that have PNG inside of them,

124
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.050
removing raster images will break
that as well, so that's another one.
