00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.447
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Another thing is that
this is an article I wrote where it has

2
00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:05.861
more information.

3
00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:09.399
This is the thing I meant
to click which is this pen.

4
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:15.237
So if I have this contact form that's
in this kind of map marker thing.

5
00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:19.006
And I have a bunch of information
about the contact and

6
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.458
then I click contact and
the contact moves over.

7
00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:28.432
And then we have the email and submit,
I type here, I click submit and

8
00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:33.795
those become the loaders,
which in turn become the success.

9
00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:39.735
And the only time you saw a bounce in that
entire animation was that green part,

10
00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:43.967
was that this is different,
something good happened.

11
00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.774
And again when we talk about
that spatial information,

12
00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:52.472
if I said to you where is the contact
form, you'd say it's in there.

13
00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:56.335
But there is no in there, they're just
form elements and absolute positioning and

14
00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:57.561
stuff like that, right?

15
00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:02.025
It's just all tricks and stuff,
it's all just on the page or whatever.

16
00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:07.209
But the idea that the people know where
something is and where to go get it and

17
00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:11.340
to know how to work with that
flow is a really important one.

18
00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:16.866
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Another thing
that's really important for

19
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.240
context shifting is
this idea of isolation.

20
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600
If I look at these three panels and
I try to read them all at once,

21
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680
it's kind of hard to do.

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.195
But if I isolate one of them, all of
a sudden I can read it a lot better and

23
00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:29.876
I can understand it a lot better.

24
00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.037
So we're always scanning
the environment around us.

25
00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:36.821
If we have to scan too much, it's very
confusing for us, and if we can isolate

26
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.510
that just a little bit then people can
pay a little bit more attention to it.
