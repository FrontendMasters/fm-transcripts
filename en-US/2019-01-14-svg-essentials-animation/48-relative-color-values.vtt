00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: How would we turn
a many element scene from day to night?

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.159
How would you, you, turn a many
element scene from day to night?

3
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I might just layer
opaque blue on top of my scene and

4
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:25.362
then maybe add a filter
to that to multiply it or

5
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.540
something and mess with that.

6
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.580
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Cool,
that's a really, really great answer.

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.552
So you could make a giant panel
that's overlaid on top and

8
00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:39.617
maybe you change the opacity slowly,
maybe you change a filter slowly.

9
00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:41.970
Totally great way of doing it.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.690
And that is actually a way
that most people do do that.

11
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.474
But we can also play with this
idea of HSL relative color

12
00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:56.366
which GreenSock has inside
of the TweenMax one as well.

13
00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.622
And HSL in the design for developers
course yesterday, I talked about how

14
00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:04.612
that's my favorite color value
because it's very human readable.

15
00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:06.225
It's very human legible.

16
00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:11.023
And what it allows us to do is take
the colors from where they're at and

17
00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:15.932
say I want to increment it a little
bit from there or change it a little.

18
00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:22.319
So you don't have to actually change every
individual color like you normally would.

19
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.480
Or even if you wanna do the overlay,
that's totally great.

20
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
But if you need to interact with anything,

21
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.180
then you run into that z-indexing issue of
like you can't access any of those things.

22
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.320
If you wanted to change all of those
elements just slightly based on where they

23
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.380
are, HSL relative color is
a great way to do it too.

24
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.438
So you're not wrong at all, but
this is another way of doing that.

25
00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:51.089
So hue, saturation, and lightness.

26
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:54.844
Hue is a 360 degree thing.

27
00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:55.872
It goes around and around.

28
00:01:55.872 --> 00:01:59.398
This is part of why it's one
of my favorite color values,

29
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:03.240
because it never fails if you
wanna make generative color.

30
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.180
1% is the same thing as 361, and

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.140
you can keep going around unlike other
color values that would eventually fail.

32
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.947
Saturation goes 0% to 100%.

33
00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:17.662
Lightness goes 0% to 100%.

34
00:02:17.662 --> 00:02:19.511
So I made these turtles.

35
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:22.912
They kind of show you each one.

36
00:02:22.912 --> 00:02:26.134
So I keep poking them
cuz I like poking them.

37
00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:27.320
Is that weird?

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.990
I think they're cute.

39
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.190
Look at the little tail.

40
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.348
Is it weird to make stuff and
like it like the things you like?

41
00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:35.236
Hi, turtles?

42
00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:39.772
Okay, so eventually saturation, I'll stop,
or eventually the saturation gets to

43
00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:44.318
a certain point of highness, and it can't
go any further, and same with lightness.

44
00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:47.214
But that hue, I can keep going.

45
00:02:47.214 --> 00:02:49.906
And I will cuz it's cute.

46
00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:55.744
[LAUGH] And you can kinda play with it and
see how you would move each one of them.

47
00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:59.822
So in this incrementing,
this is how it looks.

48
00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:03.622
You might have used HSL before,
so it's the same kind of format.

49
00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:08.002
HSL in parens, and then kind of

50
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:13.061
comma-separated values for HSL.

51
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.842
And we're changing the percentage.

52
00:03:15.842 --> 00:03:19.861
So we have that incrementer that you
saw earlier changing the percentage for

53
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:20.435
each one.

54
00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:26.739
Now here, I'm storing the value and
then I'm using it twice.

55
00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.746
Why would I do that?

56
00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:29.600
Does anybody know?

57
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.091
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well in this case, it looks
like you need to make sure that the fill

58
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:41.950
and the background color, so the fill for
your target object and the background

59
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.483
color from the body move kinda together,
but with different properties.

60
00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:48.821
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's exactly right.

61
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.639
So if I need to change all of the elements
in a scene together, and maybe I'm not

62
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.165
sure how much I'm gonna adjust it by,
I wanna store that as a variable, so

63
00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:01.650
I can change it in one place and
have it affect both.

64
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.667
Because for body,
I'm gonna change background color.

65
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:09.290
And for all of the elements, the SVG
elements, I'm gonna use fill, perfect.

66
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.631
So here's another CodePen thing.

67
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.234
And actually, that's one of those
examples of I didn't do that, and so

68
00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:21.150
it looks bad when I first.

69
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.310
Well, now it's gonna be fine.

70
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.572
But did you see the flash
of all of the elements?

71
00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:27.730
I didn't do that before.

72
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.624
You saw how to do that with
the visibility hidden.

73
00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:33.770
So I can make this come on to
the scene a few different ways.

74
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.960
I can click this, that kind of
lever thing, or I can use this guy.

75
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.787
That's another draggable to
kinda bring it on to the scene.

76
00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:49.473
And I can change the colors
of the scene and

77
00:04:49.473 --> 00:04:52.992
maybe make them work off of each other.

78
00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:57.390
So they're kind of, you can do
them in different variations and

79
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.600
kind of play with the color values.

80
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.720
And then I can, just for

81
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.410
fun, change the perspective of these
buildings and things like that.

82
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.805
So all sorts of little levers and gears
that we can play with to manipulate stuff.

83
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:16.482
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And I made this CodePen,
this is another one with Vue.

84
00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.828
So this is actually local time, and

85
00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:25.303
then I can choose other things
that are nearby or far away.

86
00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:29.931
And you can see how it will go later.

87
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:34.023
And then the scene kind of adjusts and

88
00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:40.765
changes to a night sky and
then we'll go back to Los Angeles.

89
00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:45.305
So basically I take the scene and
I have this lever.

90
00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:48.081
And rather than using Moment,

91
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:53.639
I'm using a native [COUGH] thing
called toLocaleTimeString.

92
00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.623
So you can get rid of Moment
if you're using that.

93
00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:58.457
It will actually respect daylight savings.

94
00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:01.650
And that native thing is
now very well-supported.

95
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.354
So I'm using this dial, and

96
00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:07.880
I've created a whole animation that
makes it go all the way around.

97
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.820
And it makes it go from day to night.

98
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.116
And then I find I'm using Watchers and
Vue to listen to the change events here

99
00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:20.677
basically and then figure out what's
the difference between those two times.

100
00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:25.915
And then I use the progress to kinda
go back and forth on that timeline.
