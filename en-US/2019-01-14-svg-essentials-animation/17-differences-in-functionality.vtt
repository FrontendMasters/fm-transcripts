00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
what happens when we apply it to an SVG?

2
00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:06.076
So what happened?

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.028
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's applying it
to the div and not the SVG, so?

4
00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:12.669
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No,
it's actually applying it to the SVG.

5
00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.802
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's applying it to the SVG

6
00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.010
as opposed to the circle.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.810
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's right,
that's right.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.240
So it is applying it to
the SVG instead of the circle.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.630
And the SVG is an HTML element.

10
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.480
Everything inside of an SVG, circle, recs,

11
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.780
things like that are not,
are within the SVG dump.

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.830
But the SVG element itself is an HTML
element, so it has a background.

13
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.080
So we can actually use background,
not that we want to, right?

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.130
And it's still moving across, right?

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.431
That's great Hank, thanks.

16
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:47.550
So why?

17
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.860
We're moving the whole SVG instead
of the circle, not really a problem.

18
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.540
Background doesn't work for SVG,
we use fill, right, instead of background.

19
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.400
So in HTML land we're using background and
borders,

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.030
in SVG land we're using fills and
strokes instead.

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.550
They work pretty similarly.

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.080
So what do we wanna do?

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.490
We wanna apply the fill to the circle,
not just the SVG, right?

24
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.819
So we're gonna apply that animation,
we're gonna put a class on the circle and

25
00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.120
animate that instead.

26
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.380
Does that sound good?

27
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.880
Okay, so let's try that.

28
00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:32.160
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No.
[LAUGH] What's happening now?

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's going
outside of the viewBox.

30
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: That's right,
remember we talked about the viewBox,

31
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.280
like canvas that's infinite
in every direction,

32
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.390
but we're actually looking
at it through a window.

33
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.090
Well it's sliding outside of the viewBox.

34
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm bringing this up because this is
always the first thing that happens when

35
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.180
you first start animating in SVG.

36
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.079
The first time I worked with
an SVG I was like what is happening.

37
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.063
So when a designer gives you an SVG or
you're working with an SVG,

38
00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:58.610
what you're going to find you need to
end up doing is expanding that viewBox.

39
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.300
And so usually, because you are gonna move
things around, typically if you don't

40
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.720
expand it a little bit, when you start
moving it, its gonna get cut off somehow.

41
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.960
So you could do that within your
graphics program totally fine.

42
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.585
But you also know about viewBoxes now,
so if somebody gives you that,

43
00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:20.395
you don't necessarily have to go
back to the literal drawing board.

44
00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:24.135
You can expand the viewBox by doing
some negative values for X and Y.

45
00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:28.931
You can always start at zero zero, so
you could do negative 20, negative 20 and

46
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:32.493
then expand the viewBox in
this direction by 20, 20, but

47
00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.910
also compensating for this 40, 40.

48
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.610
So we can just expand that viewBox.

49
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.910
In this case,
we are moving it over, right?

50
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.510
We are making it longer.

51
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.110
So we just need to change the viewBox.

52
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.930
How would I change the viewBox?

53
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.175
What would I update to give it room?

54
00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:54.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Remove the width and height.

55
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.680
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: No,
we wouldn't remove the width and height.

56
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.108
I mean, you could actually
remove the width and height.

57
00:03:00.108 --> 00:03:04.160
We're gonna actually have to expand
the width, as well, so you're not wrong.

58
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.224
So removing the width and
height isn't a bad idea, but

59
00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:11.040
we would probably just make it
a little bit bigger, right?

60
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.820
But what would we change in the viewBox,
which thing?

61
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The third number.

62
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.470
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The third number.

63
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: At the X coordinate,
or the X, yeah, coordinate.

64
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.510
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Well
not the X coordinate.

65
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.760
This is the X coordinate.

66
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or the X width, I guess.

67
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.190
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: The X width,
that's exactly right.

68
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.186
We would change the third number,
absolutely right, 0, 0,

69
00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.970
and then make this like 300 or
something, and then 70.

70
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.030
So we'll target the circle,

71
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.180
expand the viewBox,
use fill instead of background right?

72
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.060
Because before we were
using background and

73
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.120
now we need to change that to
fill inside of our key frames.

74
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.630
And remove fill from the markup.

75
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.561
So now we target the circle,
expand the viewBox, use fill,

76
00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:57.945
remove fill from the markup and
we have our beautiful animation.

77
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:00.312
My god it's just a circle.

78
00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:01.317
[LAUGH] All right,

79
00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:05.080
well we did just a whole bunch of
things just to move circle around.

80
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.750
And you might be thinking,
I can already move divs.

81
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.390
Why should I learn all
of this new stuff and

82
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.190
change all these view boxes and
do all this stuff?
