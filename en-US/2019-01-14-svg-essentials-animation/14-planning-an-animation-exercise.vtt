&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
it's exercise time.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.150
Get an SVG from the repo, or
Freepik, or The Noun Project, or

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.010
Shutterstock, or anywhere on the web that
you wanna find an SVG, or make an SVG, or

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.060
you can write it in code,
all of these things are options to you.

5
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.690
So, think of an animation
that you'd like to make.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.860
And create three thumbnails to show
the animation just for yourself.

7
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.140
And then eventually, when you're done with
the three thumbnails, pick one of them and

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.130
make a storyboard out of it.

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.800
And put the SVG in order and
optimize it, so that you can animate it.

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.460
We're not gonna animate it yet.

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.760
We're gonna do that in the next section,
but

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.670
I want you to get used to the idea
of working with the SVG, and

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.750
optimizing the SVG, and preparing
yourself for animation with like, a plan.

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.113
So the plan is the thumbnails and
the storyboard.
