00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: I'm gonna teach you
a little bit about how to work with

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.000
GreenSock with this Monster, because
I don't like live coding very much.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.500
So this simple TweenMax to eye,
so he blinks his eye.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.090
He's gonna teach you how to blink his eye.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.560
And if you have Two Tweens, and a eye, and

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.370
antenna, they both
happen at the same time.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.690
Now let's say, I have a time line and
I apply I changed TweenMax to tl,

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.410
they go one after each other,
they follow each other in time.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040
Then I'm gonna wrap it in a function and
call that function, and

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.710
it's the same thing they're functionally
equivalent it's a little bit more code.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.450
But the point is, I can add another
function where he flaps his wings, and

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
add it to the timeline
in any order I want.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.660
And I have him blinking his antenna,
and he's flapping.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.510
So then he's gonna say goodbye to you,
bye!

15
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.850
Okay, that's our little Monster.

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.770
I am also gonna live code for
you, because I like you.
