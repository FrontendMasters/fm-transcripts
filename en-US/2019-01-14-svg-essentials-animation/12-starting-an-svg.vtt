&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So when you're starting
to think about building out an SVG

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.200
animation, sometimes it can
be hard to think about.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.470
You have an SVG, now what?

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.587
So let's break down how I
kind of think about it,

5
00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:13.180
because I don't know any other way.

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.010
But you can do it however suits you.

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.670
I'm gonna have you do
a little exercise about this.

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.021
So I mentioned I work for CSS-Tricks, and

9
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.566
a while ago we had this
logo Easter egg thing.

10
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:30.125
So if you went on to the toggle, if you
toggled it, it did all of these goofy,

11
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:31.070
silly things.

12
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.410
And then it changed to CSS-Tricks and
then it goes back.

13
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.980
And it has all these nerdy
stuff like link and a fork.

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.190
And this is our logo is the query selector
all-star, so it turns into the K.

15
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.450
And then it turns into a star for
a planet.

16
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.520
And, yeah, nerd, nerd, nerd stuff.

17
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.740
So the way that I do this is I
get everything on the page first.

18
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.700
I get everything inside the SVG,
and it all is stored in one SVG.

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.905
And then whatever is not there initially,
I hide.

20
00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:09.370
I just say opacity zero for
everything that I'm not using yet.

21
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.720
And that way I'm spending all of my
time bringing one thing on to a page and

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.550
figuring out how that transition works.

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.790
So I'm saying like, okay, this star is
gonna be, this K is gonna become the star.

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.398
But I'm gonna remove the star at first and
decide how I want that drawn in and

25
00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:30.120
how I want it to come on and
things like that.

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.220
So then I can kinda compartmentalize
what's gonna happen one at a time.

27
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.884
And you might notice that the way that it
transitioned from one to the other was

28
00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:41.100
the same thing each way, right?

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.290
That's because I'm using GreenSock
which we're gonna play with later.

30
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.770
I make a timeline, so

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.740
the whole thing is just like a series
of events that I've ordered in time.

32
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
And then the great thing about GreenSock's
timeline is I can re-trigger it and

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.810
even reverse it.

34
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.839
So I'm just using the same timeline,
and I back it up and

35
00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:59.460
then the same thing happens.

36
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.060
So I can reuse that kind of concept
to make it go backwards and forwards.

37
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.103
But the big thing I want you to understand
here is when you're starting to play with

38
00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:11.327
animation, think about the first
thing you wanna have happen and

39
00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:13.220
the last thing you wanna have happen.

40
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.225
Have them both in the canvas
at the same time and

41
00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:20.620
slowly reveal things as you need them.

42
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.740
So design everything first,
slowly unveil things.

43
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.420
This is how I planned this animation.

44
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.310
It's horrible,
this is like chicken scratches.

45
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.990
I drew things out, and I decided
things sucked, and I destroyed ideas.

46
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.400
But I could do it all within 15 seconds or
something and

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.420
decide I didn't like an idea because
it cost me nothing to do this.

48
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.944
It would have taken me three hours to
implement something, decide it sucks,

49
00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:50.720
and go back.

50
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.680
Instead, I'm playing around with those
ideas and kind of understanding things.

51
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.310
I don't know what the bee is about.

52
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.955
Don't worry about the bee.

53
00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.605
[LAUGH] That's just me being weird.

54
00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:06.250
[LAUGH] Ugly storyboards
save you a ton of time.

55
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.746
I don't even remember what this is for.

56
00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:12.340
It's so bad that I can't even
remember what animation this was.

57
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.243
But I guarantee you that drawing
these kind of chicken scratchy ideas

58
00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:21.990
allowed me to kinda understand what
I wanted to have in the middle.

59
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.530
I knew what I wanted to
have in the beginning.

60
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.500
I knew what I wanted to have in the end.

61
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.364
But I didn't know how I wanted to carry
those ideas out until I kind of made these

62
00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:32.980
sketches which are just notes to myself.

63
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.030
And the lower fidelity they are,
the more you can dispose them, right?

64
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.600
They cost you nothing.

65
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.920
If you spend 15 seconds on something,
then you can go, well,

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.550
that's not a good idea and
then move on to the next one.

67
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.716
Or draw three of them and
then decide, okay,

68
00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:48.965
the one in the middle is really
the thing that I should be working on.
