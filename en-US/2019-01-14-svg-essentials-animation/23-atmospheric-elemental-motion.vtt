00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right, let's
talk about some theory and principle.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.130
You might be like, I'm so
tired of theory and principle.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.890
Don't worry, towards the end of the day,
you're going to be like, too much code,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.580
go back to the theory and principle.

5
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.165
So we just got to get some of the
foundations and basics in before we send

6
00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:18.300
you on your way learning some of
the other more finite details.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.259
So atmospheric and elemental motion,

8
00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.379
sometimes the character of
the animation is the whole atmosphere.

9
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.619
And this, actually you should probably go
look at it in your own browsers because it

10
00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.930
looks a little bit better there.

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.960
But some of the dust and speckles and
things like that are pieces of

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.240
the animation that are as important
as the big globs and stuff.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.380
They kind of set the tone for
how that whole space is.

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.220
And it takes your animation from being
something that's like a big flat piece of

15
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.380
something moving to something you really
feel like you're in the space of.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.140
So for elemental motion,
further away has less contrast and

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.030
is blurrier, so by just making a couple
effects of making it a little less

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.380
contrast in color and making it a little
blurrier it's a little more believable.

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.020
You should ask questions,
like does the air or

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.670
environment around it affect
the movement of the thing?

21
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.560
Like do you have things like
leaves blowing because it's windy?

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.350
You can show that wind is happening by
having things affected by that wind.

23
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.910
And reducing precision allows for
understanding.

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.070
This might sound weird, but
I'm gonna show you what I mean by this.

25
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.582
And we can combine some techniques.

26
00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:41.229
So if I'm asked to make this smoke,
you might be like, what?

27
00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.660
[LAUGH] How am I going to make this smoke,
how does that happen?

28
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.450
How does someone animate smoke like that?

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.410
Well if I reduce
the precision of the smoke

30
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
I can start to notice
some patterns emerging.

31
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.318
I can start to see that, well,

32
00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.880
actually the smoke is made up
of these little ball shapes.

33
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.390
And actually,
if I watch those little ball shapes and

34
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.932
kind of reduce the detail of them,
I can see that what's happening is that

35
00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:16.790
as they're coming down, they move
to the edge of where that smoke is.

36
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.170
And then they hit some sort of
air circulation and they go back.

37
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.620
And then they kind of circle back down
until they get bigger and bigger.

38
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.890
Now that's something I can animate, right?

39
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.320
I can actually take circles and
make them have that motion pattern and

40
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.790
then I can maybe apply a filter
to that whole thing so

41
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.000
that they'll appear like
they're one giant shape.

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.390
So you can kind of reduce precision
of some of those elements

43
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.330
to get these kind of
more advanced effects.

44
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.171
So if I'm looking at like sprite and
elemental motion for these robotters,

45
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.777
they're robot otters, so
they're robotters you know.

46
00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:59.483
So they're kind of moving
through this forest.

47
00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.884
This isn't like,
a great giant pen or anything, but

48
00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:07.116
the main purpose of the pen is to
show how, if I just showed these two

49
00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:10.913
robotters bouncing,
it wouldn't be super interesting.

50
00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:15.694
But you really get a sense of the space
that they're in by showing them in

51
00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:20.491
the forest, and having things like
that mist come down from the trees.

52
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:25.222
And that's just done with those effects
that we talked about earlier with the drop

53
00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:26.741
shadows in Illustrator.

54
00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:33.037
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So here's something,
we've got a little background move.

55
00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:37.181
We've got like a little hovering
effect that we're repeating for

56
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.624
both the robotters and their shadows.

57
00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:44.894
We make sure that it's opposite, so
the shadows are going to get smaller as it

58
00:03:44.894 --> 00:03:50.780
gets further away from the robotter, and
it's going to be opposite to the robotter.

59
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.120
There's a really crazy thing that I
had to do to make this animation.

60
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.570
Basically, the heart pops, it goes, boop.

61
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.850
And if you're using CSS you have to
kind of make that first step go up and

62
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.283
out and then contract back down.

63
00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:11.333
But then there's also this weird thing
that happened in Safari where there's

64
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.166
a bad SVG bug that didn't allow for
opacity and transform at the same time.

65
00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:19.555
And the heart just disappears,
and it looks really bad,

66
00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:23.190
which is really why I used this
pen to segue into JavaScript.

67
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.480
Because, there are, for SVG animation,
JavaScript really works quite well.

68
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.129
In a way that CSS is always going
to be just a little bit buggy.

69
00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.920
And if you are thinking, well, CSS has
better performance, not so necessarily.

70
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.270
Request animation frame for SVG dom nodes
has better hardware acceleration and

71
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.340
has better support for a lack of repings.

72
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.482
Like I've done benchmarks for
this then SVG does or then CSS does.

73
00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:57.034
So even when people talk about CSS
animation being more performant,

74
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:01.120
that's not necessarily the case for
SVG in the same way.

75
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.240
So we're gonna now start talking about how
we would do some animation in JavaScript.
