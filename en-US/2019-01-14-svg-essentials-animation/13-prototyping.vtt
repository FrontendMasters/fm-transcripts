00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.750
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's talk about
prototyping and getting ready for

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.520
animation really briefly.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.350
Thumbnails we mentioned,
notes to yourself.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.830
They're really scratchy,
they're really rough.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.390
They're just so
that you can get your ideas down on paper.

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.610
Storyboards are notes for collaboration.

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.460
They don't need to be super high fidelity,

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.950
no one wants to draw en entire comic book
before they start animating something.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.970
Who wants to do that?

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.080
Not me.
[LAUGH] You really just want them high

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.190
enough fidelity, so that other people can
look at it and understand what you mean.

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.760
So that you can talk about it.

13
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.930
But also, again, lower fidelity
means that your feelings aren't hurt

14
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.670
if someone tosses the idea out.

15
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.060
You didn't spend 17 million years
making this storyboard, and

16
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.960
somebody says,
I don't really like this direction.

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.210
Let's go in a different direction.

18
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.340
You're like fine,
no big deal, we'll do it.

19
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.090
Low fidelity prototypes show the motion,

20
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.410
they show exactly what's
supposed to be going on.

21
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.610
You can use big SVG shapes,
then you're not

22
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.170
creating them inside of a code base
which can take a lot of time and effort.

23
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.830
This person Yaroslav Zubko
does them in After Effects.

24
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.233
I make them in code with SVGs and

25
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:16.180
there's a couple of other
people on code pen who do so.

26
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.970
The reason why I do it in code is because,
this is my opinion,

27
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.740
we're in an opinionville right now.

28
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.735
This is not real life
this is opinionville.

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500
It might seem like it's faster
to do it in After Effects but

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.350
then gotta learn After Effects.

31
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.060
And if I make it in code,

32
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.070
I'm really making all of the eases that
I need to use for the thing as well.

33
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.970
So if I get approval, I'm stealing that
code and improving it for production.

34
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.030
Instead of rewriting
everything from scratch,

35
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.900
once I've already done
that in After Effects.

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.170
The other thing is,
do you want to get better at animation?

37
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.760
One way to get better at animation
is by animating a lot of things.

38
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.210
So if you're doing these
prototypes by animating them,

39
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.900
you're also practicing animation
while you're doing that.

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.210
So I'm done with my opinionville,
back to real life.

41
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.610
These kind of low fidelity prototypes
can help you show the motion.

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.400
So if you have something like I made
this for a company I was working for.

43
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.630
This is a code pen.

44
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.760
This is a screenshot of that site.

45
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.280
This is actually blown up.

46
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.390
Let's bring it back to 100.

47
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.700
This is a screenshot of that
site because I didn't wanna

48
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.540
get everything ready and done.

49
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.510
So I just absolutely positioned the things
that I'm working on on top of this

50
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.170
screenshot.

51
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.560
And then I just show what
that motion would be like.

52
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.040
This is like absolute positioning
in squares and stuff like that.

53
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.480
And the rest of the site doesn't work,

54
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.080
it's just a screenshot
that I'm working off of.
