00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So we can put all of
these things that we just learned about

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.450
together to tell a story.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.640
Let's do an exercise.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.521
Combine two of the effects that we just
learned to tell a simple story with SVG

5
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:13.371
animation.

6
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.108
Use either DrawSVG and
Motion Along a Path or

7
00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:21.260
DrawSVG in Split Text or
HSL, things like that.

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.980
We should probably give you 15 minutes for
that and

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.280
then finish up the class from there.
