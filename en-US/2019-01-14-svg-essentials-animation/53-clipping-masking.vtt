00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.054
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Morphing SVG paths is my
favorite thing [LAUGH] in the whole world.

2
00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:08.808
So it feels a little like we start
the day responsible stuff, and

3
00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:13.900
then towards the end, it just gets funner
and funner, more fun, more fun, more fun.

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.881
Clipping and masking, okay.

5
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:21.880
So the last thing we're gonna do today is
actually a really useful thing, because

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.589
until you know how to clip and mask
things, it's really hard to get realistic

7
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.602
motion especially if you have things like
arms and legs and things moving around.

8
00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:36.206
Because there's a lot of times where you
need to just show a piece of something and

9
00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:40.060
not the full thing in order
to make something realistic.

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.690
So let's talk about clipping and masking.

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.610
So the difference between clipping and

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.820
masking is really the way
that you think about it.

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.150
So clipping is using the geometry of
a shape to cut out another shape or

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.510
an image so you can cut out like a picture
or you can cut out another piece of an SVG

15
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.840
even cut out a GIF and do GIF masking.

16
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.050
So that uses the geometry so if I use
this shape and take a rectangle and

17
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.560
you know create a clip it wont
take those strokes styles with it.

18
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.680
It will only take
the geometry of that shape.

19
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.820
But if I do a mask it's
dealing with transparency so

20
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.990
it's taking what's like darker and

21
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.620
lighter it's taking all of
the kind of pieces of it.

22
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.580
So in this case dashes.

23
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.039
So if I took a bitmap image it
would be masking like you could

24
00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.234
probably see parts of an eye and the nose.

25
00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.670
You could see all of those
gradient as part of that too.

26
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.100
I have a hard time remembering
the difference between clipping and

27
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.330
masking and how to use each.

28
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.932
So I wrote an article about it.

29
00:01:53.932 --> 00:02:01.380
[LAUGH] Masking, partially,
because CSS-tricks has good SEO.

30
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.210
So I knew I would find it again.

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.160
Also, I felt like if I
wrote an article I would

32
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.570
keep it in my mind a little bit better and
I would remember better and it did work.

33
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.870
So if you wanna remember something and you
can't remember it write an article because

34
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.080
then not only can you remember it a little
but better but you can also find it again.

35
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.197
So it's good for the community and
also good for your brain.

36
00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:26.535
[LAUGH] So here we go,
we could make animations

37
00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:30.540
that have clippings and masking in them.

38
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.290
This is not a crazy, this isn't like
a really good animation by any means.

39
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.780
But it's more interesting than it would
be because it's got this kind of circle.

40
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
So I'm just basically taking the entire
SVG and animating parts of it, and

41
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.250
then I took a circle and

42
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm, using a clip path to say just
show me what's inside of this circle.

43
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.900
And then you get kind of like a peering
through the bushes kind of view of it.

44
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.130
Illustrator's good at a lot of things.

45
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.780
It's not good at outputting clip paths.

46
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.941
If you create a clip path in Illustrator,
this is what you're gonna get.

47
00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:09.560
You're gonna get defs, and
an ellipse inside of there.

48
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
And then there's gonna be a use and
then a clip path.

49
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.860
And used to animating things that are
inside of a use tag always gets a little

50
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.980
iffy, so if you're animating clip
paths that are done this way,

51
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250
you're gonna be like,
clip paths are hard to animate.

52
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.290
It's actually that the use tag
is really hard to animate.

53
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.460
And then you get this.

54
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.750
This is really complicated and
hard to understand.

55
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.980
This isn't all that's necessary.

56
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.720
So you might find that it might be
easier to just, bring the path out from

57
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.873
Illustrator if it's a complicated path,
or draw it yourself by writing it.

58
00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:48.707
You don't even actually need defs.

59
00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.430
The defs I can consider
like a staging area.

60
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.941
For an SVG, it's like,
we're gonna use you later.

61
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.727
So you don't even need this,
it's just the clip path, and

62
00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:01.000
you apply the clip path somewhere.

63
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.750
Much easier to understand.

64
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.639
And then you don't have crazy use path,
or use nonsense.

65
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.679
SVG has a clip path, or
CSS has a clip path property,

66
00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:19.983
It's not super well supported and
sometimes this pen breaks like

67
00:04:19.983 --> 00:04:25.383
sometimes Chrome supports
it better than other times.

68
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:30.809
But you can make shapes so
this clippy Bennett feely,

69
00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.760
almost Bennett, feely, clippy.

70
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.207
You have to say Bennet freely clippy or
you get the wrong clippy.

71
00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:43.152
And you can do these clip bath makers and
you can drag them around and

72
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:47.212
that's cool and it updates and
the code is down here and

73
00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:51.320
it will even open in a code pen for
you if you want.

74
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.650
So you can play around with
those clip paths here.

75
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.620
I don't remember the support you can look
at can I use for this but SVG support for

76
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.200
clip paths is really really good.

77
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.285
So this is last I checked it was like
support in CSS is like I don't know.

78
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:12.620
[LAUGH] And support in SVG is like.

79
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.766
Earlier than they supported SVG.

80
00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:19.940
Strangely, it's like Chrome 1,
Firefox 1.5.

81
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.940
So it's like way way back there.

82
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.261
So SVG clipping is really well done.

83
00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:28.774
You can animate it.

84
00:05:28.774 --> 00:05:33.116
So here is a GitHub Octocat and he falls.

85
00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:35.614
And he blinks at you.

86
00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:38.020
And then it's like that's all folks.

87
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.670
And then you can replay.

88
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.650
So basically you can use it to create
like make the end of a scene as well.

89
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.650
And remember this pen with
the little arms and stuff.

90
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.520
Those arms are done with the clip path.

91
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.730
Because really they go
into these circles here.

92
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.188
And you're showing pieces of the rectangle
and then you're not showing.

93
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:04.960
They go in past here.

94
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.940
So basically this is above that shape.

95
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.320
So it would be hard to make it so
that I'm only showing bits of it.

96
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.080
I can't put it behind,
I can't put this behind this.

97
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.484
So there's a little circle here,

98
00:06:22.484 --> 00:06:28.691
it's clipping this longer
piece of rectangle.

99
00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:30.190
I already showed you that.

100
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.510
So it's this little bit here for
both sides of the arm and

101
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.450
it kind of goes out and comes back in.

102
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.150
And you can even use GIFs to mask other
shapes and this is like a SVG pattern and

103
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.550
I'm loading a GIF in and
I'm creating a mask out of that GIF.

104
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.450
So we're using the gradients and we're
using the shadows inside of that GIF.

105
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.720
So we don't even see different colors
of it, we're just seeing the black and

106
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.680
white of it to kind of
expose other things.

107
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.817
And the code for it is pretty simple.

108
00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:13.818
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Create
a pattern using a gradient, and

109
00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:18.970
I've got this pattern with the rekt and
circle here.

110
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:25.680
And then I just apply one square where
I'm filling it with the pattern and

111
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.290
masking it with that GIF yeah.

112
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.220
I learned this technique from Yoksel.

113
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.627
She's really really great.

114
00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:38.893
You should check her out on code pen.

115
00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:42.620
Yoksel She does a lot of
really amazing amazing pens.

116
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.500
So this is kind of the tldr of that.

117
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.790
So the image is 100% height 100%.

118
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:55.060
And then I xlink:href the asset there.

119
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.662
So this is that reference pen by Yoksel.

120
00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:59.000
I just mentioned Yoksel.

121
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.750
She shows in this pen,
this is a movie of the pen, but

122
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.211
she shows in this pen every way that
you can work with SVG and CSS and

123
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:14.530
clip path and masking and she also has a
little support chart for each one of them.

124
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.880
That's really cool.

125
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.290
And she shows you how to work
with each one of them in code so

126
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.530
it's a really great resource.
