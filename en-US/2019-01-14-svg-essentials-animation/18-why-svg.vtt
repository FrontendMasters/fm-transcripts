&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So why SVG?

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.590
Let's look at the code for a star again.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.450
Now that is pretty nice.

4
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.550
If I made a star in divs,

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.450
what I would have to do is I would
take a div and I would make a border.

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.140
And then I would expand the border so

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.800
that it's in the entire length of the box
and actually collapse the entire box.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.220
And then I would make every
border transparent, except for

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.060
one border that had a corner.

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.060
And then I would give that corner a color.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.090
And then I will take that and
that will be a triangle.

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.500
Then I will take that and

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.700
I would duplicate it,
then I would rotate it with the transform.

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.076
And then I'll duplicate it and
rotate it with transform,

15
00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:45.090
rotate it like that over and over again
and then I'd eventually have a star.

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.690
That is just a star and
that's not that efficient.

17
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.160
SVG is built for drawing, it's not a hack.

18
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.990
This is actually the way the web
was designed to make drawings.

19
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.520
CSS was not built for making drawings.

20
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.110
CSS was built for layout, it's a hack.

21
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.000
So if you build shapes with CSS,
it can be a good exercise.

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.950
It can be like a fun way to get better
at CSS or learn a little bit more.

23
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.320
But no designer on the planet
is building a whole

24
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.950
diagram in CSS and
then handing it to a developer to animate.

25
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.520
That doesn't happen in real life.

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.380
Really, what they're gonna do is they're
gonna draw some sort of diagram in

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.050
Illustrator or Sketch or something like
that, and hand a developer an SVG.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.130
CSS was not made for drawing like SVG is,
and also it clouds up the dom.

29
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.090
We talked a little bit
about accessibility.

30
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.840
Creating a star with CSS is not
exactly the most accessible thing

31
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.930
you could do on the planet.

32
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.630
I drew this in SVG and
it's 2 kilobytes GZipped.

33
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.550
And you can kind of guess why,
it's a bunch of circles.

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.870
You know how I made the circles?

35
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.810
The circles are c-x-c-y and a radius.

36
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.360
That's pretty small, so these kind of
shapes are so easy for SVG to draw.

37
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.660
We can also reach inside it and
animate isolated elements.

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.070
And throw the cow over the moon and

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.930
make it scare the astronaut, and
we're gonna do that later today.

40
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.090
So that's really fun.
