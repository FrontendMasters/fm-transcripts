00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
let's talk about curviness first.

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.800
Like how we make that curviness.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.281
So we can just use general coordinates and
smooth out the motion between them.

4
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.419
Because we had some coordinates right,
xy, xy, xy.

5
00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.010
But it kind of softened that curve.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.440
It didn't just go right
from one to the other.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.760
I asked it to say soft and
then it softened that curve.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.950
So we can either set the type
parameter to soft, or

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.790
we can have a little bit more control.

10
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.160
GreenSock always gives us just
a little bit more control if we want.

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.770
So here's a CodePen demo I made that
will kind of hopefully explain.

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.210
That's curviness set to 0,
and that's set to 2.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.706
If I set it to 8, that's 0.

14
00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:46.432
What, what is going on?

15
00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:50.360
Okay, so set to 0, set to 2.

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.368
All right, so when it's set to 0, it just
goes between those coordinates, right?

17
00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.660
You saw that, it just kind of
bounced between one and another.

18
00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:04.232
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: And then it goes crazy.

19
00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:06.525
And this one is kind of normal.

20
00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:10.828
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: All right,
so what's happening here?

21
00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:16.094
So imagine that you have a rubber band and
that you have the stakes in the ground.

22
00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:20.382
So I take the stakes, I nail them in
the ground in these different points and

23
00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:22.777
I take that rubber band and
I pull it taut.

24
00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:25.310
At zero, it's fully taut.

25
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.620
Then at one I let it out a little bit.

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.410
Then at two, it's let out a little
more until it's kind of curvy.

27
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.710
But if I kept letting
that rubber band out,

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.360
what would end up happening is it
would sort of unravel on itself.

29
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.050
And that's basically the concept there.

30
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.040
So rather than it keep getting
curvier in terms of making a circle,

31
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.300
it's getting curvier.

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.985
It has more, you're letting
that rubber band fully out so

33
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.054
it's kinda coming around like that.

34
00:01:54.054 --> 00:01:56.629
So that can be useful for
certain types of motion.

35
00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.412
But it confused me at first, so
that's why I made the pen like that, so

36
00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.513
that you can see it.

37
00:02:04.952 --> 00:02:05.753
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Rotation,

38
00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:10.300
the CodePen embed transform
origin thing is kinda funny.

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.720
It's like, only when you're embedded
will the transform origin be all broken.

40
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.930
So let's talk about the rotation.

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.620
Here's autoRotate true, autoRotate false.

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.420
Both are actually useful.

43
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.890
There are some things that
you won't want to autoRotate.

44
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.622
So if I have that false,

45
00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:36.698
there's some things in mechanical worlds
that you don't wanna follow that path.

46
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:41.241
But you can see how if you don't
have autoRotate true, especially for

47
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:45.639
things like these little characters and
stuff, that's not good.

48
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.268
You don't want this little character,

49
00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.222
it kind of takes it from being
believable to not believable.

50
00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:56.486
He's just not believable
when his just [SOUND].

51
00:02:56.486 --> 00:03:02.089
He's only believable when he's
kind of following that curve.

52
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:08.440
So we can say autoRotate true or again,
GreenTalk gives us all this options.

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.809
Position parameter 1 (typically"x")..

54
00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.110
Position parameter 2(typically"y")..

55
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.550
Rotation usually rotation but

56
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.320
can be rotationX or
Y if you wanna keep it on one axis.

57
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.240
Number of degrees or radiance to
add to the rotation at the onset.

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.730
And false, which is a boolean denoting
whether you want to be using radians or

59
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.750
rotation.

60
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.230
Probably nobody in this room is at that
level of geeky, but maybe you are,

61
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.240
just in case you are,
then that's an interesting one.

62
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.438
The only one that I really use is this.

63
00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:45.440
So I'll actually pass in all these
values just to change this one.

64
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.380
And the reason is

65
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.400
autoRotate true looks really good if
they're set along the path correctly.

66
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.480
So if we go back to that little owl,
whoever his name is,

67
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.140
guy, he bends into the curve,
do you see that?

68
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.740
If he had started off like this, which is
actually how he is on the page, then he

69
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.310
would've followed and then like rotating
along but like rotating kinda strangely.

70
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.860
He would've been, if he isn't turned,

71
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.070
he would've been sure,
rotating, but not correctly.

72
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.470
So I need him to duck into that curve, and
I do that through the amount of rotation

73
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.560
at the onset, and that's that fourth
parameter, that's that amount.
