&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Let's
talk about viewBox and

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.320
svgOrigin, as the last thing that we do.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.080
We talked about transform-origin,
but we didn't talk about svgOrigin.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.610
What is svgOrigin?

5
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.790
It's not a real thing.

6
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.450
It's a thing that GreenSock gives us,
so it's not a part of the spec.

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.358
So we talked about how viewBox,
as just as like a reminder, zero, zero,

8
00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:22.600
width and height, yeah?

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.005
Remember that?

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.717
Okay, well if I went and
got this little group here, and

11
00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:33.732
I looked at where that is inside
the SVG Coordinate System,

12
00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:37.965
it would be at 215, 160, 42, and 20.

13
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.410
That's where that thing lives.

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
And the way that I found that out
is I went a grabbed that group,

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.240
like the idea of that group, and
I use a native method called getBBox.

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.030
So I console log the getBBox, which gives
me an object that's called SVGRect.

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.070
And that gives me x, y, width, and height.

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.580
Well, that sounds familiar, right?

19
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.190
That's all the things that
we need to make a viewBox.

20
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
So if I want to change the viewBox of this
particular code pen that is not loading in

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.570
that window,
I'm making the SVG width 100 VW and

22
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.720
height 100 VW,which is a really quick way
of making it take up the whole screen.

23
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.162
And I say houses, which is that group,

24
00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:28.490
getBBox, I console logged it so if you you
can go check out the console if you want,

25
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.810
but basically, I say S.X,
S.Y, S.Width, S.Height,

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.570
and then I create a new viewBox, so if I
comment this out, I have the whole scene.

27
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.990
That whole scene is there the entire time.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.700
But I can change the viewBox on the fly,
to just zoom in on those houses.

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.980
Well, of course, we're gonna animate it.

30
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.330
Of course, we're gonna animate it.

31
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.510
So we can use it for
like data visualization, and

32
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.650
zoom in on a piece of our map.

33
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.810
What's nice about this is you're
not loading multiple things, and

34
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.210
you're kind of giving the context
of what they're zooming into.

35
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.960
So we talked a little bit about, like,
what would happen if you were using D3.

36
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.400
I would make a whole map with D3 and
maybe have some stats and stuff,

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.220
and then play with interaction in
GreenSock and bring everything to life.

38
00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:28.350
So, kind of cool, and
the nice thing is, because it's an SVG,

39
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
everything is really stable for
responsive.

40
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.120
So I can, or touch points, or
probably need some padding,

41
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.330
but I can also have it work on mobile.

42
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.226
So we can also do things that are really
weird, like we can do flow charts.

43
00:02:49.226 --> 00:02:53.610
So I could say, what graphic format should
I use, are you interested in responsive?

44
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550
Yes, mobile first all the way.

45
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.650
Is it an image with a lot of
tonal variations, like a photo?

46
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.550
No, is it super complex?

47
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.800
No, SVG, and of course, my friend draw
SVG, I use that everywhere, right?

48
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.990
And then, I can say, check out our
compendium and load in CSS-Tricks.

49
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.800
So, for each one of those things, you can
kind of go through and find different

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.960
things on flow chart, and it will
bring you to different documentation.

51
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.350
So, you can learn more about
images through that flow chart.

52
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.840
Bustle uses that technique a lot.

53
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.357
They have, like fun flow charts where, and

54
00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:32.890
theirs are like beautifully
illustrated and stuff.

55
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.170
So, you can check out
their SVG flow charts.
