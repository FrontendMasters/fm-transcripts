00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:06.061
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: DrawSVG and
motion along a path, I'm bouncing,

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.600
because I'm very excited.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.860
I love this stuff.

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.942
All right, DrawSVG is super cool.

5
00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:16.048
All right, so,
let's say you have a shape and

6
00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:20.380
that shape has a stroke and
the stroke is dashed.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.055
But you make the dash really long.

8
00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:31.760
The dash offset, the spaces between
the dashes is an animatable property,

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.608
animatable, animate, animatable, whatever.

10
00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:40.652
[LAUGH] So if you make it the whole length
of the whole shape, you can go from having

11
00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:46.760
it be that dash offset is exactly the same
length, right, it doesn't appear at all.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.849
And then you make it go to zero, and

13
00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:58.281
it looks like it's drawing onto that SVG
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So

14
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.227
you can make all sorts of kind of
like things that draw themselves,

15
00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:06.890
if you seen a Nintendo that drew itself
onto the screen or something like that.

16
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.660
You can totally do this without GreenSock.

17
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.560
This is one of those paid for
plugins, you don't need GreenSock.

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.030
I'll show you how to do it with just CSS,
or you could do it with just JavaScript.

19
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.100
The nice thing about GreenSock is
it has a few different options for

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.150
how you can work with it that
are pretty simple and and easy to use.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.660
Of course, they always kind of
make things really so easy that,

22
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.150
why don't you just use it, kind of thing.

23
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.860
If you wanna make it in just CSS, or you
could just do this in JavaScript as well,

24
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.860
what we're doing here is
creating that dash offset, and

25
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm basically animating that dash offset.

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.700
So I have to find the length of
that dash in order to do this.

27
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.309
So, you can find the length of the dash
with Java Script with Get Total Length.

28
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:58.110
It's a native method, so you call
the native method on that stroke and

29
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.740
it will return a number.

30
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.280
So in this case I found out the amount and
then I apply it here and

31
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.580
now I have my little loader or
what have you and I can animate it.

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.760
However, if you have a response
of SVG that's squishy,

33
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.510
that number is not like the rest
of the SVG, it's static.

34
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.350
So if you start squishing it you'll
notice that it doesn't work for

35
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.680
all of those different sizes.

36
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.414
If this is just, this circle is gonna
always stay this size cuz it's a loader,

37
00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.222
no big deal.

38
00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:31.692
But if it is gonna change,
then you might need to use,

39
00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:35.859
maybe CSS variables in JavaScript
to kinda talk to each other and

40
00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.976
make sure that we're using the right
number so it's called at the right time.

41
00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:43.646
Or you could do it all in JavaScript,
or what have you, but

42
00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:46.110
you'd have to somehow
communicate between the two.

43
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.180
GreenSock, it doesn't really matter,
GreenSock is gonna perform all those

44
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.040
calculations immediately as you're
doing it, so it's always gonna work.

45
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.990
Also, they have all of
these different options.

46
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.436
You can do absolute values.

47
00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:06.517
I love 50%, 50%, that's another one that's
[SOUND] that's also the technical term.

48
00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:08.300
So you can do stuff like that.

49
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.260
You can use booleans.

50
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.450
You could have it just go to one side.

51
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.226
So there's just tons of stuff that you can
do with it that make it pretty easy to

52
00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:17.965
work with.

53
00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:22.675
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
you can do stuff like this.

54
00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:27.660
It was Shell Silverstein's birthday,
he's dead but I really like him.

55
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.494
So I took his poem
called Everything On It,

56
00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:35.030
which is a poem about a hot dog
with literally everything on it.

57
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.980
And I redrew it in Illustrator, and

58
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.370
then I had it kinda come
onto the canvas and stuff.

59
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.932
So it's a hot dog with everything.

60
00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:46.603
And I'm also animating some of the text,

61
00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:48.720
which I'm gonna show you
in a minute how to do, too.

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.650
And you can kinda celebrate New Years.

63
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.800
So I made this pin to celebrate New Years,
we have some texts being animated.

64
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.038
Some confetti falling, and
those fireworks are all DrawSVG.

65
00:04:03.038 --> 00:04:07.070
So the first thing that's DrawSVG,
if I replay it, are all these lines.

66
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.752
That's all of those lines are DrawSVG.

67
00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:15.111
And we've got some stagger,
right, stagger for the confetti.

68
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:20.480
The fireworks started DrawSVG
coming from 50% to true, yeah?

69
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.740
And now it's jut like playing forever.

70
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.950
We've got bubbles that are staggering and

71
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.390
then they're also repeat negative one so
they're constantly going.

72
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.690
But the other weird one is that
I'm doing fluid dynamics and

73
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.890
moving that cocktail thing around.

74
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.010
No one notices that.

75
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.562
I should, I mean, I spent way too long,
that's not important.

76
00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:48.546
I I was like, did you see the liquid?

77
00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:49.809
And everyone's like no.

78
00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.562
[LAUGH] Sarah come on.

79
00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:57.299
So here's another thing that I did
with a few different techniques,

80
00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.350
this is DrawSVG for the dots.

81
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.075
Remember how I said wind, elemental
motion, we can see the leaves go.

82
00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:12.779
That's DrawSVG around to create
the kind of circles around the rainbow.

83
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:21.308
[SOUND] And that thing that
goes around is also DrawSVG.

84
00:05:21.308 --> 00:05:24.250
So I kind of use DrawSVG
along with transforms and

85
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.430
stuff to make something occur.

86
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.150
This one is a movie because I wasn't

87
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.400
sure the state of the click
events this morning.

88
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.640
But this is in a repo that you can check
out, because it's actually a Vue app.

89
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.970
So all of the different pieces
that come on are components.

90
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.710
And I'm using the transition component
in Vue to kick off those events and then

91
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.170
I actually coordinate all the state with
UX which is like Vue's version of redux.

92
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.791
So if you're into frameworks,
that's a good place to check things out.

93
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:56.775
I also use some life cycle methods too.

94
00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:03.962
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So for
that fireworks, I have DrawSVG, right,

95
00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:07.268
50%, 50%, to DrawSVG true.

96
00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.773
And then all of the fireworks go [SOUND].

97
00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:12.760
And they're all named the same so
I can grab all of them.

98
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.100
Motion along a path, so
that was all of DrawSVG.

99
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.260
We just covered DrawSVG.

100
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.437
It was super fast but
you probably now know how it works.

101
00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:29.199
It's not more complicated than that
line of code once you load the plug-in.
