&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: See, actually,
we have the time to do this, so

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.749
let's do another exercise.

3
00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:10.033
Either create an SVG or use one from
the repo, and create a shape morph, and

4
00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.620
that can be incorporated
into your last pen.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.170
So, whatever you were
working on in your last pen,

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.957
try to make some shape morph happen.
