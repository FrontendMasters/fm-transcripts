&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Okay, so

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.170
useful functions for
interaction with the GSAP timeline.

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.330
We can pause a timeline.

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.920
We can restart a timeline.

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.070
We can resume a timeline.

6
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.350
So if I used pause, I'd use resume.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.920
So it would pause, and then it would start
again from that point in time, right?

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.460
We can say tl.restart, that says start it
back from the beginning of the timeline.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.590
We can play from x number of seconds.

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910
We can play from x number
of seconds from the end.

11
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.622
We saw seek earlier, that was when we
found that one part of the timeline to

12
00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:37.765
start from, so we could keep
working on that longer timeline.

13
00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.020
tl.reverse, that one's really cool.

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.870
We saw that before.

15
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.770
So what we could do is have click,
the whole thing goes through, and

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.100
then say, restart, reverse.

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.820
And use those two methods together, and it
would play from the end to the beginning.

18
00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:59.280
time scale, we also saw,
when we sped the entire animation up.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.590
The other cool thing about putting
those things into sections,

20
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.430
that you add to master,
is you could just speed up one section.

21
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.790
So you could just speed up one,
like scene one, or

22
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.360
you could speed up the whole timeline.

23
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.600
There have been times where I put things
into one function together, just so

24
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.160
I could adjust the timing
of that little unit.

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570
Progress, skip to halfway,
you might think, like,

26
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810
what's that good for, or
that seems not that useful.

27
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.580
We're gonna do some weird
stuff with this later.

28
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.680
It's gonna get crazy.
