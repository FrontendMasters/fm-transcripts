00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.690
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: So
Apply This To Real Dev.

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.250
I did this like, okay,
what if I was gonna redo a site?

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.090
What if I was gonna change
an experience based on animating and

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.280
revealing information?

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.250
So I'm on a trip exploring a city.

6
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.460
Last year, I went to Spain.

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.790
And I love Lonely Planet.

8
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.210
It has such great content.

9
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.130
So I go to Lonely Planet.

10
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.460
And I look up Barcelona, but

11
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.690
I go there and
down here I'm like okay which site to see.

12
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.420
I think I'm gonna go
to La Sagrada Familia.

13
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.996
I've heard good things about that,
so I click on that.

14
00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:33.610
And what should I do next?

15
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.750
Well if I go to this map section
of La Sagrada Familia, there's

16
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.070
a pub and something else that doesn't
seem interesting and that's really it.

17
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.710
This is a static JPEG,
it's not explorable or anything.

18
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.050
So I wanna find another site or
maybe lunch and then another site and

19
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.870
then dinner, right?

20
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.790
That's kind of what you do
when you explore a city.

21
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.730
But then I go back, and then it's
different somehow, I don't know why.

22
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.340
And then I go to Food and Drink.

23
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.120
And these all look good, but I don't
know if they're in the same area, and

24
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.770
if I have to go across town for
no reason, or what?

25
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.670
So then I go there's a map section,
launch maps view.

26
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.760
But really that has a few sites, but none
of the food or any of the other stuff.

27
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120
So I'm like, all right,
this is good content but

28
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
I can't really navigate it the way
that I need to for this trip.

29
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.827
So I go over Google Maps, and Google Maps
is great because if I know where I'm

30
00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:27.931
gonna go,
I know it can kind of locate that for me.

31
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.423
I wouldn't be able to find
La Sagrada Familia from here,

32
00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:35.733
if I go to Google Maps and be like
show me cool things, it's like what.

33
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.638
Cannot find cool things like [LAUGH].

34
00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:43.908
So I go to get La Sagrada Familia and
cool, I say restaurants in the area and

35
00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:46.883
I find a bunch of restaurants in the area.

36
00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:51.356
But I don't really know, and
like maybe bars and pubs, but

37
00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:55.759
between these two views,
thereâ€™s no idea of each other.

38
00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.375
They don't know each other.

39
00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:00.480
And I don't know another
site from there either.

40
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.500
And their content is not so good, so
look at all of these 4.1 of what.

41
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.281
It doesn't really show me what those are.

42
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:15.142
I can send each one to my phone,
which is really cool, but

43
00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:18.048
I'm sending one offs to my phone, right?

44
00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:22.336
And yeah the content that's what
the Google, a Google user five years ago,

45
00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.760
five star, I don't know [LAUGH], really?

46
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.609
I'm not sure.

47
00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.393
So okay I made this demo.

48
00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:33.996
Here's a trip planner, I write La Sagrada
Familia or just right in sites, and

49
00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:38.670
I can kind of navigate my way
through different sites on this map.

50
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.490
And maybe I choose that one, and
then it shows me food in the area and

51
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.960
I can kind of go through
each one on that map.

52
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.560
And then I can maybe keep going and

53
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.640
find transportation and
other sites and other food.

54
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.388
But then as soon as I'm done
selecting a bunch of them,

55
00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:58.166
I can send all the itinerary to my phone.

56
00:02:58.166 --> 00:02:59.690
And the only difference,

57
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.616
we went through 20 different views on the
other thing across two different sites.

58
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:09.074
And the difference between the two is
that we used animation to kind of guide

59
00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:13.318
the user, and show the user the
information that they needed at the time

60
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:18.300
and obscure the things that they didn't
need, and that's really great, right?

61
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.620
We're not trying to understand
everything at once.

62
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.380
We're kinda dealing with
things one at a time.

63
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.790
The other thing I want you to
think about with this demo is

64
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.520
it's not something that was additive.

65
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.420
The animation wasn't added on later.

66
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.870
The animation was part of the experience.

67
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.950
We didn't just create the whole thing and
slap it on.

68
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.200
It was an intrinsic part of the UX.

69
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.460
It was an intrinsic part
of what we built out

70
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.850
in the whole concept of
what we were creating.

71
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.437
So if animation is really
important to your site, and

72
00:03:52.437 --> 00:03:55.716
it's doing a good job,
it is a part of this site.

73
00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:57.800
It's not something that was additive,

74
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.608
people can tell when they're having
an additive animation experience.

75
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.867
They're waiting for
something and to do something.

76
00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:08.342
Really animation should be
helping you do something.
