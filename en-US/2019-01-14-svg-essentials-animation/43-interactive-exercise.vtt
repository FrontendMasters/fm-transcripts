00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Take your last pen and
make it interactive.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.740
So this could be a button click,
if you wanna start really simple.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.070
You were working on a GreenSock
timeline in the last one.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.090
You could just pause it and
then have it restart with a button click.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.450
If you wanna make it more ambitious,
you could try to hook it up to a slider.

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.050
You could try to hook
it up to a draggable,

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.810
dragging something else around the screen,
it doesn't have to be a circle either,

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.780
you could drag anything and
control a timeline, so either way.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.700
But if it's more ambitious, you should try
to make a thumbnail before you start so

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.570
you have a plan.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.695
Okay, so we'll do ten minutes for
that one.
