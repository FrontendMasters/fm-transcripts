00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: A lot of times
when we talk to people about SVG,

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.960
they're like, but the support.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.100
No, no, no, no, no, the support [LAUGH]
was a problem a long, long time ago.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.460
And those things have all changed.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.740
That one with the IE11 that's green,
it actually goes back to IE9.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.470
I don't know why they don't show
that appropriately in the Can I Use.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470
But look at all that green.

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.120
We've got.

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.000
We never get.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.430
That never happens.

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.880
So if you're worried about not using
SVG because of the support of SVG,

12
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.480
don't worry.

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.410
That's long gone, since been an issue.

14
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.660
So I hope I never have to
show this slide again.

15
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.670
We can move forward into the future
knowing that SVG is well supported and

16
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.440
we can all use it.

17
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.940
And it's just like a party.

18
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.640
I can make my own party with SVG or

19
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.680
I can have JavaScript be the event
coordinator for me, get it event.

20
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.894
If you don't like JAD jokes,
this is gonna be a long day.

21
00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:01.930
[LAUGH]
So I really think that the way that

22
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.770
you can play with it and
manipulate it is really, really fun.

23
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.562
And by the end of the day,
you'll know how to do this.

24
00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:14.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner: Why do we talk about
images when we talk about performance?

25
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.970
Images are really,
really important for performance.

26
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.000
When I talk about SVG being a really
important and really performant and

27
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.720
really small file size.

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.080
When I look at HTTP archive, most of what
we deliver across the web is images.

29
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.690
That's the heaviest thing.

30
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.600
We can all really do
good in optimizing fonts,

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.590
optimizing JavaScript,
making sure our build sizes are small.

32
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.260
But if you're not also
optimizing your images and

33
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.620
paying attention to how big your images
are, you're doing yourself a disservice.

34
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620
That's a really big cost for performance.

35
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.240
We're gonna talk a bit
about performance before we

36
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.270
even get into animating anything at all.

37
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.790
I love this quote by Jason Grigsby,
if you were here yesterday,

38
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.260
I used this quote in both slide decks,
because I think it's really important.

39
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.480
You can't be a web performance expert
without being an image expert, and

40
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.040
I think that that's really true.

41
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.870
If you really want to understand and
care for your site's performance,

42
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.480
it's really important to understand
how to optimize correctly.

43
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.380
So SVG is really great for loaders.

44
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.760
I made this for Smashing Magazine.

45
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.480
if you go and buy anything for

46
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.050
Smashing Magazine and
you have this check out experience,

47
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.280
then you'll see this little cat watching
the little bird before you check out.

48
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.070
The really amazing thing is
when they gave me this graphic,

49
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.160
they were like, we really wanted to use
this loader but we think it's too heavy.

50
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.850
I think it was something like 150
kilobytes and I was like, no worries.

51
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.160
The entire thing now,
once I optimized it, was six kilobytes.

52
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.430
That's including the animation,
the whole thing packaged up.

53
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.610
So if you optimize correctly,
you can save a whole of stuff.

54
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.280
Also, it's perfect for loaders.

55
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.730
If you need something to load fast, six
kilobytes is a really good way of going.

56
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.020
That's a lot visual information for
not a lot of cost.

57
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.570
SVG can make other images smaller.

58
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.360
So there's this JPEG to SVG
that my friend Shaw made.

59
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.820
If you don't follow him,
he's shshaw on Twitter and CodePen.

60
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.510
He made this and
there's some prior art here.

61
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.630
He made it off of this other concept
that other people had been working on.

62
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.290
But you can use this.

63
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.711
And I wasn't specifically picking an image
here, I was just picking something random.

64
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.691
So 38 kilobytes to 16 kilobytes just for
some random image.

65
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.811
So you can go play with this and
check it out,

66
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:47.121
and he has some documentation for
how he's making this as well.
