1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.678
So node dev 2.

2
00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:08.270
To get the second exercise up and
running, you're gonna be on port 4002.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.845
So make sure you're on the right port,
the right page,

4
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.780
and that everything is squared away and
going for you.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.433
Now, actually something
just happened to me, and

6
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.910
I'm actually still not
sure why this happens.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.287
I just noticed it yesterday,

8
00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:29.097
sometimes this will happen where
you'll get this tailwind CSS 404.

9
00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:32.608
I don't know why because that
really shouldn't be happening,

10
00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:36.258
because it should be running
the the build of the tailwind file 2.

11
00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:40.902
But if that does happen to you, then
what you're going to do is run npm run

12
00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:44.784
build with a -w for workspace and
you want to run the build for

13
00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:48.621
the workspace that we're running,
which is exercises m.

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:54.817
Instead of the slash,
it'll be a -m here, I'll show you.

15
00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:59.775
It'll be exercise-o2-data-loading.

16
00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:01.626
And that will just run the build for
that and

17
00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.434
that should generate the tailwind file.

18
00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:08.847
I'm not sure why that tailwind file is not
being generated cuz it totally should,

19
00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:11.681
but if that happens, that's what you do.

20
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:19.288
Okay, great, so closing all this app,
going into our README for this one.

21
00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:22.290
So data loading and remix.

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.773
Loading data, for most applications,
you're going to need some data,

23
00:01:26.773 --> 00:01:31.489
you can't just like code it all up and
React components or HTML or something.

24
00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.319
You're going to want to load some data.

25
00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.380
In our case, we're loading blog posts, but

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.466
you're going to twitter.com they're gonna
load the tweets, well, wherever you go.

27
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:44.330
And there is a really nice convention for
this in remix using loaders.

28
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.297
I'll give you an example of
how to use the loader and

29
00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:52.010
talk a little bit about responses and
stuff, so you can read through that.

30
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.310
For our exercise, we're going to be
loading these posts, that's the data.

31
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.469
You can call these posts,
whatever you like if you want to.

32
00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.882
And because this is not a react workshop,
I actually give you the code for

33
00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:09.610
the JSX and stuff cuz you do not care,
I do not care, who cares?

34
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.110
Nobody, so I just give that to you
because we are talking about remix.

35
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.090
And so I will give you that to copy paste.

36
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.056
We are just working in the one file, and

37
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:20.860
then this one does have
a couple extra credits.

38
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.555
One to make TypeScript happy.

39
00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:32.262
When I say make TypeScript happy, what I
actually mean is help TypeScript help us.

40
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:34.785
And then the second is to
switch to Prisma for data, so

41
00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:37.770
we actually have a database rather
than hard coding our stuff.

42
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.247
So that is the exercise, feel free
to read through the background, and

43
00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:41.920
then get started.
