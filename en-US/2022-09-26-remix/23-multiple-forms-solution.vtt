WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.422
We are going to talk
about multiple forums.

2
00:00:02.422 --> 00:00:05.560
So in our case, we want to be
able to have a delete button and

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.676
an update post when we're looking at
a post and when we're on the new route.

4
00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:13.111
Then we just want to have
the Create Post button.

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.684
So for the way that we're
going to structure this,

6
00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:18.854
I wanna start with just the UI.

7
00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:22.282
And so we get all the buttons
in the right spot and

8
00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:25.385
then we can make it
function on the server.

9
00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:29.857
So instead of this p tag I'm
actually gonna make a div that is

10
00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.650
display flex justify.

11
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.560
Let's see justify, or
yeah, what is it space?

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.906
Yeah, justify right.

13
00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:46.881
If I write or end yeah,
that's what it is and

14
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.578
then a gap of 4, okay.

15
00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:53.001
Cuz we're gonna have two
buttons here now and

16
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.983
this one is gonna be our delete button.

17
00:00:55.983 --> 00:01:02.261
So we'll have an is deleting
variable that we'll create and

18
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:07.195
this will say deleting
otherwise delete post.

19
00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:11.244
And for the deleting one, instead of blue,

20
00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:16.618
let's make it look red, so
it looks dangerous and stuff.

21
00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:24.861
And then of course, we also only want that
to render when we're on an existing post.

22
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:26.681
If we're on a new post,
I don't wanna render anything.

23
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.792
So I'm going to add it is new
post we'll render no otherwise,

24
00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.840
we'll render the button.

25
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.345
So we're gonna need to create that as new
post variable here in a second as well.

26
00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:39.785
And then on this button we could actually
create three separate buttons and

27
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.689
just choose which to render but
I'm gonna just reuse this one.

28
00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.060
Just because that's the way I did it and
we're gonna stick with that.

29
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.650
So in this case, we want it to be
disabled if it's creating or is updating.

30
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.986
And then this one's gonna
be a little bit tricky.

31
00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:00.012
We could do like a really funny looking,

32
00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:05.470
nested ternary thing here, and
I tried it and I didn't like it.

33
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.121
So what we're gonna do instead.

34
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:11.366
Isn't gonna say isNewPost so

35
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:16.470
if we are a new post and isUpdating.

36
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.410
Actually you know what?

37
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.460
I don't remember exactly you, shoot.

38
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.168
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
reference this one too.

39
00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:27.273
[LAUGH] So a final seven slug.

40
00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:32.283
So I am cheating yes but
I promise you'll be happier

41
00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:39.753
that I'm cheating than if I just tried
to work this out myself, there we go.

42
00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:43.505
So if we're a new post and we're in a
creating state then we'll render creating

43
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:47.272
otherwise we're under Create if we're
not a new post then we'll render null.

44
00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:50.029
So we're not going to render anything for
the creating one.

45
00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.071
If we are a new post then we
won't render the updating state.

46
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:57.412
If we're updating then we'll say updating,
otherwise we'll say update.

47
00:02:57.412 --> 00:03:02.387
So that just gets us in a good place for
the button to say updating or

48
00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:08.099
creating based on the isNewPost and
isCreating versus isUpdating state.

49
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.744
Okay, great so the next thing
that we need to do let's see yeah

50
00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:21.141
we'll do that here now is disambiguate
between which transition we're doing.

51
00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:24.721
So, if we come up here and we've got
this isCreating we're just saying,

52
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:27.810
hey we're in a creating state
if we're submitting anything.

53
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.531
If anything's being submitted I'm creating
but that's not the case anymore, right?

54
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:33.453
We have multiple forms on the page,

55
00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:37.236
multiple reasons we could be
transitioning, with a submission, and

56
00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.944
so, now we have to have
some way to disambiguate.

57
00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:43.643
And so,
we will need to say transition submission.

58
00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:49.490
So, we know what submission is being made,
and the submission won't always be truthy.

59
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.204
So we'll do this Elvis operator
here to get the form data.

60
00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:56.857
So, if that transition, or
if that submission exists,

61
00:03:56.857 --> 00:04:01.667
then the form data will exist and
we can get Properties from that form data.

62
00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:02.462
So what could we get?

63
00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:06.737
Well, we could get the post title
that's not gonna tell us whether or

64
00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:08.514
not it's being submitted.

65
00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:12.553
We can get the Post Slug,
also not gonna to be able to tell us and

66
00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:15.973
we can get the mark down that
won't tell us either but

67
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:18.642
there's one other thing that we can do.

68
00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:24.445
Actually there are a couple of things but
one thing that we can do to disambiguate

69
00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:30.266
and that is submit buttons like this can
actually have a name and a value as well.

70
00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:33.104
This was a new thing for
me when I started using Remix.

71
00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:37.286
But you can have a name,
here we'll do the delete button first,

72
00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:40.360
you're gonna have a name that is delete.

73
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.566
Sorry we'll call it intent.

74
00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:46.945
So what did the user intend to do and
the value be delete.

75
00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:51.527
So now you can look this up in the form
submission to know what was the intent,

76
00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:53.902
which of these buttons did they click.

77
00:04:53.902 --> 00:05:00.023
So we can add a name on this one and
we can say intent equals and

78
00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:06.885
we'll say if it is a new post,
then this is gonna be create.

79
00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.214
Otherwise it'll be update.

80
00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:10.702
&gt;&gt; Do you mean value there?

81
00:05:10.702 --> 00:05:11.295
&gt;&gt; You are exactly right.

82
00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:12.152
Thank you.

83
00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:17.181
[LAUGH] Value, there we go.

84
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:20.961
So, all you need is either TypeScript or
Peter and

85
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:23.482
you'll be good [LAUGH] Thank you.

86
00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:27.312
So now we can get the intent and
it the intent is create,

87
00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:31.153
then we know that the user
is submitting the creation.

88
00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:35.489
They've clicked on the create button and
then we can do the same thing for

89
00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:37.494
our isUpdating and isDeleting.

90
00:05:38.684 --> 00:05:40.978
Come on co-pilot.

91
00:05:40.978 --> 00:05:42.416
Thank you.

92
00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:44.715
And then we'll do the same thing for
isDeleting.

93
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.674
And look they're all exactly 80
characters wide, that's fun.

94
00:05:54.674 --> 00:05:56.496
Okay, so now we know.

95
00:05:56.496 --> 00:06:00.810
Which of these three
things the user is doing?

96
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.979
And down here,
our stuff will hopefully I'll update.

97
00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.055
The last thing we need to do
is create this isNewPost, and

98
00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:09.697
we should be able to
actually render this thing.

99
00:06:09.697 --> 00:06:14.880
So I'll say isNewPost and we're gonna know
that based on whether data.post exists,

100
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.429
so if there is no post on the data,
then that means our loader returned to no.

101
00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:21.999
We could also just get the params and say,

102
00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.931
here are the params new and if that's the
case, then we can just do that as well.

103
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:33.570
So, couple options there, but there's
no posts and we are creating a new one.

104
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.850
So now we can come over here,
we get create.

105
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.063
And we get update and delete post.

106
00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.218
So that is working and

107
00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:45.566
we just need to make the backend
actually function properly.

108
00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:48.579
Any questions so far?

109
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:51.616
Okay, cool.

110
00:06:51.616 --> 00:06:54.080
So let's make the backend work now.

111
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.560
For delete, that one's actually
relatively straightforward.

112
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.329
If we can just grab the intent
from the form data.

113
00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:09.309
And if the intent is delete then
we'll just delete the post and

114
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:14.147
in this case,
we're gonna need the params slug.

115
00:07:14.147 --> 00:07:19.151
So let's grab the params and
slug because our file

116
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:24.285
name is dollar slug so
that's why that pram works.

117
00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:31.842
So this delete post is gonna come
from our model server right there.

118
00:07:31.842 --> 00:07:35.905
And this is again, the params.

119
00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:39.059
Like could be undefined there's no
way that TypeScript can know for

120
00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.300
sure that this is going to be defined.

121
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.642
So we'll add an invariant
rate appear invariant.

122
00:07:44.642 --> 00:07:51.861
For params.slug and
slug not found, okay, cool.

123
00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:56.368
So now our delete button should work.

124
00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:58.749
Let's go ahead and
try it just for the fun of it.

125
00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:01.458
So delete and you saw it really quickly.

126
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:05.514
It's a deleting data and then it deleted
and redirected me where I wanted to go.

127
00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:12.968
Perfect, so now let's get rid of that.

128
00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:16.777
Now come down here and we just need to
decide whether to update the post or

129
00:08:16.777 --> 00:08:19.392
create a post based on
whether prams slug is new.

130
00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:26.703
So if params slug is new then we
will create the post otherwise we'll

131
00:08:26.703 --> 00:08:32.100
update the post with the title slug and
markdown.

132
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:38.982
And there we go.

133
00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:42.913
So now I can come over here and add,

134
00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:46.851
I don't know what's a good song?

135
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:51.421
I can't think of a good song right now
because I'm too busy thinking that I

136
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:52.389
can't think.

137
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:53.250
I have a good song.

138
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.277
So, Kryptonite, there we go.

139
00:08:56.277 --> 00:09:00.749
I knew that I was gonna be judged by any

140
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:05.375
song that I said yeah, Jingle Bells.

141
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:06.490
Okay, there we go.

142
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.575
Updates like is required.

143
00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:09.464
Rats.

144
00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:11.831
Okay, so that's annoying let's fix that.

145
00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.730
I think that actually is
broken in the finished.

146
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.710
Version so let's just fix that
together here really quick.

147
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.052
So we go to our slug the name here we've
got a default value is the post slug and

148
00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:24.316
it's disabled.

149
00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:27.265
That's probably why
it's not coming across.

150
00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:33.409
So but we wanna disable it because
this is actually our ID of our post.

151
00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:37.880
So you could probably fix this and make
this blog platform have more features.

152
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.310
But with the limited feature set that we
have right now, what we're going to do is.

153
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.997
Actually instead of using the slug
here we'll use params.slug

154
00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:51.740
because they can't change
that post slug anyway.

155
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.678
Okay, so now, Kryptonite update,
slug is still required.

156
00:09:56.678 --> 00:10:03.128
Well, that is because at rats,
that's because of this.

157
00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:05.999
So yeah, you all get it, we just fix it so

158
00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:10.488
we're not validating if we're
updating yada, yada, yada.

159
00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:12.220
Cool so that is multiple forms.

160
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.280
The basic idea is name and
value on the button.

161
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.580
That's that's pretty much it.

162
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.814
Another option is you can do it.

163
00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:26.342
Input hidden name whatever value whatever
this was actually really common or

164
00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:31.544
you a lot of people will do type hidden
really common back in the PHP days.

165
00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:34.626
Are you like I've got a to do list and

166
00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:39.808
I've got the ID of to do that you're
checking off as a hidden input.

167
00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:45.485
That's another option and this actually
works nicely if you're integrating

168
00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:51.777
with a library like some form element that
doesn't use regular HTML inputs and stuff.

169
00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:55.662
For its value and it's just expecting
you to get an on change and

170
00:10:55.662 --> 00:10:57.576
do your own fetch or whatever.

171
00:10:57.576 --> 00:11:02.121
You could render a hidden input
yourself with the value of that,

172
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.573
whatever that's supposed to be.

173
00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:09.865
So it will be submitted along
with the rest of the form.

174
00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:14.667
So, that's actually a pretty fairly
common solution to this problem as well.

175
00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:17.879
I really liked the button
with the name and value.

176
00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:20.630
And the name intent is just convention and

177
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.724
it's not even a remix convention and
it's a KCD convention.

178
00:11:24.724 --> 00:11:26.788
There you go.

179
00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:33.788
So I've also tried action and sub action.

180
00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:38.400
Intent is my favorite it's my
least hated solution there.
