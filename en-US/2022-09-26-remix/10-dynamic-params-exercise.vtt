00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.700
Let's go ahead and
start up exercise three.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.326
So node dev 3,
you should be on localhost 4003 now.

3
00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:16.827
And go to the exercise 3,
it''s dynamic params,

4
00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:19.710
and go to the readme there.

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.329
And here we've got some background.

6
00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.596
For most applications,
you don't have just set routes,

7
00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:32.744
you will have a route segment is an ID
of something or some identifier.

8
00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:36.065
In our case, that's the post name,
so if actually click on these,

9
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:37.478
you're gonna get a 404.

10
00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:43.320
That's cuz we're routing
to the /post/slug.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.280
So that's where we're trying to get to.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.302
And so we don't wanna add a route for

13
00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:51.290
each one of these individually cuz
the code is going to be all the same.

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.930
It's just the data that's different.

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.170
And so we're gonna use dynamic
route params for that.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.870
Give a little bit of background into
that and how you do that and remix so

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.325
you can look through that.

18
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:06.923
And then for the actual exercise,
we're going to be implementing that.

19
00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:12.106
We have a new file for you to create and
a little bit edit in our server file.

20
00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:16.124
And then we've got some extra credit for
adding post content actually compiling

21
00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:18.439
that with marked which
is already installed.

22
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.500
And then you're doing
more with TypeScript.

23
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.164
I tried to separate the TypeScript for

24
00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:26.820
those of you who aren't super
into TypeScript all the time.

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.950
So TypeScript,
I tried to make that a separate thing.

26
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.280
And then that's it for this exercise.

27
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.751
All right, let's rock and roll.
