1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.990
Great, then let's get this running.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.787
We're gonna run node dev 1, and
then pop open localhost: 4001.

3
00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:14.930
And this is the Indie Stack,
ta-da, slightly modified.

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.666
But this is basically what you'll get
if you start up with the Indie Stack.

5
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.708
You can log in.

6
00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.830
We aren't doing anything
with auth until way later.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.708
But if you want to, you can log in.

8
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:29.160
There's a user that has been seeded
into the database for you and

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.064
it's cody@remix.run.

10
00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:35.049
And the password is,
you're gonna love this, Kodylovesyou.

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.460
And boom, now it says hello, Kody.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.037
But again,

13
00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:43.020
you probably won't need to authenticate
until the very end of the workshop.

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290
So don't worry too much about that.

15
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.201
So what we're gonna be doing is
we're building a blog, okay?

16
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.550
So we want to have, and
not just a markdown blog where it's GitHub

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.151
files like everybody's been doing,
myself included, for years.

18
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:01.880
But this is gonna be a blog where
you can write markdown, but

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.202
the markdown is saved in a database.

20
00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:07.301
And so you can deploy this to production.

21
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:12.629
And then log in, write new blog posts,
hit save and it's instantly available.

22
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:17.094
No build necessary,
which is kind of exciting these days.

23
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.350
But that is what we're gonna be building.

24
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.500
So the first exercise, we're gonna
build out our first Remix routes.

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.880
I think you have everything that
you need to work on this exercise.

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.580
Like I said, it's pretty quick, so
we won't take a lot of time on it.

27
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.455
But I just want you to get
started on this first exercise.
