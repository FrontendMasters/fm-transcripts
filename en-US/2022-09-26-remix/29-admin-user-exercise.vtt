00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.900
Let's go on to Exercise 10,
the last exercise of our day.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.616
We're gonna note Dev 10 and
that should be on 4010.

3
00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.660
As mentioned, the ND stack sets
up authentication for you.

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.341
And you're more than welcome to dive
into the user model to see how some of

5
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:28.520
the user creation and
password management stuff works.

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.731
As well as this session dot
server which we actually will

7
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.494
be modifying to see how
some of that all works, but

8
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:41.512
we are just going to use what was
generated for us in this project and

9
00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:46.735
enhance it so that we can protect
some of our admin only routes.

10
00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:51.778
So if you open up the readme that will
give some background on protected

11
00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:56.222
routes and things like that,
some explanation on loaders and

12
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.732
actions and
the way that they run concurrently.

13
00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:05.492
And then, I give an example of how to
do a little bit of protected routes.

14
00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:08.584
And, we actually get into
throwing responses and

15
00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.576
why that makes this so awesome.

16
00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:12.778
So you can take a look at that, and

17
00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:17.891
then our exercise we want to protect all
the routes under post admin, so users

18
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:23.740
should not be able to get to those routes
or perform any actions on those routes.

19
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.333
And then in the extra credit,

20
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.720
we're also going to hide any
links that take users over there.

21
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.186
So, we're talking about the server
side which is where you want to put

22
00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.653
the prediction like you
have to have it there, and

23
00:01:34.653 --> 00:01:38.415
then we'll talk about the client side
to enhance the users experience by not

24
00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:40.328
sharing them links they can't go to.

25
00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:45.800
So, that is what we're doing and
I hope you have an amazing time doing it.
