00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.888
So let's move on to exercise eight,
node dev eight.

2
00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:12.290
And this is where we talk about errors.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.598
What happens when there are errors
cuz there always will be errors.

4
00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:21.390
No matter how good you are at coding,
you will create errors.

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
I am sorry to inform you of this but
it's gonna happen.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.350
So remix has built in error
handling capabilities.

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.616
There are two exports that you're going
to wanna know about, error boundaries and

8
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.420
catch boundaries.

9
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.350
And those are all explained in the
background so you can read through that.

10
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.561
And then for the exercise,

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:45.680
we're going to add error
boundaries to a couple of routes.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.236
And in fact, we have one route that is
like a hidden parent route that we're just

13
00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:53.990
getting the default because we
haven't actually specified it.

14
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.520
We're gonna create that file so
we can add an error boundary to that.

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.006
And then we have the extra credit is for
the catch boundaries which are also for

16
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.570
handling errors just slightly different.

17
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.464
So I think that's all
the background that I need to say,

18
00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:14.504
feel free to get started on this and
we'll be back to work on it together.
