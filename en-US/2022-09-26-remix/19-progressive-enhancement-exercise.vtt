00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.483
Who's ready for exercise six?

2
00:00:01.483 --> 00:00:08.897
Me, [LAUGH] great, so
we'll run node dev 6 and

3
00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:13.661
open up exercise six readme.

4
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:18.719
This is what we're gonna start talking
about progressive enhancement and

5
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.584
let me just make sure there's
nothing I need to mention.

6
00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:25.904
I'm just gonna I shout this
out in the instructions, but

7
00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:27.644
I'm gonna mention it again.

8
00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:31.495
There's a hook that you're gonna
be using called useTransition,

9
00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:34.272
there's a hook in React
called useTransition.

10
00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:39.398
We shipped first but
they did like everybody knew it was

11
00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:45.092
gonna be used transition,
we are going to rename this hook.

12
00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:49.189
It will probably be called useNavigation,
I think.

13
00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:54.024
But yeah, just good to know when you're
doing this if you do an auto import,

14
00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:57.361
make sure it's coming from remix,
not from react.

15
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:02.346
Cuz they are completely different in
what they do what they're for and yeah,

16
00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:06.111
it will not work if you're
importing from react for that.

17
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:10.830
Okay, other than that, I think you
should be good with the instructions.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.980
The objective of this one is
to add a loading state so

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.556
that when you click on the Create button.

20
00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:20.249
If you'll wanna simulate a slow
network in your network tab,

21
00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.384
let me show you how to do
that really quick actually.

22
00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:28.108
So, we're on port 4006, go to Post, Admin.

23
00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:31.997
And then, if you go open up your
dev tools in the Network tab,

24
00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:35.450
there should be a way to
throttle your network speed.

25
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.588
So you wanna go to slow 3G,
this is the one aspects of your

26
00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:44.518
application you have zero control over,
isn't that terrifying?

27
00:01:44.518 --> 00:01:49.311
That there's a part of your app you
have no control over at all, yeah,

28
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:51.926
that's what's so fun about the web.

29
00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:56.828
And so yeah, we're going to simulate
a slow network experience and

30
00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:02.074
gives users a nice pending UI,
that's the objective of this exercise.

31
00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:06.940
In addition to that the extra credit
is also to handle a slow network and

32
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.404
that is to enable users to
prefetch the content for

33
00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:15.846
these pages as the users interacting so
that you don't wait until they click,

34
00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:19.910
but you actually can start
loading the data ahead of time.
