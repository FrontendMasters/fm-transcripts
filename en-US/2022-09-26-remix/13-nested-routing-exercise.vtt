00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.339
So we're going to move on
to exercise four now and

2
00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.007
I want you to take a second to write
down your thoughts and everything.

3
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.008
Pause the video so

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.760
you can remember the stuff that
you learned cuz this is important.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.030
And now we're gonna move on to exercise
four, you're gonna be on port 4004.

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.260
And in this one,
let me get myself over there as well.

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.700
Open up the readme, we're gonna
be talking about nested routing.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.040
So, so
far our blog has a list of blog posts.

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.710
Those are all seated in
the database by the seed script.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.206
We wanna actually be able
to write blog posts so

11
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.430
we're going to add an admin interface to
our app so that we can modify what's in

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.380
the database so we can make changes and
write new blog posts.

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.270
So to do that we're going to leverage
a feature of remix called nested routing.

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.419
I gave you a pretty good explainer
here in the background so

15
00:00:56.419 --> 00:01:00.400
I'll leave you to that and
then we can talk about it after.

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.599
And then yeah, for
the exercise we're adding a couple routes,

17
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.700
post slash admin, a post slash admin slug,
and a post slash admin new.

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.870
So those are the routes that
we ultimately want to have.

19
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.137
Well, eventually I don't think we're
actually not adding the slug route yet,

20
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:19.530
that will come later.

21
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.188
But when you're all finished,

22
00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:28.680
your MPX remix routes should print out
the same thing as what we have here.

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920
So you can take a look at that and
compare.

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.760
And again, you'll have to cd into the
directory to run that MPX remix routes.

25
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.070
I give you some JSX because again,
you're not here to learn React.

26
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.960
And yeah, I think we're just gonna
create a couple of files and stuff.

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.390
So yeah, have fun with that exercise four.
