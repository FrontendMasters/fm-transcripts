00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.576
Hello everyone, my name is Kent C Dodds,

2
00:00:02.576 --> 00:00:06.260
and I couldn't be more excited to
be back here at Frontend Masters.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.221
I was here, I should have looked, but
I think it's been about four years since

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.455
I was here at Frontend Masters
teaching classes and

5
00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:19.644
I'm super excited to be back because now
we have Remix created by Ryan Florence and

6
00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.153
Michael Jackson of React Router Fame.

7
00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:25.826
And remix is basically
an evolution of React Router, and

8
00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:30.645
very soon it will be a just Router,
a Remix Router, not just React thing but

9
00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.654
JavaScript thing in general.

10
00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:34.127
So really exciting.

11
00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:40.043
I actually got into Remix because
I rebuilt my website in Remix and

12
00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:46.176
I was just blown away by the power and
flexibility and simplicity and

13
00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:52.190
all of the positive adjectives I
can think of to describe Remix.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.739
It was a joy and
I had a problem because I actually also

15
00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.716
created testing javascript.com and
epicreact.dev.

16
00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:05.974
And I wanted to just keep working
on these, this was my plan,

17
00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:11.401
was just to keep working on this stuff and
improving it, adding new things and

18
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.679
all this stuff but then I used Remix and
everything changed.

19
00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.613
All I want to do is talk about Remix now.

20
00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:21.700
And so, that's what ended up happening,

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.588
actually I ended up joining the Remix
team about a year after Ryan and

22
00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:32.220
Michael had released Remix so that I
could just teach Remix all the time.

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.546
And so currently, I am the director
of Developer Experience at Remix.

24
00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:40.874
I'm responsible for the website, the docs,

25
00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:45.579
the community on Discord,
the conference that we ran this year.

26
00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.050
Really exciting stuff going
on in the remix community.

27
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.826
We open sourced in November,
this last November,

28
00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:56.260
and six months later we had
a conference of over 300 people.

29
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.740
So, it's growing at
an outrageously rapid pace.

30
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.868
And a large part of that is because
Remix is [LAUGH] well, it's amazing,

31
00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:11.506
but it's built on top of React Router,
so people who are using React Router can

32
00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:17.200
iteratively move over to Remix and
get all the the nice awesome benefits.

33
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.869
But yeah, so
that's your little introduction to me,

34
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:25.490
if you want to go a little deeper,
you can go to my website and I paid far

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.388
too much money to get this video put
together introducing myself to you.

36
00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:35.368
And so you can go learn a little bit more
about who I am, but yeah, I just love

37
00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:40.351
teaching people how to build excellent
software, that is my goal in life,

38
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:46.360
is to make the world a better place by
helping people build quality software.

39
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.428
So, let's talk a little bit about,
what we're gonna do, just to

40
00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:57.510
give you an overview of our day today,
we're doing the fundamentals of Remix.

41
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.660
So, whether you've touched
Remix a little bit or

42
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.990
have never touched Remix at all,
this is the place for you.

43
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.488
And I do expect that you have some
experience with JavaScript and

44
00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.496
maybe a little bit with TypeScript,

45
00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:14.400
we are gonna be using TypeScript
throughout this whole thing.

46
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.871
If you haven't ever touched TypeScript
before, then that's a real treat because

47
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:21.310
you're gonna touch it and you'll be like,
my gosh, I love this thing so much.

48
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.172
So, I can't imagine writing web
applications without TypeScript anymore.

49
00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.604
Luckily, Remix actually makes
the TypeScript that you write pretty

50
00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:30.492
lightweight so,

51
00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:33.879
lots of what you look at just kind
of looks like regular JavaScript.

52
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.523
So yeah, a little bit of experience with
JavaScript, a little bit with TypeScript

53
00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:43.960
and a little bit with React, kind of the
prerequisites for being able to take this.

54
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.491
Of course along with that also,
some experience with Node,

55
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:51.950
being able to run commands in
the terminal, that sort of thing.

56
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.058
And most of this workshop
is focused on exercises, so

57
00:03:55.058 --> 00:04:00.040
we'll have lots of opportunities for
you to actually run through the exercises.

58
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.970
While I give you an intro to Remix, I want
you to be getting the workshop set up.

59
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.623
It shouldn't take a ridiculously
long amount of time but

60
00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:10.900
it will take a little time.

61
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.344
So, The Front End Masters GitHub has
a Remix fundamentals repo and so

62
00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:18.100
if you go to that and
then scroll down here,

63
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.079
make sure that you satisfy the system
requirements and then come down here and

64
00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.241
copy this code block for the setup and
then paste that anywhere.

65
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:32.014
I'm gonna paste that into
a terminal in any directory.

66
00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:36.451
So, I'm gonna go to my desktop directory
and yes, that is a bacon emoji,

67
00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:38.611
it's different every time [LAUGH].

68
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:45.105
And we're gonna just paste that in, so
that all, get set up on my desktop.

69
00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:48.393
And this will download and
install a whole bunch of stuff and

70
00:04:48.393 --> 00:04:52.420
we'll just leave that running in
the background while I explain Remix.
