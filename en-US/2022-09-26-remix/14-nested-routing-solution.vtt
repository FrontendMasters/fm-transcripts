00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:05.102
So in Nested Routing, we're just getting
a little taste of it in this exercise,

2
00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:09.286
but hopefully enough to be able to
understand how the conventions and

3
00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:12.914
APIs work so that you can
implement it in your own projects.

4
00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:17.878
So we have a couple of files that
we're gonna create, the admin route,

5
00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:21.207
the new route, and
then the admin index route.

6
00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:24.495
And we'll talk about when each
one of those is gonna be active.

7
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.898
But the first one I wanna change actually
is the index that'll link to all of these.

8
00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:34.018
So if we go to our app routes posts index.

9
00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:38.941
The index routes are basically what
should be on the screen when there are no

10
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.970
child routes.

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.950
If I have no other sibling child routes
that are currently active this is what

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.081
should be rendered.

13
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.426
And so In here,
we're going to add an admin link.

14
00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:52.579
So I'll just say link to admin.

15
00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.018
And just for the fun of it,
we'll add a class name.

16
00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:58.144
Gotta spell it right doesn't
work if you spell it wrong.

17
00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:02.416
Text red 600 and underline that.

18
00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:03.056
Okay, cool.

19
00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:07.911
So we've got an admin we go to blog
posts [INAUDIBLE] we're gonna get a 404

20
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.853
because there is no, well,
there's no post called admin.

21
00:01:11.853 --> 00:01:13.859
But we're also gonna have
a route called admin.

22
00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.470
So you won't be able to have
a post called admin sorry,

23
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.757
gives the our URL structure here.

24
00:01:19.757 --> 00:01:21.683
You could change it if you want it to,
I suppose.

25
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:25.347
But one thing that I wanna call out
here is that this is a relative route.

26
00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:30.486
So if you've been using React Router for
a while, until version 6,

27
00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:35.373
when nested routing became a thing,
you had to construct these.

28
00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:38.903
And so
you'd have to say slash posts slash admin.

29
00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:40.695
And that was kind of annoying.

30
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:46.632
So yeah, now the link is intelligent and
knows where it is in the route hierarchy.

31
00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:48.264
And so it will automatically nest.

32
00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:53.370
Now, of course, we can if we want it
to go to slash admin then you can

33
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.866
do the full route if you want but
we're just gonna do that as a sub route.

34
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:03.739
Cool, so now let's make that sub route,
we'll make an admin.tsx.

35
00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.924
This is gonna be our parent route.

36
00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:08.808
So this is a sibling to the slug.

37
00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:11.943
Because the URL is actually
a sibling to the slug as well.

38
00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:13.043
Slash post slash admin.

39
00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:14.933
We have slash posts slash my first post.

40
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:19.085
So they are siblings, but
this ones gonna be a special one.

41
00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.268
Because it is going to be a parent route,
and

42
00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:24.282
I'll show you what makes it
apparent route here in a second.

43
00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.594
So let me grab this jsx for

44
00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:32.333
our admin will export default
a function called admin route.

45
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.751
By the way, it doesn't matter what you
call it, it's just a react component.

46
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:35.952
So call it whatever you want.

47
00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:40.214
And now we've got all that jsx.

48
00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:41.949
So we've got to load up these posts.

49
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.837
We gotta bring in this link from remix,
run, react.

50
00:02:46.837 --> 00:02:51.244
And then we've gotta a job here to do
that we'll get to here in a second but

51
00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.204
let's get these posts in here.

52
00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:58.235
The posts for the admin route are it's
basically the same loaders we have and

53
00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:02.960
the post listing route because we just
wanna list of posts here as well.

54
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.181
So I'm gonna borrow all of this and
stick it right there.

55
00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:09.644
Now, somebody asked me earlier.

56
00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:13.326
How do you do code sharing
between different loaders and

57
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:17.331
things like that like how big
do your loaders typically get?

58
00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:25.873
And I would say for the most part my
loaders don't typically get very large but

59
00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:29.960
I should say It's just JavaScript.

60
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.135
So you do it however you wanna do it
it's like once you're inside this loader

61
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.892
there's no special hooks or
anything like that.

62
00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:38.550
And that makes a loader, loader.

63
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.225
It's just JavaScript.

64
00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:43.818
So if you wanna share code and whatever,
this is not terse enough for you,

65
00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:48.654
then yeah, you can make a function and
call into that function if you want to.

66
00:03:48.654 --> 00:03:50.252
For me this is plenty.

67
00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:52.432
Also, I prefer function declarations.

68
00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.533
So we're gonna switch that.

69
00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.662
So we've got our loader.

70
00:03:55.662 --> 00:03:56.640
We've got our list items.

71
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.969
Now let's get our posts from
use loader data type of loader.

72
00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.319
And now TypeScript is
telling me we're all good.

73
00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.744
So if I come over here,
now we've got our loaders.

74
00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:10.828
Now, if we click on one of these,

75
00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:15.680
we're gonna get a 404 because this
is taking us to /post/admin/slug.

76
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.229
We don't have a route that matches that.

77
00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.898
So we're gonna get a 404 for that.

78
00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:25.286
So let's see,
what's the direction I wanna take this?

79
00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:28.751
I think, yeah,
we'll create the route first and

80
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.475
then we'll talk about why
that route is not working.

81
00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:34.675
If I get to a point where I'm like
[INAUDIBLE] why isn't it working?

82
00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:36.839
Remind me because I didn't
do this part [LAUGH].

83
00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.284
And I've done this before.

84
00:04:38.284 --> 00:04:42.592
And it took me like, 2 minutes to
figure out why I was messed up.

85
00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:48.868
So we want to have where we're linking to
is slash posts slash admin slash luck.

86
00:04:48.868 --> 00:04:52.870
So we need a sub route,
we need a child route of admin.

87
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.338
So we're going to make
a directory called admin.

88
00:04:56.338 --> 00:05:01.121
And under that is going to
go our $slugtsx file here,

89
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:06.774
except I just remembered we're
gonna get to the $slug later.

90
00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:10.933
Right now what we're focused on is
the index route and the new route for

91
00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:12.214
creating new posts.

92
00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:14.953
We'll get to edit and update, or edit and

93
00:05:14.953 --> 00:05:17.938
delete in a future
exercise of the workshop.

94
00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:20.872
So here we'll make an index.tsx.

95
00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:25.538
So this is what should be displayed at
this route when we're just at slash

96
00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:26.846
posts slash admin.

97
00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:32.906
And so for this one,
it's actually pretty simple.

98
00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:35.900
It's just a link to create a new post.

99
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.664
So we'll make a remix component and
return that.

100
00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:45.613
Let's call this AdminIndexRoute.

101
00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:47.815
And we'll bring in the link.

102
00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:49.943
And then we'll thank our lucky stars for
prettier.

103
00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:50.882
My goodness.

104
00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:54.077
Do you remember what it was
like to code before prettier?

105
00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:55.409
What a joke.

106
00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:56.948
Can't believe we did that.

107
00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:58.370
Yeah, man.

108
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.624
Thank you, James.

109
00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:01.062
Okay, great.

110
00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:02.447
So we've got our index route.

111
00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:07.912
Let's also make the new.tsx
route here as well.

112
00:06:07.912 --> 00:06:09.223
And we'll borrow the jsx.

113
00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:10.075
Yeah, that's [LAUGH] right.

114
00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:13.179
We'll get to the contents of
this route here in a second.

115
00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:21.132
But it's for now just gonna be
new post and new post route.

116
00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:21.771
Okay, great.
So

117
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.532
we've got all of our route files working.

118
00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:26.894
There's one last piece here,
though that needs to be done.

119
00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:33.112
So If I go create new posts,
nothing happened there.

120
00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:37.882
When I'm on admin, I'm not seeing that
thing that links me to create new posts.

121
00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:39.844
So what's going on?

122
00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:42.531
What's going on is admin.

123
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.929
This admin tsx module is a parent route.

124
00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:46.747
It's a layout route.

125
00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:49.797
It's responsible for
laying out its children.

126
00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:51.797
And so that is what this bit is.

127
00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:55.818
We wanna say hey I wanna have
a list of all the posts and

128
00:06:55.818 --> 00:06:59.673
then in my main area I want
to have all my children.

129
00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:01.578
This is where the new form should go.

130
00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:05.966
This is where the editing or
updating posts should go.

131
00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:08.960
This is where my link to
create a new post should go.

132
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.318
And so we're going to use the outlet
component from remix run react,

133
00:07:13.318 --> 00:07:17.095
to say hey remix if I have any
children this is where they go.

134
00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:21.838
And so now we have I create
a new post right there.

135
00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:27.379
And this is rendering because we don't
have any additional segments beyond admin.

136
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:31.481
So this is our index no children this
is what should render that's what

137
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:33.717
the index is no children render this.

138
00:07:33.717 --> 00:07:38.604
And then if we go to create new post now
we're on slash new now we do have children

139
00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:43.434
let me find the route that matches that
one and I'll render that in that spot.

140
00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:45.117
So that is the idea of nested routing.

141
00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:48.326
You have the parent, parent is
responsible for rendering the outlet.

142
00:07:48.326 --> 00:07:50.960
And that's where children
go if their children.

143
00:07:53.323 --> 00:07:56.539
And yeah that's it there's
no extra credit on this one.

144
00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.052
So that is the exercise.

145
00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:03.562
If you want to or
if maybe if you did it we can look at

146
00:08:03.562 --> 00:08:07.200
exercises/04, npx remix routes.

147
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.924
And see the route structure there,
where we have our route.

148
00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:14.621
We actually have had a parent
route this entire time.

149
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:15.827
It's your root route.

150
00:08:15.827 --> 00:08:19.889
Then we have our post log,
our post slash admin and

151
00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.708
then that has two children there.

152
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:24.620
That is the structure of nested routing.
