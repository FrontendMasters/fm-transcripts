WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.756
All right so, excited to
actually get working on code and

2
00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:07.452
stuff and not talking so much but
hopefully you get an idea

3
00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:11.691
of what role Remix plays in the world
of building an application.

4
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:17.103
And yeah, the TLDR is a very large role.

5
00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:18.195
Okay, great.

6
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:22.770
So, this is the Remix
fundamentals workshop.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.090
Let's talk about this a little bit.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.350
I'm using VSCode.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm using night owl as my theme,
and my font is dank mono.

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.850
So, questions that people
always seem to ask.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.891
So there you go.

12
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:37.816
We have a bunch of exercises
in our exercise directory, and

13
00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:42.685
then the final version of those exercises
in the final directory you might

14
00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:46.780
notice there are more finals
than there are exercises.

15
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.600
That's because, we have a couple
of steps in some of the exercises.

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.650
And so, I have you do,
like do this chunk and then this chunk.

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.541
So, there are a couple of neat tools that
will help you go through each one of these

18
00:00:58.541 --> 00:00:59.720
exercises.

19
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.500
But first I wanna show you
where the instructions are.

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.961
So, if you open up the first exercise,

21
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.850
you'll see this is like what
a Remix application looks like.

22
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.081
This is very similar to what
you would come with if you ran

23
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:15.890
the indie stack setup.

24
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.390
In fact, let me show you how
to do that really quick.

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.232
Even though we're not gonna use this.

26
00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:24.755
So, if you run npx create Remix,

27
00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:33.400
Then this is going to install the create
Remix CLI temporarily to your computer.

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.890
And as soon as that finishes after
the install process, here we go.

29
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.430
As soon as that's finished, then you can
just answer the interactive question.

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.650
So where would you like to create it?

31
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.300
My Remix app, that's fine.

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.490
And then it'll give you the options.

33
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.614
If you choose pre configured
stack ready for production,

34
00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:55.070
then that will give you the options
between these three stacks.

35
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.000
These are the official stacks
that are maintained by Remix.

36
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.690
And if you want to learn more,
then you go to this URL.

37
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.460
And I chose the indie stack
when setting up this workshop.

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.114
And I chose TypeScript because I can't
even imagine not using TypeScript.

39
00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:15.562
And then you run the installation,
it will go through the install process and

40
00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:16.940
some more setup stuff.

41
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.506
If you skip the installation then it will
tell you what to do to finish the setup.

42
00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:26.835
And then it has like a user
authentication implemented already and

43
00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:31.330
data models SQLite database,
all that stuff already ready for you.

44
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.230
And just some instructions in
the readme on how to get it deployed.

45
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.680
So that is what we're going to
be using for our workshop today.

46
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.322
So, if you wanted to set up
something kind of like this,

47
00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.360
then you could just run that.

48
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.187
So, in each one of these exercise
directories, we have this readme.md file,

49
00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:53.655
and that is where you're going
to start every exercise.

50
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:59.200
You'll come into here, you'll read through
or maybe skim some of the background.

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.174
I've got links to different things in
here that could be useful to you as well.

52
00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:07.742
And then we have instructions on the
exercise, what you're actually supposed to

53
00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:11.117
do, in addition to what files
you're gonna be working in and

54
00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:14.580
then at the very bottom it has
this elaboration and feedback.

55
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.470
So, an important part of remembering
what you've learned is taking notes and

56
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.970
making note of what you've learned.

57
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.069
So, if you wanna provide me with some
feedback on the workshop that you can do

58
00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.962
that with this link at
the bottom of each one of these.

59
00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:32.992
But the most important thing is that
you're taking notes and writing down what

60
00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:36.915
you've learned, and I have a section for
that at the very top called notes.

61
00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.303
So, you can just put in your
notes whatever you learned and

62
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.510
that's valuable for your learning.

63
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.299
So that is where you find the instructions
is the readme of each one of these

64
00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.158
exercises.

65
00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:53.652
Now, like I said earlier there
are a couple of tools to help

66
00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:57.045
make this a little bit easier for
you, and so

67
00:03:57.045 --> 00:04:02.128
if you open up your terminal and
use node to run these two scripts.

68
00:04:02.128 --> 00:04:05.190
We've got the dev script, so
we say no to dev, and if you just

69
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.794
execute that then it will ask you which
one of the apps you wanna start and

70
00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:11.230
you could choose which one you want.

71
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.285
So, we can hit routing and
it will start that on a particular port.

72
00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.875
So all the exercises run on port 4000, and
then the number of exercise you're on.

73
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.215
So you can run all of the exercises
at once if you wanted to.

74
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:28.265
I don't recommend it because on localhost
can kind of get funny with like cookies.

75
00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:30.725
And it's all the same domain.

76
00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.406
It's just different ports.

77
00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.720
But you can run them all at the same time.

78
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.711
And then if we run node dev and
switch to final,

79
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:42.107
then we'll see that
we'll run on port 5,001.

80
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:44.907
So that's the 5,000 space exercise or

81
00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:49.459
extra credits run on 5,000 plus 50,
plus the exercise number.

82
00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:54.417
And then if you want to skip the selection
thing, then you can actually just

83
00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:59.150
provide the exercise number and
it will just run that exercise number.

84
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.167
So, node run dev or
node dev 1 will run exercise one.

85
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:10.839
And then if you run node dev final/01,

86
00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:15.620
then that will run the final.

87
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.731
Okay, cool.
So, then,

88
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:21.096
throughout the workshop you're gonna be
making changes to code and you might think

89
00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:25.164
that you're like I totally got this,
why is it not working the same way?

90
00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:28.447
They're like what is the difference,
what's the diff?

91
00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:32.740
Well, we have a node diff that will give
you the difference between what's in

92
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.750
the app directory in the final and what's
in the app directory of your exercise.

93
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.574
And so, if we run node diff 1,

94
00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:43.810
then this will give you the diff
between the final and your exercise.

95
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.610
Don't like no cheating.

96
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.400
So, I recommend you only do that if
you're like totally stuck or whatever.

97
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.050
I thought I had it exactly the same but
I don't.

98
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.234
And then of course you can
run node diff by itself and

99
00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:59.690
it will let you do a diff between
any exercise, any folder, whatever.

100
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.251
So, those are the tools that will
hopefully help you as you're working

101
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:07.960
through all this, of course you can ask
me questions and all of that stuff.

102
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.500
I will be happy to answer questions and
stuff as we go.

103
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.900
But I think it's important for
you to know the way that I do this.

104
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.986
I used to do workshops where I would
be like, okay, watch me do this and

105
00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:24.355
I gonna just tune out this thing really
quick and you're gonna basically,

106
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.766
copy what I did, okay.

107
00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:29.720
Or I actually, early, I would just,
okay, you're gonna follow me.

108
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.840
And I found out that because I
already know all of this stuff,

109
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.730
I move pretty fast, and
too fast for people to catch up.

110
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.600
So, then I said, don't follow me, I'm just
gonna do it and now you're gonna do it.

111
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.495
And I realized that that's not
a great way for people to remember,

112
00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:45.870
because they're literally just
regurgitating what I'm saying.

113
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.403
So, what I do now, is I say here's
a problem, deal with it, and

114
00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:53.655
then I just let you go, and I give you
the resources I'm not throwing you out in

115
00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:56.885
the ocean without a life jacket,
I give you a life jacket.

116
00:06:56.885 --> 00:07:01.191
[LAUGH] But I liked you work on it and
struggle with it because that is how you

117
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:04.471
sort of find in your mind,
how this stuff works.

118
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:07.691
And so, then we come back together and
I work through it and

119
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.901
you can an ask me questions as we go.

120
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.391
So, that's how this operates.

121
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.501
We just do this for
every one of the exercises.
