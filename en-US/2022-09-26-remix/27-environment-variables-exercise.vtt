00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
Now, we're gonna move on to exercise 9.

2
00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:10.349
So let's close down this server,
node dev 9,

3
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.900
And close all these, open up 9 README.

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.768
Now, the next two exercises
are kinda go hand in hand.

5
00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:28.668
The reason we're doing exercise 9 is so
that we can do exercise 10, but

6
00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.552
it's a valuable thing to understand and
know with Remix.

7
00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:34.787
And so
it's good to have it as a separate thing.

8
00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:37.033
I'm gonna talk about
environment variables.

9
00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.206
Now, your Remix app, because it has
a server that's actually running,

10
00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:46.297
you can use process.env.NODE_ENV or
process.env for

11
00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:50.153
whatever environment variables
that works for Node.

12
00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:55.229
I think environment variables are
different on different platforms and run

13
00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:01.107
times, but yeah, you can just use whatever
the runtime supports for your server code.

14
00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:04.587
But for client code, if you need
environment variables that get into

15
00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:07.354
the client,
that's what this exercise is all about.

16
00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:12.545
And I give you an example of use case with
actually something I do in my own site and

17
00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:17.837
describe some of the problems that you'll
run into so you can read through that.

18
00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:21.772
I'll give you a convention
that I have been using for

19
00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:27.768
getting environment variables into the
client in a way that is both typesafe and

20
00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:30.201
also pretty straightforward.

21
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.401
And then it is your job to implement that.

22
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:37.674
For us,
we're on the contrived side of things.

23
00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:42.063
What we wanna do is make it so
only the admin email can update posts and

24
00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:43.687
even see that post page.

25
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.249
So we wanna protect some of our routes.

26
00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.501
And so we have an ADMIN_EMAIL
environment variable,

27
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.771
which you'll find in the .env here.

28
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.272
That is kody@remix.run.

29
00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:57.751
And we need this access to both in
the client and on the server, and

30
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:00.170
this is where I say it's
a little contrived.

31
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.618
You typically wouldn't want the admin
email in the client, but yeah,

32
00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:07.179
it's actually not a big deal,
cuz maybe we're gonna add a contact page,

33
00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.672
and it'll show your email anyway,
so no big deal.

34
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:15.336
But this is just how we're going to
do this so that the client can know,

35
00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:20.920
is the current user the admin so
that it can display the right things?

36
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.682
But more importantly, so the server
also can determine, this is the action

37
00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:30.740
that's being performed, is the currently
logged in user allowed to do that action?

38
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.278
So you're gonna be spending a little bit
of time in a new file called env.server.

39
00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:39.348
You'll also work in entry.server and
root.tsx.

40
00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:44.021
In the next exercise, we'll get into
the session.server file to actually

41
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:46.876
implement some of the protections and
stuff.

42
00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:51.413
But right now, your objective is
just to get these environments or

43
00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:55.230
this environment variable
into the client and server.

44
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.983
And then yeah, having TypeScript.

45
00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:02.859
Happy about how all of this
works is the extra credit here.

46
00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.188
Cool?

47
00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:08.244
All right, have fun with exercise 9.
