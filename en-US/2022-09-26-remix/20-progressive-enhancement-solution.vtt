1
00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:01.324
How many of you finished that one?

2
00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:02.084
Did we have time?

3
00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:05.955
Okay, cool, yeah,
I thought it was relatively quick,

4
00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:07.900
there was just lots to read.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.250
So one of the things in this exercise
six is progressive enhancement.

6
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.622
One of the things that I wanted to draw
home is that everything we've done so

7
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.394
far doesn't need client-side
JavaScript at all.

8
00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:26.704
So, in the background here,
I encouraged you to go to the root.tsx,

9
00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:29.318
which we have not looked at so far.

10
00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.796
But this is your component
that's responsible for

11
00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.205
rendering everything between
the opening HTML and the closing HTML.

12
00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.805
So if something doesn't show up in
the body of your HTML, it's your fault,

13
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.485
because you're the one who's rendering
that, remix doesn't touch that.

14
00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:46.625
Remix does give you some
components that you can render

15
00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:50.411
that are built into the compiler and
everything.

16
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.159
But yeah, you're the one rendering it.

17
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.828
So if you don't want JavaScript on
the client, then you just get rid of it,

18
00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:00.365
you're gonna comment out the scripts.

19
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:06.405
And because remix is server-rendered,
then the entire app still works.

20
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:10.480
I can still go to post, I can go,
let's not slow this down,

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.681
we don't need that for right now.

22
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.864
I can go to the homepage,
I can go to the login, all of this.

23
00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:19.249
You'll just notice we're doing full
page refreshes between these, but

24
00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.964
the app works.

25
00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:22.925
That's what progressive
enhancement is about,

26
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.468
a foundation of a functional app, right?

27
00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:31.530
And so many apps today do not function
without client-side JavaScript.

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.796
Now, there are some apps where you
could argue that they probably would

29
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.441
be impossible to work without JavaScript.

30
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.225
And you're probably thinking of
Figma maybe as a good example.

31
00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:45.566
And well, yes, technically,

32
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:51.127
that probably wouldn't work very
well without client-side JavaScript.

33
00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:56.542
It actually is possible,
let me see if I can find it really quick.

34
00:01:56.542 --> 00:02:00.572
Jjenzz, yep, nope.

35
00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:05.375
There it is.

36
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:10.912
So Jenna has done a lot of really
cool stuff with remix, and

37
00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:17.021
she built a Figma that works
without client-side JavaScript.

38
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:21.793
I don't know if I would actually
wanna use this to design anything,

39
00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:26.230
but the point is that you can
actually start with a foundation of

40
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.843
something that works for most apps.

41
00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.599
How many here building Figma?

42
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.330
I didn't think so.

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.368
So most of our apps can mostly
work without JavaScript, and

44
00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:38.212
then we use JavaScript to make it better.

45
00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:44.205
And I'm not just talking about
navigating around these different pages,

46
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:49.721
I'm actually talking about the full
experience, even mutations,

47
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:55.063
New Post, new-post-yo, This is new,
I keep doing that, new.

48
00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:58.682
And dude, totally created.

49
00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:02.663
Now, I can go to my post page, and
there's my new post, and there it is.

50
00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:05.179
Whole thing works,
no JavaScript necessary.

51
00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.463
So that's what we've done so far.

52
00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:10.656
There are a couple of
reasons why this is cool.

53
00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.532
First of all, I would say,

54
00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:17.031
most people probably don't mind
having JavaScript on the page.

55
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:19.654
Most of the time, that JavaScript
is gonna load, most of the time,

56
00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:21.230
the user hasn't disabled JavaScript.

57
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.778
So ability to work without JavaScript by
itself is not all that interesting to me.

58
00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:31.343
Especially, since the user
experience isn't the best,

59
00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:36.292
you're getting full page refreshes and
loading more data than you maybe need and

60
00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:40.532
stuff like that, because you're
reloading the HTML over and over.

61
00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.963
So that part's not what is cool to me.

62
00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:48.500
The cool thing to me is that now that
I do have JavaScript on the page,

63
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.689
I can go to post-admin and
I can go create new post.

64
00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.789
And whether or
not I have JavaScript on the page,

65
00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:02.489
if I'm on a slow 3G network, and
here, let's disable the cache.

66
00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.123
And let's say that I'm just
working on a really slow network,

67
00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:13.026
as soon as this HTML loads,
that really slow network.

68
00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:17.593
I hit Create Post, and
my JavaScript's still downloading, but

69
00:04:17.593 --> 00:04:21.920
I was able to hit Create Post and
the whole thing still worked.

70
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.437
So as important as it is for
us to make our initial page loads fast,

71
00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:31.037
and hydration runs quick and all,
reduce the amount of JavaScript

72
00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:35.245
that we're loading on the browser,
that all is important.

73
00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:39.983
But it becomes a little less
important when your app actually can

74
00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:44.296
still function before
the JavaScript finishes loading.

75
00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:46.829
Because we code split so
efficiently and everything,

76
00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:50.418
you're actually probably not loading
a silly amount of JavaScript anyway.

77
00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:52.715
And yeah, but
it becomes less of a problem.

78
00:04:52.715 --> 00:04:54.580
So that's one thing that I like a lot,

79
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.098
it works before the JavaScript
finishes loading.

80
00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:02.154
But even better than that, what I love
about the no JavaScript functionality or

81
00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:07.284
support, the progressive enhancement
support of remix, is that it is the proof

82
00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:11.903
that you don't need application state
management to build a remix app.

83
00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:14.457
So, I've told you that and
I've said that, and maybe you believe me,

84
00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:15.990
hopefully you believe me, I don't know,

85
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.223
don't just believe me,
you should test it out for yourself.

86
00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:23.167
But this is my evidence that we
can build a full application that

87
00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.418
works without JavaScript.

88
00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:30.637
So how could you possibly say that you
need a state management library for it?

89
00:05:30.637 --> 00:05:34.119
If it works without JavaScript clearly,
there's no state management.

90
00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.052
So I think that's pretty cool.

91
00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.641
There you go, that's evidence.

92
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:43.240
No JavaScript necessary means that
there's no state management necessary,

93
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.133
which is half of the code that you write.

94
00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.334
So you can get a lot more done.

95
00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:52.405
And that's what happened with my side,
I was building this,

96
00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:54.844
I was not planning on user accounts.

97
00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:57.991
I was not planning on
the call Kent podcast,

98
00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:02.159
where you can literally record
a call in your browser, and

99
00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.007
then I get that recording, and
I can respond with my own recording,

100
00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:10.772
and we get that stuck together
in a podcast episode.

101
00:06:10.772 --> 00:06:14.445
I was not planning on doing that, but
I'm like, well, I finished a little faster

102
00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:17.388
than I was expecting, so
let's see how far I can take this thing.

103
00:06:17.388 --> 00:06:21.128
And eventually, I think maybe I'll turn
this thing into [LAUGH] a business,

104
00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:22.308
cuz it's pretty cool.

105
00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:23.620
Would you pay three bucks a month for
that?

106
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.343
I don't know, maybe.

107
00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.552
And so
many things I was not planning on doing,

108
00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:33.919
the blog post recommendations at the
bottom of every one of these blog posts.

109
00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.454
You get a recommendation to three
other blog posts that are related

110
00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:41.873
to what you're reading, something you've
never read before at least recently,

111
00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:44.606
and some other random
thing that's popular post.

112
00:06:44.606 --> 00:06:47.546
It's different every time, you refresh
the page, it's gonna be different.

113
00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:50.321
I just like a lot of different ideas,
like, wow,

114
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:54.748
look at all these cool thing I can do on
top of what I've already done just because

115
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.145
I don't have to worry about
application state management.

116
00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:03.077
So it makes me so much more productive.

117
00:07:03.077 --> 00:07:06.240
So no wonder I joined the team,
because I'm like,

118
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.856
this is all I wanna do now,
because I love this thing a lot.

119
00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:15.571
Okay, so hopefully,
that point makes sense.

120
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:19.349
So we worked before the JavaScript loads,
we work without the JavaScript, so

121
00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.675
why do we have JavaScript?

122
00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:21.595
What's the point?

123
00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:22.948
Why do we put JavaScript on the page?

124
00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:28.554
Because we can make the user experience
better, we can enhance it with JavaScript.

125
00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:32.650
It is not enabled by JavaScript,
it's enhanced by JavaScript, and

126
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.413
the enhancements that
you can make are great.

127
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:41.668
And the mental model is as simple as
full page refresh on every navigation,

128
00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:46.635
but the capabilities are what
our users are expecting, and

129
00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:49.630
that is what makes this so awesome.

130
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.961
So with JavaScript enabled,
and if we slow this

131
00:07:54.961 --> 00:08:00.175
down as a slow 3G network,
I hit Create Post.

132
00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:04.076
And we see that there's
a network request going on, but

133
00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:08.401
the user gets no feedback
whatsoever when they click on that.

134
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:11.724
Well, sort of, it kind of messes up,
because when I click Create post,

135
00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:12.486
then the focus,

136
00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:15.819
it makes it look like something's
happening, nothing's happening.

137
00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:20.800
There's no feedback for
the user that a request is being made.

138
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.799
Without JavaScript,
if I go Disable JavaScript,

139
00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:28.246
we actually have a better user experience.

140
00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:32.510
So what Disable JavaScript does is
it rejects all JavaScript scripts

141
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:37.004
that you're trying to load, so
the browser doesn't load any of those.

142
00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:38.779
So we don't have any
JavaScript on the page.

143
00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:43.204
If I click Create Post now,
we at least get a favicon spinning.

144
00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:46.658
So, what we've done by not
thinking about pending UI

145
00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:51.131
is we progressively enhance with
JavaScript to a worse experience.

146
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.617
What's the opposite of enhancement?

147
00:08:52.617 --> 00:08:58.130
I don't know, it's like we've dehanced
[LAUGH] our experience with JavaScript,

148
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.476
that's nonsense.

149
00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.006
And of course,
none of you would ever do that, I know,

150
00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:05.911
you'd never make a worse experience, you'd
always think about penning UI, and so

151
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:07.460
that's what we're going to do.

152
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:14.266
We'll go into our app &gt; routes
&gt; posts &gt; admin &gt; and new.

153
00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:18.186
And in here, this is all client-side
stuff, so we've taken care of the backend,

154
00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:19.089
that's all done.

155
00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:22.608
All we have to do is on the client,
we need to know when the user has made

156
00:09:22.608 --> 00:09:26.894
a submission so that we can say, hey,
we're creating, this thing is happening.

157
00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:31.055
And because remix is the one managing that
fetch request for us, it's the one where

158
00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:34.639
we're gonna get the information
about transitions that are going on.

159
00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:39.297
Now, transitions are not just for
posting or submitting a form,

160
00:09:39.297 --> 00:09:44.052
this is anytime you transition
between different routes, okay?

161
00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:48.232
So we're gonna get transition
from useTransition.

162
00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:52.832
And again, it's not React,
it is remix-run/react.

163
00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:59.028
And by the way, I should mention,
like I said, we will probably change that.

164
00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:04.046
And if we do, of course, we'll probably
support the old version or whatever.

165
00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:09.034
So we don't break your stuff or we'll have
a code mod or whatever, but in the repo,

166
00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:11.052
I made this CHANGELOG.md file.

167
00:10:11.052 --> 00:10:13.830
And so if eventually that does ship and
that changes,

168
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.817
I will add that note to the changelog.

169
00:10:15.817 --> 00:10:21.015
So hi, folks watching in the future,
just check that changelog to see whether

170
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:25.767
that piece has changed as well as like
the file system routes and stuff.

171
00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:28.055
Okay, so now we have the transition,

172
00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:32.276
the transition is gonna tell us some
stuff about where we're going and

173
00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:35.941
what what's happening,
what is causing this transition.

174
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:42.435
So we're gonna get our isCreating
state from, nice try, compiler.

175
00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:45.830
But actually, transition has a submission.

176
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.347
It may or may not have a submission,
if we're just clicking on a link,

177
00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:49.512
there's no submission there.

178
00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:52.679
The user is not submitting any data,
they're just clicking on a link.

179
00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:55.753
But if they're submitting a form,
that is going to have a submission.

180
00:10:55.753 --> 00:10:58.780
And so we're gonna just say,
we're creating if the transition has

181
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.234
a submission, so
we'll just booleanify that thing.

182
00:11:03.188 --> 00:11:06.762
I know some of you are probably like,
why didn't you just not note that thing?

183
00:11:06.762 --> 00:11:09.397
I'm like, you got to be honest.

184
00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:12.927
Is this more simple than
just Booleaning it?

185
00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:15.607
I don't know, a double bang, I don't know.

186
00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:18.032
I mean, if you wanna save your keystrokes,
that's fine with me.

187
00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:22.360
But okay, so now we know that whether
we're in a creating state based on whether

188
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.729
there's a transition.

189
00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:26.724
So our designer just said, hey,
just disabled the button and

190
00:11:26.724 --> 00:11:30.709
update the text content for the button,
we don't have a loading spinner for you.

191
00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:33.725
But you could render a loading spinner,
you do whatever you want to,

192
00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:35.597
have a little bar that
goes across the top,

193
00:11:35.597 --> 00:11:38.044
because you can actually use
this anywhere in your app.

194
00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:42.575
I could put this in the route
of my app and have a global bar.

195
00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:44.015
You do whatever you want,

196
00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:47.558
because there's only one transition
that can happen at a time.

197
00:11:47.558 --> 00:11:49.799
You can't submit multiple forms at once,
and

198
00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:52.505
we'll talk about that in
the advanced remix workshop.

199
00:11:52.505 --> 00:11:54.632
But for
these navigation based transitions,

200
00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:56.656
you can only navigate
to one place at a time.

201
00:11:56.656 --> 00:11:59.200
Even if you submit over there and
you're like, never mind,

202
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.946
I'm submitting over there,
you no longer have that old one, right?

203
00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:04.803
So there's only one transition,
that's why this is global, and

204
00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:05.932
you can have it anywhere.

205
00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:09.206
Okay, so we'll take this as creating, and

206
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:13.461
we're gonna say disabled if
we are in isCreating state.

207
00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:19.790
And then if we're isCreating,
then Creating..., otherwise, Create Post.

208
00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:25.489
And that's it, put it on.

209
00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:30.035
So yeah, okay,
I'm still on slow 3G, that's good.

210
00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:32.380
So waiting for
the JavaScript to finish loading here.

211
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.065
I don't wanna wait, that's rattling.

212
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:38.584
Okay, now, throttle slow 3G, and
I say, well, whatever, I don't care.

213
00:12:38.584 --> 00:12:41.072
We hit Create Post, we get Creating....

214
00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:44.571
So now, we have progressively
enhanced to a better experience,

215
00:12:44.571 --> 00:12:47.829
we're not doing a full page reload and
all of that nonsense.

216
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:51.349
We are staying on the page,
we're doing a fetch request, but

217
00:12:51.349 --> 00:12:55.955
we've hooked into remix, so remix can
tell us the navigation that's going on,

218
00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:58.821
which is a form submission so
we can say creating.

219
00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:01.285
And that was the exercise,
there's the extra credit.

220
00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:05.894
That's slightly different topic, but
it was not a lot of code changes but

221
00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:09.400
a fair bit of concepts,
hopefully, it all made sense.
