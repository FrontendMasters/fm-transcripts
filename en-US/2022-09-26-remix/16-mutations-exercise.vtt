00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.670
All right, let's go into exercise five.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.045
So we'll run node dev 5 and
that should be on port

3
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:12.300
4005 except I want to be
on the localhost variety.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.770
And then we'll go to the readme in 05.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.790
This is talking about mutations.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.750
So so far we've just been loading data and
that's been pretty okay.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.120
Most frameworks have
that pretty well done.

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.150
I like the way that remix does it but

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.660
it's not really necessarily
the value proposition.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.530
What makes remix really cool is mutations.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.105
And we also talked about [INAUDIBLE] that
also makes [LAUGH] remix really cool but

12
00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.542
mutations is really special.

13
00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:44.083
So we're gonna talk about what it
takes to make changes to your data.

14
00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.593
We've got a bunch of stuff on
the background you can read here.

15
00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:50.040
Some examples of how the mutation API and
conventions work.

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.342
And then for our exercise, we're gonna
be implementing the new.tsx file.

17
00:00:55.342 --> 00:00:59.566
And actually if we go to
app routes posts admin new,

18
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:03.497
I actually filled this out
with a bunch of JSX for

19
00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:07.740
you already because again,
not a React workshop.

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.740
So have a good time with this one and
we actually do have some extra credits.

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.241
So we're gonna talk about error handling
on the form as well as some more

22
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.900
TypeScript stuff too.

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.030
So have a good time with this and
we'll see you on the other side of it.
