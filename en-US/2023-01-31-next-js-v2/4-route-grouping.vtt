1
00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:04.141
So we left off doing some routing stuff,

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:09.629
making dynamic routes and
things like that for our site.

3
00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.346
This is really another cool feature
that the latest version of Next.js has

4
00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.778
when it comes to routing that's
called route grouping or grouping.

5
00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:19.713
Route grouping.

6
00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:21.980
Just call it route grouping
was actually really cool.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.935
So basically let's say we
wanted to create a Next app,

8
00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:31.299
but it was gonna be one app, and

9
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.579
it was gonna be for our marketing site.

10
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.556
So our website.com and
all the stuff there.

11
00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:41.562
But also everything behind
the authentication screen,

12
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.818
everything behind a signing screen, so
the dashboard as well, it's gonna be in

13
00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:49.836
the same app, which is actually something
a lot of people will do Next.js.

14
00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:54.449
But you don't really wanna
like change the URL segment.

15
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.255
Maybe you want it to be
your website.com/about,

16
00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:01.271
you got another one for a slash pricing.

17
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:04.425
You got another one for a slash blog,
within for the dashboard.

18
00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.702
You don't really wanna mount
it on slash dashboard.

19
00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:11.393
If you just wanted to go like to slash
some slug or something like that, right?

20
00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:16.221
How would you do that while keeping
those things kind of separate as far as

21
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.526
like layout and things like that.

22
00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:19.996
Well, that's what route grouping is.

23
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.078
So route grouping allows us
to do something like this.

24
00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.757
So we can go into the app directory,
and we can make a new folder.

25
00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:30.705
And we can do something like parentheses.

26
00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:32.639
So you can say parentheses and

27
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:37.355
we could do something like I don't
know marketing site here like this and

28
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:42.247
then I can go into marketing and then I
can make a new folder into marketing.

29
00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:47.286
I'll call this I don't know,
I'll just call this one home.

30
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.532
This doesn't really make sense but
it's called home.

31
00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:52.467
And then inside of home I'll say page.tsx.

32
00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.520
So I can do that.

33
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.714
Export, default function,

34
00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:04.913
marketing, home like this.

35
00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:06.109
And this is just an example, so

36
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.690
you don't have to follow along
here trying to show you something.

37
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.169
So, if we're looking at this and
we understand how folders and

38
00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.955
names work in Next.js.

39
00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:20.485
Parentheses aside, this should make
a route for slash marketing slash home.

40
00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:22.587
That's what this should make.

41
00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:24.926
So let's see if we actually get that.

42
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:33.285
So if we go to slash marketing
slash home we get a four.

43
00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:37.386
So we actually didn't get that and
that's because this is a group route and

44
00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:41.035
the difference between putting
parentheses around something and

45
00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.529
not is that it's just
ignored in the router.

46
00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.712
So the router's just gonna
ignore that marketing, and

47
00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:51.272
the real route is just gonna be /app/home,
or

48
00:02:51.272 --> 00:02:55.191
I'm sorry, /home,
cuz app is just a folder here.

49
00:02:55.191 --> 00:03:00.206
So it'll just be /home like that and
then we get the marketing page.

50
00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:01.838
So this is great.

51
00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:05.090
When we get to talking about these
things right here called layouts and

52
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.353
stuff like that you'll understand
why you want something like this.

53
00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:12.778
But it's just a great way to separate
your app out based off of different

54
00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:17.453
functionalities like that without
affecting the URL if you choose not to.

55
00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:21.914
So you don't have to keep mounting so many
different segments on the URL because you

56
00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:24.272
have all these different
paths in your app,

57
00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:26.459
you can just like just ignore this part.

58
00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.353
But it needs to be grouped
because they share a layout.

59
00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:33.750
They share the styles, they share these
whatever, I wanna put them together but

60
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.156
I don't want the URL to
be affected by that.

61
00:03:36.156 --> 00:03:38.557
So that's route grouping
is actually quite powerful.

62
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:41.551
&gt;&gt; Questions good?

63
00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:43.675
&gt;&gt; Yes.

64
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.364
&gt;&gt; What controls or
protections are in there for

65
00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:49.337
collisions in this case
because theoretically,

66
00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:53.954
I could now set up a folder called home,
just in the root of the app directory.

67
00:03:53.954 --> 00:03:57.849
And now there's confusion
about which home did you mean.

68
00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.222
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

69
00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:02.135
So if we did this, we put home in here.

70
00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:03.520
Let's just say this is the route one.

71
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.748
And then we go back here and
we say this is the nested one.

72
00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:15.652
So, if I run this,
you can see I get the nested one.

73
00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.039
And the reason is cuz
that was the first one.

74
00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.177
So the first one's gonna win here,
so yeah,

75
00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:23.347
you have to be very careful about
how you handle those collisions.

76
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:28.106
So in their documentation they
recommend like, yeah, just be careful.

77
00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.899
Because yeah, you will run into this.

78
00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.869
It's just like any other route or if you
did this in express the same thing will

79
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:38.040
happen you have, if you did app dot get
slash and express three different times.

80
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.230
The first one is gonna hit because that's
the first one that was registered.

81
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.982
So it's the same way.

82
00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:46.419
So you just have to be careful about that.

83
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.822
And it's not as obvious cuz it could be
like, you got to take an account like this

84
00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:53.607
is not in the URL, so
you have to think about that.

85
00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:54.202
Okay, cool.

86
00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:57.654
So what we wanna do now is just
kind of set up the routes for

87
00:04:57.654 --> 00:04:59.426
our app that we're making.

88
00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.218
And especially just like I said,

89
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:04.994
something like a patients about yourself,
maybe you have your blog,

90
00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:09.616
you have a way for people to contact you,
there's a form, and that's basically it.

91
00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:10.881
So let's set up the routes for that.

92
00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:14.169
So we need our homepage,
we need a blog page,

93
00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.681
we need a blog post page, and
then we just need a contact page.

94
00:05:18.681 --> 00:05:19.770
So let's set those up.

95
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.851
So we probably have most of those already.

96
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:23.571
I'm gonna get rid of the about here.

97
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:29.191
I have my blog, I have my blog page,
I have my BlogPost page here,

98
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:34.314
and then the last one is gonna
be the contact and then index.

99
00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:36.885
So we have index,
I just need to make a contact one.

100
00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:42.963
So I'm gonna make a new folder,
I'm gonna call it contact, like that.

101
00:05:42.963 --> 00:05:45.089
And then what file do
I need to put in here?

102
00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.915
&gt;&gt; Page.

103
00:05:45.915 --> 00:05:47.598
&gt;&gt; Page, exactly.

104
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:50.078
It's gotta make a page.

105
00:05:50.078 --> 00:05:52.634
Page.tsx do that.

106
00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:56.180
And this is the contact and
well, we'll fill that out later.

107
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.077
It's not so important.

108
00:05:59.077 --> 00:06:01.438
JSX is not so important,
that's just react.

109
00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:06.268
Cool.

110
00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.098
Okay.

111
00:06:12.098 --> 00:06:15.657
Yeah, if you refresh too
fast you'll get that error.

112
00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.118
All right.

113
00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:21.894
So we got that,got out route set
up you can always go back here if

114
00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:26.763
you want to check them out but
again it's just the index blog blog

115
00:06:26.763 --> 00:06:31.563
slug title whatever you want to
call it and then a contact page.
