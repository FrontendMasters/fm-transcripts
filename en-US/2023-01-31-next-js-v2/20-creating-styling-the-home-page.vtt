1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.310
Here comes the final challenge.

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.866
Now that we've learned all there is to
know about getting started with nextjs,

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:10.422
we're going to attempt to build our own
blog/personal website as quickly as we

4
00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:12.940
can, and tying all those things together.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.971
So, follow along with me.

6
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.395
So, what we're gonna do is
already have something for

7
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.830
us here on GitHub,
you can follow along with me there.

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.559
So I'm gonna go to that,

9
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.490
which is intro nextjs-app.

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.803
There we go, all right,
so I'm gonna go there.

11
00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.293
And you can check out
the blog-start-branch.

12
00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:43.716
So the blog-start-branch is pretty
much what we get when we started at

13
00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:47.537
the beginning, which is like what next
Create App gives us when we scaffold it,

14
00:00:47.537 --> 00:00:50.980
but I just taking away all that stuff,
so we can just make our own thing.

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.082
So please, clone, fork,
pull that down locally, and

16
00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.070
that's where we're gonna start.

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.287
What we're gonna do now is
we're going to walk through and

18
00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:02.580
try to build small scale apps,
it's not gonna to be crazy.

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.639
We're not gonna use a database or
anything like that.

20
00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.458
It's just gonna try to combine
all the skills that we did.

21
00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:10.390
There's no right there's no wrong,
follow along, interpret however you want.

22
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.370
And I'll kinda narrow it along the way.

23
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.944
So as a starting point,
clone this repo here,

24
00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.838
which is basically just what you would
get if you did create Next app and

25
00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:22.361
then deleted all this
stuff that it created?

26
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.460
This is basically what this is.

27
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.012
So, let's do it.

28
00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:29.154
Let's follow along and try to make it out.

29
00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:35.500
All right, so first thing first is
we have our homepage route here.

30
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.991
It just says hello,
we have our layouts here.

31
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:40.810
It's not really doing anything,
and then we have this head tag.

32
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.720
So first thing is let's
create our new routes.

33
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.912
So we'll make a folder here for,
let's just say for

34
00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:50.064
a contact form or something like that.

35
00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:55.455
And then we'll make another folder
here for blog, where our blogs go.

36
00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.259
And inside of here we'll
make another folder for

37
00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.890
all of our blog posts
that we'll use slug for.

38
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.376
And inside it there we'll make a page.tsx.

39
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.700
And then for the blog itself,
we'll make a page.tsx for all the blogs.

40
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.987
So we got all of that.

41
00:02:14.987 --> 00:02:17.980
And for the contact,
we'll need a page.tsx as well.

42
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.530
There we go.

43
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.700
So we got all of our pages Yes, save that.

44
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.886
Thank you.

45
00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:27.818
Let's start with the homepage.

46
00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:31.554
So the homepage, homepage is where
you just talk about yourself,

47
00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:33.970
show off your profile, things like that.

48
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.062
So we'll just keep
something like a full page.

49
00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:37.740
Just talk about ourselves.

50
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.766
This is me, this is what I do.

51
00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:40.653
Here's some links to my projects.

52
00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:41.773
Here's my blog.

53
00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:45.591
Here's how you can contact me, and
we'll just link off into that, right?

54
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:46.136
Now, so let's do that.

55
00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:50.430
So we have this div here,
we'll make another div.

56
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.530
And the way that I'm thinking about doing
is just like making it full screen, and

57
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.585
just say, hey, this is my name,
here's my blog, here's how you contact me.

58
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:00.151
Basically keeping it super simple.

59
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:05.297
So we'll do that, I'll put that div there,
this will be here before

60
00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:11.082
our name This will be for like our blog
and this will be for like contacting us.

61
00:03:11.082 --> 00:03:12.334
So, nothing crazy.

62
00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:16.320
Something like that.

63
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.142
Obviously, this isn't gonna look good,
so we got to add some styles.

64
00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:20.110
Let's get some styles in here.

65
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.463
So we could just use Global styles,
but that'd be gross.

66
00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:28.960
I don't wanna use Global styles
to just style this one page.

67
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.695
So we'll make a module.

68
00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:33.818
So what we can do is, for the module,
we can put it in the app directory,

69
00:03:33.818 --> 00:03:35.500
we can put it in the styles directory.

70
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.304
There's no wrong here.

71
00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:40.121
I'm just gonna keep everything in
the styles directory cuz I don't like

72
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.007
cluttering up stuff.

73
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:42.172
There's nothing wrong here.

74
00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:43.754
You can do whatever you want.

75
00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:45.629
So I'm just gonna say home.module.

76
00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:53.540
.css, and I always make a thing for
the home.

77
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.752
I'm gonna say this is height

78
00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:05.160
100 vh, width 100 vw.

79
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.011
Background, [SOUND] black, like dark mode.

80
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.095
The screen hurts my eyes.

81
00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:16.842
[LAUGH] We'll do that, and
then we'll go into our page,

82
00:04:16.842 --> 00:04:19.093
and we'll import those styles.

83
00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:24.813
So we'll say import those styles [SOUND]

84
00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:31.059
from [SOUND] styles/home.module.css.

85
00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:39.777
And we'll just add them here
ClassName=styles.home like that.

86
00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:45.777
Now we go check it out, see what broke.

87
00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:46.760
We gotta reset that build.

88
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.472
Go back here.

89
00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:54.597
Here we go.

90
00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:56.799
And obviously we need a reset here.

91
00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:00.160
So let's get a reset in here.

92
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.390
We'll just make one from scratch.

93
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.288
Inside of our global, we'll just say,

94
00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:12.805
body, html, margin: 0px.

95
00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:14.179
padding: 0px.

96
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.530
And it will import that
global in our layout.

97
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.916
[SOUND]
Just like

98
00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:31.892
that, cool.

99
00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:38.109
And they're still some funky CSS thing
going on there, but that's totally fine.

100
00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:40.455
All right, so got that.

101
00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:41.714
Got our page.
Obviously,

102
00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:44.573
add some more styles to the home module.

103
00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:48.831
Let's just make sure that the color
is white for the text, so

104
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.510
we can actually see it.

105
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.728
There we go.

106
00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:56.726
And then what we'll do is
we'll say display: flex,

107
00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:03.623
justify-content: center,
align-items: center like that, easy.

108
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:14.360
And then we'll just say this Hi,
or it lets us do it.

109
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.213
Keep it semantic [SOUND] Scott Moss,

110
00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:22.293
something like that.

111
00:06:22.293 --> 00:06:24.887
Super excited, there we go, look at that.

112
00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:27.155
About to get a job already.

113
00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:28.911
That's my name.

114
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:31.870
And you can say, check out my blog.

115
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.420
So this is gonna link to our blog.

116
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.671
So what do we need to link to our page?

117
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.277
&gt;&gt; Link component.

118
00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.844
&gt;&gt; Link component, yeah.

119
00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:46.773
So Link, and
this will be Check out my Blog.

120
00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:51.404
[SOUND] And then we can

121
00:06:51.404 --> 00:06:55.766
say href to where?

122
00:06:55.766 --> 00:07:00.430
&gt;&gt; /blog
&gt;&gt; /blog, exactly.

123
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.143
There we go.

124
00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:03.300
So we got that.
Check out my blog.

125
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.246
And yeah, there's no component there and
so it died.

126
00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:10.943
We have to make a component here,
but the link works, sweet.

127
00:07:10.943 --> 00:07:13.566
And then for a contact,
pretty much the same thing.

128
00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:16.949
We can grab this and
we can say, contact me.

129
00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:27.599
Hey, Boom, so we've got our links.

130
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:28.631
They look ugly, but

131
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:32.098
that's the whole point,
we wanna give off that hacker news vibes.

132
00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:34.222
So that's [LAUGH] what we're trying to do,

133
00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:38.183
that's the whole point It makes us look
like we know more than we actually know.
