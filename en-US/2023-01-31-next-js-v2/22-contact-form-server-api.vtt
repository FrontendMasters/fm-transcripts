1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.476
Let's do this contact form here.

2
00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:02.698
So for the contact form.

3
00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:06.502
We're going to do the mutation
because it's a form so we have to post

4
00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:10.774
somewhere so we're going to make an API
that receives some input to post to so

5
00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:14.344
we can create that form and
we can record people contacting us.

6
00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:15.352
Right so.

7
00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:16.251
Let's do that.

8
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.833
So inside of our pages directory
I'm actually just going to delete,

9
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:25.731
I'm in pages slash API, I'm going to
delete this stuff because we don't

10
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:29.887
need it and
I'm going to make pages slash API slash.

11
00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.886
Contact.ts, and

12
00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:37.760
I'm just gonna export default

13
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.204
handler, Like that?

14
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:44.634
Nope.

15
00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:45.369
Why did it do that?

16
00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:46.204
[LAUGH]?

17
00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:47.435
What was that?

18
00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.321
I need a function.

19
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:51.245
There we go.

20
00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:53.477
And it takes a request and a response.

21
00:00:53.477 --> 00:00:58.643
And then I'll just say
if request dot method,

22
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:02.890
triple equals post, it's all caps.

23
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.574
Then let's go to work.

24
00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:08.370
So then I'll say, cool,

25
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.382
this is where you would save to DB.

26
00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:15.510
We don't have a DB, so
we're not gonna save it to DB.

27
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.101
We're just posting to our server.

28
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:21.372
So I'm just gonna respond by
to let him know that, gotcha.

29
00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:25.947
So I'll say res.json message.

30
00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:29.434
Okay, we got it, thank you.

31
00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:32.201
All right, so we are good there.

32
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:36.155
And then inside of our contact form,
let's make that.

33
00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:40.966
We'll just say const or export default

34
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:45.786
function contact Return.

35
00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:50.152
But wait, if we have to do a mutation,
how do we do that in a server component?

36
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:50.816
&gt;&gt; You don't.

37
00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:51.580
&gt;&gt; We don't?

38
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.482
So what do we do with this component?

39
00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:54.629
&gt;&gt; Use client at the top.

40
00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.027
And then-
&gt;&gt; So

41
00:01:56.027 --> 00:01:58.884
turn the whole page into
a client component.

42
00:01:58.884 --> 00:01:59.534
Like this.

43
00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.610
&gt;&gt; Could you do router refresh?

44
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.448
&gt;&gt; If we needed to list the thing
that you just submitted, yeah, but

45
00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:16.898
are you saying, are you suggesting we turn
the whole page into a client component?

46
00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:21.695
&gt;&gt; You could probably actually maybe
put that in like the button itself.

47
00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:24.373
&gt;&gt; You could just do it in
the part that's doing interaction.

48
00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:28.802
There's no wrong or right way but it is
ideal to try to squeeze the client all

49
00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:32.530
the way down to the part that's
actually doing the client thing

50
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.277
versus making the whole page suffer and
haven to be the client.

51
00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:40.370
So I just want you to think about
that exercise, that thought exercise.

52
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.778
But yeah, we'll just turn the whole
page to a client because it's faster.

53
00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:45.797
But yeah, you probably don't
want to do that in production.

54
00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:48.429
So we'll just say cool.

55
00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.365
Now, this is just
the stuff you already know.

56
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:53.022
Guess what you can do this thing.

57
00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:55.944
You remember this?

58
00:02:55.944 --> 00:02:56.663
Look at that.

59
00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:57.591
You remember that?

60
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:58.991
It's still there.

61
00:02:58.991 --> 00:02:59.646
How's that feel?

62
00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.484
Yeah, right?

63
00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:05.296
Okay [LAUGH] so we got that.

64
00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:08.118
Looks good, right?

65
00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:09.159
Gimme your email.

66
00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.146
Actually, it'll just be your string.

67
00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:10.826
We won't need it.

68
00:03:10.826 --> 00:03:11.645
We won't need that.

69
00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:12.156
Cool.

70
00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:24.857
Got that and it's just a form right here,

71
00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:28.837
right, so form on submit

72
00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.774
that's gonna handle submit.

73
00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:34.958
We're just gonna do some thing.

74
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:41.282
Eventually we'll get to that thing and

75
00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:45.688
then got that in there, and

76
00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:50.285
then we just have an input for

77
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:55.458
your email that's required and

78
00:03:55.458 --> 00:04:00.440
its value is email and on change

79
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.055
it's going to just do this.

80
00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:08.824
So set email to e.target.value.

81
00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:14.048
Cool, so we got that.

82
00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:17.056
And then we need a button.

83
00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:23.779
That's type="submit" It says submit.

84
00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:30.918
All right, I was gonna do this
Either prevent that form for

85
00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:35.199
refreshing which honestly
this should just be standard.

86
00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:42.222
And then we can do whatever we need
to do to for our API call here.

87
00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:43.100
So I'll make this async.

88
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.110
Okay.

89
00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:47.757
I will just say fetch.

90
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.611
Which in this case will just
be our URL /api/contact.

91
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.314
I can say /api/contact.

92
00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:00.925
Wait, can you do relative
paths with fetch?

93
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:01.942
I don't think you can.

94
00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:03.624
We're about to find out.

95
00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:07.104
So we'll do that and

96
00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:13.048
then we'll say method 'POST'.

97
00:05:16.963 --> 00:05:21.121
Post up the body,
you gotta stringify it, all this stuff.

98
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:25.002
Email, that type of thing,

99
00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:33.258
I think you also got to set
the headers if you're doing JSON.

100
00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:44.104
Content-Type application/json.

101
00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:48.370
Then accept that, okay.

102
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:55.593
All right, cool, so now we've got that,
we've got our email.

103
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:58.533
All right, oops.

104
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.060
Got that.

105
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.505
All right, so let's try our contact form.

106
00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:10.682
So if we go back home, And let's just put,
did I put a log in the API?

107
00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:12.190
I didn't, let's do that.

108
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:20.461
Select the body there.

109
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:23.444
All right, I misspelled value.

110
00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:24.396
God, I love it.

111
00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:25.611
Okay, let's do that again.

112
00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:30.470
Hello, and there we go.

113
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.235
Submitted our form.

114
00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:36.395
All right, so
other than this looking really bad,

115
00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:42.602
we just made our own full stack landing
page resume in 20 minutes, right?

116
00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:45.094
If you had Tailwind,
this would have been even faster,

117
00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:46.588
it would have been crazy, yeah.

118
00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:49.422
&gt;&gt; I just had just general question.

119
00:06:49.422 --> 00:06:51.798
I can work with Three.js and
stuff like that, React, Three, Fiber.

120
00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:53.232
&gt;&gt; Nice, I love Three.js.

121
00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:58.156
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's fun, but I'm curious,
those have to be client components then.

122
00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:58.715
I'm not sure how that works.

123
00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:04.262
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you bring in,
like, do you use React Fiber?

124
00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:05.133
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

125
00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:09.179
So like when you bring in like,
what's a good example with that?

126
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:13.914
Basically all you have to do is like, when
you bring in like the camera, the stage,

127
00:07:13.914 --> 00:07:16.565
the scene, all that stuff,
you need a proxy.

128
00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:21.562
You'll have to go to like your components
file somewhere and make a component,

129
00:07:21.562 --> 00:07:26.410
call it the same thing as the Three JS
one, and all it does is an empty component

130
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.312
that returns that component and
it has used client at the top.

131
00:07:30.312 --> 00:07:31.247
&gt;&gt; Got it.
&gt;&gt; That's it.

132
00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:35.306
That's why I was like, someone could
literally make a babble plugin that does

133
00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:38.998
that for third party libraries because
that it's gonna be like that for

134
00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:41.294
a while until people
go update their stuff.

135
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:45.051
I think it's gonna be like that for the
next year, probably in the next course,

136
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.038
which will be full stack,
build an app and full stack next JSV.

137
00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:52.938
Two, we will be literally building an app
from scratch so we'll be covering things

138
00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:57.768
like nothing simulated basically we will
be using a real database real server real

139
00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:01.268
authentication like actually
how to sign up and sign out and

140
00:08:01.268 --> 00:08:03.439
how you would do that in production.

141
00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:05.626
Production optimizations
not going too deep,

142
00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.806
because in another course there
will be production grade next year.

143
00:08:08.806 --> 00:08:10.541
Yes.
Where we really go in and

144
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:13.466
fine tune everything to like,
work for a huge app.

145
00:08:13.466 --> 00:08:15.533
And yeah, we'll be doing it from scratch.

146
00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:18.492
So we'll have a conversation around
it everyone will be following along.

147
00:08:18.492 --> 00:08:22.891
And hopefully you build something that
you're proud of, because my goal in that

148
00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:25.997
course Is to actually make
something that you look out and

149
00:08:25.997 --> 00:08:29.036
you're like, wow, this looks good,
it feels good and

150
00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:32.618
you use it as a reference to build
out anything else in the future.

151
00:08:32.618 --> 00:08:36.735
It's like it's gonna be your go to
reference app because it does use

152
00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:37.900
realistic stuff.
