>> What to do from here, well, definitely take the next course, which will be full stack V2. And then following sometime later, we'll have update to the production course when some of the more production things get standardized. But until then, I highly recommend checking out beta.nextjs.org, which is the documentation for Next.js 13.

[00:00:20]
It doesn't show you pretty much everything that I talked about here, but it tells you the why behind it. I've learned so much about React and then tensions behind the creators and what they do with this app directory. Well, with server components and client components, the philosophy, different mindsets, just from reading this documentation.

[00:00:42]
So, I highly recommend going here. And you can see on the left, some things that are grayed out that they haven't figured out yet, right? Cuz it's still kinda in beta, for instance, deployment. It's kinda like it works, but we don't know a way to recommend it to you yet.

[00:00:57]
And different things like I talked about the template and I was like, don't really use it. That's why [LAUGH] in all different types of things like accessibility, AMP, CMS Forms, MDX, SEO, it's all you can use it. They just don't have opinions they fall in love with so hard that they recommend it to you yet.

[00:01:18]
But you can still do this stuff yourself, you don't have to wait for someone to give you the way to do it. You can just do it yourself and whatever works for you works. But I still highly recommend checking this out. If you go to the one page specifically on here which is, if you click on the app directory roadmap, it talks about all the features that were added and from what.

[00:01:39]
And so you can see all these server components that came from React 18, client components React 18, shared components? What's that? It's work in progress, I don't know, it's gonna get crazy. Streaming, suspense, all these stuff. So you can just click on each one of these to get a instant rundown on which each one of these are, and where they are.

[00:01:59]
If they were implemented, for instance, this was not implemented in React, so they can't use it yet. Cache only in server components so you can kind of see that's a really good reference. And you just click on each one of these and it'll take you to the section that talks about it.

[00:02:13]
So everything that I've talked about today, this is the appendix for it. I highly recommend checking it out as a reference to get going. And then from there, if you follow along on this app, I know I went super fast. But I highly recommend just trying to just build something, you don't have to use real stuff.

[00:02:30]
The full stack course, if you take that, we'll do that, but just try to get a little more familiar with it. Try to break it, try to see what happens if you do this, if you do that. That's actually gonna help you when you try to break things.

[00:02:42]
Cuz it helps you understand what this framework is trying to do, what the intentions of the framework are. And that's usually how I learn, I go in and just poke it until it's like, stop. It screams at me and I'm like, okay, that's how you work, I got it.

[00:02:56]
Cuz sometimes it's just, who wants to read source code all day? You can just poke this thing until it screams at you. So that's kinda how I work. So that's my recommendation, and then just stay up-to-date on what's coming. Vercel, the company behind it, tweets a lot of stuff.

[00:03:09]
They have a really great DevApps or developer relationship team that tweets about this stuff all the time, so check them out.
>> But yeah, I would say those will be the next steps for the ambitious folks who are looking to get a leg up on Next.js.
>> Thank you.
