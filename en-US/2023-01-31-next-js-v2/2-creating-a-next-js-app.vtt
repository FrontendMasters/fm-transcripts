1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.937
Okay, so let's get started,
let's make a Next App.

2
00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:04.128
Enough talking, let's write some code.

3
00:00:04.128 --> 00:00:08.275
First thing I'm gonna do is actually,
I'm gonna open up my other terminal.

4
00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.439
This terminal here is called Warp.

5
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.766
It's actually really cool if
you've never heard about it, but

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.140
it's not really a good one for
this type of stuff.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.636
So I'm just gonna open up the,
what do I use other than this?

8
00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:21.658
I think I use iTerm.

9
00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:22.466
There we go, okay.

10
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:26.157
Make this bigger.

11
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.519
There we go.

12
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.451
All right, so

13
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:35.590
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
use this tool called create-next-app.

14
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.391
So create-next-app is the same thing
as every create whatever app that's

15
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:45.276
out there, it makes an app that's already
got all the default stuff for you.

16
00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:50.903
In order to use Next.js 13, we had to
add some of these tags like @latest,

17
00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:54.904
and then we have to pass
this flag experimental-app.

18
00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:57.539
So I'm just gonna copy this.

19
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.740
And I'm gonna go into
my code directory here.

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.572
And I'm just gonna say npx.

21
00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:09.948
And I'm just gonna say,
create-next-app@latest --experimental-app.

22
00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:13.353
And it's gonna do that.

23
00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:16.093
And it's like,
do you need to install these packages?

24
00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:18.504
Yes, I do, install those packages for me.

25
00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:19.512
Give it a name.

26
00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:25.671
In this course, I think we're gonna
build kinda like a personal site page,

27
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:30.389
resume looking,
like your own personal dev site where you

28
00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.490
can show off your projects and stuff.

29
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.570
So I'll just call this my-site.

30
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.154
That's what we're gonna make.

31
00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:42.104
I'm gonna be using TypeScripts, so
if you wanna follow along with me,

32
00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:42.901
use TypeScripts.

33
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:47.846
Highly recommend ESLint,
and let this thing install.

34
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:52.666
Yeah, that's the easiest
way to install Next.js.

35
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:53.711
So take a minute to download.

36
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.148
Well, actually, it's pretty fast.

37
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.718
If you wanna do it manually, though,
I did write down the manual instructions,

38
00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.290
which actually sometimes I do just do
the manual instructions because it's just

39
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.936
out of habit.

40
00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:07.146
I had just done it forever, so
I usually just do it anyway.

41
00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:10.349
There's really only a few
dependencies you have to install,

42
00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.956
which are gonna be these here.

43
00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:16.914
So you need to install next@latest
react@latest react-dom@latest, and

44
00:02:16.914 --> 00:02:19.774
then this eslint-config-next@latest.

45
00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:22.205
Those are the only things you
need to install yourself.

46
00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:26.789
And you just gotta do some setup in
the package.json and the nextConfig.

47
00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.957
And I'm gonna walk you through those files
so you can see what I'm talking about, but

48
00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:31.201
you just gotta set that stuff up.

49
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.416
Cool, okay, so looks like I'm done here.

50
00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:37.640
I'm gonna go to my-site, and

51
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.111
I'm going to open this
thing up in VS Code.

52
00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.138
There we go.

53
00:02:47.138 --> 00:02:53.445
So let's just get a little tour of what we
got here, cuz it's definitely different.

54
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:57.926
So we get our standard every repo stuff,
our git, it's already initialized.

55
00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.792
We got our git, ignore all that stuff.

56
00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:04.065
We got our tsconfig,
which really isn't doing anything special.

57
00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:08.452
Nothing crazy here, but
take a look at if you're interested.

58
00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:09.718
Let's take a look at the package.json,

59
00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:11.247
there's some really cool
stuff happening here.

60
00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:12.585
So, first thing is look at the scripts.

61
00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.131
So, scripts here,
we've got four different scripts.

62
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.492
We have one called dev, that's
pointing to something called next dev.

63
00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:22.893
This is in the next tool
is like a CLI basically.

64
00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:27.710
So, it's basically depending
on what you opt into,

65
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.110
it's either using Webpack or
it's using Rust.

66
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.945
I think it's using Rust now for
their new thing.

67
00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:37.384
So it's like the build system
is obfuscated from you.

68
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.506
You don't need to worry about it.

69
00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:40.302
And that's one of the things
that we'll talk about.

70
00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:43.909
And if you use create-react-app,
it's still using Webpack.

71
00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.084
And there's an eject command you can use
where you gotta bring the Webpack out and

72
00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:50.313
do all this stuff.

73
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.205
Like with Next.js,
I don't think I've ever had to do that.

74
00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:57.677
I've never had to even worry about what
the build system does cuz it just works,

75
00:03:57.677 --> 00:03:59.161
maybe once or twice ever.

76
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:03.218
And I've built, I don't know,
over a hundred Next.js apps so far, so

77
00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:04.093
I don't know.

78
00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:05.795
I don't think I've ever had that problem,

79
00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:08.743
cuz they just do such a good job of making
sure I don't have to worry about it.

80
00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:09.719
It kinda gives you that feel.

81
00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.517
I don't know if you've ever developed
in like iOS or anything in Xcode, or

82
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:17.277
Android even, where you just like,
you just go in and you just hit Build.

83
00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:20.212
And it just works and you don't have
to configure the build too much,

84
00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:21.231
kinda feels like that.

85
00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:26.863
I mean, not quite, but it's the closest
I've gotten to it for React app.

86
00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:27.876
So we got the next dev.

87
00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:31.981
That's what we're gonna run in development
mode so we can start our server locally

88
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.808
and get all the module reloading and
all that cool stuff.

89
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.670
Build is when you go to deploy.

90
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.750
So you build things ahead of time.

91
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.295
And that's because for
a few reasons, right?

92
00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:43.534
Some pages might be static,

93
00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:46.955
some things have to be built ahead of time
that we want to cache, so we build it.

94
00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:50.341
Some data might need to be fetched
at build time like for a CMS, for

95
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.327
a blog post, or something like that.

96
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:54.905
You do build.
Start is like after you build it,

97
00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:56.350
you would run start.

98
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.941
So that's the actual
server that's running.

99
00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:00.150
You will never run that locally.

100
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.728
That's gonna be like some thing you
deploy to that's gonna run that command.

101
00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:07.829
And then lint does exactly what
you think it does, it lint.

102
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:12.387
And then you can take a look at all the
dependencies if you want, but like I said,

103
00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:15.516
the main ones are just next,
react, react-dom, and

104
00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.259
everything else is just
like extra stuff here.

105
00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.803
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Like the carts and horses,

106
00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:25.579
see there's no testing
kind of solution inherent.

107
00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:29.317
Is that something that
Next.js leaves to us?

108
00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:30.600
Is that something we'll cover later?

109
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've thought about this a lot,
and I've talked with the Next.js team.

110
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.454
It's like the next step for them might be
incorporating their own testing solutions

111
00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.672
so it feels like a really
complete framework.

112
00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:45.258
But as it stands right now, no, they leave
it to us, because it is no different from

113
00:05:45.258 --> 00:05:49.339
testing the Next.js framework than it
is like a React thing or React App.

114
00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.626
So they were like, yeah,
we'll just leave that, but

115
00:05:51.626 --> 00:05:53.530
I do think there's opportunity for
them to.

116
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.356
And now if you make a file or
you put it in this folder,

117
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.559
it will run it through this test for you.

118
00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.542
So I think that'd be really cool.

119
00:06:00.542 --> 00:06:04.839
Someone should add that, someone should
fork next CLI and allow you to do that.

120
00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:08.812
So if you want a project to do that,
I'll definitely tweet it out.

121
00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:12.597
But now, you test it the same way you test
any React app, there's no difference.

122
00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:14.935
All right,
let's take a look at a few things here.

123
00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:19.411
If we go to the nextConfig,
couple of things.

124
00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:25.339
One, we create this object here that
says experimental and then appDir true.

125
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.377
So we have to opt in to
the experimental app directory,

126
00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:31.822
cuz at the time of teaching this course,
it is experimental.

127
00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:36.850
Although I did talk with the head of
developer relations over there at Vercel,

128
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.513
the company behind Next.js, and
app directory is not going anywhere.

129
00:06:41.513 --> 00:06:43.943
It's finalized, it's done.

130
00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:46.158
Any change that might happen
are gonna be background changes and

131
00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:47.397
nothing that we'll actually see.

132
00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:49.268
It''s just how they
actually optimize things.

133
00:06:49.268 --> 00:06:51.633
So, although it is experimental right now,

134
00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.695
pretty safe to say this is
gonna be the future of Next.is.

135
00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:59.333
So you guys are literally on
the bleeding edge of Next.js right now.

136
00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.532
Very excited to be sharing that.

137
00:07:01.532 --> 00:07:03.897
Either I'm gonna have some good
opinions in this course and

138
00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:07.112
the Internet's gonna be like, this is
how you do Next.js, or people are like,

139
00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:08.417
what is this guy talking about?

140
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:09.301
This is not how you do this,

141
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:11.431
because I don't think anyone's
teaching this stuff right now.

142
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.366
So I'm super excited and
kinda nervous at the same time.

143
00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:16.090
So we'll see.

144
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.102
And this is just like a comment to help
the TypeScript compiler know that there's

145
00:07:20.102 --> 00:07:24.122
a type in this JavaScript file since you
can't use types in the JavaScript file.

146
00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:27.314
So that's just a hint for
the compiler don't need to worry about it.

147
00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:30.275
And it's just changing the color
cuz my theme picked it up.

148
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:33.235
Otherwise it'll just not be a color.

149
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:38.719
And then we have public, public is just
a folder where you put public assets and

150
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.644
they get served publicly.

151
00:07:40.644 --> 00:07:46.514
So fava con, images that you might want,
those things just get served publicly.

152
00:07:46.514 --> 00:07:49.261
And then we're gonna talk
about the pages and the apps.

153
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:51.572
I'm just gonna briefly
talk about them right now,

154
00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.136
but I'm not gonna go too in depth.

155
00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:58.014
So, let's think about it as app is
where we're gonna put all of our pages,

156
00:07:58.014 --> 00:08:02.430
which sounds weird because there's
a directory called Pages, but

157
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.619
that was the old version of Next.

158
00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:07.868
You can still use the Pages directory and
we'll talk about it more for

159
00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:11.637
in this course, we're going to be using
the app directory for all of our pages.

160
00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:13.658
And in for this course,

161
00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:19.630
the Pages directory is mostly going
to be used for back end API routes.

162
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.175
So you might ask yourself, why is that?

163
00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:22.493
That sounds really weird.

164
00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:24.566
Well, it's because this is a fragment.

165
00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:29.463
This is an artifact leftover from the last
version of Next where they didn't

166
00:08:29.463 --> 00:08:34.601
really know where to put the API folder
once the app folder migration happened.

167
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.703
Because it actually made sense when all
your pages were in the Pages folder to

168
00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:39.558
have the API there,
it actually worked out.

169
00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:41.804
But now all your pages
are in the App folder,

170
00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:44.671
they didn't move the API
folder over to the app folder.

171
00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:47.446
I think that would have been a lot of
breaking changes maybe, or maybe they're

172
00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:49.898
trying to figure out maybe we should
just make a top level API folder.

173
00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:53.335
So they're still creating an RFC for
that on what to do.

174
00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:56.950
So that's why we still have the Pages
folder with only the API in it.

175
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.523
Because that's just what's left over.

176
00:08:58.523 --> 00:08:59.669
It hasn't been migrated yet.

177
00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:00.614
It hasn't been moved.

178
00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:03.833
And it's not so high much of
a priority for them right now,

179
00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:07.777
as they're really working with the React
team to solidify some of these

180
00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:10.555
newer updates to React 18 and
things like that.

181
00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:12.749
But yeah, don't get confused by that.

182
00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:15.753
It's really confusing, sorry.

183
00:09:15.753 --> 00:09:16.842
Any questions?

184
00:09:16.842 --> 00:09:18.077
Yes.

185
00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:22.964
&gt;&gt; So where would the underscore dot app
dot TSX and underscore document dot TSX

186
00:09:22.964 --> 00:09:26.870
files, would that exists in
the App directory then as well?

187
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.383
&gt;&gt; Good question.
So

188
00:09:27.383 --> 00:09:32.896
he's asking about previous versions of
Next.js, you would have an app.tsx file or

189
00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:38.343
a document.tsx file where you can, it's
basically the root of your application.

190
00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:39.649
Okay, we don't have those anymore.

191
00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:40.505
They're gone.

192
00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:43.473
We don't have underscore app,
we have underscore document, but

193
00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:46.557
we do have something that kinda
replaces it and we'll talk about it.

194
00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:49.382
And yes,
it goes in the app directory, yes.

195
00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:52.378
What font and theme are you using?

196
00:09:52.378 --> 00:09:54.774
Man, that's a good question.

197
00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:55.695
How do I see this?

198
00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.774
&gt;&gt; That's One Dark Pro.
&gt;&gt; It always comes up.

199
00:09:57.774 --> 00:10:00.467
&gt;&gt; I don't know, they asked me on Twitter
today and I felt so bad cuz I don't know.

200
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:02.072
&gt;&gt; That's One Dark Pro for
sure, I love the theme.

201
00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:07.823
&gt;&gt; One Dark Pro, darker, and
then my font is Fear Mono, yes.

202
00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:12.967
&gt;&gt; So I have a question about
the fact that the API is included.

203
00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:19.812
How does this impact the ideas
of serverless or microservices,

204
00:10:19.812 --> 00:10:25.149
if people wanna build that
type of architecture?

205
00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:29.933
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, although the API
is included here in this repo,

206
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:33.097
it's actually deployed separately.

207
00:10:33.097 --> 00:10:37.160
So, when you deploy this, each one of
these files here is gonna be their

208
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.914
own service function,
separate from whatever React you wrote.

209
00:10:40.914 --> 00:10:42.326
It doesn't even know about the React.

210
00:10:42.326 --> 00:10:43.145
They're not bundled together.

211
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:44.849
They know nothing about each other.

212
00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:51.260
This is just sugar syntax for
us developers to co-locate our code,

213
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.651
and not so
much affect functionality, yeah.

214
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:57.164
And that's really what
this framework is about.

215
00:10:57.164 --> 00:11:01.467
It's just like the company
behind this framework is

216
00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:05.192
really insane about developer experience.

217
00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:06.963
That's all they think about.

218
00:11:06.963 --> 00:11:08.468
So that's really what
this framework is about.

219
00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:12.359
It's like how do we create something
that's fun for developers to use?

220
00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:15.204
And because of that there's always gonna
be something that feels like magic.

221
00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:17.840
Kinda like when Rails first came out and
it was like, damn,

222
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.394
that thing just generated everything,
that's crazy.

223
00:11:20.394 --> 00:11:21.852
And it felt magical.

224
00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:26.441
Or when Angular came out, and everyone was
doing scope dot this, scope dot that, and

225
00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:29.207
everything was just changing,
and it felt crazy.

226
00:11:29.207 --> 00:11:34.656
Okay, it's like that, but
just on the framework level, yeah.

227
00:11:34.656 --> 00:11:35.924
Yes.

228
00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:43.670
&gt;&gt; So this is, it looks like Express?

229
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.633
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does look like Express.

230
00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:46.399
That's a good question.

231
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:51.475
So that's because for
the most part most platforms that support

232
00:11:51.475 --> 00:11:58.055
service functions in JavaScript, their
runtime is heavily based off of Express,

233
00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:03.231
so, which is heavily based off of
the native HTTP module in node.

234
00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:04.294
So if you go to AWS,

235
00:12:04.294 --> 00:12:08.815
if you go to Google Cloud anywhere that
supports a JavaScript service function,

236
00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:12.685
it's just a function that takes
a request and sends back a response.

237
00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:14.013
And that's it.
So fortunately,

238
00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:17.210
if you've ever used Express,
this is gonna fit right in for you.

239
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.755
Because yeah, it is.

240
00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:24.986
There are some differences and
nuances, but it's 90% the same.

241
00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:25.819
Okay, let's start it.

242
00:12:25.819 --> 00:12:30.956
So if you go into terminal, npm, run, dev,

243
00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:36.107
you should get this, should be on 3000.

244
00:12:36.107 --> 00:12:39.559
Or if you already have 3000
using it'll go to like 3001 or

245
00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.077
until it finds the next one.

246
00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:42.901
So I was gonna go there.

247
00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:44.775
And actually,
I've never seen this new one.

248
00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:45.902
This is sick.

249
00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:48.148
I was always seeing the old one,
this is my first time seeing this one.

250
00:12:48.148 --> 00:12:49.642
This is kinda cool.

251
00:12:49.642 --> 00:12:52.426
I really like the design of this company.

252
00:12:52.426 --> 00:12:57.262
Yeah, so they give you this really cool
landing page here that you can check out

253
00:12:57.262 --> 00:12:58.153
and whatnot.

254
00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.628
And if we want, we can go back and
look at the code, but

255
00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.726
I don't think it's too important
to get too caught up on the code.

256
00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:05.315
But we can take a look at it.

257
00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:10.485
That code for that page is gonna be
an app page dot TSX, get this out there.

258
00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:16.118
And you can see it's once you get
to this component, it's just React.

259
00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:20.062
It's nothing crazy going on here and
this component, it's just React, right?

260
00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:25.956
It's not doing anything If you haven't
seen before, it's literally just React.

261
00:13:25.956 --> 00:13:33.156
Next.js doesn't really influence too
much about how you write your JSX.

262
00:13:33.156 --> 00:13:34.393
It just leaves that to React.

263
00:13:34.393 --> 00:13:37.300
It just kinda helps you with
everything up to that point.

264
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.200
How do you get the routes and
things like that?

265
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.398
So once you start writing JSX,
it's just React.

266
00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:44.269
So not to worry about that too much.

267
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.718
But yeah here's the files for
that, they got some CSS.

268
00:13:46.718 --> 00:13:49.958
I'm not gonna talk about this stuff
right here, the header, the layout.

269
00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:50.684
We'll get there.

270
00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:52.179
If you got questions,

271
00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:56.356
save them for later cuz I promise
I will be talking about those.

272
00:13:56.356 --> 00:14:01.897
But yeah,
that's how you start a Next.js ap.
