1
00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:00.791
How's it going everyone?

2
00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:05.232
I'm Scott Moss welcome
to Intro to Next.js v2.

3
00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:08.476
Very excited to be back here
once again with the folks

4
00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.063
our frontend masters here in Minnesota.

5
00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:14.808
Even though I said I'll probably never
come when it's snowing again, but

6
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:17.668
[LAUGH] here I am and
honestly this time it's not that bad.

7
00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:22.194
I guess that means I've been here long
enough to where I kind of just warmed

8
00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:22.778
up to it.

9
00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:23.842
I'm kinda used to it at this point.

10
00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:24.640
And I dunno,

11
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.588
the snow was a really good break from it
just being dry all the time in California.

12
00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:33.308
So yeah, Intro Next.js v2,
this course is, I mean,

13
00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:37.264
it was always gonna happen, but
I think a really big push for

14
00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:43.219
this course was the recent announcement of
Next,js 13, which was a breaking change.

15
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.189
You know, maybe it's really just a
completely different way of thinking about

16
00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.863
how to make applications in general
not just upgrades to a framework, but

17
00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:52.772
just like upgrades to a mental model.

18
00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:53.428
Really.

19
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.702
There's a lot of changes
in this framework.

20
00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:59.705
So I spent a lot of time building in it,
talking with the folks at Versailles,

21
00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:04.221
talking with the folks working on Next.js,
talking with the folks on the React team.

22
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.307
Just trying to get a good sense of where
the future is for some of this technology.

23
00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:12.828
So I baked all that in, and I'm bringing
it to you all in the form of this course.

24
00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:18.592
So if you don't have any experience
with Next.js, that's totally fine.

25
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:20.296
That's what this course is for.

26
00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.764
All I ask is that you have some
experience with JavaScript and

27
00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:28.864
hopefully you have some experience with a
framework, typically something like React,

28
00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:32.468
because Next.js is based off of
React if you didn't know, but

29
00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:34.373
we'll cover a lot of that stuff.

30
00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:39.300
Okay, so what you can do is you
can go to this URL here if you

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.624
want to kind of look at the notes and
follow along.

32
00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:47.252
The notes are mostly a guide for me to
keep me from rambling up here all day and

33
00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.399
talking about stuff I shouldn't be talking
about because it might be too advanced for

34
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.531
this course or stuff like that,
because I can just talk all day.

35
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.655
So they're mostly for me.

36
00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.776
But if you feel the need, totally look
at this stuff and you can follow along.

37
00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:03.606
But we'll mostly be spending our time in
the editor today, walking through some

38
00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:07.774
examples, trying to build something out of
all the lessons that I'm walking through,

39
00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:11.627
the new techniques and practices and
APIs that we're going to be talking about.

40
00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:13.676
But yeah, if you want that,
you can follow along here.

41
00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:17.016
I'll be having it on screen, so
you can follow along with me if you want.

42
00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:19.369
So I guess a little more about me,
if you don't know me.

43
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:25.398
I've been an engineer for
over a decade now and recently.

44
00:02:25.398 --> 00:02:28.714
And since then, I've done a lot of things,

45
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:33.655
I've started companies,
done open source, things like that.

46
00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.799
And now transitioning over
to being an investor.

47
00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.500
I'm a VC now, but
I still write code all the time for fun.

48
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.293
So it's no longer my day job.

49
00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:44.723
But as you can tell,
I just can't get away from this stuff.

50
00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:45.426
It's just really cool.

51
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:50.673
And a lot of my stuff that I do at my job
is evaluating technical pitches anyway,

52
00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:55.601
so I still see code every day it's just
I'm not always the one writing it,

53
00:02:55.601 --> 00:03:00.235
but this stuff is very interesting to me,
so I like to stay up to date.

54
00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:03.475
But yeah, like I was saying, this next day
ask course, I'm super excited about it.

55
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:07.705
I was telling Mark that there's so
many new things in Next.js 13 and

56
00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:12.292
React 18 that I've just like,
I wouldn't say struggling, but I was just

57
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:16.949
trying to make sure I was finding a way
to Introduced the topics in a format that

58
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.320
would be digestible, for this course
while not getting into the weeds of

59
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.091
like production quality optimizations
that can be saved for something else.

60
00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:27.389
So, if you have questions,

61
00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.243
if you feel like I'm not going deep enough
on certain things asked those questions.

62
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:35.001
And it's probably because I feel like it
was out of scope of this intro course.

63
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.937
So, and also some of these
patterns are still developing.

64
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:44.143
Next.js 13 is still somewhat in beta,
it's still relatively new.

65
00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:47.167
So a lot of opinions and
things are still being fleshed out.

66
00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:51.233
But we could talk about those things and
have discussions about them.

67
00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:55.752
&gt;&gt; What would you say as far as people
taking version one of the course if

68
00:03:55.752 --> 00:04:00.749
they're using prior to Next.js 13,
if they're using Next.js 12 or

69
00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.813
earlier, should they take
the first version of the course?

70
00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:07.126
&gt;&gt; If you are using Next.js 12,

71
00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:12.190
you will probably get better benefit
out early version of the course.

72
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.838
There's a lot of crossover
that we'll be covering here.

73
00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:19.054
But if you want to talk about
specifically just what's Next.js 12,

74
00:04:19.054 --> 00:04:21.158
then I think the first
course might be better.

75
00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:26.811
If you wanna go to 13 and beyond then
you probably wanna watch this course.

76
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:28.959
Yeah, that's how different
those two versions are.

77
00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.909
They're completely different.

78
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.015
And you'll see why.

79
00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:37.057
But like I said, there is some crossover
when it comes to how Next.js handles its

80
00:04:37.057 --> 00:04:38.850
conventions and configurations.

81
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.976
But there's some things that they can't
help because React itself was updated,

82
00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:44.727
so, okay.

83
00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:45.953
Yeah.
So some of the things we'll be covered.

84
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:51.198
Covering creating pages using the app and
pages directory.

85
00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:55.274
If you've used versions of Next.js
before 13, there was no app directory.

86
00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:57.566
There was only pages directory.

87
00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:59.014
But now there's an app directory.

88
00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.718
And it kind of works the same,
but it does not work the same.

89
00:05:02.718 --> 00:05:05.651
It is completely different,
but also kind of the same.

90
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.801
You'll see what I'm talking about.

91
00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:08.386
That's where all the magic is.

92
00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:11.656
But we'll be talking about that and
the differences between them.

93
00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:16.306
Server and client components, how to use
those together, this is one of the biggest

94
00:05:16.306 --> 00:05:20.829
changes introduced to React is this whole
mental model and concept of server first

95
00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:25.220
routing server components which is way
different than server side rendering so

96
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.691
if you ever heard of SSR You
might be thinking like, yeah,

97
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.815
I know what server side rendering is.

98
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:31.775
This is not that.

99
00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:34.511
This is something completely
different than server side rendering.

100
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.814
And we'll talk about that,
but we've gone over it.

101
00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:41.100
Fetching data on the server and
the client side,

102
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.305
which Next.js has had support for
in the past,

103
00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:49.853
using things like get static props and get
server side props and things like that.

104
00:05:49.853 --> 00:05:52.688
Okay, that's gone.

105
00:05:52.688 --> 00:05:54.216
Data on the server side and

106
00:05:54.216 --> 00:05:58.191
then the client side is as you'll
see it's kind of mostly the same.

107
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.326
We'll talk about configuration.

108
00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.329
So how do we get the best out of Next.js?

109
00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:05.333
Up to a point we probably won't get into
like how to optimize for production and

110
00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.222
speed things up and stuff like that.

111
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:10.322
We'll figure out how to at least
tweak some things if we need to.

112
00:06:10.322 --> 00:06:11.814
Styling, that's important.

113
00:06:11.814 --> 00:06:13.812
We can't make apps if
they don't look good.

114
00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:16.595
We've got to make them look just like
those pixels those designers give us.

115
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:20.899
So we'll talk about all the different
ways you can style your components,

116
00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:24.453
which there are some caveats
when using server components and

117
00:06:24.453 --> 00:06:27.064
trying to think in a server-first mindset.

118
00:06:27.064 --> 00:06:31.712
And how CSS interacts on the server
when there is no DOM and all that stuff.

119
00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:35.268
So there's a lot of things you have to
think about and then many, many more or

120
00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:36.504
whatever you guys ask me.

121
00:06:36.504 --> 00:06:38.498
So pretty much.

122
00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.081
Any questions on that stuff?

123
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:41.615
Yeah, Mark?

124
00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:47.770
&gt;&gt; Will you potentially be looking at
edge functions versus API routes at all?

125
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.282
That's a great question.

126
00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:53.057
So I do not plan on covering edge
functions and API routes, but

127
00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:57.267
I can definitely talk about it
because there really isn't that big of

128
00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:59.167
a difference between the two.

129
00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:03.282
So if we get into when we get
into the API functions and stuff,

130
00:07:03.282 --> 00:07:06.844
I'll talk about the difference
between those two.

131
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:12.492
But for the most part, there really
isn't a big difference on the runtime

132
00:07:12.492 --> 00:07:18.050
the different types of runtimes that
Next.js allows you to have because

133
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.177
the code is mostly the same unless
you're doing some crazy stuff so
