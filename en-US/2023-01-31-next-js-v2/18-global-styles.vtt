00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.578
Couple ways to do styling here in next.js.

2
00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:06.080
Actually there's more than a couple ways,
so I'm just gonna go through the two or

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.775
three that I think are the most useful.

4
00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:12.438
There are some other ones that are mostly
meant for like optimizing and production,

5
00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:15.786
so I'll say that for
a production grade Next.js course, or

6
00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:17.245
may be the full stack one.

7
00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.870
But we'll go through the ones that
are like, pretty easy to use and

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.236
then from there, why should try
to run through and like, make

9
00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:28.549
like a little website, see what happens
with all the skills that we just made.

10
00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:35.185
So, global styling, so global style
is exactly what it sounds like,

11
00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:39.575
it's how you apply styles
to your entire app.

12
00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:41.083
It's actually quite simple.

13
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.847
So something you can do
here in the next.js,

14
00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:48.715
repo is we just get rid of those things,
is what I like to do, is I like to create,

15
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.802
I think they might already
have one here already.

16
00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:57.609
They don't like to create a folder
on the root, and call it styles.

17
00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.630
And then I'll make a global file,

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.206
not global, global CSS like that, and

19
00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:11.210
then I'll just add my global styles here.

20
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.045
So, if you don't add this, this one
right here, everyone knows this one.

21
00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:19.292
You're just, gonna be messed up,
this would just be default.

22
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.993
I don't understand why the system
just default in all browsers,

23
00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:23.476
I can't stand it single handedly.

24
00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:27.047
The most destructive thing,
if you don't get right, you will.

25
00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:30.136
Everything is off, so,
if you've ever been like,

26
00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:32.748
why did that padding make my thing,
my box?

27
00:01:32.748 --> 00:01:35.316
30 pixels bigger, yeah, it's cauz of this.

28
00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:40.004
That's why, so do that anyway global,
and then from there,

29
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.359
you just want to find a layout.

30
00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.597
Preferably your root layout,
in this case it will be here for

31
00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:47.503
me in the app directory lay out TSX.

32
00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:52.077
Thanks, and I wanna import it, and
luckily for us, it's already imported.

33
00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.162
They already have a global CSS file here.

34
00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:57.775
So they co-located and when I say they,
this is what we got from,

35
00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.156
the scaffold from create next app, they.

36
00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:03.209
Decided to co-locate the global CSS
in the app directory, which is fine,

37
00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.790
there's nothing wrong with that,
you could totally do that.

38
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.542
Me personally, I find it noisy to
have that global CSS file in here, so

39
00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:12.406
I put it in a styles folder.

40
00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:15.841
You got get the same effect,
there's really no difference here.

41
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:20.440
So, you can leave this here, you can
import it, it doesn't really matter.

42
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.909
The only difference between this and
mine is the path, right?

43
00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.945
Mine would just be, styles, global.

44
00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:34.805
That's it, so, same way,
you just import at the top.

45
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:36.200
You don't need a from.

46
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.635
You just need to import it.

47
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:42.118
And that's because there's, the build
system knows how to handle these files.

48
00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:45.749
It's going to take this file,
it's going to create like, style tag and

49
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.845
inject it in for you and
do all that stuff.

50
00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:51.127
So you just need to do that,
so this is your global CSS.

51
00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:55.702
Pretty simple, and this is the CSS
you would use to like, reset things,

52
00:02:55.702 --> 00:03:00.356
apply global styles, things that
are like are not unique to components.

53
00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:04.467
I wouldn't put component styles in here,
because then they will bleed

54
00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:08.040
on to each other, and
you should be using scoped CSS for that.
