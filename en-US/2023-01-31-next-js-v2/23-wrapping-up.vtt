1
00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:03.297
What to do from here, well,
definitely take the next course,

2
00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:04.745
which will be full stack V2.

3
00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:09.195
And then following sometime later, we'll
have update to the production course when

4
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:12.052
some of the more production
things get standardized.

5
00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:17.392
But until then, I highly recommend
checking out beta.nextjs.org,

6
00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.954
which is the documentation for Next.js 13.

7
00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:26.087
It doesn't show you pretty much
everything that I talked about here,

8
00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.613
but it tells you the why behind it.

9
00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:32.981
I've learned so much about React and
then tensions behind the creators and

10
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:35.206
what they do with this app directory.

11
00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:39.080
Well, with server components and
client components, the philosophy,

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.401
different mindsets,
just from reading this documentation.

13
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.372
So, I highly recommend going here.

14
00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:45.278
And you can see on the left,

15
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.819
some things that are grayed out that
they haven't figured out yet, right?

16
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.701
Cuz it's still kinda in beta,
for instance, deployment.

17
00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:57.728
It's kinda like it works, but we don't
know a way to recommend it to you yet.

18
00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:02.055
And different things like I talked
about the template and I was like,

19
00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:03.478
don't really use it.

20
00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:08.468
That's why [LAUGH] in all different
types of things like accessibility,

21
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.251
AMP, CMS Forms, MDX, SEO,
it's all you can use it.

22
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:16.010
They just don't have opinions
they fall in love with so

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.715
hard that they recommend it to you yet.

24
00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:21.451
But you can still do this stuff yourself,
you don't have to wait for

25
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:22.899
someone to give you the way to do it.

26
00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.633
You can just do it yourself and
whatever works for you works.

27
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.743
But I still highly recommend
checking this out.

28
00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:31.818
If you go to the one page
specifically on here which is,

29
00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:35.009
if you click on the app directory roadmap,

30
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.635
it talks about all the features
that were added and from what.

31
00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:43.707
And so you can see all these server
components that came from React 18,

32
00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:46.736
client components React 18,
shared components?

33
00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:49.394
What's that?
It's work in progress, I don't know,

34
00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:50.736
it's gonna get crazy.

35
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.598
Streaming, suspense, all these stuff.

36
00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:57.159
So you can just click on each one of these
to get a instant rundown on which each one

37
00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.146
of these are, and where they are.

38
00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:02.080
If they were implemented, for instance,

39
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.324
this was not implemented in React,
so they can't use it yet.

40
00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:07.688
Cache only in server components so

41
00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:09.767
you can kind of see that's
a really good reference.

42
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.355
And you just click on
each one of these and

43
00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.378
it'll take you to the section
that talks about it.

44
00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:16.775
So everything that I've talked about
today, this is the appendix for it.

45
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:20.574
I highly recommend checking it
out as a reference to get going.

46
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:25.162
And then from there, if you follow along
on this app, I know I went super fast.

47
00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:28.714
But I highly recommend just
trying to just build something,

48
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.743
you don't have to use real stuff.

49
00:02:30.743 --> 00:02:33.187
The full stack course,
if you take that, we'll do that, but

50
00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.031
just try to get a little
more familiar with it.

51
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:39.236
Try to break it, try to see what
happens if you do this, if you do that.

52
00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:42.114
That's actually gonna help you
when you try to break things.

53
00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:45.516
Cuz it helps you understand what
this framework is trying to do,

54
00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:47.784
what the intentions of the framework are.

55
00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:52.896
And that's usually how I learn, I go in
and just poke it until it's like, stop.

56
00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:56.383
It screams at me and I'm like, okay,
that's how you work, I got it.

57
00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:59.168
Cuz sometimes it's just,
who wants to read source code all day?

58
00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:01.089
You can just poke this thing
until it screams at you.

59
00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.308
So that's kinda how I work.

60
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.768
So that's my recommendation, and then
just stay up-to-date on what's coming.

61
00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:09.800
Vercel, the company behind it,
tweets a lot of stuff.

62
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.371
They have a really great DevApps or
developer relationship team that tweets

63
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.726
about this stuff all the time,
so check them out.

64
00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:18.915
&gt;&gt; But yeah, I would say those
will be the next steps for

65
00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:22.772
the ambitious folks who are looking
to get a leg up on Next.js.

66
00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:23.604
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

67
00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:28.358
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
