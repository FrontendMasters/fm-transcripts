00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.195
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: If we
look at the Network tab here,

2
00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.135
this is actually pretty atrocious.

3
00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:11.319
Because you'll notice, we are now
downloading 3.5 megabytes of image.

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.893
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And that 3.5 megabytes
of image is going to show up even on

5
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:19.496
our tiny browser.

6
00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:21.176
So if we're at iPhone size,

7
00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:25.910
we're still downloading 3.5 megabytes
of image to fill this space.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.120
And that's just no good.

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.070
So in a different app, what you might end
up doing is manually creating a bunch of

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.460
different sizes and writing a bunch
of media queries and having

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.060
to kind of do some art direction there and
figure out exactly what you want.

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.570
If you wanted to do that in Gatsby,
you absolutely could.

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.824
However, we will just do it for
you so that you don't have to.

14
00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:56.240
And the way that we will do that is by
installing a couple Gatsby plugins.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.167
So let's take a look here.

16
00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.770
And we're going to stop our server.

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.423
And we'll do an npm install
of gatsby-transformer-sharp.

18
00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:12.968
Sharp as a third-party library
that does image transformation.

19
00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:19.581
It works in, I think it's like a C binary
or something that Node then wraps.

20
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:23.824
And it's pretty powerful.

21
00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:26.154
It's also kind of a mystery,
I don't really know how it works.

22
00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:29.824
But it's really, really cool in
what it allows us to accomplish.

23
00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:33.867
So then we're gonna use the plugin-sharp.

24
00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:38.978
Now, the difference between
a transformer and a plugin, the plugin

25
00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:44.950
is gonna install Sharp and kinda make
Sharp available to do various things.

26
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.630
The transformer looks for
nodes that are images and

27
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.730
will apply image transformations to them.

28
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.430
So a transformer in Gatsby is
a plugin that looks for data and

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.321
will transform data from
one type to another.

30
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:02.400
It's a really, really powerful model.

31
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.610
And then the other thing that we
want here is we're going to install

32
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.768
component from a third-party that's
called gatsby-background-image.

33
00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:18.708
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
once we get this installed,

34
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.621
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We're gonna hop

35
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.785
into our,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: gatsby-config.

36
00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:26.353
So let's do that.

37
00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:33.922
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we're going to,
first, just add in the transformer and

38
00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:35.081
the plug-in.

39
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.234
So gatsby-transformer-sharp.

40
00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:40.782
No config there.

41
00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:43.096
gatsby-plugin-sharp.

42
00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.750
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Same thing,
doesn't need any options.

43
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.005
And then now we wanna get at our images.

44
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:52.999
And so I'm going to just create
another gatsby-source-filesystem and

45
00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.132
call it images.

46
00:02:56.083 --> 00:03:00.901
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we’ll just
create a folder up here next to our post

47
00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:03.680
that’s also called images.

48
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.534
So let me create the folder,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And

49
00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:15.880
I’m going to move this static image,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Up into images.

50
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.074
So I want it to be there instead.

51
00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:24.137
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And that means that I
no longer need this static images folder

52
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.758
either, so I can just delete that.

53
00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:31.751
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
now that we've got this,

54
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.760
what's gonna happen is Gatsby's gonna
look inside of this images folder.

55
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.924
And because we've got the transformers for
the transformer and

56
00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:44.021
the plugin for sharp,
it's going to do stuff to those images.

57
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:49.061
And that is a really, really powerful
model for us because what it means

58
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.282
is that we can get in here and do some
really cool things with these images.

59
00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:56.840
So let's start our server again.

60
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.174
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
once we get up and running,

61
00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:09.130
because we haven't written any code,
nothing's gonna be happening yet.

62
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.437
But let's jump into the playground.

63
00:04:12.404 --> 00:04:16.907
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And what I'm going
to do is, let's pull up just our images.

64
00:04:19.162 --> 00:04:22.200
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we'll start
by looking at the relative path.

65
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.555
So if I run this, we can see now that
Gatsby is aware that this image exists.

66
00:04:28.555 --> 00:04:29.894
And it can find it.

67
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.149
And that's useful.

68
00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:35.885
We just, through that alone, would be
able to identify where the file is.

69
00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.796
And theoretically,
we could try to bring it in or something.

70
00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:42.350
But that's not super useful now.

71
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.208
But because we've
installed the sharp stuff,

72
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:51.107
we're able to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Where did it go?

73
00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:54.605
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Need to refresh?

74
00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:02.232
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Here,
we can get into childImageSharp.

75
00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:06.586
And childImageSharp is a whole other
node that has all sorts of stuff in it.

76
00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:12.004
So one of the things that we can do
is we can get the original image.

77
00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:16.838
And if I get the original image,
that needs a width, a height and a source.

78
00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:19.504
So I can just kinda get
some data about this.

79
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.811
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so,
we can see, this image is way too big.

80
00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:25.701
We just don't need it to be that big.

81
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.967
But we would be able to
link to that directly.

82
00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:33.872
We could put this in as our source on
the background image and it would work.

83
00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:36.389
But it wouldn't solve our problem
because the image would still be huge,

84
00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.600
it's the original image.

85
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.461
So instead, we're going to use
something called a fluid image.

86
00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:46.226
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And in a fluid image,
we have a handful of options.

87
00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:49.360
We create a base64 encoded
version of the image.

88
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.340
We can do a traced SVG
version of the image,

89
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.870
which is something we're not gonna
get into today, but it's really cool.

90
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.488
You can get the aspect ratio.

91
00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:57.289
You can get its source.

92
00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.443
So if we grab its source,
we can see, okay, that's good.

93
00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:02.919
What if we want its srcSet?

94
00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:08.775
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's grab that,
okay, so now we're looking at cool things.

95
00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.330
All right, here's the original,
there's the big one.

96
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.625
And if I come out here to my localhost and
I just dropped this in,

97
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.989
there's my giant image, right?

98
00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.995
And this is the uncompressed,
full-size image.

99
00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:27.974
But I also have,
here's a 400 pixel version of it.

100
00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:29.586
So I can come back out here.

101
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:32.452
And let's look at this one instead.

102
00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:34.175
And now,
we've got a smaller version of it.

103
00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:37.408
And if we wanna really tiny version of it,
like a thumbnail version,

104
00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:40.049
I can come back out here and
grab the thumbnail version.

105
00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:46.778
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so basically, what
Gatsby's done is it's taken this image and

106
00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:50.495
it's created a whole array of different
sizes for different viewports and

107
00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:53.690
different resolutions, so
that we don't have to do that work.
