00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.546
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm gonna
do a little bit of styling.

2
00:00:02.546 --> 00:00:06.567
I don't know if you've noticed but
I really like writing CSS.

3
00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:09.571
[LAUGH] Set it up to do
some box shadow stuff,

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.070
we're gonna make this display block.

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.770
We also want to set
a little bit of a margin so

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.245
that it's not crammed into anything.

7
00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:24.208
We're going to set a max width of,
let's see 33% minus 1 REM,

8
00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:30.400
so that way it'll take up roughly
a third accounting for the margin.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.678
We then want to make sure that it
doesn't get any wider than 120 pixels

10
00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:38.981
cuz that's where we capped it and
that would cause problems.

11
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:44.092
And then I want to make sure that
when we hover over these that you get

12
00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:49.589
a little bit of a box shadow thing,
so we're gonna transition on that.

13
00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.715
And the way this will work is
we're gonna just set up the focus,

14
00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.937
so if you tab to it or hover,

15
00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:02.591
we will set up a box shadow to be,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: It's

16
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:03.970
kind of a big squishy shadow.

17
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.320
So something that gives us some height.

18
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.077
We're gonna use triple 2s and then
about there is a good capacity for it.

19
00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:13.781
And then,

20
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:18.640
we wanna make sure that it's on top in
case it sits on top of another photo.

21
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.090
So then, having done that,
we need to actually show the photo.

22
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.470
We've just got the the link so far.

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.185
So, come on, all right, I can type.

24
00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:38.779
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So we're gonna set the
image and I need to put a key on this link

25
00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:45.043
so we'll just do the photo ID again for
that since we're mapping over elements.

26
00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:50.752
And then the image is
going to get the fluid

27
00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:55.810
which is going to be the photo.fluid

28
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.862
because remember we spread in use-insta.

29
00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:06.830
We spread the child image sharp which
is what has fluid inside of it.

30
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.660
So fluid is going to be
available at the top.

31
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.226
Then we have an alt tag and
the alt tag is gonna

32
00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:22.194
be the photo caption because Instagram

33
00:02:22.194 --> 00:02:26.720
doesn't give us an actual alt tag.

34
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.690
And we'll add a little bit of CSS in here.

35
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.230
And this is going to be
pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.060
We're going to make it 100% wide.

37
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.810
And we'll make sure that anything inside
of it doesn't have any margin top so

38
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.000
that it stays kinda
where we want it to be.

39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.880
So there's our image, and we should see,
okay, we're getting closer.

40
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.780
Like now we've got images and if I click
on this it's gonna open up Instagram like,

41
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.389
perfect where we were
getting real close here.

42
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.402
So the next thing that we wanna do is,

43
00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:09.167
we wanna make sure that we've got
some styles on the actual wrapper.

44
00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.197
And those will give us
the rest of the story.

45
00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:17.471
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
we'll set this to be display flex.

46
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.680
We'll have it wrap.

47
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
So, flex-wrap is gonna be wrap.

48
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.946
We want to justify the content
with space-between.

49
00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:29.246
Every time I see this CSS property,

50
00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:32.560
I start thinking of
the Dave Matthews' Band song.

51
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.910
And it gets stuck in my head for
the rest of the day and

52
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.780
you're all welcome because now it's going
to happen to you for the rest of time.

53
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.950
We'll do a margin of one REM and then I'm
going to set a negative margin on it.

54
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.340
So we're going to probably call this good,
where we have

55
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.130
Like Instagram images are now
loading from a third party source.

56
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.000
And we didn't have to install
a third party library.

57
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.310
We didn't have to make any API calls.

58
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.940
We didn't have to get API keys.

59
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.700
Now I will say, Instagram is an easy
one because it's public data.

60
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.520
You do usually have to configure your
sources with an API key of some sort.

61
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.881
We didn't do that today because I didn't
want to force everybody to go through

62
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:23.193
a developer login system and
getting API keys and all that.

63
00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:26.894
But for a lot of different API's and
data sources,

64
00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:32.491
you're gonna be required to provide
some kind of credential, which is a good

65
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:37.764
thing because anybody who wants to
shouldn't be able to load your data.

66
00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:42.880
That brings us to the end of
loading third party data.

67
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.160
There's just a whole universe of
things that you can do with this.

68
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.610
We only touched the surface.

69
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.900
This is a pretty straightforward
approach of how you would do this.
