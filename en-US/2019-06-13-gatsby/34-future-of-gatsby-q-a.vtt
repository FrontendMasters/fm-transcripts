00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you mind demonstrating or
just showing us maybe some example

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.517
of Gatsby e-commerce sites or
something with more dynamic data?

3
00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:13.429
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Sure, yeah, so let's
take a look at the Gatsby swag store.

4
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.422
So this is a pretty

5
00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:23.022
straightforward site.

6
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.701
We've got image previews and
other good stuff, and

7
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:32.216
then if I actually want to buy something,
I can come in here, add to the cart and

8
00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:36.660
this dynamic stuff is all
happening asynchronously, right.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.948
Then if I do other things,
edit my cart, all that good stuff,

10
00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.450
then if I go to log in,
we'll use auth0 for the log in.

11
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.246
And when it redirects us back,
it's going to show,

12
00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:57.691
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The login screen.

13
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:01.003
We get to our dashboard,
it shows us our coupon codes,

14
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.400
it shows me how many
contributions I've made.

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.282
And then under the hood, what this
is doing is it's actually taking my

16
00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:13.420
GitHub account and
it's tying it to a Shopify account, and

17
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.914
linking all of that together
through a custom API that we built.

18
00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:21.288
That tracks, are you a contributor,
have you used your Shopify codes,

19
00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:22.240
that sort of thing.

20
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.663
So that the codes are linked to
the person that has earned them.

21
00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:32.156
So that even if somebody who's not
qualified were to go try to use the swag

22
00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:36.090
code, it won't work until you've
actually met the qualifications for it.

23
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.640
And the qualifications for this, just in
case anybody's wondering how to get this

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.580
sweet level two swag code,
is five contributions to the repo.

25
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.100
And those contributions can be anything
from grammar fixes to whatever,

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.440
but yeah, we've got tons and tons and
tons of opportunities to get involved.

27
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.263
We absolutely love to
have people involved,

28
00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:58.873
we have a whole section on contributing.

29
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:03.415
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Where is it?

30
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.193
Up here, contributing.

31
00:02:05.193 --> 00:02:09.540
And we are really, really into this.

32
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.650
So like I said, we do free swag for

33
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.660
our contributors, we offer free
community pair programming sessions.

34
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.285
Anybody who wants to get involved in open
source, you can book an hour of our time,

35
00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:21.610
when somebody from the core team will
jump on with you, work on a project.

36
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.140
The only thing we won't do is
work on commercial projects.

37
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.240
So we're not gonna help you do your job,
but

38
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.370
we will happily help you learn something
that will help you do your job.

39
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.460
We've got a listing of
upcoming community events.

40
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.390
If you're gonna be talking about Gatsby,
please submit an event.

41
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.500
That submission is a contribution.

42
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.875
It'll count toward your free swag.

43
00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:43.770
[LAUGH] We have a site showcase
where you can show off

44
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.610
sites that you've built with Gatsby.

45
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.530
Submitting to the showcase
also counts as a contribution.

46
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.630
So we've got lots and lots of ways to get
involved, we'd absolutely love to have

47
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.950
each and every one of you as
a member of the Gatsby community.

48
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.336
So please reach out to me.

49
00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:01.990
Anything I can do to help,
I'm happy to do it.

50
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.270
Also, I kinda started to answer your
question and then totally took a turn.

51
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.570
Did I show you enough?

52
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.825
Is there anything else that you wanna see?

53
00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:11.938
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No, I think that's fine,
especially with the showcase website.

54
00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:13.656
I can just go check that out.

55
00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:15.666
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
perfect, any other questions?

56
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:19.924
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's next for
Gatsby over the next year or so?

57
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:23.484
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Themes, so
we have been working on themes,

58
00:03:23.484 --> 00:03:26.480
which I am extremely excited about.

59
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.604
So the way that Gatsby themes work

60
00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:36.370
is we have, [LAUGH] there we go.

61
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.180
We've effectively set up a way for
you to do composable websites.

62
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.720
So when you talk about themes,
traditionally you would think about

63
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.750
a WordPress theme,
where it is a collection of templates and

64
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.570
styles, and then you can extend
that a little bit, and that's cool.

65
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.740
What Gatsby themes allow you to do, which
is really exciting, is you can compose

66
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.230
themes together and you can install
multiple themes next to each other.

67
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.180
So you have vertical and
horizontal composition of themes,

68
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.570
which means that if I want to build
a blog, I can install a blog theme.

69
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.170
And then if I want that blog
to source from WordPress,

70
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.700
I can install the WordPress higher
level theme that powers the blog theme.

71
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.140
But then if I want to install
an e-commerce store, I can just install

72
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.490
another theme for e-commerce, and then
a theme for Shopify to pull in that data.

73
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.280
And what that means is that under the hood
you're saying, my Gatsby config is

74
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.790
Gatsby theme Shopify e-COM,
Gatsby theme WordPress blog.

75
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.420
And no other config, maybe a API key so
that you can get the data.

76
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.020
But outside of that,
you don't have to write any code.

77
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.863
Your site wouldn't have anything
in it other than a Gatsby config.

78
00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:54.918
Because the data comes from WordPress, the
e-commerce stuff comes from Shopify, and

79
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:57.708
there is no code to write,
because it all lives in the theme,

80
00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:00.070
which is a dependency that you install.

81
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.701
If you want to eject and override that,

82
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:09.766
that we have the same as we do with
our config in webpack and stuff.

83
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.051
We do the same progressive disclosure
of complexity in the themes as well so

84
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:15.580
that you're able to eject
a single component.

85
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.510
And rewrite it in the theme to make
it look the way that you want, but

86
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.070
the rest of the theme stays intact.

87
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.340
We call that component shadowing.

88
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.660
It's incredibly powerful.

89
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.740
The stuff that people are gonna be
able to do with this is next level.

90
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.930
We've only started seeing people start to
play with this, and they're already just

91
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.450
consistently surprising us with how cool
the things are that they're building.

92
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.730
This is also, I think, where it's
gonna start to open up the door for

93
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.490
people to make and sell Gatsby themes.

94
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.060
Or to, if you wanted to start a business,
like an Etsy style business,

95
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.060
you can build a Gatsby theme for
what an Etsy profile looks like.

96
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.410
And then just stand up multiple versions
of that theme for each customer.

97
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.979
So that it's completely
isolated in sandbox,

98
00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.766
you don't have to worry about
the hosting fees of scaling a business,

99
00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:09.343
the security concerns of somebody being
able to log into somebody else's account.

100
00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:10.676
They're in a completely separate account.

101
00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:12.310
It's a completely separate
instance of a website.

102
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.550
It just looks the same, right?

103
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.850
And so you can build this theme once and
then resell that access to somebody else.

104
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:25.070
So there's a whole new angle for online
entrepreneurship that we see this opening.

105
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.600
And these are just the things that I'm
able to spit ball off the top of my head.

106
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.440
We have so many internal notes and
documents and

107
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.800
discussions with community members
about just the ideas they have for

108
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.610
what this is gonna be capable of doing,
and I cannot wait.

109
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.760
I'm so excited for it.
