00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: My name
is Jason Lengstorf and

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.910
I work as human duct tape at Gatsby, that
means that I do a lot of different things.

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.530
Everything from dev roll to
writing content to writing code.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.850
And I used to work as an architect at IBM.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.300
I live in Portland, Oregon.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.900
And so what we're going to learn today,
Is a bunch of stuff.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.210
But the most exciting thing is we're gonna
learn what Gatsby is and why it matters

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
as a platform and as a tool, and
why it's useful to us as web developers.

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.500
We're also gonna dive into
the Gatsby fundamentals,

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.810
kinda the building blocks of what
makes a Gatsby site tick and

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.190
what makes it different from
just building a plain React app.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.070
We'll dive into GraphQL,
the fundamentals of GraphQL.

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.170
We're only gonna use the pieces of
it that we need to build in Gatsby.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.040
We're not gonna be doing a deep dive into
what GraphQL is or the language specifics.

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.160
We're also gonna get into MDX.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.130
MDX is a way to write React
components in your markdown.

17
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.380
That is a really powerful way to
write content for developers and

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.760
so we're gonna look at how to use that.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.080
We've also got programmatic page creation
which is where you've got data somewhere.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.930
You're able to load that data and

21
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.400
build pages from it without having to
write actual files to house that data.

22
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.730
Then we're going to get into
performance optimization through image

23
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.850
optimization and various other strategies
that Gatsby either does automatically or

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.369
enables with relatively low effort.

25
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.500
And we're going to load third
party data into our Gatsby site.

26
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.250
We'll be loading Instagram data and

27
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.740
showing recent posts from an account
in an interesting component.

28
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.440
And once we get all that done we're gonna
build into play that site to nullify so

29
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.520
everything that you build today we'll be
live on the Internet by the end of this

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300
workshop, which is a pretty
fun way to build Web sites.
