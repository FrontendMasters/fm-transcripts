00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The way that I
want this to look is I wanna show

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.060
the preview to the left and the text,
like the title and excerpt and

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.110
link, to the right of that image.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.850
So if I come in here,
I want the image to live here.

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.200
And that means that I'm
gonna use Flexbox again.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.730
So I'm gonna put the image here,

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.720
and then I wanna div that will contain all
of this text so that I can put that to

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.940
the right of it without having to do
floats or anything weird like that.

9
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.830
So we can come up here to the article and

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.619
I'm going to set the display to flex and

11
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.970
then I'm just gonna

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.890
override this knowing
what I am about to do and

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.510
how that's gonna affect things,
I'm just gonna get rid of that margin.

14
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.143
And then here I want a div.

15
00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:56.885
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm gonna to wrap
that around the whole thing, and

16
00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.500
I think that's everything we needed.

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.133
Let's take a look.

18
00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.970
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Nope,
it doesn't like, yes.

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.680
Because we haven't actually
pulled in our source yet.

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.650
So we need to actually get that.

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.240
And to do that,
we're gonna go into our posts, and

22
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330
we just need to add in the image.

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.163
So I'm gonna get the image,

24
00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:26.437
I'm gonna get the childImageSharp and

25
00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:30.429
get the fluid, and then I want

26
00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:37.165
the Gatsby Image Sharp Fluid_with Webp,
okay?

27
00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:41.440
Let me just verify that I
didn't typo any of that, good.

28
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.890
Yeah, let's play with some settings too,
like let's resize this image and stuff.

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.140
Let's make it square, so

30
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.140
we're going to make our images a 100
pixel by 100 pixel square thumbnail.

31
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.350
And then I want to change
the colors on it too.

32
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.920
So now I'm going to make
it a duo tone image, and

33
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.620
I want the shadow to be this color,

34
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
let's call it, yeah.

35
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.106
663399, and then I'm going

36
00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:18.696
to set the highlight to be this DDBBFF.

37
00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:24.806
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So I've got my fluid
call and I'm able to just kind of set some

38
00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:29.206
things on here, what I want it to
look like,and upon doing that,

39
00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:32.490
that's going to give me back this image.

40
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.990
And then I just need to come back
down here and, let's also name this.

41
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.780
I'm gonna alias this to sharp
because it's just easier to type.

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.930
So then I need to grab the image out.

43
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.570
And here we go for a matter image, right?

44
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.279
So now we've got our post,
whenever we do the static query,

45
00:02:55.279 --> 00:03:00.225
we're also going to get image data back
for the post, which means that in the post

46
00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:05.331
preview now I have,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Post

47
00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:08.220
image sharp fluid.

48
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.410
Because again, I did,
discket becomes the post

49
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.195
and then we set it to
post ImageSharpFluid, so

50
00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:24.870
when I drop this in here, I'm gonna
have to stop and restart the server,

51
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.310
cuz we just changed the Graph 2.0 query.

52
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.180
And let me fix that warning real quick,

53
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.760
because we stopped using link in index,
and I just don't want that to be,

54
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.120
we're not using that anymore,
so we can drop that out.

55
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.030
So now when we go to our post preview.

56
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.910
When we reload.

57
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.180
Okay that's closer but
that's definitely not right.

58
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.980
Like this is kind of a big mess.

59
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.230
So let's figure out what I did wrong and
I'll tell you

60
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.830
I set this to be 100% as opposed
to 100 pixels, so there we go.

61
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.430
So by setting this to 100 pixels,
now we have these kind of

62
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.410
dual tone images set up
that are displayed here.

63
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.380
And again, like we didn't have to do
any image processing, we didn't have to

64
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.040
add a whole bunch of extra stuff,
we just use Gatsby's built-in performance

65
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.020
optimizations to load these images in
a way that is better for performance.

66
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.830
And if we look at the sizes on these,
these images are, they're not huge.

67
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.477
But you can see, too,
what we're actually setting out,

68
00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:42.480
we've got the sizes,
the source that gets set up to

69
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.770
everything from 25 pixels
wide all the way up to 4,

70
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.080
032 pixels wide, cuz apparently,
that's how big the original is.

71
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.040
We have a fallback source.

72
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.000
We have our alt set, and then it does some

73
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.650
kind of art direction stuff with
the picture and all those good things.

74
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.550
And what that means is like that's
how we get the web [INAUDIBLE]

75
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.190
All this is just being done
under the hood for you.

76
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.520
That's what Gatsby Images is built to do.

77
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.970
And if we look at the size,
these images are 2 kilobytes

78
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.140
as opposed to being whatever, however
many megabytes they were as originals.

79
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.205
Plus we go to do some
cool art direction and

80
00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:23.928
kinda make it sort of matchy matchy
with our header, which is really cool.
