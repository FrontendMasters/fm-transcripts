1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I think we're
ready to build ourselves a header, so

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.430
we're gonna create a new file for
this cuz it's got a little bit going on.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.427
So we can just go ahead and hop into our
components folder and create a new file,

4
00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:13.786
we're gonna call this header.js.

5
00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:18.878
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
we're gonna do another react component, so

6
00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:21.270
let's import react from react.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.397
And this time,
we're gonna use a styled component,

8
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:27.604
so we're gonna import
styled from emotion/styled.

9
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.988
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
we're also gonna use the CSS props, so

10
00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:34.814
I'm gonna important CSS
from the emotion/core.

11
00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:42.469
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And let's also import
link because we're gonna be linking

12
00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.715
between our home and
about pages in the nav bar, so

13
00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.280
we're gonna import that from gatsby.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.408
And then to start, we will do our header,

15
00:00:55.408 --> 00:01:00.056
so the const header is going to just

16
00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:05.196
be,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: A header

17
00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.840
element like we saw it here.

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.798
And this one is going to take some links.

19
00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:16.728
And so the first link that we wanna do,

20
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:22.060
if we just kinda comment this out,
we wanna do like a site name.

21
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.090
Like the where we are,
kind of the branding for the site, and

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.010
then we wanna add navigation.

23
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.350
And so to do that we need nav links,
but we wanna style these links and

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.520
I don't necessarily want to apply
a CSS prompt to every one of them.

25
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.298
Which means, we wanna use what's
called a styled component.

26
00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:47.810
So I'm gonna create something called nav
link, and this is gonna be a styled link.

27
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.049
And so in doing this, I'm basically saying
like, I wanna use this component, but

28
00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.220
I wanna apply styles to it.

29
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.972
And I can do that by let's say,
I want to set the color, so

30
00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:06.414
I don't want it to be standard link color,
I want it to be like the triple 2s.

31
00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:10.521
I want the font size to
be the default font size,

32
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:15.255
we want the font-weight to be,
let's say, normal.

33
00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:23.240
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we want the line
height to be 1 because this doesn't occupy

34
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.320
any more vertical space than it needs to.

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.340
We don't want these to be
stuck right on each other so

36
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.820
we're gonna give them a little
horizontal breathing room.

37
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.700
But only on the right so that we'll have
to override this a little bit later on.

38
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.950
And so that it's easier to click,

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.640
we're gonna add a little bit of
padding to make the click area bigger.

40
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.150
And we're gonna remove the underline.

41
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.059
So in doing that,
now I can come down here and I can say,

42
00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.437
let's do a NavLink for Home.

43
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:05.510
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And this is
going to be a link to the home page.

44
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.080
And let's tell everybody what we're doing.

45
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.300
We're doing a Frontend Masters workshop.

46
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.330
And so I, before we go any further, let's

47
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.570
actually get this showing on the screen so
we can see our work and mess with it.

48
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.800
We're gonna default export to header.

49
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.679
Once we've exported the header,
I'm gonna come back over here and

50
00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.310
I'm gonna import it.

51
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.920
Let me collapse this so
we can see what we're doing.

52
00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:37.143
So I'm gonna import
the header from header, and

53
00:03:37.143 --> 00:03:41.827
then I’m just gonna drop
it in right here instead.

54
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:44.599
And so now, you can see,

55
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.491
we’ve got our workshop
is right at the top.

56
00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:51.850
And so, this is good,
we’re getting closer.

57
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.740
Let’s style up this header
a little bit more and to do that,

58
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.322
we're gonna use the CSS prompt.

59
00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:08.410
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And I'm gonna use,
let's do like a light colored background.

60
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.200
And so
I can save each of these steps as I go.

61
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.958
Now we can see we've got our
light colored background there.

62
00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:18.500
Let's add a border bottom
to really set it off.

63
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.460
So we'll do a one pixel
solid border of triple D.

64
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.698
That'll give us just a little
bit of definition down here.

65
00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:31.602
Then I'm gonna make it display flex and
the reason for that is that I want to put

66
00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:36.290
the header on the left and the text on
the right, or the links on the right.

67
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.610
Actually, lets hold off on that,
I'm gonna leave that out for now.

68
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.140
And lets build the nav so
we can see how this actually affects it.

69
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.340
So we're going to use a nav component.

70
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.270
And this nav component is
going to get a CSS prompt,

71
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.480
because we just wanna
remove that top margin.

72
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.490
I'm gonna let prettier do the work for
me here.

73
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.670
So I'm just gonna say
the margin top is zero.

74
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.400
And when I save this, it is going
to fix all of those things for me.

75
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.124
So I'm gonna add a nav link to the home

76
00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:18.717
page and,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: That's what I want and

77
00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:20.144
I can say, home.

78
00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:23.630
And then I'm gonna add
one more to the about.

79
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.299
And we'll say, about and
now when I save these,

80
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.790
you can see we've got kind of
some stacking, it's not ideal.

81
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.940
So let's turn this display flex on.

82
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.570
Okay, so that's better but
still not great.

83
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.547
So to fix that,
let's do a justify content and

84
00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:51.490
we'll set space between.

85
00:05:54.293 --> 00:05:56.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, now we're
getting there, we're cooking with gas.

86
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.190
And finally,
we'll set a little bit of padding here.

87
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.930
So I want this to have
some vertical padding.

88
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.180
And then we're gonna do some CSS wizardry,
copyright Harry Roberts.

89
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.230
This is a little bit of Math
in CSS which is super fun.

90
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.410
So what I want is, I don't want to
add a rapper div around my header.

91
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.441
So instead, I need to find a way

92
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:34.474
to set my width to be either 90

93
00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:39.518
vertical width or the 550.

94
00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:41.961
Which means that we've gonna do some math.

95
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:48.461
I'm gonna do a 100 vertical width,
minus 550 pixels so

96
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:54.219
a 100% of the screen
minus 550% of the screen.

97
00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.610
And then I'm gonna divide that by 2.

98
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.522
And so this now,
gives us half the padding we need so

99
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:05.971
that it stays the right whip.

100
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:08.611
Neat, right?

101
00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:12.439
[LAUGH] And that's the end of the workshop
you've learned the most important thing

102
00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.669
you needed to know today.

103
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.560
So what's cool about this is, it gives us
the ability to kind of set this stuff up

104
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.460
and not have to add a bunch
of extra markup into the DOM.

105
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.590
I really enjoyed that and
wanted to kind of share.

106
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.720
So a couple things are left to do here.

107
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.900
We don't know which page we're on.

108
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.290
So as I click,
I can't see what's going on.

109
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.720
And I wanna be able to see that, right?

110
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.230
So we need to be able to set what
things are and like what they're doing.

111
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.600
So I'm going to up here.

112
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.820
I want a way to say that
something is the current page.

113
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.010
And so if you've used SAS or
any other kind of nested CSS,

114
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.710
you might have seen this before.

115
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.050
This Ampersand means like this element and
then I'm adding a class to it.

116
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.070
So when this element has the class
current page applied do extra things.

117
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.000
And the extra thing that I'm gonna do
is I'm going to set a border bottom

118
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.800
of two pixels solid and
we'll use the triple two for that.

119
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.830
And then that means that down here,

120
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.200
I have to tell it how to be,
how to use that class.

121
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.960
So I’m going to set a prop down here.

122
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.120
And this is a prop that
Gatsby just accepts.

123
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.070
So when it’s active,
you can set an active class name.

124
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.141
And we're gonna set that
to be current page.

125
00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:46.170
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so
now we can see, hey, that's cool.

126
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.320
That's what we wanted.

127
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.817
And then I'm also wanting to set

128
00:08:55.492 --> 00:08:57.174
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: One of these to bold,

129
00:08:57.174 --> 00:09:00.351
and so
I want the home link to be bold, but

130
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:05.580
I don't necessarily wanna
just add a CSS prop to this.

131
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.616
So we're gonna use something pretty
cool that CSS and JS allow us to do,

132
00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:12.054
which is using props to determine styles.

133
00:09:12.054 --> 00:09:15.987
So I'm going to set a prop down here,
of font-weight.

134
00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:19.850
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
I'm gonna set that to bold.

135
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.194
But, what I want to do, is up here,

136
00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:28.918
so that's not just gonna work,
but what I can do is up here,

137
00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:33.148
I can look at the
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: At the props, and so

138
00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:36.690
I can just create a template string and
add in a little function.

139
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.450
So I'm gonna look at my props.

140
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.376
And then I'm either going to
use the props.fontweight,

141
00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:46.100
or I'm gonna send back normal.

142
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.780
And what's really cool about that is
that it allows us to kind of configure

143
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.080
our components,
to be a little more flexible.

144
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.130
So I'm basically saying like,
do it bold when I tell you to otherwise,

145
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.410
default to normal.

146
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.250
And if I wanted to set it to be a really
light font weight or something,

147
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.480
I could do that as well.

148
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.750
But so this is a,
that's a pretty powerful way to do that.

149
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.660
And with that being said, I believe we
are pretty much ready to rock on this.

150
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.280
Let's see if I, yeah I think
we're in pretty good shape here.

151
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.840
We've got ourselves a header, that
header is consistent across the pages.

152
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.605
Looks like I've got a couple little margin

153
00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:39.416
issues that I guess I can deal with.

154
00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:40.810
Let's deal with those.

155
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:46.378
And so the way that we would do this is we
would just subtract that padding width.

156
00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:55.322
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
now that you can see,

157
00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.965
pulled it back just
enough to make that work.

158
00:10:57.965 --> 00:11:02.863
And then over here, we've got straight
margin, so I'm also going to add

159
00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:08.550
a last child or I think last of type.

160
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.710
So we're gonna use the selector and
we'll do last of type

161
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.728
and we'll set the margin-right to 0.

162
00:11:21.728 --> 00:11:24.871
And that way-
&gt;&gt; Student: You got a typo.

163
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:26.589
It says last of type.

164
00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:28.925
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Laste, last of type.

165
00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:31.924
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: There we go.

166
00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.072
So now, that margin is gone, so

167
00:11:34.072 --> 00:11:38.447
that when we do have text that runs
the full width, you can see that

168
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:43.420
the right edge of these blocks lines
up with the right edge of the item.

169
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.280
So that's what we want.

170
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.900
We're in good shape here.

171
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.300
With that,
we are done with styles for now.

172
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.720
This is kind of, gonna be the global
style sheet that we'll stick to for

173
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.100
everything else that we do.

174
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.320
If you are wanting to jump ahead,
you can check out

175
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.399
Step One, Styles, and
you'll be where we just ended.

176
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.950
So next,
we're going to dive into graph ql, and

177
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.630
we're gonna build some content from data
as opposed to just hard coding things.
