00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.360
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yes.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just wondered about you've
got each post in its own subfolder.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.320
Is that necessary for the MDX thing to-.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: No,
so anything that you

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.870
put into this post folder
will get pulled out in red.

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.770
The reason that I'm doing this is because
later on I'm gonna add images and

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.850
I would like to have the images for

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.140
a given post in the same folder
as the post that uses them.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.719
It's much easier for me to keep track of,
and also I'm gonna show you a little

10
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.298
convenience thing that Gatsby does when
we get there that every time I see it,

11
00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:41.570
it just makes my heart smile.

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.790
Yeah, go ahead.

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, in this instance
you have one type of post.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.140
What if you wanted multiple post types?

15
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.360
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yes,
if you had multiple post types,

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.220
you would end up writing
a slightly different query.

17
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.250
So for example, you might end up saying,

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.050
let's say we wanted all file
where we would filter and

19
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.410
say that we want the source
instance name to be posts.

20
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.170
And then this is where gets really
powerful because now we can say child or

21
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.740
nodes and then child MDX and
then front matter and

22
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.570
title, and so, where'd I do wrong?

23
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.927
Source instant, no, needs to be equals.

24
00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:31.360
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: That's
the wrong button.

25
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.120
This is the right button.

26
00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:34.655
Go away.

27
00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:41.550
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: There, so
this is where we're kind of displaying

28
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.634
a relationship where we're
looking at the files.

29
00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:48.190
And do you remember when
I said that we set a name

30
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.790
on our Gatsby config to be post?

31
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.880
We're basically saying give
me everything named posts.

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.140
So if you wanted to create another
one that was called recipes or

33
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.900
docs or whatever,
like whatever you wanted to create,

34
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.523
you could create another folder or
even have a sub folder in here.

35
00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:11.680
A pattern I see is content/post,
content/docs.

36
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.170
And then instead of doing path posts,

37
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.580
you can do content/posts and
then this is named posts.

38
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.420
In that way you're able to kinda
filter down to just what you need.

39
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.870
Does that make sense?

40
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so
it would just be in your, in the query.

41
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.920
You wouldn't have to change
anything in your config.

42
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.440
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Well, yeah, you would.

43
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or
would have another section?

44
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.420
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yeah,
you could just duplicate this and

45
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.700
say this one is docs, and this is
gonna point to a folder called docs.

46
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.489
And then you'd be able to query for
the source instance name of docs, and

47
00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.653
that would pull up anything
in the docs folder instead.
