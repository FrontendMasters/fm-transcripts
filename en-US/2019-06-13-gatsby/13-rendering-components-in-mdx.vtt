00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: MDX, it doesn't
actually stand for anything I don't think.

2
00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:07.605
The way that React used JSX
which gives you the ability

3
00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:12.339
to write HTML inside of
your JavaScript templates.

4
00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.235
MDX is a way to enable using React
components inside of mark down.

5
00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:22.422
So it's sort of a riff on JSX is MDX.

6
00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.374
And so
what we're gonna do is build a page, and

7
00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.843
then once we get that page built,
and we're reading MDX, we're also

8
00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:34.495
gonna write a React component and
kinda play with what MDX is capable of.

9
00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:38.420
So to start, we're gonna stop our
server if we haven't already, and

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.961
we're going to install some dependencies.

11
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:49.028
So we need to get gatsby mdx
not at symbol just gatsby-mdx.

12
00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:54.867
And then we also need mdx-js/mdx and

13
00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.791
mdx-js/react.

14
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:03.193
So these are the pieces that we're gonna
need to install to get MDX up and running.

15
00:01:03.193 --> 00:01:04.475
So let's go ahead and do that.

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.987
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We're going

17
00:01:14.987 --> 00:01:20.868
to get into our Gatsby config, and
we need to configure gatsby-mdx.

18
00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:26.333
And to do that, I'm gonna add in,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Another component.

19
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.721
And so up till now, we've been including
all of our plugins by just name because

20
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.833
none of them need any configuration.

21
00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:35.763
Gatsby-mdx requires a little
bit of configuration,

22
00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.808
cuz we gotta tell it what's going on.

23
00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:42.355
So what we're gonna do is
we're going to say we're

24
00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:47.347
resolving gatsby-mdx and
this is a shortcut for this.

25
00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:48.824
Resolve gatsby-mdx and

26
00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:52.906
just typing out the name of the plugin
are functionally equivalent.

27
00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:56.690
The reason that we're doing the resolve
here is because we also want to pass

28
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.986
in options, and that's gonna be an object.

29
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:03.241
And the option that we
want to pass is what

30
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.382
layout do we wanna use in our MDX files.

31
00:02:07.382 --> 00:02:10.965
We wanna be able to use this header and
shared footer.

32
00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:19.341
So I'm going to set up a default,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Layouts option.

33
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:25.126
And I want the default one to be,
we're gonna use require resolve so

34
00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:29.504
that we get the path name,
the absolute path name.

35
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:35.469
And we're gonna get source,
components and layout.

36
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.124
And so this is going to give us
any MDX files that we load will

37
00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:43.557
be loaded into the layout template for us.

38
00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:46.054
So we don't have to set that up or
deal with it.

39
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:54.805
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Then,
we're going to just create an MDX file.

40
00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:59.941
So in pages, I'm gonna create a new
file and let's make this a contact page.

41
00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:03.612
And instead of a JS,
I'm gonna call it contact.mdx.

42
00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:10.749
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then inside of it
let's just tell people how to contact us.

43
00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.987
So let's say,
let's see you can get in touch with

44
00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:18.790
me,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: By opening the nearest

45
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.372
window and yelling out of it,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Real loud.

46
00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:30.282
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let me turn on
text wrapping so that you can see.

47
00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.437
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
I'm gonna save this.

48
00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:42.276
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so then,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm gonna run develop,

49
00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:46.453
and assuming I didn't typo anything,

50
00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:50.005
it's just gonna boot up, okay?

51
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:56.089
And now, I should be able to visit
a contact page, there we go.

52
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.821
So now that we've installed the plugin,
the plugin is looking for

53
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:01.762
MDX files in the pages directory.

54
00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:05.754
And anything that we add
there is just gonna work.

55
00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:11.614
And one immediate advantage here
is that there's no ceremony here.

56
00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:16.388
If we want to add a heading and
a paragraph

57
00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:21.176
tag,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: There's a lot of extra

58
00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:26.467
setup in a React component
that just goes away in here.

59
00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:29.194
But what if we wanna add
some kind of interactivity?

60
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:32.264
That's the whole reason of using MDX
is because we wanna do something.

61
00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:36.088
So I want to create a way for
people to wave.

62
00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:40.011
So I want somebody to be able
to wave at me from my home page.

63
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:43.369
So let's build a component to do that.

64
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:44.964
So let's go up into our components.

65
00:04:44.964 --> 00:04:49.499
We're gonna create a new file, and
we're gonna call this wave.js.

66
00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.886
And this one is gonna
be a React component,

67
00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:54.085
we're gonna use a little bit of state.

68
00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:58.813
So we're gonna use the use state hook,
and react.

69
00:04:58.813 --> 00:05:02.081
We wanna be able to style this up a bit,
so

70
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.456
let's do the css prop from emotion core.

71
00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:09.631
And then I'm gonna call
this component wave.

72
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.049
It's not gonna take any props.

73
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:18.792
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then down here,
I'm going to export default wave.

74
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.654
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So inside of this
component, we wanna do, basically,

75
00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:27.932
the goal of this component is I want
somebody to be able to click a button and

76
00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:32.359
it will tell them that they waved, and
I wanna know how many times they wave.

77
00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:36.422
So we wanna keep track of how many waves
have happened, cuz really what I'm looking

78
00:05:36.422 --> 00:05:40.331
for is I want people to be yelling out
the nearest window and doing this, right?

79
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:42.492
So that's what we're going for.

80
00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:50.710
So let's, let's set this up we're
gonna do waves and set waves.

81
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.756
And that's going to equal use state, and

82
00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:57.334
by default they have a wave,
so the number is 0.

83
00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.367
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then we're
also gonna set up some labeling here.

84
00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:07.866
So I wanna be aware of whether or
not we need a plural version of waves.

85
00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:13.871
So let's set up a label, and
that is going to be template train,

86
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:16.776
and we'll use the wave emoji.

87
00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:22.834
We did use emoji actually
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So

88
00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:27.412
you've got the wave emoji, and
then I'm going to set in the waves.

89
00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:34.372
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then depending
on whether or not waves equals 1.

90
00:06:34.372 --> 00:06:41.546
I'm going to either say wave or waves.

91
00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:46.965
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
that's my label component.

92
00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.667
So now that we've got that,
I can just send back a button.

93
00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.319
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: My button
is going to hold the label.

94
00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:00.741
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then I'm gonna set two props on this.

95
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.807
The first one is gonna be some styles.

96
00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:08.088
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
the styles that I wanna send our,

97
00:07:08.088 --> 00:07:09.999
let's just make this noticeable.

98
00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:14.449
So our background is
gonna be rebeccaPurple.

99
00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:21.013
And our border is none, so that we get
rid of the defaults borders that happen.

100
00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:24.062
We'll make the color white so
we have enough contrast with the text.

101
00:07:24.062 --> 00:07:28.995
And lets make the text just a little
bit bigger so we'll do 1.2rem.

102
00:07:28.995 --> 00:07:31.814
And the next prop that we need
is gonna be a click handler.

103
00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:34.659
So once somebody clicks this button,
what happens?

104
00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:42.234
So let's set an onClick and we will tell
it to set the waves, 2 waves plus 1.

105
00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:49.342
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
so this is our component.

106
00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:52.801
It is set up to track
the number of clicks and

107
00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:56.272
tell us how many times somebody has waved.

108
00:07:56.272 --> 00:08:02.921
So to use this we can just go
back into our MDX component.

109
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:07.911
And I'm going to add a new section for
this.

110
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:13.407
Let's have an H2 say or
you can wave to me,

111
00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:20.144
just click this button to
simulate a friendly wave.

112
00:08:20.144 --> 00:08:23.085
And then we need to figure out
how to click the button in and

113
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:25.063
then let's add a little disclaimer.

114
00:08:25.063 --> 00:08:29.748
So please note that I may not wave back.

115
00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:34.419
This is because I am very far away.

116
00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:41.565
And probably didn't see
you click this button.

117
00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.800
So how do we get our
wave component in here?

118
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.524
Really what we want,
is we wanna be able to just type wave.

119
00:08:49.524 --> 00:08:51.169
And really that's all we have to do.

120
00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:52.839
We just have to import it at the top.

121
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:59.338
So we can import wave from,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Components/wave.

122
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.224
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we don't need
the extension, we can just use that.

123
00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:10.746
So now, when I save this,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: It's gonna hot reload.

124
00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.732
We can see our button in here,
and if I click it,

125
00:09:14.732 --> 00:09:18.438
it's gonna say how many times I've waved.

126
00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:27.496
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And that's the power
of MDX is there's no wackiness involved,

127
00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:30.600
it's just writing some mark down.

128
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.931
And then if you wanna use React,
you just write some React.

129
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:38.564
And what's really powerful about this too
is let's say I wanted to do something

130
00:09:38.564 --> 00:09:39.126
custom.

131
00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:43.943
I'll do, let's say, a div and

132
00:09:43.943 --> 00:09:46.804
we'll do a style.

133
00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:51.998
And set the background to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Red or something.

134
00:09:51.998 --> 00:09:57.506
And then I wanna add some content in here,
if I write like regular

135
00:09:57.506 --> 00:10:03.403
mark down,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: It

136
00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:06.120
still reads that as mark
down inside of the JSX.

137
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.347
Now, importantly,
you have to leave that extra space,

138
00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:11.308
cuz otherwise it won't parse it.

139
00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:15.963
So you do need to have a full line
break to get that JSX to keep

140
00:10:15.963 --> 00:10:18.246
the markdown parts inside.

141
00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:26.156
But,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: There we go,

142
00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:27.084
now it's working.

143
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.982
I think I had a stray space in there.

144
00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:33.177
So basically this is something
that's really flexible,

145
00:10:33.177 --> 00:10:37.037
where you can do a combination
of markdown and React.

146
00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:38.365
This is really useful, for

147
00:10:38.365 --> 00:10:42.062
example if you wanna use like images
where you can use the markdown syntax for

148
00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:45.212
displaying the image, but
you can wrap it in a React component.

149
00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:48.362
That will add a figure caption or
additional,

150
00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:52.804
maybe you wanted to add a gallery
where you can show thumbnails and

151
00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:55.659
click them to show the full size version.

152
00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:57.024
There's a lot of flexibility here.

153
00:10:58.902 --> 00:11:02.220
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
that's great for a contact page.

154
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.139
But what if we wanna use this for
something else?

155
00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:07.685
What if we want to write our blog in MDX?

156
00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.610
And that's what we're gonna
