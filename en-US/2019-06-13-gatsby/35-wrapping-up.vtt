00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.083
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: That
is really kind of fast.

2
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:08.079
I know we did a little bit of a speed
run through a lot of these things, but

3
00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.295
that's everything that you
should be required to know.

4
00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:15.438
And even some things that you shouldn't
be required to know on how to get up and

5
00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:16.988
running with a Gatsby site.

6
00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:21.858
You're now able to kinda get a new site
up and running, create some pages,

7
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:26.495
link between them, how to get some
styles in there and do both global and

8
00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.220
component level styles.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.724
You've got the very basics
of GraphQL in Gatsby and

10
00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:35.889
a few different instances of
using those in different ways.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.710
We set up a blog with MDX.

12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.996
We figured out how to use React
components in our MDX files.

13
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:49.890
Added a couple neat things
like this hero box.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.260
Figured out how to optimize images,

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.950
whether they're background images or
regular images.

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.820
And then we started using
some some third party data to

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.100
add some extra stuff to our site.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600
And finally, we did some some
basic analysis to the bundle, and

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.840
got that thing up on the Internet.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.342
So does anybody have any
questions before we call it a day?

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.490
See one back there.

22
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Will there
be an intermediate or

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.000
advanced Gatsby workshop in the future?

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.421
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I
believe you have to ask Mark.

25
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:26.200
[LAUGH] I would happlity do an
intermediate and advanced Gatsby workshop.

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The answer would be awesome.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.640
You're welcome to come back.

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.834
And everybody tweet @fronendmasters and
@jason to make it happen.

29
00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.568
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yes.

30
00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:37.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

31
00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:42.282
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
