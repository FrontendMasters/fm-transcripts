WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We've built
the site so we can just build it again.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.290
I guess I can use NPM run build.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.390
And NPM run build is going to

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.360
put everything that we're
doing into this public folder.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.020
So let me cash close this,
we've got a public, and

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.350
this builds on our actual site.

7
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.080
So we've got the about,
another post contact, hello world,

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.430
all the things that we expect to be there,
along with the static folder, and

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.980
then a bunch of JavaScript chunks,
and all that good stuff.

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.570
This is what webpack is generating for us.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.620
And this is why it's nice
to use Gatsby because

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.050
this type of configuration is not trivial.

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.890
And trying to set this up in webpack,
it takes a lot.

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.170
So being able to just know that this
is being done for us is very nice.

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.269
So once we've got this,
we can do Gatsby serve.

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.360
And now we can see the built site.

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.660
We can see this is actually the server
side rendered generated site.

18
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.220
And a couple things that are nice to
look at here are on the network tab.

19
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.627
Let's go to fast 3G, I can do my load and

20
00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:25.580
you can kinda see this load's pretty
darn quick, that's a good thing.

21
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.860
We're also seeing that we're barely
loading, we're not loading much here.

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.810
So as we move around you can also see,
did everybody see that?

23
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070
This is kinda hard to notice,
but check this out.

24
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.610
So watch this timeline up in the top.

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.743
Okay, so we've loaded,
here are the assets that we got,

26
00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:45.470
here are the things that we got.

27
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.510
Now watch what happens when
I hover over about up in

28
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.210
the top right of this timeline.

29
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.426
You see that?

30
00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:58.760
We just pre fetched the about page so
that it feels instant when you load to it.

31
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.350
And that way your users,
when they're on this site,

32
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.840
they don't have to wait for things to
load, things are just available to them.

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.980
It's a really really nice workflow and
it makes using a Gatsby site feel instant.

34
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.290
It's a really nice experience.

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.520
So this is the kind of stuff
that we're trying to do

36
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.580
to make everybody's life
just a little bit easier.

37
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.660
So if I go back out you can
also see that the images and

38
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.690
stuff start preloading, too.

39
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.290
Watch the bottom of the panel down here.

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.070
As I start to hover over things,
you can see the blogs start to prefetch

41
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.090
in the background so that when I
click on it it's already available.

42
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.130
This is that kind of stuff that we're
talking about with the purple pattern and

43
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.500
the various performance optimizations
that are just baked into the core of what

44
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.630
Gatsby does.

45
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.960
This is so that you, as a developer,

46
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.186
never once have to think about
how the heck prefetching works.

47
00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:59.250
But in case you're curious,
what this ends up doing is up at the top.

48
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.680
We'll start adding these
link rel prefetches

49
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.540
which pull resources in to be used later.

50
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.372
So that's kind of the fast version.

51
00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:09.990
Go ahead.

52
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it only
prefetch on hover then?

53
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.710
Is that sort of what triggers it or?

54
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.230
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: No.

55
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.160
It'll prefetch on a handful of things.

56
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.270
So I had the slow 3G installed.

57
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.754
So on a faster connection,

58
00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:29.482
it detects network latency using
browser feature detection.

59
00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:31.897
On a fast connection,
it'll also use the intersection observer.

60
00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:34.951
So as I scroll down
the page when it saw this,

61
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:39.620
it would say hey what's that,
let me let me prefetch that.

62
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.680
So it kind of determines how
much bandwidth you have.

63
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.980
And then we'll attempt to prefetch
things as they become available.

64
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.330
Another thing that I didn't really show
here is the the lazy loading of these.

65
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.532
So let me make this much slower.

66
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.160
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so on a slow 3G,

67
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.650
now remember this took like 40 seconds
when we were in development mode.

68
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.430
It's taking, let's see, we got
something on the screen in six seconds.

69
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.690
And this is on slow 3G.

70
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.750
This is what most of
the world is gonna see.

71
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.350
This is another reason why I like,

72
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.310
one of the reasons that I came to Gatsby
is because I actually see Gatsby having

73
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.240
the potential to be kind
of a global equalizer.

74
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.650
Because the sites that
you build in Gatsby,

75
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.570
they work with JavaScript disabled,
they work offline with the plugin, and

76
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.560
they will, they only take
a few kilobytes to download.

77
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.940
So for
somebody who is in a developing country,

78
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.750
if they have to walk to their friend's
house who has a Wi Fi hotspot and

79
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.430
download their sites before they go home,
a Gatsby site is only gonna

80
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.960
cost them a little bit if
they're paying by the megabite.

81
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.578
And it means that that site's gonna to
continue to work when they leave so

82
00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.180
that they can actually use
the internet even if they don't

83
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.830
have access to a reliable internet
connection or they pay by the megabite.

84
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.948
So that means that something that we
want to use like modern technology,

85
00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:07.240
React, Graft UL, all this fun
stuff that we want to play with,

86
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.900
is also something that is completely
functional and honestly ideal for

87
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.550
people who don't have strong
Internet connections or

88
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.540
who don't have access to
a reliable WiFi connection or

89
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.400
who are living on pay per megabyte data,
in really slow 2G, 3G zones.

90
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.530
So it's another one of those things of
making the right thing the easy thing.

91
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.340
By default, when you build a Gatsby site,
you're gonna build something that's good

92
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.300
for somebody no matter where they
are in the world trying to load it.

93
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.749
And I really, really liked that
about Gatsby as a technology.

94
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.030
So anyways my little
feel good diatribe aside,

95
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.650
we're now ready to publish this and
put it up on the Internet now.
