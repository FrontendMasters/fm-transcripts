1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.075
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
the last thing we're gonna do here then,

2
00:00:02.075 --> 00:00:03.784
is get this thing up on the Internet.

3
00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:09.038
So this part is thankfully very fun cuz
I know it's the end of the day, and

4
00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:14.488
I don't know about you but my brain's
about to melt out the side of my ears.

5
00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:18.625
So what we're gonna do is we're
actually just gonna go to Netlify,

6
00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.991
we're gonna create a free account and
we're gonna deploy this thing.

7
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:28.738
So I'm going to stop the server and
let me let's see,

8
00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:33.192
I'm going to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Well,

9
00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:34.249
I wanna get this up on GitHub.

10
00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:39.242
I have tools that make this easy, but
let me just do this the long way to make

11
00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.932
this really so that I'm not doing
things that no one knows how to use.

12
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:44.803
So I'm gonna create a new one.

13
00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:48.779
Let's call this
Frontend Masters Gatsby intro and

14
00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.833
I'm going to create this repository.

15
00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:59.672
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm gonna take
this and I'm going to say get

16
00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:05.632
remote add deploy, and
we'll put this in here.

17
00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.115
And I'm going to get add
everything that we did today.

18
00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:15.751
I'm going to get push deploy, wait,
I need to actually commit this don't I.

19
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:16.605
Sure do.

20
00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:19.720
So get commit,

21
00:01:23.237 --> 00:01:26.411
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I built the thing.

22
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:30.794
Don't write commit messages like me,
write good commit messages.

23
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.778
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so I'm gonna
push up to this new repo that I just

24
00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:41.466
created that is called
Frontend Masters Gatsby intro.

25
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:46.336
And now that that's pushed,
I can see all of my content up here.

26
00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:49.956
And so I'm going to then go to Netlify,

27
00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:54.027
I'm gonna log in, and
this puts me in here.

28
00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:55.987
So I've already created an account, so

29
00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:58.706
I'm not able to show you
the account creation process.

30
00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:03.479
But if I go actually if I
go into a incognito window,

31
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.030
if I go into an incognito window and
I hit Sign up,

32
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.588
you just sign up with your GitHub or
other like source control system.

33
00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:20.857
And upon doing that, I really like
Netlify, it's a really good system.

34
00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:27.744
They've done an absolutely stellar job
of building just easy, friendly tools.

35
00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:30.207
So let me create a new site from Git.

36
00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:32.839
I'm going to choose GitHub as my option.

37
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:36.730
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: They're
gonna have me authorize, and

38
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.192
then they're gonna show me all
of my things that I just did.

39
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:44.191
So if I do a search,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,

40
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.865
here's the repo that I just created.

41
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:49.770
We can double check that to make sure,
yep there it is.

42
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.627
So I'm gonna grab this one and it
detected already that it's a Gatsby site.

43
00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:01.490
So that's it, let's hit the deploy button.

44
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.193
And now we can watch our site deploy.

45
00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:10.018
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And it's just going
to kind of stand up a Netlify container,

46
00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:14.868
it's going to install all our
dependencies, it'll run the Gatsby build,

47
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:19.830
and then it'll take us live, the first
one usually takes three ish minutes.

48
00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:25.925
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: This is where
I really need elevator music.

49
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:30.475
&gt;&gt; multiple: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Student: The question is, I'm sorry,

50
00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:33.401
how long will they actually
provide these free sites?

51
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.762
Because I've been using Netlify for quite
some time now, but I'm getting to a point

52
00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:41.213
where I just wonder, when do I have
to start paying for all of this?

53
00:03:41.213 --> 00:03:42.229
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: You know,
that's a great question.

54
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.089
And I,
have not heard anything from the Netlify

55
00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.864
team about ever trying
to monetize this tier.

56
00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.881
I think what they monetize is,
when you go beyond certain points,

57
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.476
needing collaboration things like that.

58
00:03:56.476 --> 00:04:00.748
So I don't expect them to
ever surprise us with a,

59
00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:05.043
hey you have all the sites and
now they cost money.

60
00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:09.182
I expect that if they do decide to start
charging money we'll get a lot of notice.

61
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:14.549
Because they've always
shown responsible business

62
00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.206
practices so
I don't expect to be surprised.

63
00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:23.006
But yeah, so we're getting closer
we're writing out our redirect data

64
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:27.319
that's usually one of the last things that
happens before it tells us it's done.

65
00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.785
And there we go, site is live.

66
00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:33.202
Now, I can hit this Preview button, boom.

67
00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:35.238
We've got ourselves a live website.

68
00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:37.216
And so, this is really,

69
00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:42.697
really exciting because what is means
is now I have a persistent URL.

70
00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:48.585
And this is really nice because I'm
looking at whatever I wanna call this and

71
00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:51.897
I can rename it if I want and
it will just be as

72
00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:56.783
long as it's available the thing
that I want .Netlify.com.

73
00:04:56.783 --> 00:05:01.679
Another really cool thing
about this is that you're also

74
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:06.779
able to do branch based deploys,
so like if I wanna check all

75
00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.795
my pull requests on a deploy
branch before we do anything.

76
00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:17.173
So it's gonna automatically build
a deploy preview for all pull requests,

77
00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:21.639
so just to show you how neat that
is let me check out a new branch.

78
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.193
And we'll call this deploy test.

79
00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:29.522
And I'm going to come in here and
let's just change the color of something.

80
00:05:29.522 --> 00:05:33.583
Let's make I don't know
let's make this hero box

81
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:38.036
will change all of these to
be where was this red color?

82
00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:42.403
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's make these like,
we'll see it's gonna be bad,

83
00:05:42.403 --> 00:05:44.938
I don't even wanna look at
it before we hit the button.

84
00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:48.133
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Is that wrong?

85
00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:49.337
That's right.

86
00:05:52.883 --> 00:05:55.808
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
this is gonna be super gross.

87
00:05:55.808 --> 00:05:57.797
So, I'm going to commit this.

88
00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:03.701
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then we can push it.

89
00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.440
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
before I do anything,

90
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.232
I'm just gonna come back here and
click to the Overview,

91
00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:19.512
and as soon as this finishes,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I have to open

92
00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.410
the pull request it's
why that didn't happen.

93
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.134
So I have my compare and pull request,
let me open my pull request.

94
00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:35.810
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, that's in,
and now if I go and look at my deploys,

95
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.468
I can see it's already building
a preview of this thing.

96
00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:46.021
And it's also already installed
on my Github repo so,

97
00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:47.959
I can see what's happening.

98
00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:53.792
It's showing me this
deployment as it's working.

99
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:55.875
So this is really really powerful stuff.

100
00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:58.718
And you'll notice it's much faster
on the second build around.

101
00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.122
I mean we're looking at,
we're coming up on I think,

102
00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:04.347
about 30 seconds of build so far.

103
00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:08.877
So after they get started it's
a little bit faster each time.

104
00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:15.548
So in my Settings, in the General
settings, I can change the site name.

105
00:07:15.548 --> 00:07:21.188
And we can call this,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Frontend

106
00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:22.034
Masters Gatsby.

107
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:30.313
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So that's saved,
and now if I click Over,

108
00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:36.879
we can see at Frontend Masters Gatsby,
I have a running site, it's there.

109
00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:42.745
If I were it to be interested in a custom
domain you can also just come in here and

110
00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:44.390
add a custom domain.

111
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.931
We've got documentation on how to do that.

112
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:50.795
They've got all sort of fun things
like they will automatically set

113
00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:52.685
up your SSL certificate.

114
00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:56.693
They have support for
Cloud functions which is really cool,

115
00:07:56.693 --> 00:08:00.700
that's like if you wanna,
if you've heard of Serverless,

116
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.253
this is a really kind of nice
way of doing Serverless.

117
00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:08.349
You can do identity, like you can do log
in management you can have people submit

118
00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:09.709
forms through your site.

119
00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:11.623
Netlify has a lot of cool
stuff going on with it.

120
00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:15.791
So, but really what they do really,
really well and

121
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:21.973
what I really love about them is that
they just make this process so, so easy.

122
00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:26.057
So here we go we've got this,
I can look at my deploy preview and

123
00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:30.309
it's not great,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Well,

124
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.442
at least it's blue and not red.

125
00:08:31.442 --> 00:08:36.807
I thought it was making it red because
I can't read hex, but [LAUGH] but.

126
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:40.923
I mean okay, so this is good but
this is not what we want, so

127
00:08:40.923 --> 00:08:45.725
I'm gonna go ahead and this is terrible,
we're not gonna do this.

128
00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:51.901
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So I'm gonna
close that and we don't want it, and

129
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.427
we'll just delete that branch and
pretend it never happened.
