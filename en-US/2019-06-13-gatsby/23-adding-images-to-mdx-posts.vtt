00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The first thing that
we wanna do is we want to kind of look

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.596
at what this might require.

3
00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:10.920
And so I'm going to go back to Unsplash,
we've got one here.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.013
And I'm gonna just type hello world.

5
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.891
So what I'm doing is I just wanna
get a couple images that we

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:20.140
can throw into our blog.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.253
So I'm gonna download a couple these.

8
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.790
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then let's maybe look at another one.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.570
This looks good, let's grab that one.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.729
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so
we've got these two images,

11
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:37.580
that'll be the end of our
adventures with Unsplash.

12
00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:45.960
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so in my post,
I want to use these images.

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.575
And so I'm gonna create a new folder,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Inside of

14
00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:55.532
each,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Post, and again,

15
00:00:55.532 --> 00:01:00.383
the benefit of this is
that it allows us to keep

16
00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:04.990
the images where we're going to use them.

17
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.469
So if I'm trying to figure out
where the images are for this post,

18
00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.200
I don't want to have to go
up to this images folder.

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.953
And on a sufficiently large site,

20
00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:16.790
this might be hundreds of images if
it was everything from every post.

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.020
So that gets a little unwieldy.

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.100
So instead, we wanna use this stuff here.

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.214
And I am gonna rename these a little bit.

24
00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.654
We'll keep the author's name, but
we will change up the descriptions so

25
00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:29.531
that we actually know
what we're looking for.

26
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.750
And so
that I don't have to type random hashes.

27
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.104
Lets go in here and
lets say I want my image

28
00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:44.786
to be images and jon-tyson-hola.jpg.

29
00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:51.500
And then in another post,
I wanna do the same thing.

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.108
I'm gonna add an image to my frontmatter.

31
00:01:56.108 --> 00:02:03.975
And I want this to be
images/pablo-gentile-hello.jpg.

32
00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:08.060
I believe that's JPEG, yes.

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.090
So now we've got our two posts,
and they've got images specified.

34
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.210
And I wanna show you something
that is really fun about this.

35
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.090
Which is that,
without having to do anything,

36
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.690
Gatsby's going to make our lives easier.

37
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.812
And the way that it will do that,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Is I'm going to

38
00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:32.750
come out here, look into my,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Collapse,

39
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.008
we're gonna just write up a new query.

40
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.660
And the query that I'm gonna
write is gonna be for allMdx.

41
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.770
And I'm going to get my nodes,
my frontmatter.

42
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.580
And then I wanna get,
I need to refresh, wanna get my image.

43
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.064
And then in my image,
I'm gonna get childImageSharp.

44
00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:53.900
And then in here,
I'm gonna get the fluid size.

45
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.809
And then I'm gonna get the srcSet.

46
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.314
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And now, without
me changing anything, no new config or

47
00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:07.297
anything, because Gatsby recognized in
that frontmatter that we were pointing to

48
00:03:07.297 --> 00:03:11.638
a local image, the transformer knows
to make those transformations and

49
00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:14.690
give us the optimized
version of that file.

50
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.440
So we don't have to do anything,
we just get to use it.

51
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.820
So now we can go into our, let's see,
where where do we wanna start?

52
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.970
Yeah, let's go into our post-preview.

53
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.015
And we're going to install one dependency,
which is gatsby-image.

54
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.425
And what gatsby-image does is the same
thing as gatsby-background-image but

55
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.235
for regular images.

56
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.152
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so once we get
this, we can jump into our post-preview.

57
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And we're going
to import Image from 'gatsby-image'.

58
00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.690
And then down here,
I want to add in this image.

59
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.150
And so we're gonna link the image.

60
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.872
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So we'll just go
to post.slug, like we do anyways.

61
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:14.660
And then I'm going to add
a little bit of CSS here.

62
00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:21.510
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And that CSS is going
to be just to make sure that the images

63
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.857
kinda look right.

64
00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:28.817
So we're gonna do margin 1rem,
rem 0 0, and

65
00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:34.040
we'll make the link 100 pixels wide.

66
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.348
And inside, I'm going to add the image.

67
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.606
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then we need
to get this fluid from somewhere,

68
00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:50.478
I don't know where that's gonna come from.

69
00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:54.140
But then we also need to
set just a couple styles.

70
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.244
And this is just kind of to
override a few things that we want,

71
00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:00.581
we don't want extra margin here.

72
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:05.160
So everything inside of this image,
we're going to give it a margin-top of 0.

73
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.420
And then we also need to add an alt tag,
because we always want that, an alt tag.

74
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.200
In this case, because it's a post image,
we're gonna use the title as the alt tag.

75
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.010
Ideally, that is not how you would do it.

76
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.590
You would actually write an alt tag for
every image, and

77
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.450
you could do that by adding it
here as an image alt or something.

78
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.905
I didn't wanna get too
deep into the weeds,

79
00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:31.841
cuz I know that I'm already making
you write a bunch of CSS and stuff.

80
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:35.219
So [LAUGH] just know you should
be writing custom alt for

81
00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.480
every image, it's very helpful.
