00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.695
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's
build a blog using MDX.

2
00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:05.550
We're gonna start by just
writing a couple blog posts.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.710
So let me create a new folder down here.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.380
Let's see,
we want that folder to be called posts,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.820
and this is not in the source directory.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.040
To be clear, it doesn't actually
matter where you put your posts.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.560
You can put them in the source directory.

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.330
You can put them in
a folder called content.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.080
They just have to be somewhere that you
can get at them, that's the big thing.

10
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.300
Inside of here, I'm gonna set
up my posts to be a folder and

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.010
then that folder is gonna contain a file.

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.268
And I'm doing that for
a very specific reason,

13
00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.192
which we'll look at a little bit later.

14
00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:46.050
But ultimately this is up to you.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.530
To keep them in order,
I do kinda numbering.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.140
So I'm gonna do hello world, and
then inside I want a helloworld.mdx.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.524
And in this file we're gonna
introduce something new.

18
00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.530
In markdown,
we have a concept called front matter.

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.310
So I can create a little fence up here,
and

20
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.030
inside of it I can add stuff that's
not gonna show up on the page.

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.170
So I wanna add a title, and
my title is gonna be Hello World.

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.080
And let's add a slug.

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.372
This is the URL that
the page is gonna have.

24
00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:25.160
So, we'll do kinda the kebab case,
hello world with a hyphen, all lowercase,

25
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.820
and then I'm going to add an author name,
and that is who I am.

26
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.018
So, then we'll just do
a really simple one,

27
00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:40.440
this is my first blog post,
I wrote it with MDX.

28
00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:46.400
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
that's gonna be our post to start.

29
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.780
And once we have that,
we also wanna add a second post.

30
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.430
So let's just, I'm just gonna copy this so
we don't have to type it twice.

31
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.640
I'm gonna create a new file,
we'll call this 0 1.

32
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.962
And let's call it another post,

33
00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:10.532
anotherpost.mdx, okay?

34
00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:14.100
And inside here,
I'm gonna modify the slug.

35
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.950
We want a different title,
keep the author.

36
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.910
And then let's just change this out
to say this is my next blog post.

37
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.790
And I'm on a roll.

38
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.495
Two blog posts in five minutes,
I'm killing it.

39
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:40.140
Okay, so, how do we get these into Gatsby?

40
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.648
We're gonna use another plugin and we're
gonna get them into the data layer so

41
00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:43.450
that we can access them.

42
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.600
So to do that we're going to install,
let's stop the server, control+C.

43
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.158
And then I'm going to run npm install,

44
00:02:57.158 --> 00:03:01.206
gatsby source file system.

45
00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.810
Let me make sure I don't need any others.

46
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.902
Nope, gatsby source file system.

47
00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:10.880
And Gatsby source file system is
a way to use local files as part

48
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.090
of the GraphQL data layer.

49
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.043
And that is going to get installed.

50
00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:20.133
And while we're waiting for
that to install,

51
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.908
I'm gonna pop open the Gatsby config.

52
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.250
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And inside of it
I'm gonna create another config object.

53
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.340
We're gonna resolve
gatsby-source-filesystem,

54
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.430
and we need options.

55
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.087
And so the options, the only one
that's required is the path but

56
00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm gonna give it a name as well just
in case we wanted to search for it.

57
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.390
So I'm gonna give it a name of posts.

58
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.370
And if you remember,
the folder is called posts.

59
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.290
So I'm going to also give it a path of
posts, and it's just going to look for

60
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.090
that folder of posts.

61
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.740
And it's gonna load anything it finds
in there as part a of the data layer.

62
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.120
And because we have Gatsby MDX installed,
it's going to look for MDX files and

63
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.251
transform those into GraphQL nodes,
which is all very exciting.
