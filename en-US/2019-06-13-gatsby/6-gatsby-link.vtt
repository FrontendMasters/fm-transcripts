00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The next thing that
we would wanna do is probably start kinda

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.100
linking between these pages.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.448
So my instinct here is going to
be to set up a link like this,

4
00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:14.340
and maybe this is what I do.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.300
Actually, let's make that look
more linky and explain what it is.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.450
Let's add a HTML entity for a left arrow,
and I'm gonna go back to home.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.561
And so this gives us a pretty simple
back to home link, okay, that's good.

8
00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:35.854
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And when I click this,
it takes me back to the homepage.

9
00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:39.419
But my homepage isn't hooked up to
have any links or anything yet, so

10
00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:40.800
I can't go back.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.760
But I wanna show one thing, watch this
flicker as I click between the pages,

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.540
it's really, really fast because there's
not very much content on this site.

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.960
But what's happening is the entire page
is reloading, and we don't want that,

14
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.560
we don't want the entire page to reload,
we want to make that smooth.

15
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.580
And because we're generating a React app,
we have the ability to do dynamic routing.

16
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.050
So Gatsby comes prepackaged
with Reach Router, and

17
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.520
Reach Router gives us a whole lot of
control over the location in the browser,

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.080
the way that things behave,
and we just get that for free.

19
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.820
So you're able to,
Gatsby link does a couple extra things,

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.280
like pre-loading resources in
the background and some other fancy stuff.

21
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.550
So we've wrapped Reach Router, so
we can just import link from Gatsby,

22
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.270
this is a named export.

23
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.530
And this link component has the same
API as Reach Router's link component.

24
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.010
So I can just change this
out to be a link component.

25
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.900
And instead of an href we're gonna use
a to, so we're linking to the homepage.

26
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.960
And when I save this, visually,
it looks exactly the same.

27
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.660
But if you watch,
this is gonna be really subtle,

28
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.540
that tiny little flash, it's not there,
it's an instant reload.

29
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.630
So this is what we really want, is we
want this feeling of instant refreshing.

30
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.290
It makes our app feel native,
there is no reload phase.

31
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.090
So let's go ahead and
make the same change to our homepage.

32
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.340
And so we're gonna go in here and
just kinda do all the same things.

33
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.200
I'm gonna import link from Gatsby.

34
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.270
And then down here I wanna turn
this into a, let's call it Home.

35
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.730
And then down here I'm going to say,
let's actually just get rid of this.

36
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.049
Instead we're gonna say Hello Minnesota!

37
00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.010
And then we can just
link to the about page.

38
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.992
And I'm going to say Learn about me,
and this time, we'll use a right arrow.

39
00:02:57.037 --> 00:03:00.048
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And I've got
Prettier configured auto format on Save.

40
00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:03.840
So if you see my code jump around a little
bit when I save, that's what's going on.

41
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.932
Let me hide that sidebar so
you can see what's happening.

42
00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.412
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And so these
are kinda the fundamentals of Gatsby,

43
00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:16.010
you create pages and
you link between them.

44
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.150
And really, this is the only thing that
you absolutely need to know to use Gatsby,

45
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.990
is that if you have
a pages directory here and

46
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.170
you add files to it,
we're gonna create pages.

47
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.036
And if you want to link between those
pages, you can use this Gatsby link.

48
00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:38.849
If you know those two things, everything
else you can just kinda do it the way that

49
00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.670
you would normally do it, and
it's usually gonna be okay.
