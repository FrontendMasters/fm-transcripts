00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So this is something
that you wanna be judicious about

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.488
because the reasons that solutions for
CSS modules in CSS and

3
00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:14.584
JS were kinda created is because
one of the biggest challenges

4
00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:21.159
of managing styles at scale is global
scope being confusing and hard to manage.

5
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.299
So, what we're gonna do is
some stuff that is kinda,

6
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:31.109
it's just like my opinion man, but
you can do this a lot of different ways.

7
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.780
So I'm gonna set this up where
we're gonna set everything on

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.269
the page to have box-sizing
of border-box and buckle and

9
00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.493
cuz we're gonna write CSS for
like 20 minutes here.

10
00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:50.976
We're gonna do a margin of 0 and this is
where my opinions really start to show.

11
00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:56.335
We also have this wonderful tool that
I learned from Hayden Pickering,

12
00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:59.742
it's called the lobotomized owl selector.

13
00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:06.611
And so what this means is every sibling
selector is going to get this style,

14
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:13.933
and we're gonna give it a margin top of
1 rem, which is like the root font size.

15
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:18.311
And the reason that I like this as a
selector is that it just kinda normalizes

16
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.703
vertical spacing in a way that doesn't
require really elaborate resets.

17
00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:27.355
We're not gonna use something
like normalize or the CSS reset.

18
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:31.387
We're just doing a little bit
of code to make this work.

19
00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:36.806
Next, let's set up our HTML and body tags.

20
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:39.810
These we want to always
have a margin of zero,

21
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.092
even if body would be a sibling
element because there's a head.

22
00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:45.988
We're gonna set a default color.

23
00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:50.309
Let's make that, I don't know,
555 that seems okay.

24
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.227
We'll go with the font family.

25
00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:56.324
And I'm gonna just use
the default font stack.

26
00:01:56.324 --> 00:02:00.756
So I'm gonna do apple-system,

27
00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:06.305
BlinkMacSystem, God, SystemFont.

28
00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.855
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Can I spell?

29
00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:17.444
Segoe UI, then we'll do Roboto.

30
00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:21.208
I never had to type this
out by hand before,

31
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:25.087
there's a lot, Arial, ans sans-serif.

32
00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:28.196
And we're not gonna use any emoji,
so I'm gonna leave that part out.

33
00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:33.541
And then we can do
the font-size of 18 pixels.

34
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.922
A line height of 1.4.

35
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:40.722
So these are just some
kind of really as straight

36
00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:45.652
forward as I can make them defaults for
our page.

37
00:02:45.652 --> 00:02:54.273
If you do this it's going to be
kind of okay just out of the gate.

38
00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:58.791
The last thing that we need to do in
here is, I wanna make sure that so

39
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.143
Gatsby wraps everything in a div.

40
00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:04.431
If we look at the code here.

41
00:03:08.113 --> 00:03:09.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's
get that out of the way.

42
00:03:13.258 --> 00:03:16.839
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We have this div id
gatsby, and then we have a no script tag.

43
00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.495
And because there's a no script,

44
00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:21.474
that means that this div gets
treated like a sibling element.

45
00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:23.713
We don't want that to get extra sizing.

46
00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:28.094
So, I'm wanna leave myself a note,
so that I know what I'm doing.

47
00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:34.223
Remove margin for
main div that Gatsby mounts into,

48
00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:39.098
and then I'm going to do a direct selector

49
00:03:39.098 --> 00:03:43.298
to the div and set a margin top of 0.

50
00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.494
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then we're gonna
set up just some really basic typography,

51
00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:59.035
so that we don't have to think too hard
about any of that as we're styling

52
00:03:59.035 --> 00:03:59.981
everything else.

53
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:07.575
So let's make all of our headings a darker
color, so we'll give in triple twos.

54
00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:12.900
We'll give them a shoulder line height
which is just kinda nice to look at.

55
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.940
And then we're also going to
say that anything that comes

56
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.676
after a heading is going to
have a smaller margin top.

57
00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:27.740
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: That just gives
us a little more visual grouping,

58
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.386
the heading is close to
the content next to it.

59
00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:33.694
We also want any bolded text
to have that darker color.

60
00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:39.316
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
finally, if we make a list,

61
00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:45.095
we want that list to not have
a huge amount of top space.

62
00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:50.399
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay,
so we just typed a bunch.

63
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.974
This is not the only, I wish I could tell
you this is the only CSS we're gonna write

64
00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:56.740
in this workshop, it's not.

65
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.041
We're gonna write so much CSS.

66
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:06.603
But this is the bulk of, kind of,
the configuration level stuff.

67
00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:12.065
So the next thing that we're gonna do,
is we've got this kinda global styles.

68
00:05:12.065 --> 00:05:15.204
And if I just collapse
this out of the way,

69
00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:20.068
then I can see we're not actually
doing anything with this yet.

70
00:05:20.068 --> 00:05:22.203
So we're gonna wanna put in a header,

71
00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:24.951
and we don't know what's
gonna go in there yet.

72
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:27.773
But we're also gonna set in a main.

73
00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:35.211
And this main is going
to contain our children.

74
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.793
So with that, we can start,
I mean we're not done yet, but

75
00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:41.025
we're gonna start working on this.

76
00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:44.785
We're gonna export this
layout as a default.

77
00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:51.657
And then, once that's done,
I'm going to come over into my index,

78
00:05:51.657 --> 00:05:58.723
I'm going to import the layout
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: From this folder.

79
00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:02.698
And then instead of using this fragment,
I'm just gonna use a layout.

80
00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:03.231
How does it work?

81
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:08.882
Is it an Option-Click to give
myself multiple cursors?

82
00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:11.648
So once I've added this layout, and

83
00:06:11.648 --> 00:06:18.207
I go to the homepage,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I gotta,

84
00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:23.148
I forgot to restart the server so
npm run develop.

85
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.677
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: All right, so
we're back up at 8000 so I can refresh.

86
00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:34.012
Hey, we've got ourselves
some global styles.

87
00:06:34.012 --> 00:06:37.899
Now I've only applied this to the homepage
so when I go to the About page,

88
00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.643
you'll notice it's not done.

89
00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:43.558
So let's also apply
this to our About page.

90
00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:45.362
And I can just copy this directly over.

91
00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:52.606
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then again,
we're gonna add a layout.

92
00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:56.367
And now when I click between the two.

93
00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:57.609
Let's look at okay.

94
00:06:57.609 --> 00:06:58.491
I mean it's still not great.

95
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.082
We got to solve some problems like
where we don't have a header and

96
00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:05.559
we're also this text is all kind
of jammed up against the side.

97
00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:12.769
So let's let's address the issue with,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The main section,

98
00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.349
and we're gonna do this
using a different technique.

99
00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.002
And I'm kinda showing a lot
of different techniques here.

100
00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:22.128
You may not want to mix all of
them in your actual projects.

101
00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:24.139
This is more just to kind
of show off how it works.

102
00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.385
Go ahead.

103
00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:27.307
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
I see in the CSS we wrote,

104
00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:32.325
we're using a lot of element selectors
instead of class id selectors,

105
00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:37.927
just for my own confirmation is that kind
of an idiomatic practice to emotion and

106
00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:43.056
sound components as I just want to get
this out of the way really quickly.

107
00:07:43.056 --> 00:07:48.679
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: To be completely
honest, this is such a subjective thing.

108
00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:53.936
My take on it is that typography
is typically globally set and

109
00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:56.721
individually overridden, but

110
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:02.717
I also come from write all your CSS
by hand and really use the cascade.

111
00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:04.980
A lot of people don't like that and so

112
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.569
they very tightly encapsulate
their typography styles.

113
00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:12.829
And everything kinda gets
set by config tokens.

114
00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:14.462
There's not a right or
a wrong way to do this.

115
00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:18.812
The only that really matters,
when you're dealing with styles in an app,

116
00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:22.402
is that the team understands what
decisions have been made and

117
00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.557
agrees to enforce them the same way.

118
00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:28.357
So as long as everybody's
on the same page,

119
00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:32.580
you can build,
a good style system for your app.

120
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.044
Where it will start to fall apart
is if there are a lot of rules

121
00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:40.184
that you just have to know it gets tricky.

122
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:43.891
I think that's were a lot of
contention around CSS comes in,

123
00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.975
is how much of it is stuff you just
have to intuitively understand?

124
00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:51.022
Or stuff that you have to learn by
sloughing through the code base.

125
00:08:51.022 --> 00:08:56.121
How much of the code base do you need
to know to be able to write styles?

126
00:08:56.121 --> 00:09:00.157
That varies from team to team and
is probably a debate that,

127
00:09:00.157 --> 00:09:04.287
well it is a debate that has been
raging on Twitter for years.

128
00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:09.003
[LAUGH] So yeah we probably won't
solve that today but my preference is,

129
00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:13.799
set some defaults on the elements
because it's easy to override element

130
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.571
styles with classes or other selectors.

131
00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:19.038
And that way things are kind of set here,
and

132
00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:21.714
then you override them
individually as you go.

133
00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:29.266
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: On the main,
we want to keep it off of the sides.

134
00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:32.062
So what I'm gonna do is,

135
00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:37.399
let's say I give it a margin
of 2 rem at the top.

136
00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:41.692
We'll make it an auto and
then we'll give it 4 rem at the bottom so

137
00:09:41.692 --> 00:09:44.049
there's a little breathing room.

138
00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:48.583
I'm going to give it a max width of 90,
what is this?

139
00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:53.495
Viewport width I think is
what that VW stands for.

140
00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:57.957
And then I'm going to set
a width of 550 pixels.

141
00:09:57.957 --> 00:10:02.682
And by setting a max width of 90 VW,
that means that 5% of

142
00:10:02.682 --> 00:10:07.233
the viewport width is gonna
show up to the left and right.

143
00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:12.340
So if I inspect this now,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: My

144
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.001
main is set with some extra sizes.

145
00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:21.197
And as this expands,
we can see those viewport widths

146
00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:26.623
are changing a little bit and
once we hit a certain size,

147
00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:30.448
it just sticks at a max width of 550.

148
00:10:30.448 --> 00:10:31.511
And so this is a way for

149
00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:34.952
us to just say that's the biggest
we want this thing to get is 550.

150
00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:39.054
But the smallest we ever want
it to be is 90% of the width so

151
00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:41.363
that it has some breathing room.
