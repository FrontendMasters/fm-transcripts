00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.670
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
now we're gonna start with GraphQL.

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.050
We're gonna learn
the fundamentals of how it works.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.020
And we're going to start adding data
to our Gatsby site using GraphQL.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.380
And the way that we'll do that to start
is we're gonna add some site metadata.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.330
Up here at the top,
we are currently just showing the URL.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.930
And that's not a great user experience.

7
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.040
If I navigate away,
I have no idea what's in this tab.

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.510
So I want to show the title.

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.100
And also for SEO purposes,
let's add a description as well.

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.330
The way that that is
going to work is first,

11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.030
we're just gonna hop
into our Gatsby config.

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.230
And we're gonna add some data.

13
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.390
So the first data that we're gonna add.

14
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.930
We just get in.

15
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.280
Let's open up that Gatsby config.

16
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.700
And I'm going to add a new prop to
this object called site metadata.

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.430
And this one also takes an object and
I can put whatever I want in here.

18
00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.520
So I'm going to add a title and let's call
this Frontend Masters Gatsby Workshop.

19
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.700
And then I can add a description.

20
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.997
And the description that I'm going
to add is a site we built together,

21
00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:19.690
during a full day,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Frontend Masters.

22
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.820
Let's wrap, not the thing that
I wanted here, Gatsby workshop.

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.800
Okay, so
that gives us the data that we need.

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840
So we've got a title and a description.

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.550
Now, to get this to load, because we're
changing Gatsby configuration files,

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.140
I'm going to stop and start the server.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.799
So Control+C and
then npm run develop again.

28
00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:50.696
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And by default,
nothing's gonna change here.

29
00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:54.240
We're not using the data yet, so
this site is completely unphased.

30
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.661
But, we also have this GraphQL Playground.

31
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:04.620
And the GraphQL Playground is gonna be
one of the most useful things in Gatsby,

32
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.230
because it gives us the ability
to play with our ideas.

33
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.648
So let me delete all this stuff and
we'll just start with a blank slate.

34
00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:16.259
So GraphQL, at its core,

35
00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:22.750
is a way of describing relationships
between types of data.

36
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.660
So if you've ever used a REST API, REST
APIs are typically I want a type of thing.

37
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.770
And it's going to deliver back
a list of those types of things.

38
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.130
And then if there are relationships,
if it's a normalized REST API,

39
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490
it's going to give you back a list of IDs.

40
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.290
So that you would then need to go and
query for the IDs of, so

41
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.090
you got a post let's say, and
then it would say the comments and

42
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.510
here's an array of IDs for comments.

43
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.412
And then you would have to go make queries
for, give me the comment with ID one,

44
00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:54.350
the comment with ID two,
you end up making all these calls.

45
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.420
GraphQL describes data a little
differently, where you're able to say,

46
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.120
well give me the post and
then give me the comments.

47
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.880
And for each comment, I want the author's
name and then for that author,

48
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.360
give me the list of posts that they wrote.

49
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.055
And you can just make these arbitrarily
nested queries that are theoretically can

50
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:12.590
recurse infinitely,
you might not want to actually do that.

51
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.960
But that's one of the reasons
that GraphQL is so exciting, and

52
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.980
one of the reasons that we like it.

53
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.966
So by default Gatsby doesn't
do a whole lot with GraphQL.

54
00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:26.780
It's just gonna set up some some
default things, what pages you've got,

55
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.330
what plugins you've got,
and then your site data.

56
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.570
And so inside of your site data,
I can click this open.

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.430
And I can see that we
have our site metadata,

58
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.930
which is that field that
we just filled out.

59
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.390
And then we see our title and description,
so it's picked up that title and

60
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.270
description from the config file.

61
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.960
And that means that we can write a query.

62
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.440
So the query that I want
is to get into the site.

63
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.830
And then I wanna get that site metadata.

64
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.050
And in here, if I hit Option+Space,
it's gonna show me the available fields so

65
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.910
that I can just choose
the ones that I want.

66
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.950
So I'm gonna choose both the title and
description, and

67
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.080
then I can run this query.

68
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.360
And I can see, here it is,
we have the data that we just added.

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360
So this is pretty sweet, because now
instead of having to hard code this

70
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.570
into a config file somewhere, and
then people just need to know that,

71
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.620
if you want this config, you have
to open like this, like slash data,

72
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.430
slash site,
slash metadata.json or something.

73
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.840
Now we can just say, yeah,

74
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230
it's all in the GraphQL layer,
just query for what you need.

75
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.470
That's a pretty powerful model.
