00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.810
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So the first
thing that we wanna look at is kinda

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.670
the way that we get pages created.

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.701
So by default, anything that's in a pages
directory is gonna be treated as a page.

4
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:12.130
So index.js becomes index.html,
that's our homepage.

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.634
If we wanna create another page like,

6
00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:20.561
like let's say an about page,
we create about.js,

7
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:25.596
and in here,
we're going to import React from react,

8
00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:28.460
and then let's export a page.

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.900
So we're gonna export default.

10
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:36.060
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
I'm going to use a React fragment.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.820
So this is just a way to kinda wrap
up the components so that we don't

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.430
have to send them as an array, we don't
have to add jump markup to the to the DOM.

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400
We don't want it a wrapper div.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.270
One of the things that you want
to avoid with with any of these

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.140
JS frameworks is it's really
easy to create just div soup.

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.410
We don't want div soup.

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.750
React fragments allow
us to avoid div soup.

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.050
So I'm going to add, let's say,
a heading that's gonna say About Me.

19
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.250
I'm gonna go down to create a paragraph.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.740
Let's make that paragraph, I don't know,
This is my personal website, and

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.320
then down here, really, that's all we
need, we've got ourselves an about page.

22
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.442
So let's save that, and then there's not
really any way for me to get there but

23
00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:28.660
I do know because I called this about.js,
this is gonna be available at about.

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940
So by navigating to about,

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.450
I'm able to very quickly see
these changes, and we can see.

26
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.420
We didn't have to start and
stop the server or anything,

27
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.100
we just create the file, and
there we go, we've got a page.
