WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.950
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So to get the data,

2
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.720
we're going to just take advantage of
another hook and load our Instagram post.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.610
So let's create another file and hooks.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.850
And this one is going to be called,
use Instagram.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.053
And inside of it, we're going to import
GraphQL and useStaticQuery from Gatsby.

6
00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:30.090
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And this is gonna
be a hook function, use Instagram.

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.210
It's gonna return something, and
that's gonna be our export default.

8
00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.208
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So what we wanna
grab is, we're gonna set up data like we

9
00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:47.587
usually do, and this is gonna be
the result of a useStaticQuery,

10
00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:52.442
using a GraphQL template tag, and
let's go write this query that we want

11
00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:57.850
in the playground so that we can
kinda see what we're getting after.

12
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.820
So we know that we want
the all Insta node, but

13
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.380
I also know that I only want 12 of these.

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.750
So I'm gonna use the limit filter.

15
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.530
And once I get inside of this,
I am going to want a handful of things.

16
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.239
I want the ID
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: That's not in

17
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:15.800
the local file, I want that to be up here.

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.940
The ID, I want the caption,
I want the username.

19
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.496
And then I wanna make sure
that we get the right size, so

20
00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:34.350
I'm gonna set the max width on these
to 120 and also the max height, to 120.

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.303
And one thing that I didn't mention,
the GraphQL fragments,

22
00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:43.301
there's a limitation in the Playground and
in other GraphQL explorers where we

23
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:48.224
can't inject a GraphQL fragment into it,
which means that you can't use them

24
00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:52.840
when you're writing these types
of queries in the playground.

25
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.866
So if I try this,
if I'm like Gatsby image sharp

26
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:04.460
fluid with web P, it's going to give me
an error that it's an unknown fragment.

27
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.632
So we have to kind of fake it with
something like source set for now, and

28
00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.982
then we can swap that out once we get in.

29
00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:16.930
So now that we've got this query,
we know it works.

30
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.110
It gives us what we want.

31
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.560
So I'm gonna just grab that out,
drop it in right here.

32
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.120
And I'm gonna use the fragment
now instead of the source.

33
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.772
And then at the bottom, what I want is
to process this data a little bit and

34
00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:36.347
make it a little easier.

35
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:42.924
So similar to the post we are gonna do
return data.allInstaNode.nodes.map and

36
00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:49.420
that's gonna give us back a node, and
I want to just return a simplified object.

37
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.360
So the first thing I'm gonna do is,
I'm just gonna spread out

38
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.080
all of the local file stuff,
because I want that to be available.

39
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.720
Child image sharp.

40
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.920
Then, I'm gonna add in the ID, so
the node.id, and I add in the caption.

41
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.545
Which is the node.caption and
I'm gonna add in the username.

42
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.626
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Which
is node.username.

43
00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:22.306
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
with that being said,

44
00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:28.150
we now have a hook that should
give us our Instagram data.

45
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.958
So if I go back to my insta component,

46
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:41.340
I can import use Instagram from hooks.

47
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.528
Use Instagram,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And

48
00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:49.828
we'll be able to then pull this data in.

49
00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:57.082
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
let's create a const called,

50
00:03:57.082 --> 00:04:00.580
what do I want to call this?

51
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.400
Insta Photos and
that's gonna be use Instagram.

52
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.940
And then we want to just grab out the user
name from the first one because we're

53
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.220
going to use this in both the title and
in the link.

54
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.421
So let's grab out the first insta photos.

55
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.267
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And pull and
destruct for the user name out of it and

56
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:27.656
then I can use this here.

57
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:38.670
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So now, what we
should see when I get to the homepage.

58
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.530
Think I might have to refresh this to get,
no no, it's working.

59
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.138
We have our,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Username is actually

60
00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:47.630
coming back from the query.

61
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.650
That's good.

62
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.208
So then,
we can do some looping on this data.

63
00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:59.474
So we're gonna take our instant photos.

64
00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:02.860
And we're going to map over them,
get a photo and

65
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.678
then we will return,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And anchor,

66
00:05:07.678 --> 00:05:10.243
that's gonna have an atroph and

67
00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:15.658
the atroph that we wanna use is going
to be a link to the photo itself so

68
00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:20.313
that's gonna be a link to
Instagram.com/p/photo.id

69
00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:25.254
which is what I figured out is
how Instagram addresses those.
