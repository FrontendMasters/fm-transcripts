00:00:00.021 --> 00:00:01.945
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So
the way that the blog today is gonna work,

2
00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:03.558
this is kind of a ride along, right?

3
00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:07.900
So I'm gonna live code this whole thing
up here, and we'll all do it together.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.210
I'm gonna go a little bit slow, but
I have a tendency to code pretty fast.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.840
So I don't expect you to
get all of these things,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.330
you're probably not gonna keep up with me
keystroke for keystroke, and that's okay.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.460
We have regular checkpoints where you'll
be able to check out a branch to get to

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.034
where we are in the workshop.

9
00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:27.158
And these kind of
encapsulate big concepts.

10
00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.175
So if you get lost, if you fall behind,
don't worry, don't panic,

11
00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:33.232
we will have a chance to skip ahead.

12
00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.970
Let's build a blog.

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.417
All right, so at this point,
we should have the the package installed.

14
00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:45.367
And so if you haven't run it already,
just run a quick npm install,

15
00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:49.475
make sure we've got everything, and
let's take a look at this repo.

16
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:55.865
So what we've got is a fairly
straightforward Node module setup.

17
00:00:55.865 --> 00:01:00.171
So if you've used this before,
you'll recognize the package.json.

18
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:04.509
Inside, we've got three dependencies,
gatsby, react, and react-dom.

19
00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.303
Those are the only three dependencies
you need to build a Gatsby site.

20
00:01:09.348 --> 00:01:10.769
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We
also have prettier so

21
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.189
that we can format our code more easily.

22
00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.048
That's an optional dependency,
you don't have to use that.

23
00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:19.060
And up here, we have a handful of scripts.

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.340
So the one that we're gonna be using
most is gonna be the develop script.

25
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.630
We've also got a build script,
which we'll look at later.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.870
format, if you just wanna fix the code.

27
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.135
If you aren't liking the way it looks,
you want prettier to fix it for

28
00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.518
you, just run npm run format,
that'll do that.

29
00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:37.636
And then serve is kind
of a test script for

30
00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:41.140
build that we'll look
at a little bit later.

31
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.588
Inside of a Gatsby site, you've got your
kinda standard boilerplate, the README,

32
00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.512
the LICENSE, the prettier config,
the .gitignore.

33
00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:49.844
And then we have two folders here.

34
00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:52.360
We've got a source and a static folder.

35
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.095
In the static folder,
we just have a favicon.

36
00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.440
The reason we include that is so

37
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.719
that the browser doesn't complain about
not being able to find a favicon.

38
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.157
There's really no other reason for
that to be there.

39
00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:06.920
And in the src folder we have a pages
directory, and then index.js.

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.854
And you can see here that index.js, it's
a very straightforward React component.

41
00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:19.240
We are importing React, and
we're exporting some jsx.

42
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.792
If you're not familiar with React, don't
worry, the things that we're gonna do in

43
00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:30.209
here today, I mean, we are writing React,
but we're not gonna go way overboard.

44
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.410
So don't worry if this
is a new syntax to you.

45
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.009
It will start to feel
a little more natural,

46
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.678
hopefully by the end of the workshop
if you just keep writing.

47
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:42.603
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
that's the whole thing.

48
00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:44.652
So the cache, the node_modules, and

49
00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:48.201
the public, those are folders that
are handled by Code, not by us.

50
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.202
So we're not gonna go in there at all.

51
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:54.191
So really, all we've got in our
Gatsby site is an index.js.

52
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.455
There's not really any
other code to start.

53
00:02:56.455 --> 00:03:00.978
And that's because Gatsby, again,
is designed to be no boilerplate.

54
00:03:00.978 --> 00:03:03.837
We don't wanna have to do a bunch
of boilerplate to get started.

55
00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:08.902
So let's start our site,
we're gonna do npm run develop.

56
00:03:08.902 --> 00:03:13.860
And what this will do is, it will run
through kinda Gatsby's startup process.

57
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.850
This is doing all the things in
the background that normally

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.680
you would have to configure yourself.

59
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.417
And once that's done, it's gonna give us
this URL, this http://localhost:8000.

60
00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:24.508
So I'm gonna grab this,
drop it into my browser.

61
00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:28.088
And now we've got our running site,
this Hello Frontend Masters!

62
00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:32.877
And so something that I love about Gatsby
is that right out of the gate we have

63
00:03:32.877 --> 00:03:34.710
support for hot reloading.

64
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.631
Okay, so now if I save this,
it's gonna update right away.

65
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:42.461
So we're able to very quickly
see something in the browser.

66
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.891
And as you can see,
we didn't change any code.

67
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.591
There was no config, or
boilerplate, or anything.

68
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:50.139
We just set up our Gatsby site and
we're off to the races.

69
00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.571
We're already seeing
things in our browser.
