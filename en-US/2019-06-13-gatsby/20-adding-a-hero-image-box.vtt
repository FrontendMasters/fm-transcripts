1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.258
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So the way that
we're gonna add a Hero Box is to start

2
00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:06.446
we're just gonna create
a new component called Hero.

3
00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:13.416
And that is going to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Live

4
00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:15.915
in our Components folder.

5
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.006
And as we import React from 'react',

6
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:24.347
queue Enrique Iglesias playing in
the background and I import the,

7
00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:30.174
wait what am I doing, that's not what
I want at all, I wanna be over here.

8
00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.943
So I'm going to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Import styled is

9
00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:34.641
what I wanted.

10
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:40.644
I'm gonna import styled
from '@emotions/styled'.

11
00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:46.500
And then we're also gonna grab just
a handful of things from Gatsby.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.405
So we want the link component,
we want the graphql template tag, and then

13
00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:58.188
we're gonna useStaticQuery in here too,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: From Gatsby.

14
00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:04.794
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then, let's set up our Hero,

15
00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:10.531
which is going to be a react component.

16
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:15.490
We don't know if it's gonna take any
props yet, but let's start there.

17
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.075
We're going to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's

18
00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:26.772
just return to start a div.

19
00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:32.442
And so this div that we're going to
return is going to contain some text.

20
00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:37.467
And so what I want to do is I wanna
take this copy here on the homepage,

21
00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:40.475
that looks a little too much like a blog.

22
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:45.371
So what I wanna do is I wanna lift this
out and put a big beautiful image behind

23
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.517
it and get us to a point where,
it kind of looks like a homepage.

24
00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:54.254
So we're gonna take this content and
move it into its own place.

25
00:01:54.254 --> 00:01:59.126
So let's start by just kind of
grabbing the things out that we want,

26
00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.953
so let's rewrite a little bit of copy.

27
00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:06.797
We're going to say
Frontend Masters + Gatsby and

28
00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:12.689
then show a little love so
we'll use the hearts HTML entity.

29
00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.178
Then let's add some text, we're gonna say,

30
00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:24.511
Hello Minnesota, and
we will link to the About page,

31
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.477
and we'll say, Learn about me.

32
00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.091
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
that's gonna set us up to kind

33
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:38.462
of be at least the basics of
what we're trying to do here.

34
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:40.559
So let's export default Hero.

35
00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:48.798
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then in our
layout, we're going to pull this in.

36
00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:54.282
So now that we've got a component to us,
we can import our Hero.

37
00:02:54.282 --> 00:02:57.013
We're going to pull that in from Hero.

38
00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:04.289
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And,
I would like to drop this where?

39
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.949
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: No you know what?

40
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.616
Let's not use this here, because we
only wanna use this on the homepage, so

41
00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:11.874
why would we put this on the layout?

42
00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:13.602
We don't want this on every page.

43
00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:17.608
So instead, let's close the layout file
altogether, we're not gonna use it.

44
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:21.058
Instead we're gonna go down into Pages and
go into Index.

45
00:03:21.058 --> 00:03:26.043
And we're going to
import our Hero from now

46
00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:30.069
it needs to be components/Hero.

47
00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.993
And then we're gonna use that by just
setting it outside of the layout.

48
00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:42.218
Now the reason that I do this is because,
if you remember we told layout to

49
00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:46.331
constrain the width of things, but
I want this image to be full width.

50
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:51.515
So I'm just gonna drop it right out here,
but that means that now

51
00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:57.769
I need to put in a fragment to enclose
that otherwise react is gonna yell at us.

52
00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.465
So in doing that,
now we've got this section up top.

53
00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:03.040
We've got our heading up there.

54
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.666
That also means that I
can drop out this stuff.

55
00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:11.233
I'm gonna just keep the blog part.

56
00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:15.966
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, getting closer.

57
00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:20.759
So now we've got a header section
we're gonna read the blog.

58
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.263
Let's grab an image for this.

59
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:28.136
And so the image that I'm going to
grab is an image of Minneapolis.

60
00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:31.845
So I'm gonna go to Unsplash,
and I'm going to search for

61
00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:36.517
Minneapolis,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And let's see,

62
00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:38.289
this one looks good.

63
00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.070
Lets get this one.

64
00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:44.753
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then,
we need to be able to access this, so

65
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:46.817
a few things are gonna happen.

66
00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:49.824
I'm going to just start closing out
all the stuff we're not using anymore.

67
00:04:53.156 --> 00:04:58.459
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's get down
to just the Hero and the index.

68
00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:04.569
So in my hero, I wanna set this
background image on this thing here,

69
00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.554
so I'm gonna create a new react component.

70
00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:13.738
Now I could put this in a different file,
but I don't really wanna

71
00:05:13.738 --> 00:05:18.639
deal with that so
instead I'm going to do a styled ('div')

72
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.635
and,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's

73
00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:28.350
just make this background image.

74
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.128
And where am I gonna find this, right?

75
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:35.180
So if I want just an image,
Gatsby is going to put anything

76
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.128
in this static folder,
it's gonna make it available,

77
00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:44.993
so let's create a new folder,
we'll call it Images.

78
00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:49.411
I'm going to take this image
that we downloaded and

79
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:56.398
I'm gonna drop it right in here and then
we'll keep the photographer's name but

80
00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.805
we're just gonna change this to be mn.

81
00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:06.224
So that means then I can get images and

82
00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:13.067
it was /NicoleHarrington mn.jpeg.

83
00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:21.207
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So let's drop this in,
we gonna use this image background now,

84
00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:22.822
and let's see what happens.

85
00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:25.800
I bet it's going to look bad.

86
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.459
Yeah, it looks bad so
let's make it look better.

87
00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:32.205
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So the first thing
that we wanna do is we want to make sure

88
00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:33.552
that we're actually showing the image.

89
00:06:33.552 --> 00:06:39.363
So let's set the background position and
I looked at this ahead of time and

90
00:06:39.363 --> 00:06:45.548
I know what it needs to look like, so
it's gonna be 20% offset from the top,

91
00:06:45.548 --> 00:06:49.317
and then we're gonna
center it horizontally.

92
00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:52.388
Then we're gonna set the background size,

93
00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:57.285
my background size needs to be cover,
and what cover means is the image

94
00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:01.196
will be as big as it can be to
occupy all available space.

95
00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:04.236
And that means if it's
wider than it is tall,

96
00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:08.320
all of that extra height will
end up being cut off and hidden.

97
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.390
And that is nice because what it
means is we're still not there but

98
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.504
now at least you can sort of tell it's a
photo of a city, so we're getting closer.

99
00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:23.237
So next I would like to add a text box
which is gonna kind of give us the spacing

100
00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:28.515
and center this text, because we want
this text to be in the middle and

101
00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:31.811
lined up with everything else on our blog.

102
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.599
So, we're gonna wrap this
thing in a text box and

103
00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.748
the way that we're gonna do that is,
we're just gonna do another styled

104
00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:43.614
('div'),
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And

105
00:07:43.614 --> 00:07:48.185
let's set this one to be,
I'm gonna give this one a background

106
00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:52.410
image of a linear gradient
because we want to make sure that

107
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.655
there's enough contrast on
the text to actually read it.

108
00:07:56.655 --> 00:08:01.542
So we're gonna set this to run to the top,

109
00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:07.278
we're gonna start it at,
let's see ddbbffdd.

110
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:11.998
If you haven't seen this before,
this is hex with an alpha channel, so

111
00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:14.996
I am setting this to be
kind of a high opacity.

112
00:08:14.996 --> 00:08:18.572
And then it's going to fade to,

113
00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:24.266
it's going to start at
the 2rem from the bottom and

114
00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:31.435
then that is going to fade to a ddbbff00,
which is 0 opacity.

115
00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:36.163
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm gonna
set this to be display flex,

116
00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:40.049
because I want to be able to
position the content vertically and

117
00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:44.253
horizontally without having to do
a bunch of weird, hacky things.

118
00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:47.545
I'm gonna set the flex-direction to column
because I wanna control it up and down.

119
00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:54.805
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I'm also going
to set the height to be 100%, and

120
00:08:54.805 --> 00:09:02.621
I'm going to justify this content to
the bottom of the box by using flex-end.

121
00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:07.550
We can set some padding on here,
so we don't want any top or

122
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:13.585
bottom padding, but we want to use
that same setup that we used before to

123
00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:19.019
get the right amount of,
let's see we're gonna divide by two,

124
00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:23.575
that'll give us that 550 or,
as wide as it can go.

125
00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:27.385
And then we will give it a little
space at the bottom actually so

126
00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:32.016
that we don't have the text just kind
of crammed into the bottom like this.

127
00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:38.915
So then we're gonna set
it to width of 100%.

128
00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:45.503
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then we're gonna
style up the the actual components, and so

129
00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:47.764
I'm gonna do this using child selectors.

130
00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:51.561
You could do this by creating
styled components for each thing,

131
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:53.115
you could use inline CSS.

132
00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:57.393
I just wanted to show some options because
we've been using the CSS prop a lot, and

133
00:09:57.393 --> 00:09:59.315
I wanted to show that you can in fact,

134
00:09:59.315 --> 00:10:02.184
use just you know standard
CSS selectors here as well.

135
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:06.374
So this is gonna be any H1 inside of
a text box is how that's gonna work.

136
00:10:06.374 --> 00:10:11.408
We're going to set this to have
a little bit of a text shadow so

137
00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:16.542
that it shows up 1 pixel ,1 pixel
will blur that 3 pixels and

138
00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:20.013
then we will set it to
be about that color.

139
00:10:20.013 --> 00:10:21.391
Make the font size a little bit bigger.

140
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.820
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: About
that will look good.

141
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.061
And then for the paragraphs and the links,
we want to control the color here,

142
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:34.693
so we're gonna make it the darker color to
make sure that we get enough contrast, and

143
00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:36.999
we're also gonna remove the top margin.

144
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.429
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And for the the link,

145
00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:46.804
we're going to actually override
that margin top a little bit.

146
00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:51.711
And this is really just me being lazy and
not wanting to write the color

147
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:55.601
out twice I could do this by
copying this down as well and

148
00:10:55.601 --> 00:11:01.629
not having that be a duplicate selector,
but again, it's all kind of preference.

149
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:06.322
And then I'm going to wrap
this whole thing into the,

150
00:11:06.322 --> 00:11:10.923
what was it,
text box is what I called it, TextBox.

151
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.240
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Put this around and
let's see what happens.

152
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.786
Okay, we're getting closer.

153
00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:24.746
It's, we got our gradient here it's
getting some color, but we do still have

154
00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:29.571
this margin so we're wanna fix that cuz
I want it to just sit right on the top.

155
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:33.746
So we're just gonna say for
the image background why don't

156
00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:38.422
you,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Whatever the next

157
00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:44.134
element is, take away that top margin,
and I also want some height on this so

158
00:11:44.134 --> 00:11:49.340
I'm gonna set it to be 50% of
the vertical height of the view port.

159
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.753
So, hey, that looks all right.

160
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:57.748
And this would work for us,
this would give us what we want.

161
00:11:57.748 --> 00:12:02.485
We can read the text, we've got a link,
it takes us to our About page.

162
00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.182
Cool, I'm happy.

163
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.090
I'm not upset about this.
