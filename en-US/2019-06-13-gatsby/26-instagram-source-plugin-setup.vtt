1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.687
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: We're gonna build
ourselves a component that loads post from

2
00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:03.310
Instagram.

3
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.380
So we're going to just grab any
Instagram account that we want and

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.180
we'll be able to display
data from that post and

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.620
we're going to do that through the same
graph QL layer that we've used for

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.650
our post for our images for
everything else.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.334
So what we're gonna do now is,

8
00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:28.965
we are going to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Install

9
00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:32.140
one more plug-in.

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.920
I think this is the penultimate
plug-in we're gonna install.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.900
I love when I get to use
that word in a sentence.

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.752
So we're gonna install
gatsby-source-instagram.

13
00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:50.550
And source plug-ins in
Gatsby are plentiful.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.981
Depending on what you want, let's see,

15
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:59.924
you are able to find 272 source plug-ins.

16
00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:04.926
So you can load, let's see,
what's at the top,

17
00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:10.660
PostgreSQL, any API end point,
big commerce, Vimeo.

18
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.830
Pretty much any CMS that exposes
an API we've got a plug-in for.

19
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960
We've got some weird stuff in here,
like you can use Google Sheets.

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990
Like you can load a Google spreadsheet
as a data source for Gatsby.

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.894
So like if you've got tabular data,
it totally works.

22
00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:32.760
You can, we've got plugins for
all sorts of things like there.

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.210
You will not have a hard time
finding a plug-in for what you need.

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.320
And if you do find yourself
needing a plug-in,

25
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.490
we also have good docs that
will be getting better soon,

26
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.460
on how to build your own plug-ins for
pretty much any data source.

27
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.320
Did you have a question?

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.370
&gt;&gt; Student: So
these are maintained by Gatsby?

29
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.640
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Not all of them are,
no.

30
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.100
Some of them are maintained by Gatsby.

31
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.330
If you find like File system is here.

32
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.940
And you'll see this one
is an official plugin.

33
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.570
So if it says an official plugin,
that means that we maintain it.

34
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.943
You can also just see a whole list of
those if you go to the github gatsbyjs

35
00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:14.930
slash gatsby.

36
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.300
We use a monerripo so

37
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.520
all of the packages that we maintain
are also in this packages folder.

38
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.330
And so you can see everything that is
actively maintained by Gatsby in here.

39
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:36.290
So now that we've got our Instagram plug
in installed, we're going to configure it.

40
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.473
So let's jump into Gatsby config
which I already have opened, and

41
00:02:43.473 --> 00:02:48.474
down at the bottom here,
I'm going to resolve

42
00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:53.490
Gatsby source Instagram and
the options are.

43
00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:59.701
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Just the username,
so we're gonna set the username we need,

44
00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:04.450
I'm gonna use the gatsbyjs Instagram,
you can use any Instagram you want.

45
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.010
This is all public data, so you don't
need API keys or anything like that.

46
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.320
After installing this,
we're able to npm run develop.

47
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.960
And I'm gonna jump back into the GraphQL
Playground, once this finishes booting.

48
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.140
There we go.

49
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.200
Gonna refresh the page, make sure
that we've got all of this new stuff.

50
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.520
And now, I wanna see what's new,
what's in here now.

51
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.980
All instant node.

52
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.480
Okay.

53
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.480
Get those.

54
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.050
What does that give us?

55
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.989
How about the,
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Local file?

56
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.940
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Child image sharp,
what's this?

57
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.060
We're optimizing Instagram images for you.

58
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.040
Yes, we certainly are.

59
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.420
So now we can do a source set of
your Instagram photos as well.

60
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.228
And so now, I don't know what this is but
I'm gonna pull it up anyways, ops!

61
00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:12.600
Let's go.
Local host 8000, yeah.

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.020
So there's an image from our Instagram,
that's the 200 pixel version, and

63
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.530
it's like been fully optimized for us,
we don't have to do anything, we just

64
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.290
installed it in because gatsby transformer
sharp was available, it did the work.

65
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.600
So now,
we can use this to do fun things with.

66
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.648
What we will do is,
let's create a new component and

67
00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:39.906
we're gonna call this component, Insta.

68
00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:47.480
So inside Insta.js,
we're going to import react from react.

69
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.379
We're gonna import Image cuz we're gonna
be using Gatsby image from Gatsby image.

70
00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.550
We're going to import the CSS
tag from emotion/core.

71
00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:05.900
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: And
let's set up our components.

72
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.930
So we've got use Insta.

73
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.360
All right, we've got our Insta
component and that is going to,

74
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080
eventually, this is gonna need data.

75
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.773
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Once we have data,
we're gonna return, so

76
00:05:21.773 --> 00:05:24.770
we'll just start by kinda
scaffolding this out.

77
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.645
You're gonna return a fragment, cuz again,

78
00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:32.450
we don't wanna populate the DOM with
a bunch of junk divs if we don't have to.

79
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.730
So we'll set up an h2.

80
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.970
This is gonna say Instagram posts from.

81
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.220
And eventually,
we'll want the username to be dynamic, but

82
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.666
we can hard code it for now.

83
00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:49.810
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Then,
we're gonna wanna show all of our posts.

84
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.060
And those are gonna be
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Shown here.

85
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.090
And then underneath that,

86
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.080
we're going to want to,
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Link to the post.

87
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.210
So we can say.

88
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.510
It's gonna be
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: Link

89
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.460
out to Instagram.com.

90
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.580
This will eventually be not hard-coded.

91
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.020
We'll grab the username, but
for now, we can just do that.

92
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.880
And then we'll say, see more on Instagram.

93
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.960
And we'll use that right
arrow HTML entity again.

94
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.110
So that gives us kind of
a really default setup.

95
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.630
So we will do an export default Insta,
and let's include this somewhere.

96
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.400
So I want this to live on the Index page.

97
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.240
And so then,
I'm just gonna go to the homepage.

98
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.450
And I'm gonna import

99
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.970
in stuff from components and stuff.

100
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:07.880
And then down at the bottom, I want to
just drop this right into the posts.

101
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.950
And it doesn't need any props.

102
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.870
We can just we can run it as is.

103
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.605
So if I save this,
&gt;&gt; Jason Legstorf: And

104
00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.170
I come back out here,
and go to the home page.

105
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.870
We can see that it's sort of ready for

106
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.470
some Instagram posts but
we need to actually get that data.
