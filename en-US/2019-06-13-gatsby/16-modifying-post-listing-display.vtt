00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.392
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We can then
decide how we're gonna display this.

2
00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:08.450
And to make things easy, i'm just gonna
package this up into its own component.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.780
So we can create a new file,
and we're gonna call this one

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.840
post preview, if I can find it.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.534
Here we go.

6
00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:21.990
It's called postpreview.js.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
And inside of it we're going
to import React from React.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.140
We're also going to import the CSX prop
from, or the CSX tag from the emotion.

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.230
Why are you, why are you like that?

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.922
Don't do that.

11
00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:40.676
Here we go.

12
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:47.590
We also need link from Gatsby because
we're going to be linking to the post.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.790
And let's see what else we got.

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.490
We're gonna do a post preview component

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.980
that is going to take
the post as its props.

16
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.556
And then we're going to return something,
and that'll be our export default.

17
00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:14.059
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so in this,
I'm gonna use the article tag.

18
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.150
And we want to, we'll use an h3 because
we put it under an h1 or an h2 I mean.

19
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.080
And that is going to be the post.title.

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.622
We're also going to want to
show the post.excerpt and,

21
00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:41.750
yeah, then we wanna link to read it.

22
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.871
So let's do a link to the post.slug.

23
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.070
Now this page doesn't exist yet,
we still have to create that, but

24
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.210
we will get there In a minute.

25
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.240
So we're gonna say read this post, and

26
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.730
we'll use that right
arrow HTML entity again.

27
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.900
Let's also link the heading.

28
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.960
We want that h1 to show up.

29
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.610
So let's do a link to post slug.

30
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.540
And then I'm just gonna drag this over so
it links the title.

31
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.990
Okay, so that's all good.

32
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.990
We're gonna need to style
this up a little bit.

33
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.860
So let's save it first and
we'll go in and use it.

34
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.050
So I'm gonna import my post preview
from components post preview.

35
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.546
And then down here I'm going to just use
it, post preview, and we need a key.

36
00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:41.163
So the key is gonna be post slug,
we just need something unique, and

37
00:02:41.163 --> 00:02:44.040
then the post is gonna be the post.

38
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.610
We have to use a key when we're mapping
over data because that's how React

39
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.820
knows which component is which for
different updates.

40
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.050
It'll complain if we don't do this.

41
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.760
So we just wanna make sure to give it
something and it has to be unique, so

42
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.059
you can't put in like a string.

43
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.120
So if we save this.

44
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.990
Okay, I mean that's not
terrible out of the gate.

45
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.050
We set some decent defaults,
that's okay, but

46
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.960
let's do a little bit of
styling to make this better.

47
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.190
Let me just pop this over so
we can see what we're doing.

48
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.500
I'm gonna get back into this post preview,
and let's just style this up a bit.

49
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.580
So I've got my CSS prop.

50
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.940
And we're going to,
let's add a border bottom,

51
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.520
give it one pic solid, triple Ds,
and then we'll go margin top,

52
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.510
a little bit of space up there so
that it's not crunched.

53
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.730
Add some padding at the bottom to
give it some breathing room, and

54
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.280
then because we don't want the top
one to be disproportionally

55
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.220
far away from the heading.

56
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.510
We'll also just set
the margin top to 1rem there.

57
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.860
And that should I think give
us most of what we need.

58
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.918
Okay, and now the other thing
that we're gonna do is,

59
00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:09.682
I know that i'm gonna reuse this
read link in a few places, and so

60
00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:15.350
it's not just gonna be in this file,
and I wanna change some styles on it.

61
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.899
So I wanna make this look
a little bit different.

62
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.810
In order to do that,
I wanna make this reusable.

63
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.640
So I'm gonna use a little trick of
just exporting a styled component that

64
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.370
doesn't even render.

65
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.721
And the way that this would work is we're
gonna create a file called readlink.js.

66
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:38.355
And this one is gonna import
styled from emotion/styled,

67
00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:42.668
and I'm also gonna
import link from Gatsby.

68
00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:48.200
And then the read link is
going to be a styled link.

69
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.320
And I just wanna add a couple little
things to make this look nice.

70
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.790
First I'm gonna make it
display in line block so

71
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.800
that it doesn't fill
out the entire screen.

72
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.365
And then I'm also going to set
the font size to a little bit smaller

73
00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:12.190
than the rest of the text around it,
and I'm gonna export that as a default.

74
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.330
And that means now I've just basically
created a little styled component that's,

75
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.070
it doesn't change any functionality
of the link component,

76
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.760
it just makes it look a little different.

77
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.711
So that when I come in here
now I can import that.

78
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:33.810
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And I'm gonna use that
down here to make this just look a little

79
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.470
bit nicer.

80
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.220
And it's a minor thing but
what it does is, that way we don't have to

81
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.660
copy paste that style when I'm inevitably
gonna wanna use this a little bit later.
