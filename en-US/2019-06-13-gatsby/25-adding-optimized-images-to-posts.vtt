00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.891
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Next, if we wanna show
a blog or an image in line in our blog,

2
00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:11.167
we need to
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We

3
00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.718
need to install one more plugin.

4
00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:16.700
Well, actually, let's just try this.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.734
So what you might do,
if you think you were gonna use an image,

6
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.302
is because we've got a relative
path to an image here,

7
00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:27.887
I might think that I could
just write a markdown image.

8
00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:34.669
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And then,
that would be at images

9
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:38.879
slash john tyson hola dot jpeg.

10
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.354
And when I save this and go in.

11
00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:43.884
Crap, it's broken.

12
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:48.757
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Reason for
that is that Gatsby's building this,

13
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.563
it's building all these files.

14
00:00:50.563 --> 00:00:54.760
Which means that the files aren't exactly
where we would expect them to be.

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.390
So an easy way to solve this problem is
to just install Gatsby remark images.

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.560
And we actually have to install it.

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.240
So NPN install.

18
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.180
Gatsby remark images.

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.350
And remark is, if you're not using MDX and

20
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.090
you just wanna use markdown,
you would use Gatsby's remark plugin.

21
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.070
Remark is a markdown parser that can
convert markdown files into HTML.

22
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.570
MDX is compatible with all the remark
plugins, which means that we get

23
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.150
all the benefits of using remark
with the added benefits of react.

24
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.700
So now that I've installed this,
I'm gonna go into the Gatsby config.

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.762
And in my Gatsby MDX, I'm going to set

26
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.839
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: GatsbyRemarkPlugins,

27
00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:52.326
and that is an array.

28
00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:58.991
And then, I'm just gonna
resolve gatsby-remark-images.

29
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.434
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And upon doing that,
I can restart my server.

30
00:02:13.928 --> 00:02:15.955
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, and it works.

31
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:21.637
And if we look, we'll also see
it's working with Gatsby image.

32
00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:24.584
So it's doing that same optimization,

33
00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:30.393
that same conversion to high-performance
images so that we're not loading,

34
00:02:30.393 --> 00:02:36.287
even though what we actually put into
the blog folder is a 3.5 megabyte image,

35
00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:41.078
what's being downloaded to
the browser is 34.9 kilobytes.

36
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:46.020
So again, kind of saves us from ourselves.

37
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.010
No matter how lazy we get, and
just embed whatever image,

38
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.770
we don't do any optimization, we're not
just yeah, cool, grab something off and

39
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.590
splash and throw it in here.

40
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.065
We do that, and Gatsby is like okay,
cool, I got you, don't worry about it.

41
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.280
Do your thing.

42
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.060
Your co-workers aren't gonna like it
when they have to download 150 megabytes

43
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.816
images off Git.

44
00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:07.360
But otherwise,
you're gonna be in great shape here.

45
00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:13.851
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So that is really,
I mean, there's more to this,

46
00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:16.833
you can go a lot deeper on images.

47
00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.887
Like I said,
you can convert these to trace SVGs,

48
00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:24.328
we've got some external plug-ins that
will allow do things like create

49
00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:27.120
simplified polygon drawings of the images.

50
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.923
Which is really, looks like art direction.

51
00:03:28.923 --> 00:03:33.978
I'll just show you using Gatsby image.

52
00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:36.169
I think this is it.

53
00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.345
Hope that works.

54
00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:39.380
Yeah, here we go.

55
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.040
So this is like the the standard blur up.

56
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.600
You can also set like
a plain background color.

57
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.780
So it it loads in like that.

58
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.760
We've got this traced SVG
look where the images become

59
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.230
like simplified traced
versions of themselves.

60
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.590
Which is really cool.

61
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.900
And each of these is just an option.

62
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.560
You just you choose that option,
you pick the colors you want.

63
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.189
This is a foreground and background color.

64
00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.085
And then you get those benefits.

65
00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:06.000
WebP is kind of the same thing.

66
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.243
And then, the other one that we've got is,
let's see, Gatsby nodes.

67
00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:15.157
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And this one does
some really cool stuff where it will

68
00:04:15.157 --> 00:04:15.718
show you

69
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.782
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Where's
the actual demo?

70
00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:19.844
Is it here?

71
00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.696
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So it does these
like kind of stylized drawings.

72
00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:32.383
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yeah,
that doesn't look as cool as I want it to.

73
00:04:32.383 --> 00:04:34.690
I wish there was a better demo in this.

74
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.180
Anyways, it's really cool to see because
it just looks at your images and

75
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.300
tries to draw versions of it.

76
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.610
Anyways, I thought I had
a better example of that.

77
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.250
But that is how images work in MDX and
in Gatsby.
