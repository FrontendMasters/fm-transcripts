00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.665
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So this is kind
of like our step0, the fundamentals.

2
00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:07.365
At this point, if you are lost and
you wanna jump ahead,

3
00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:11.965
there's another branch that
you can jump to which is,

4
00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:15.376
I should have pulled this up somewhere.

5
00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:23.384
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's see,
github.com/frontendmasters/gatsby-intro.

6
00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:24.970
So each of these is its own branch.

7
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.244
We just did step0.

8
00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:30.865
If you wanna jump ahead, you can just
check this branch, step0/pages-and-links,

9
00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.968
and that will get you to where we are now.

10
00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:42.319
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So our next goal
is going to be to set up some styles.

11
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.147
So we're gonna do the step1 now.
