00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.316
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Styles and

2
00:00:01.316 --> 00:00:06.113
Gatsby are are actually fairly flexible
you can do them with regular CSS.

3
00:00:06.113 --> 00:00:11.368
You can use CSS modules, you can use
any of the CSS and JS solutions.

4
00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:13.215
All of them have their trade offs, for

5
00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.217
this particular workshop we're
going to be using Emotion but

6
00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:19.636
there's nothing that stops you from
using really whatever you want.

7
00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:21.633
We are gonna be using Emotion for this.

8
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.770
Emotion is one of many flavors of CSS and
JS.

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.844
There is no right or

10
00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:30.017
wrong solution here this is just very
much gonna come down to preference.

11
00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:32.770
You don't even need to use CSS and
JS with Gatsby.

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.239
You can use CSS modules or just plain
CSS files, it really is up to you.

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.825
So to make this work,

14
00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:45.160
what we're going to do is we're going
to install a few new dependencies.

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.400
So I'm going to stop my server.

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.436
I'm hitting Ctrl+C to do that and
then, let's clear so

17
00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:52.980
it's a little easier to see.

18
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.720
How's my font size?

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.490
Can everybody read it?

20
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.120
Okay, so we're going to do an npm install.

21
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:08.351
And I'm going to install
@emotion/core @emotion/styled and

22
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:12.480
gatsby-plugin-emotion.

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.191
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: So emotion/core is
gonna give us access to global styles and

24
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.910
to the CSS prop which we wanna use.

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.510
And then emotion/styled gives us
a styled components kind of interface.

26
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.724
We'll look at a few different ways
to do styles and mix and match.

27
00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:38.013
And then gatsby-plugin-emotion is to add
the things that we need for Gatsby to

28
00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:42.237
build with Emotion properly, made ads,
a Babel plugin and some other stuff so

29
00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:45.960
that you don't have to think about
it again, we want this to be easy.

30
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.820
So you install the plugin and
things are just gonna work.

31
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.815
So let me get this installing.

32
00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:56.000
So to configure plugins,
we have to create a file out here and

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.660
this file is called gatsby-config.

34
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.032
And this is an optional file only if you
want to change things in your gatsby site.

35
00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.937
It's set up using the common JS style, so

36
00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:10.770
you are going to do module.exports and
then this exports an object.

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.595
You can leave this empty if you want,

38
00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:18.989
again none of the fields in here
are required, they are all optional.

39
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.652
We want to include plug-ins and

40
00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:24.180
the plug-in that we want to
include is gatsby-plugin-emotion.

41
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.090
So having done this,
Gatsby now knows how to use Emotion.

42
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.544
So this is kind of like the matrix,
you just download the knowledge and

43
00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:32.850
you know kung fu, and you're ready to go.

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.670
So once you've got this typed in, that's
the last you need to think about config.

45
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910
We can just start writing some code.

46
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.960
And the way that we're going to do this
is we're going to create a common layout.

47
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.850
So on any website,
you're probably gonna have a header and

48
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.220
maybe some navigation, some stuff
that stays the same between pages.

49
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.730
And we also probably want something like,
if I make this full screen,

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.710
this is kinda junky, it's all stuck
to the side of page and stuff.

51
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.730
That's not really what we want.

52
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.980
So instead,
let's come up with a way to style this and

53
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.310
make it look nice as
it's currently set up.

54
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.480
And make that sharable, so kind of
global styles and all those good things.

55
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.356
So to do that, I'm gonna create a new
folder, and folder names in this source

56
00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:24.548
directory, aside from pages, are up to
you, you can call them whatever you want.

57
00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:27.599
And I'm gonna create a file
called layout.js, and so in this,

58
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.629
this is gonna be another react component,
so we're gonna import react from react.

59
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.098
And then I want to import Global and
the CSS prop from emotion/core.

60
00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:49.100
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Then I am going to
just set this up to be a named constant.

61
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.452
The reason that I'm doing that is because
if you're trying to debug your react,

62
00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:55.569
it's helpful to name the components.

63
00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.588
It makes life a little bit easier.

64
00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:01.107
In a layout component, it's a little bit
special because what we're going to do is

65
00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:04.627
we are just going to wrap things with the
layout, and then anything that gets passed

66
00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:07.367
to that, as child content,
we're just going to display them.

67
00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:08.940
We're not gonna do anything to it.

68
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.960
And we're going to take advantage of
react children prop to make that happen.

69
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.430
So, down here,
we can just set up our file.

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.309
So we'll start with the react fragment,
and

71
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.192
the first thing that we want to
do is set up our global styles.

72
00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:33.860
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
just looking at how this works.

73
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.800
Global is a react component that Emotion
gives us that allows us to set up

74
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.680
basically styles that are going
to show up in the Global scope.

75
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.710
So this is what you would
imagine is like traditional CSS.

76
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.750
Anything that we put here is going to
be applied to everything on the page.
