WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.900
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: To see this in action,
we can do npm run develop.

2
00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:15.532
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, and if you
remember, when we looked at this last

3
00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:19.700
time, it showed us the site,
site plug-ins.

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.229
Well, if I reload now.

5
00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:23.300
Now I've got stuff.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.390
I've got the files.

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.900
I've got MDX.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.970
I've got a whole bunch of new things,
all that became available, but

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.830
you'll notice that they all
kinda sorta look the same.

10
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.310
Like we've got a list of
fields that come back.

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.500
Some of them are the same,
some of them are different.

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.421
But what I wanna do is,
I just wanna make a query for

13
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:47.470
all MDX.

14
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.550
And we're gonna do this the same way
that we did in the the site metadata.

15
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.880
So I'm gonna do all,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: All MDX.

16
00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:09.712
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And I want to get the
nodes and so, in graph ql speak this is

17
00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:15.190
kind of the,
most theory that we'll get into today.

18
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.320
Graph ql is based on graph theory,

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130
which is a way of kind of describing
relationships between things.

20
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.480
And so you've got, when you look at data,

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.070
you've got nodes,
which is the data itself.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.048
And then you've got edges, which is the
relationship between the different nodes.

23
00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:36.400
Because of that, you'll see in graph
ql queries, especially in gatsby,

24
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.190
that will have like edges, nodes,
or like edges and then node.

25
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.550
When you see that, just know edge
is describing a relationship,

26
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.800
node is describing the data itself and
nodes here is just shorthand so

27
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.360
we can say, all of the data
that comes back from all MDX.

28
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.100
And let's get the excerpt
of each of our MDX files.

29
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.910
Okay, we got data.

30
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.760
We've got the excerpt that is the first
blog post and the second blog post.

31
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360
So what if I want that front matter?

32
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.160
Well, let's hit command or option space.

33
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190
And there's my front matter.

34
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.150
Said option space and see what's in here.

35
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.816
Title slogan author, perfect subtitle.

36
00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:20.304
Slug, author.

37
00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:26.410
Okay, we've got our,
got ourselves a thing, it's happening.

38
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.050
And now I wanna change this out so

39
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.330
that we're displaying these
blog posts on the homepage.

40
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.970
Because right now, when I go home,
it's not showing anything.

41
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.210
We don't necessarily want to.

42
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.690
We don't have enough content for
a dedicated home page, right?

43
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.740
So let's show blog posts there.

44
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.964
So the way that we're gonna do that is
we're going to create another hook to load

45
00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:50.660
our blog post.

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.500
So let's go in to our hooks.

47
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.030
Let's create a new one.

48
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.406
This one's gonna be called use-posts.js.

49
00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:06.385
And I'm going to import graph ql and
useStaticQuery again from gatsby.

50
00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:12.480
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
then, describe that hook.

51
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.390
So usePosts, doesn't take any arguments.

52
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.609
If you wanted to get more creative here,

53
00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.624
you could theoretically add
ways to filter and stuff.

54
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.990
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: We don't need
that here, so we're not gonna bother.

55
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.200
But there are a lot of options.

56
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.640
So we're gonna do useStaticQuery,
get this graph ql template tag in there.

57
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.400
And then, I'm going to pull out
this query that we just wrote.

58
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.095
Let's grab that and drop it right in.

59
00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:44.857
So again, we're

60
00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:50.360
loading from gatsby's data layer,
all the MDX files,

61
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.950
and then we get into each node and
look at its front matter and its excerpt.

62
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.430
And of the front matter we want
the title slug and author.

63
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.980
Go ahead.

64
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where did that
front matter come from?

65
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.670
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The front
matter is this part here.

66
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so that's.

67
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.733
You didn't define front matter.

68
00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.070
It's just inside the fences
that's the word for it?

69
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.502
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Yeah, so this is
a convention that you'll see in MDX and

70
00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:14.519
markdown, is you kinda just do YML
definitions up at the top, and

71
00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.210
it will automatically parse that out,
it's what's called front matter.

72
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.050
So yeah, that's not a gatsby thing,

73
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.100
that's a, I believe a just
like generic markdown thing.

74
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.810
At least all the markdown
parsing libraries I've seen

75
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.870
have some variation on front matter.

76
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.650
So now that we've got our use-posts,
we are going to simplify this.

77
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.670
So I want to actually return an object.

78
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.790
And the object that I wanna return,

79
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.310
is going to look,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Let's see.

80
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.335
I want it to have the title.

81
00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:56.192
I want it to have the author.

82
00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:58.270
I want it to have the slug.

83
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.223
And I want it to have the excerpt.

84
00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:04.265
And I need to get that for

85
00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:09.170
each post which means that I
also am going to have to loop so

86
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.098
i'm going to do data.allmdx.nodes.map and
that gives me a post,

87
00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:21.600
and then I'm gonna return this,
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Okay, so

88
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.520
I just did some kind of like wrap around
coding so just to step through this again.

89
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.980
I'm getting the data out of the query and

90
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.130
then I'm stepping into it allMdx.nodes and
then I'm mapping over those.

91
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.638
And each of those is going to be a post
object that has the front matter and

92
00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:41.551
the excerpt.

93
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:46.920
I'm implicit returning an object
that has these four items in it.

94
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.130
And I'm doing this for convenience.

95
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.120
Again, I don't wanna have to type like
data.allMdx.nodes.frontmatter.title.

96
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.270
I wanna be able to just say post.title.

97
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.130
So what I'm doing is I'm taking my post,
and

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.210
then I'm gonna say post.frontmatter.title,
and that gives me what I want.

99
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.650
And I can drop this down here and
say author.

100
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.980
Same here for slug.

101
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.730
And then this one is not
in the front matter.

102
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.940
So it's just post.excerpt.

103
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.330
So this will now give us a like,
simplified object so

104
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.250
that we're only loading the stuff that we
need to use in a way that's easy to use.

105
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.350
So let's export that.

106
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.850
Export default use hosts.

107
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.790
Okay.

108
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.480
And then on the home page,
we are going to actually use those.

109
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.249
So let's go to index.

110
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.180
Let's import that hook.

111
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.920
Import usePosts from hooks/use-posts.

112
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.029
And then same thing here.

113
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.463
We need to get rid of the implicit return.

114
00:06:57.463 --> 00:07:01.313
So now we have our default export.

115
00:07:01.313 --> 00:07:06.905
So I'm gonna do const posts = usePosts().

116
00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:11.620
And then down here,
I can just add another section.

117
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.090
Let's do h2, read my blog.

118
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.380
Not react my blog.

119
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.380
Boy, that's muscle memory.

120
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.880
So I can do post.map and get a post.

121
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.170
And we're gonna return and react element.

122
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.900
So we haven't written
this react element yet.

123
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.320
So for now, let's just dump this.

124
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.072
This is my favorite way to
debug in react in general,

125
00:07:38.072 --> 00:07:43.004
is to just
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Take whatever it

126
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.320
is that I just got and do json.stringify.

127
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.900
The thing that I wanna log, null, because
I can't remember what that change is.

128
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.770
And then two spaces so
that it's kinda nice looking.

129
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.840
So if I change that, and then I come back
out here, it's gonna show me the content.

130
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.900
So we can see, all right, we're looping
through, and we're showing their blog.

131
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.075
That's great.
That's what we want.
