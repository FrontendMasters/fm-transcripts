00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: The ultimate goal here
is that we wanna give you good defaults so

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.080
that, right out of the gate,
you will create a Gatsby site and publish

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.940
it with no changes, and you're gonna score
straight hundreds on performance audits.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.220
You're going to deliver an experience
that loads in under a second, or

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.320
under two seconds, for
people on mobile phones.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.900
And these are the types of things
that make a huge difference.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.660
We're not talking about strict
performance in this workshop.

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.246
But there have been a ton of studies about
how much it affects conversion rates and

9
00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.969
revenue to have a web site load faster.

10
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.011
Over three seconds you start
losing about 50% of your traffic.

11
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.990
That's a really high bounce rate.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.900
And so you wanna make sure that
you're getting under that.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.780
So under the hood we set
a bunch of good defaults.

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.700
We follow the purple pattern,

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.080
which if you've ever listened
to he talks about this a lot.

16
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.060
I'm not going into what that is today, but

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.460
this is a great thing to Google
later if you're interested.

18
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.620
If you're not interested,
don't worry about it.

19
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.050
Gatsby does it for you.

20
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.850
We also do other
performance best practices,

21
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.070
code splitting, and pre-fetching in
the background and all this stuff.

22
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.840
We generate only static assets so

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.920
we're not gonna make you stand
up a node server in production.

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950
We're not gonna make you
worry about whether or

25
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.700
not your database is highly available.

26
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330
It doesn't matter because you
only need your server and

27
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.560
your database to be available during
build, and then after that the site can't

28
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.480
really go down unless the CDN fails and
so that gives you security benefits.

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.990
There is no database access so

30
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.390
you can't get your database
hacked through your website.

31
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.320
It's a static site.

32
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.600
They can deface it, but then you just
like reupload the files and it's gone.

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.660
They have no server access.

34
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.680
They have no database access.

35
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.670
You also optimized and
lazy-load your assets.

36
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.530
So your images are gonna get
automatically scaled down and

37
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130
we generate the right sizes for
different resolutions.

38
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.630
We do a lazy-loading solution that's going
to kind of blur in the full size image so

39
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.300
that you don't get jank
as the images load.

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.120
But also it doesn't block
the page from loading.

41
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.180
We normalize third-party data.

42
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.520
We talked about this
with the content mesh.

43
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.260
Again, the reason this is valuable
in setting right defaults,

44
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.760
making the right thing the easy thing,
is if you're running an agency,

45
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.230
if you're working as a freelancer,
your clients are gonna have

46
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.780
different systems that they use where
one's gonna wanna use this CMS.

47
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780
One's gonna wanna use that CMS.

48
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.650
And the overhead of switching between
those projects can be really high.

49
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.420
But if you're using Gatsby,
because it's normalizing that data,

50
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.200
your team now has a lot of transferability
because the overall structure of working

51
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.420
on a Gatsby site is really familiar,
no matter where the data comes from,

52
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.760
because it's just
reacting GraphQL queries.

53
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.089
So you get a lot more
crossover between teams,

54
00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:48.168
a lot more ability to quickly collaborate,
without a lot of context switching.

55
00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:51.116
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: But importantly,

56
00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:54.010
we wanna make sure that
developers don't lose control.

57
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.330
One of the things that's really
challenging about zero-config solutions

58
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.910
is that they set good defaults.

59
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.250
But then when you find yourself
wanting to leave those defaults,

60
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.730
you end up ejecting the entire app.

61
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.290
You have to maintain everything.

62
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.550
So we wanted to make it so that if you
need to add a new web pack loader,

63
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.270
if you wanna change up your babble
config and use type script or reason or

64
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.980
whatever as your build layer for
your Gatsby site, you can do that.

65
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.860
You can modify this config.

66
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.010
But you only have to
customize what you need.

67
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.550
If you change your web pack config, that
doesn't mean that you have to completely

68
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.160
give up all of Gatsby's defaults and
then suddenly manage them yourselves.

69
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.100
You're able to just customize the thing
that you want to customize and then we'll

70
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.170
compose that together so that you are only
ejecting the piece that you need.

71
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.610
We call this progressive
disclosure of complexity.

72
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.882
If you are interested in the kinda
learning theory behind why we do that and

73
00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:51.770
what we're after I've got
a blog post on it and

74
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.720
we talk about it kind of frequently.

75
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.980
It's a little beyond what we
want to talk about today.
