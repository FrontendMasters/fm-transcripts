00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.830
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So, like I said,

2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.080
what localized script was intended to do
originally was take different versions of

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.270
a language, or take different
versions of a word, and pass it in.

4
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.630
You can pass it in as Spanish,
you can pass it in as French, and

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.000
swap it out dynamically on the frontend.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
But what we're gonna do is hack it to pass
in some valuable data that we'll need for

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.650
interacting with our WordPress site.

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.639
So, just like the other one,
it takes the, well, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.760
It takes the handle of
the file that we enqued.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.624
So, before if we named our file
when we were enquing it theme/js,

11
00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:32.460
we put theme/js here to
let it know what to load.

12
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.960
The next one is the name of the variable
we want to attach all the values to

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.339
in our JavaScript.

14
00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.041
So, when we run this,
there's going to be a global variable,

15
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.518
like window dot name for
js will be a variable.

16
00:00:48.518 --> 00:00:50.980
We can just run it in the consult and
get the value.

17
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.870
So, this is a good thing and kind of
a bad thing that's going to be made

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.510
publically available or not publically
on page, but you could access it.

19
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.290
It's great for scripts because, if
there's stuff we need to figure out from

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.390
WordPress, for example,
if we wanna figure out the name or

21
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.060
the URL of our site, this is dynamic
content that could potentially change.

22
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.310
How do we figure out?

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.670
What about the name of it or
the description of our site?

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.310
All of these are things that someone
could change on a whim, on the fly, so

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.910
these are type of things
that we could pass in.

26
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.160
And this is all page PM not really
going to get into the details of

27
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.060
what this is doing.

28
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.440
But you could take a look at it and guess,
hey, this top one is going to give me some

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.920
sort of sanitized version
of the url to my site.

30
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.450
And then the bottom one is going to
give me the name of my site, right.

31
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.460
We could figure out that much.

32
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730
It's about,
it's much as we need to know about this.

33
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.970
And I'll give you the exact data we
need to pass in at different times, but

34
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.840
this is the other major thing
that we do need to know about.

35
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.510
So between localized script and

36
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.810
wp enqueue scripts That's going to
be where all the magic happens.

37
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.840
Last little bit, like I said
WordPress needs to take these things

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.070
that we setup so take our JavaScript file,
poured it into the backend magical

39
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.840
caverns of WordPress and then dump it
out on to the page at the right time.

40
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.590
And the way we do that is by hooking
into WordPress' action and hook system.

41
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.620
So, where we see wp_enqueue_scripts
here under add actions.

42
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.870
This is telling WordPress, hey at this
exact time, when you're about to load

43
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.600
all the scripts onto the page,
whether it's CSS or JavaScript.

44
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.710
Go ahead and run my script too.

45
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.530
So WordPress is chugging along.

46
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.860
It's building out your page.

47
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.410
It has the head stuff.

48
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.700
It's getting close down to the footer now,
and then it's going to see this and

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.909
say hey I've got to include.

50
00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.539
Glued this in queue script, and
I've got to localize it and

51
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.169
pass it some custom data.

52
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.009
Bless you.

53
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.339
So these few things together
are what we're going to work on

54
00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.499
with our first few exercises and
getting comfortable with this stuff
