00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.320
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Open up the functions.php
file as the first step, and

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.690
locate the wp_enqueue_script function
inside of jsforwp_enqueue_scripts.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.605
Okay, so here is my

4
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:19.613
jsforwp_enqueue_scripts.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And

5
00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:24.499
the instruction is to change
path/to/file.js to assets/js/theme.js and

6
00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.377
that makes sense, all right?

7
00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:29.830
If we look in our structure,
we're here in our functions.

8
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.998
We wanna go into our assets,
JS, theme and load it.

9
00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:40.678
Perfect, okay, so come down to
where we have path/to/file.js and

10
00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:46.180
we're gonna change that
to assets/js/theme.

11
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.450
Honestly if you all wanna copy and paste
this stuff up here down below I don't

12
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.720
really care, again the exercise
isn't to type it out manually.

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.460
It's to identify again and again
the stuff that you're gonna be changing.

14
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.384
So once you do this,
come back over to your site.

15
00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:05.058
Were there any other instructions?

16
00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:07.823
Activate the theme,
load it in the browser, look for

17
00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:10.380
it loaded in the message console.

18
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.090
So if I come back over to my site and
I pop open my console, there we go,

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.570
I'm seeing loaded.
