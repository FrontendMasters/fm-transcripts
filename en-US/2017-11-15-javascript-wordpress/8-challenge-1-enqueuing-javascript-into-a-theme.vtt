1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: These are the practice
exercises that we're gonna do.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.141
And let's swap over,
hopefully, at this point,

3
00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:09.433
everybody has pulled down
the repo that we have.

4
00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:16.566
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And
if you go to just github.com/zgordon,

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:21.420
it'll be pinned as
the Frontend Masters just for WP.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.490
And we want to be looking in this
first section here in queuing

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.490
JavaScript init theme.

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.577
So before we get into exactly
how we're gonna do all this,

9
00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:36.979
just something about all of our
project exercises to start of and

10
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.448
I'll you in the code other than
this might be a little bit easier.

11
00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.370
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Okay, so
all of our exercises have two parts.

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.750
They have the actual exercise that
you should be playing with, and

13
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.490
then it has completed.

14
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.280
And completed is going to,
of course, have the finished code.

15
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.810
So the other thing that they have
is a readme file in every one.

16
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.152
So if you can on your computer,
pop open in this folder and

17
00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:11.504
come down into 1.1 in queing js and
open up the readme.

18
00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:22.394
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: You'll see these
instructions, so every folder that we're

19
00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:27.212
working with has this readme, and then
it'll tell you, hey, go to this folder.

20
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.468
Find this function,
change this information, and

21
00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:34.322
when you go into that folder,
or into that file, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:39.007
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And you scroll down,

23
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.240
you'll see these comments that match
the exact same thing as the instructions.

24
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.420
So it says,
Change /path/ to assets theme.js.

25
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.257
So like I said,
I'm going to give you some broken code,

26
00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:51.670
and then give you
the exact code to fix it.

27
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.760
And the idea is to make
this as easy as possible.

28
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.750
So that what we're really trying to do is
identify the stuff that you're gonna have

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.100
to change regularly.

30
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.230
And not spend our day coding out or

31
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.440
typing out a bunch of stuff
that we don't need to.

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.590
So again, you'll scroll through,
you'll see where those changes are.

33
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490
And that's how you're gonna follow them.

34
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.760
Now, some of these exercises
are themes and some are plugins.

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.570
Everything we're looking at in
this first section is a theme.

36
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.590
So in order to run a theme,
we can't just edit this here and

37
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.280
have it magically show up in WordPress.

38
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.060
We have to find the right
folder in our computer.

39
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.820
And put all of these exercises
into that themes folder.

40
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.080
So if you're using desktop server or
local, or I'm using another one, Chassis,

41
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.970
they're all going to be in different
places depending on where you are.

42
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.200
So let's take a moment now, just make sure
that you can pull up your WordPress files.

43
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.892
Go into WP-content/themes and copy and

44
00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:54.482
paste all of these exercises once,
so 1.1 through 1.6,

45
00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:58.500
copy and
paste them into your themes folder.

46
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Including the completed?

47
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.590
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Including the completed,
yep.

48
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.071
Cuz then they'll all be there for
you to edit and

49
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:14.972
play around with
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So

50
00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:21.739
I guess that mine's a little bit
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Oopps,

51
00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.274
don't delete the whole folder.

52
00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:24.844
Okay.

53
00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:39.042
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Okay, so I'm gonna take
all these files, copy and paste them in.

54
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:43.810
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And we're good to go.

55
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
Now, if you come over to your WordPress
site that you should have set up.

56
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.090
It's whatever the URL
structure you set up.

57
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.520
Go into your theme section and
you should see all of those themes there.

58
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.327
And I'll just pull mine up real quick

59
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.669
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: If you're not familiar with
WordPress, to log in, you could just go

60
00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.730
into your site dot com/WP-admin, and
that will take you to the admin area.

61
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.520
You want to come into appearance
over here and themes.

62
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.030
And then you should see all
of the themes listed there.

63
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.565
Now, they don't have beautiful
pictures everywhere.

64
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.268
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And
what you want to do is activate 1.1,

65
00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:07.931
not the completed, but the practice one.

66
00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.417
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And
when you come over and view your site,

67
00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:17.330
nothing special should
necessarily be happening.

68
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.920
This is just a very basic WordPress
theme that I have set up for you so

69
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.110
because this is our
first exercise together.

70
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.490
And we're gonna be using this theme
consistently through everything.

71
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.630
I just want to show you a few
different pieces of it.

72
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.460
So the tricky thing we
have to do now is again,

73
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.794
we don't want to be editing these files
that we downloaded, right, from the repo.

74
00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:40.350
We wanna be editing the files
that are in our theme directory.

75
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.540
So what I tend to do is just open up my
whole themes folder inside my code editor.

76
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.120
And today, I'll be using Atom
just cuz it's a simple one but

77
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.720
if you have a preferred IDE or something
else that you like, don't change for

78
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.810
my sake, keep using what you're using.

79
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.247
But now, I'll go ahead and pull all
those theme files into your editor so

80
00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:01.365
that we could see them all at once.

81
00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.819
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And
before we start with the actual exercise,

82
00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.970
let me show you a few
things about this file.

83
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.400
So WordPress,
if you haven't built a theme before,

84
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.450
this is about a simple file
architecture as you're gonna find.

85
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.390
So index.php is going to
control all the pages.

86
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.130
Header will have our header code.

87
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.790
And if I open up header, remember how I
said there's a function called wp_head?

88
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.330
Notice that there's no JavaScript and
CSS here in our file,

89
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.100
there's not even a title tag.

90
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.560
This is the hook that WordPress uses
behind the scenes to export any CSS and

91
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.040
any HTML that we want to go in the header.

92
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.405
And if we open up our footer.php,
we'll see a wp_footer.

93
00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:56.590
And again, this is the tag that
WordPress uses so that whenever we

94
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.160
include something that's going to go in
the footer, it's going to dump out here.

95
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.230
And when you run WordPress, you'll see
in the footer, just WordPress alone is

96
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.200
going to have a bunch of code there,
and that's how it's hooking into it.

97
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.730
Our functions.php file is kind of all the
programmy stuff that isn't template code.

98
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.310
It all gets thrown into a functions.php
file until it gets too big and

99
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.650
then taken out as a plugin or something
like that, or separate other files.

100
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.130
So that's just to give you an idea
of the different files to expect.

101
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.140
And then inside of our assets and js,

102
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.960
there is most of the time we're
gonna be calling it theme.js.

103
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.780
This is not a convention
necessarily by any means.

104
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.560
You don't have to call that.

105
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.380
You can call it whatever you want.

106
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.210
And notice that it's just
going to display a message.

107
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.220
If you haven't seen these
immediately evoked functions before,

108
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.390
is this new to anybody offhand?

109
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.080
This syntax?

110
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.470
Nope, okay.

111
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.910
What this is gonna do is
help scope our stuff and

112
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.450
protect it from being put up into
the global scope and then it will load it.

113
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.840
But the other reason I did this is later
when we get to jQuery we also have to

114
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.780
use a syntax like this to
pass in the dollar sign.

115
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.930
So when our code eventually runs,
all we're gonna get

116
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.240
is a console message that says loaded,
so that's what we want to get to.

117
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.306
And if we open up our readme,
we'll see the instructions.

118
00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:23.706
So since this is the first exercise,
why don't we do it together.

119
00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:27.566
And then from here, you could do the next
couple of exercises on your own and

120
00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:29.746
then I'll circle back and
go over them with everyone.
