00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Zac: This is shifting in big part,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.070
because I got talk about WordPress
recently added API to its core.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.340
That now the WordPress bubble is kind
of intercepting with this much larger

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.120
JavaScript bubble and there is a lot
more that you can do with JavaScript and

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.290
server side that might not work with
WordPress and just a sheer number of

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.940
people developing JavaScript apps,
I don't know the actual peer numbers.

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.170
WordPress powers a huge
portion of the Internet, but

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.160
the JavaScript development
world is a huge one.

9
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.180
So WordPress developers
are coming out of this.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.511
In the past, they could know just
a little bit of jQuery and get by for

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.020
years with everything that they needed to.

12
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.387
But now we're needing to learn things like
frameworks, like view, and react, and

13
00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:47.155
tools like Web Pack and run and command
line and NPM and yarn and all that.

14
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:52.069
So this is shifting for them and for
those people who already know these skills

15
00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:57.133
in the JavaScript world like I said, it's
a great way to come into the WordPress

16
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.538
space both for work and for
leveraging what WordPress can do for you.

17
00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:06.478
So WordPress was forked from
another free version of blogging

18
00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:09.518
software in the early 2000s, and

19
00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:14.180
it has had a very interesting
history of JavaScript in it.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.762
So there's this talk that
I'll share link out later,

21
00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.470
in fact, should I just throw this in the,
well, no.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.101
Search for his name and
then JavaScript past, present, and future.

23
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:31.327
This is a 15 minute flash talk, and he
starts off at the very beginning talking

24
00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:36.486
about the 300 lines of JavaScript that
were in one file when they started.

25
00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:42.340
And now, 30% or somewhere around there,
of WordPress is built in JavaScript.

26
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.320
So over that time,
we've seen a lot of different

27
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.320
little admin features added,
making this a little bit easier,

28
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.260
starting off with adding some buttons,
and then TMCE eventually,

29
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.560
which is JavaScript driven, and
then some bigger things were implemented.

30
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.289
We have things like the customizer,

31
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.923
which is the first single page web app
experience built inside WordPress and

32
00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:11.694
it let's you change all these
features like menus and widgets.

33
00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.966
It doesn't add the content directly but
your site name and

34
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.590
you could swap out themes and things like
that, and see all of it live and preview.

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.382
So this is a single web page experience,
and

36
00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:26.015
it's not using any major
frameworks behind the scenes.

37
00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.070
It has its own JavaScript API,
and it's pretty powerful.

38
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.830
This was added in a time,
we have other features

39
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.807
like,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Wait for it, it's so worth it.

40
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.803
&gt;&gt; Zac: The media library, so, a pretty
robust media library where you can drag

41
00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:49.023
and drop images,
you can move stuff around easily.

42
00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:52.860
You can just drag stuff on into
the browser and it will load.

43
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.367
And not just images, but
videos, other things as well.

44
00:02:56.367 --> 00:03:02.766
It has some embed technology, so you can
just paste a YouTube link in there and

45
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:07.210
it will automatically reform
it into a embedded URL.

46
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.616
This was built in backbone and
at the time,

47
00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:17.418
a lot of thinking went into making that
decision of what framework should be used,

48
00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:22.827
and it allowed a lot of things to be done
that weren't able to be done before.

49
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:27.502
Also, because it's in core,
it was used for other projects, so

50
00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:32.857
we also have things like post revisions,
which is a way to basically scroll

51
00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:38.060
along a bar and see left and
right differences between different posts.

52
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.380
So if you have an about page and you've
edited over the course of a year and

53
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.590
changed things,
you could just drag something and

54
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.720
see the two previews
side-by-side of the differences.

55
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.910
Again, moving more into that
single page web app experience.

56
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.000
So there is stuff in WordPress
core that uses JavaScript and

57
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880
it's increasing more and more.
