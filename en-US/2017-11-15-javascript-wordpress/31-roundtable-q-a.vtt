1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.640
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's talk about
what we've done here.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.060
So everybody has had an example to, or
had a chance to at least work through.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.660
Thumbs up if you got through
saving something successfully.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.820
All right, thumbs stay up if that felt
good at some emotional level to have it,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.310
yeah, okay.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.960
I'd like to take a moment then, let's
just go around and hear from everyone.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.510
If you have a question, or
insight something that you noticed,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.150
anything like that, and
we'll start over at the far end here.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.710
Speak into the microphone, please.
&gt;&gt; Female: Just to ask,

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.900
somebody who has no PHP background at all,
and just JavaScript.

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.760
I'm kind of really enjoying this even
though we haven't really touched

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.680
any of the PHP.

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.040
So I'm a little nervous about
diving into that later on,

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.320
but otherwise overall enjoying it.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Nice.

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.230
That is actually really great feedback and
if you stay in the WordPress ecosystem,

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.180
that's what PHP learning is like.

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.290
It's just little bits,
it's pretty manageable.

18
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.040
So hopefully that will continue on.

19
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.620
Very cool.
&gt;&gt; Male: I think some

20
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.490
prerequisites would have been cool too,

21
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.050
just having a little bit to take
a look at before we come in here.

22
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.140
I took a look at some of the stuff and
have worked with my own WordPress

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.120
website a little bit, but
I've learned a lot here.

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.020
So the single page application
stuff is really cool.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.920
And like you said, once you get that
stuff working and you can update that,

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
it's really.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Nice, yeah.

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.100
I think that you're right.

28
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.850
That, again, my assumption was that most
folks watching or here at the workshop,

29
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.080
would have built a theme or
have some of that.

30
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.830
So double applause to tackling this weird
alien environment without that background.

31
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.120
Let's jump to the back row.
&gt;&gt; Male: Just it's really nice.

32
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.500
Kind of an expedited path that you can
follow now to develop your own stuff

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.350
if you like.

34
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.610
Gets the really basics taken care of.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Cool, so

35
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.450
you're okay with the,
here's a bunch of code,

36
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.998
just change these few things, and then-
&gt;&gt; Male: [CROSSTALK] And manipulate it.

37
00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:05.863
&gt;&gt; Zac: Comes into place?

38
00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:06.800
&gt;&gt; Male: After that, based on what you're

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.840
looking for, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Cool.

40
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.880
How long do you think we
would've been here if we'd coded

41
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.050
everything today from scratch?
&gt;&gt; Male: We probably

42
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.584
would've gotten through one of the things.
&gt;&gt; Zac: [LAUGH]

43
00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:14.126
Yeah, we'd still be in [CROSSTALK] QS.

44
00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:17.659
[CROSSTALK] that big wouldn't
probably be what happened.

45
00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.407
How about you?
&gt;&gt; Female: I really liked how it's,

46
00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:26.120
like WordPress, but it's also JavaScript,
so it patches together the small bits of

47
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.130
knowledge that aren't really workable
that I have into like a big picture.

48
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.639
I can actually do stuff
with these half-finished

49
00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.170
coding tutorials.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Totally, and

50
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.400
I think that you hit the nail
on where we are with JavaScript.

51
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.380
Like I said, you could build
full apps based on the API.

52
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190
But what most people are doing and
the biggest wins are just like

53
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.950
a little bit here, and
it makes it that much slicker, right?

54
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.780
And so awesome, good feedback.
&gt;&gt; Male: Yeah, I definitely

55
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.820
appreciate the moldability to all the work
that we did today as someone who hasn't.

56
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.540
I kinda stopped at getting my
situation kind of figured out,

57
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.770
getting things hooked up
on the development side.

58
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.550
One thing I,

59
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.580
just I might appreciate as someone who is
kind of freak for having all of my notes.

60
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.329
Kind of look less on my computer if it
would be possible to take the slides and

61
00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.455
make that into a raw readme file or
something like that

62
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:33.620
&gt;&gt; Zac: So good, okay.

63
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.210
&gt;&gt; Male: It's a little more like

64
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.950
digestible that's just as I'm kind
of tooling around a little bit now.

65
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.850
&gt;&gt; Zac: No, that is brilliant.

66
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.221
I'll take all the slides and put them
in a markdown format or something,

67
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.552
then you could just read [SOUND],
nice, awesome.

68
00:03:46.552 --> 00:03:48.250
Cool, good feedback.

69
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.960
How about for you?
&gt;&gt; Male: I thought that

70
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.750
the responsiveness, actually,
of the code is surprisingly nifty.

71
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.600
I thought it was for some JavaScript code,
it takes a long time to load.

72
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.960
This was actually surprisingly fast.

73
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.520
So the code is straightforward
to understand,

74
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.370
as long as you've seen it before.

75
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
But that's the first thing that
came to mind, was like, yeah,

76
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.410
this loads fairly fast.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Good, because sometimes the API

77
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.020
can be a little slow, so it's good
that your initial feel was responsive.

78
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.820
Did most people feel it was pretty quick?

79
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.510
You weren't waiting too long?

80
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.780
Good, that's what we're looking for,
awesome.

81
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130
Best for last, eh?
&gt;&gt; Male: As someone who really has thought

82
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.148
at different times in my life that
WordPress was kind of equivalent to

83
00:04:32.148 --> 00:04:35.333
blogger.com or simple.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yes.

84
00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:35.860
&gt;&gt; Male: This,

85
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.050
I'm amazed that kind of power.

86
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.270
And I think as time goes on, I go through
the notes, I'll discover more and

87
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.380
more that you can do with this.

88
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.270
And the second observation, for being a
one day course, I've been impressed by how

89
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.600
much interactive you've been with
the students in the chatroom and stuff.

90
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.820
And I've gotten a lot of feedback
just from you, personally,

91
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.700
which I definitely was not expecting.
&gt;&gt; Zac: Hoorah, well, thanks for

92
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.250
all coming.

93
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.040
I've enjoyed that, too?
&gt;&gt; Male: And I guess I'd add that I've

94
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.270
done a lot of consulting for
start ups and just working here as well.

95
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.030
WordPress is how people
get ideas off the ground.

96
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.100
It's really just the real fast,

97
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.900
simple framework that you
can pull a bunch of plugins.

98
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.570
And then mold your application
to do something that

99
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.230
really hasn't been done before, or does
what you need it to do for your business.

100
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.298
So a lot of people built
the version 1 [LAUGH].

101
00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:28.852
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yeah

102
00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:30.370
&gt;&gt; Male: On WordPress.

103
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.260
And in our case, we are continuing
to use it [LAUGH] because

104
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.080
it's just such a big
project to get off of it.

105
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.430
Even though we have a successful app and

106
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.890
we're making a lot of
changes to it incoming.

107
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.319
But it's just the ease
of use to stand up and

108
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.690
how many plugins that you can get into it.

109
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.110
So if anyone's entrepreneurial,

110
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.250
just a great fantastic way to
get things off the ground.

111
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.860
And another experience work for
big corporation and they were always just

112
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.510
shocked that how much
their C-sharper you know,

113
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.420
C language based CMS' would cost
to do anything you know, right?

114
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.010
And it's like,

115
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.420
yeah you wanna build a website,
that's gonna be a $100,000 or $200,000.

116
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.450
And it's like, you know what, I'd keep
saying in WordPress, I can stand this up

117
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.363
in a week by myself [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Zac: And I only charge you 50.

118
00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:21.024
&gt;&gt; Male: [LAUGH] Yeah,

119
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:22.470
only charge a $50 grand.

120
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.510
So those are just some
things to add to that.

121
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.121
&gt;&gt; Zac: Awesome, very good feedback.

122
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.220
Yeah, I like that.

123
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.177
And I guarantee that like in the next
moon, at least half of you will have some

124
00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:37.030
over conversation where
WordPress could be a solution.

125
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.890
And the other person might not even know
it, and you don't have to bring it up

126
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.810
to him because then you're also
volunteering your help, right?

127
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.230
But you'll end up and had be like, that
WordPress could do that pretty easy right.

128
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.170
&gt;&gt; Male: So do you feel like focusing on

129
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.590
JavaScript and
WordPress as future-proofing yourself,

130
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.677
at least for the next four months?

131
00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:59.298
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Male: I mean, is this up and

132
00:06:59.298 --> 00:07:02.070
coming or way over this behind the curve?
&gt;&gt; Zac: I think it'll take you

133
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.590
four months of this to get over
the next hump of leaving here and

134
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.000
really getting more comfortable.

135
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But I can even see in the next,

136
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.540
I think five years is safe to say
that WordPress is not gonna go away.

137
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.240
It's still gonna gain a few
percentages of the web.

138
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.670
JavaScript sure ain't going away.

139
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.702
And after that time, more and more
developers will already have these skills,

140
00:07:25.702 --> 00:07:29.380
so like at this point you really do have a
cutting edge, and anyone watching at home,

141
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.370
you do too.

142
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.700
So this is all valuable.
