&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: But
here's what we gonna do with practice.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.320
We're first going to, I give you few
exercises which we just switched back from

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.390
on how to access the endpoints
with do on your site.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.280
And then we'll play around, we have
a few minutes around with arguments,

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.590
so you could try searching or
this or that.

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.860
This is where you need
some content in your site.

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.250
So, if you haven't installed the WP Rest,
or if you haven't added some dummy text or

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.650
some dummy post, go ahead and
do that as part of this practice.

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.194
And then there is a plugin
in the 4.3 folder,

10
00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:34.630
that if you install it would
set up a custom endpoints.

11
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.430
And after these exercises, I want to
show you how that's done because,

12
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.910
like I said,
most people are going to the direction of

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.980
rather than just using
completely default API.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.450
They're trimming them down,
making them faster, and

15
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.160
just getting only the day they need and
nothing else.
