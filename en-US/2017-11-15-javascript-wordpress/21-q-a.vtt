00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So, are there any questions
before we take a break at this point,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.858
in terms of AJAX?

3
00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:10.286
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Mira, just saying
looking for the solution on frontend

4
00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:15.260
main JS,
which you kinda already showed, right?

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: For
frontend main for the jQuery one?

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.460
Yeah, that was what we just went over.

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.360
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Right, yeah, so
she can catch up on the video there, and

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.290
then can we make the short
code go to the API?

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.266
I'm not sure what [CROSSTALK]
just saying short codes.

10
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.031
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So,
there this is a place where, man,

11
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:45.520
I need to give some context to
explain what they're asking.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.681
So, in Wordpress,
there are what are called short codes,

13
00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:57.512
and these are things that, I forget
the exact format of, no, it's not that.

14
00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:01.900
In the content editor,
let's say you wanted

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.955
to do a grid that was two columns, right?

16
00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:09.170
You can't actually throw in all the and
all that stuff there.

17
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.840
So, there's a format of using what
are called shortcodes in WordPress, and

18
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.050
you can, in PHP,
I think it's something like this.

19
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.700
Or another one might be a contact form.

20
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.520
So because this is PHP that's generated,

21
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.190
you can't just pass it in
with the localized script and

22
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.350
necessarily expect it to work, because
this is gonna fire off a bunch of stuff.

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.640
What you could potentially do I don't
know, that would be a little bit tricky.

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.720
Basically, you would have to get it in
the some sort of format that could then be

25
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.790
sent via JavaScript.

26
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.410
And when I mentioned it
very beginning JS widgets

27
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.300
this is one of the things I
know it sound a short code but

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.090
they're trying to figure out how
do to like, how do we take stuff?

29
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.650
That's so, dependent on PHP, And
make it available in JavaScript.

30
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.335
So I need to dig a little bit
deeper my short answer is I don't

31
00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:08.833
think that's gonna work, but
what you can do is try it and

32
00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:13.363
just where you see localized
script say something like,

33
00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:18.920
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And see what you get.

34
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.900
I don't My guess is that that
is not gonna work, but it may.

35
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.890
I'd be curious.

36
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.800
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: And my row was
just asking about that rpelacement for

37
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.190
a response.

38
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.990
It's JS for WP underscore globals, right?

39
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.790
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Yes.
It is.

40
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.232
It's exactly what we set right here.

41
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.210
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Instead of
the response from the initial load.

42
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.260
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Yep for the initial load
because we're getting that from here, and

43
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.810
we don't get a response back till
after we make the jQuery call,

44
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.020
the response is going
to come inside of that.

45
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.239
Sorry let me just pull up.

46
00:02:58.896 --> 00:02:59.710
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Yeah.

47
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.370
So, we can't use response
until we get the success back,

48
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.980
then we could use response.total_likes.

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.290
Before this ajax call is made, we have to
depend on the global variables that we set

50
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.900
up of total likes and that comment was
wrong, so I'll make sure that gets fixed.
