00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.160
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Stepping
back from this a moment.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.040
In 2015,

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.570
in December, Matt Mullenweg who is kind
of a co-founder of WordPress, he was one

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.110
of the two people along with Mike Little
who fought it back in its early days.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.420
He gave his first homework
assignment ever, and

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.860
every year he gives a talk on the state of
WordPress and what's latest and greatest,

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.190
what's coming, what's new, all of these.

8
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.760
And at the end of 2015,
he gave his first homework assignment,

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.370
which was learn JavaScript deeply.

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.910
Now on a personal note,
I haven't shared much about myself.

11
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.490
But my background is in education and
web development, so

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.230
I've taught high school, and college,
and code schools, and online schools.

13
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.570
And now I'm here at Frontend Masters!

14
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.530
It was funny because I
was let go from a job,

15
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.290
the exact same week that he said this.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.420
Like, we don't wanna
teach WordPress anymore.

17
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.690
So I'm like, what am I gonna do?

18
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.610
And I show up at this talk and
he's like, go learn JavaScript deeply.

19
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.130
Everybody, go learn it.

20
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.270
And so, I was like, okay,
I'll teaching JavaScript deeply now and

21
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.959
I have ever since I was sitting
in the audience for this.

22
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.090
So that's kind of a little
bit just about me and

23
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.150
what my focus has been on since then.

24
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.760
I started a project called The JavaScript
for WordPress Master Course.

25
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.800
And it's gone through different revisions.

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.860
I was planning to just take four months,
teach JavaScript from start to finish and

27
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.350
then take off for the rest of the year.

28
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.930
And now a year and a half later,
I'm halfway done with the project because

29
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.202
JavaScript from start to finish is a lot.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: The next year at the next

30
00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:30.290
state of WordPress he said the same
thing again, go learn JavaScript deeply.

31
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.550
And the reason for
this is becoming more and more apparent.

32
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.618
He also pointed out that 30% at that
point of WordPress is in JavaScript,

33
00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:40.760
its core code.

34
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.960
So to contribute to parts of it,
you need to know it.

35
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.050
But there's also more stuff going on since
then, so that customizer I showed you,

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.120
it's getting better and better, there
are experiments on how to do more and

37
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.780
more with it.

38
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.655
As well as widgets and hooks in
WordPress are huge, huge part of it but

39
00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:02.443
you've had to build all of them in PHP.

40
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:04.919
So there are some projects now.

41
00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:09.268
The way new features in Core and WordPress
work is they launch it as a plugin first,

42
00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:11.800
get all th traction,
get all the testing done.

43
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.080
Then it becomes a featured plugin, and
then eventually [COUGH] rolled into Core.

44
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.620
So these are the projects
that I'm mentioning here,

45
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.100
have a lot of work behind them [COUGH] and
people going into them.

46
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.870
But they're not in core yet, so
this is just kind of what's up and coming.

47
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.530
And then the biggest one is Gutenberg, and

48
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.050
Gutenberg is a rebuild of
the entire editor page.

49
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.390
So when you go to add a post or
add a page, it's going to be

50
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.750
rebuilding that as a single page web
app design with the ability to kind of

51
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.020
drag some things around, have blocks of
content instead of just one content field.

52
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.980
And in order to build it or work with it,
you're going to have to know JavaScript.

53
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.650
And there are some debates right now.

54
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.229
It's, I wouldn't say too out of control,
but there is a lot of influence on people

55
00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:01.284
saying, we should build these new things
in React because Calypso's built in React.

56
00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:05.364
And we have all these developers being
paid to work on a WordPress project that's

57
00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:06.329
already in React.

58
00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.099
But then you have so
many of the average developers out there,

59
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.577
who've really fallen in love with Vue.

60
00:03:12.577 --> 00:03:16.924
And, they're like, no Vue's easier and
we should use Vue instead.

61
00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:18.222
And so there's a lot of discussion
going into this right now.

62
00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:19.989
And they even have open chats every week,
and

63
00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.650
you could join them if you wanted to and
take part of the discussion.

64
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.900
So, this is kind of some of
the stuff that's coming up in Core.

65
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.267
And the point being, a year from now,
these thing will be even further along.

66
00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:34.334
And to edit and work with any of them, in
the past you could use just a little bit

67
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:38.109
of PHP, now you're really gonna
need to understand your JavaScript.

68
00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.788
And in the real world,
we're seeing this as well, so plugins,

69
00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.640
building out more API support.

70
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.470
So if you have a contact form, it's not
going to work with an API powered site,

71
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.010
unless you do some extra
work behind the scenes.

72
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.300
We're also seeing more JS driven themes.

73
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.490
It's still at this point not always the
smartest idea to build your entire theme

74
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.520
in JavaScript because you lose out all the
ability of WordPress like feeding you data

75
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.830
and loading stuff on the page.

76
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.058
And we will even see some stuff today
on where it's a good approach to, hey,

77
00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:10.592
let's just do this with PHP, but we'll
take over everything else with JavaScript

78
00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:12.380
cuz there are still some cases with that.

79
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.400
So lets say JS driven,

80
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.770
and then one of the most exciting is
completely decoupled environments.

81
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.620
So, you could build your React, or
Angular, or Vue app, and then just tie

82
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.960
into the APN on the back-end, and
never have to touch WordPress.

83
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.240
And with authentication,
you don't actually have to log in.

84
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.300
Although I will say that, where it's
at right now, even decoupled projects,

85
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.360
most people are saying if I have a client
that needs to regularly edit content,

86
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.150
let's let them log in to
WordPress normally to do that.

87
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
But we want to build our apps in Angular,
or in JavaScript, or in Vue right now,

88
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.880
so we're going to build it that
way cuz that's the future and

89
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.480
we'll just plugin to the back-end with
the API and they can go and edit that way.

90
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.150
So this is kind of the current
landscape of JavaScript and WordPress.

91
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.168
And what's fascinating to me, and

92
00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:00.934
having all of you here is that this
is the very first time, I think,

93
00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:05.648
in WordPress's history where we're seeing
people with JavaScript experience or

94
00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:10.292
dev experience in mass beginning to look
at the software in a completely different

95
00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:14.434
way than the average person who just
knows some PHP and can build a theme.

96
00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:18.698
They're not coming in going,
how do I set up my web pack build, and

97
00:05:18.698 --> 00:05:23.603
how do I build a decoupled project and tie
into an API, because these skills are not

98
00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:27.370
standard, but in a lot of education
now with web development,

99
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.526
this is stuff being taught
kind of as the go-to way.

100
00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:34.220
So, there is discussion on
what's going to come next.

101
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.290
I have some opinions.

102
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.670
It hasn't really been announced,
so I'll hold them off.

103
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.000
But possibly even by the time this airs or
definitely within the next year or so.

104
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.870
We'll probably see just
like backbone was added and

105
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.760
jQuery was added at a certain time.

106
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.017
We'll probably see Vue or
React added to Word Press Core itself and

107
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:53.914
the core components being built with that,
which is going to allow a lot of other

108
00:05:53.914 --> 00:05:59.972
things to happen easier.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So, just to note and

109
00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:03.948
to remind to kind of wrap this up
that JavaScript is becoming more and

110
00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:07.460
more integrated and more and
more important to WordPress.

111
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.670
So having these skills is essential.

112
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.990
And it's a buzz in the community and
has been for

113
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.760
a little while of people
trying to learn more.

114
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.700
So I want to push again, if you have
these skills on the JavaScript end,

115
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.810
jump into doing more of WordPress,
cuz there's a lot of folks that could

116
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.207
use your expertise, and clients that
could use your skills, too, right?
