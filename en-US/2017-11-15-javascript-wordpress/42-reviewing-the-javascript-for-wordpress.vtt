00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's do a quick
little recap on everything

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.220
amazing that we have learn today and
gone through.

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.730
Then we will send you out to the world to
build JavaScript stuff in WordPress and

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.510
be amazing at it.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.050
Look at that y'all.

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.050
You learned all of this today.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.911
Remember when we were
just starting off and

8
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:28.893
I told you that JavaScript has
a long history in WordPress.

9
00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:32.279
It started out with like
300 lines in one file and

10
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.764
now it's 30% in like tens
of thousands of lines.

11
00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.822
And they're considering whether
they should add React or View and

12
00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:40.480
what they should do next.

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.310
We have a single page
web app as a customizer.

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.590
We're getting a single page web app
to override all of the edit pages and

15
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.110
all of the add new post pages.

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.600
And you are at the perfect time
to be fluent in JavaScript and

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
getting better, and know just enough
WordPress to do way more than

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430
a lot of other people who have been
working with WordPress for awhile.

19
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.110
So, it's very cool the time that we're in.

20
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.960
And raise your hand if you feel like
you've at least learned how to enqueue

21
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.480
a JavaScript file.

22
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.910
Please everybody, please, right?

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.750
We know how to take our JavaScript, and

24
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.880
we know how to run it through PHP and
load it.

25
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.630
We know how to do it in a theme, we know
how to do it in a plugin, and guess what?

26
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.300
You could forget because you
have the code examples there.

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.920
So don't bother remembering,

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.890
enqueue is spelled E-N-Q-U-E-U-E
every time, weird word.

29
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.060
Unless you have I-N-G,
then the other E isn't there.

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.620
But that's the basic of it.

31
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.380
So you've gotta know that.

32
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620
And then we looked a little bit at AJAX.

33
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.010
We did a jQuery example together.

34
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.310
You have an Axios example
to go over on your own.

35
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670
And it's just a matter
of what you wanna use.

36
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.940
And there are times in WordPress, like our
Like thing, it would have taken us setting

37
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.620
up a custom API route, and accepting POST
requests in order to handle all that.

38
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.200
So in some cases, doing a little quick and
dirty AJAX within a theme or

39
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.330
a plugin, not completely frowned upon,
still okay.

40
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.240
But the direction we're moving
in is if we wanted to do that,

41
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.980
we would set up a custom endpoint where we
could get the total number of likes and

42
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.500
we can authenticate and
post in new likes at the same time.

43
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.650
So that's the direction
we're moving towards.

44
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.610
We looked at how to get posts, pages,

45
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.220
media, all that other stuff and
adding an ID to the end of it.

46
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.900
We looked at how we can pass arguments, so

47
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.720
we could do even more by filtering stuff
down and getting exactly what we want.

48
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.730
And then we looked at how to build
a enhanced theme using JavaScript.

49
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.160
And again, this is the place I would
suggest, I would not necessarily

50
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.370
suggest building a WordPress theme
in WordPress that has no PHP.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.160
Because PHP can leverage a lot of things
that JavaScript still has a hard time

52
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
doing or you'd have to code a lot
of API functionality on your own.

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.210
So one of the best ways to start
implementing this is in little ways,

54
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.560
maybe a sexy footer.

55
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500
Maybe a certain page on your site.

56
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.150
Maybe in the header somewhere.

57
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.130
One of the biggest places I've seen it
implemented first is with searches.

58
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.460
So when Airbnb got all its complicity for

59
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.470
rolling out React in production
very early on, what did they do?

60
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350
Search, that was the first thing they hit,

61
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.380
because it makes sense to
make that interactive.

62
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.387
Some other people in the WordPress
space that are getting client work,

63
00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:33.951
their stuff is completely
traditional PHP theme.

64
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.130
An then they're like,
we want this fancy search.

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.810
Let's use the API for that.

66
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.760
So piecemeal, adding it in and
enhancing it.

67
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.220
Now outside of WordPress,
build whatever the heck you want and

68
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.380
just use WordPress on the backend.

69
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.910
Now we showed how to edit and
how to save and

70
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.110
how to delete, but
you have to make a decision for yourself.

71
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.515
It may be way easier to build
a super slick front facing

72
00:03:57.515 --> 00:04:02.670
read-only JavaScript app and
use WordPress for editing, right?

73
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.760
Then you don't have to
build the whole editor.

74
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.310
Then you don't have to
deal with authentication.

75
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.960
So if all your decoupled app is
doing is always receiving data and

76
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.630
you're never trying to send it back,
then they could just go into WordPress,

77
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.910
log into the admin area,
make the changes there and

78
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.256
then they're pushed to your site, and
you don't have to code any of that.

79
00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:23.410
But, if you want to get really custom and

80
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.050
you wanna hide the fact that you're even
using WordPress as a data store or as

81
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.370
an application framework, you've got the
basic crud down and you can go from there.

82
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.920
Now, where do we go from here?

83
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.410
Because there aren't a ton
of resources at this point.

84
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.520
I did share with you a few projects.

85
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.800
I have my site JavaScript for WP.

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.290
There's some free content in the blogs
that I'm sharing out, projects and things.

87
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.160
I also have the show interviewing people
who are pioneers in developing this stuff

88
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.490
as well as projects.

89
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.510
And you can just from time to time
search REST API Project with WordPress,

90
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.190
things like that.

91
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.640
But we are at the cutting edge.

92
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.650
So the standards of how to approach things
the best way are still being developed.

93
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.480
And the opportunity to come into a lot
of these really prestigious WordPress

94
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.300
companies that really value
great work lifestyle and

95
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.750
pay you well and like,
like Human Made is one of them.

96
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.000
The guy who built
the WordPress REST API works there, and

97
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.500
some of their core contributors.

98
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.660
And what you find in a lot of
these bigger Wordpress agencies

99
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.890
is they're not just making money off of
it, they're actually contributing and

100
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.250
building back to the platform itself.

101
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.660
So, you may have not thought about a job
in the WordPress space as a JavaScript

102
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.950
developer, but let me tell you the
WordPress world would love to have you.

103
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.690
So the more you know about JavaScript,
the more you could enter into this.

104
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.970
And even if you don't get too far with
the community or working with it,

105
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.800
if you know that WordPress is a potential
backend application framework,

106
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.610
data store, CMS that you could do,
leave as it is and

107
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.190
then build your own JS either on top
of it or completely independently.

108
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.390
Then that is a huge win for you.

109
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.570
There are other ones.

110
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.800
Drupal is out there.

111
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.000
I'd say that's the main other one.

112
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.620
It has an API.

113
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.410
It tends to be a little bit more
developer-centric, the community.

114
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.100
And you don't see quite as
many people who are like,

115
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.170
yeah I'm gonna throw up a new site,
going to Drupal as much.

116
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.200
But it has an API and the stuff that you
learn today, you could apply to that.

117
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.610
There's gonna be slightly different
things like post.title.rendered

118
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.420
isn't exactly the same but

119
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.310
the skills that you have are pretty
versatile in terms of what you could do.
