&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So what we'll do is,
there are a few more exercises.

2
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.129
Let's see what we could do to
get through 5.2 on your own.

3
00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.040
All that's gonna do is
change some parameters.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.340
So rather all your post,

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.660
you'll just be grabbing like there post,
pretty simple there.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.530
And then see if you could get through
the exercise of trying to save the post

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.580
on your own, and see how that goes.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.090
And then I'll come in and review it, and

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.590
then we could assess how we wanna
tackle the editing and deleting, okay?

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.510
So you'll need probably a good 10,
15, 20 minutes, and

11
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.830
see if you could get all the way
through the rest of them.

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.810
Give that a stab.

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.620
If not, just go one by one, and
try to at least get through saving posts.
