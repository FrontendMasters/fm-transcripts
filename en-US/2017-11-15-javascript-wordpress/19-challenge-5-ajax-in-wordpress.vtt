&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Here's what we're doing.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.669
So, we're gonna make
a Like This Site plugin and

3
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:08.214
it saves likes as number
in the wp_options table.

4
00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:12.029
Outside the scope of this course,
but wp_options is kind of a free for

5
00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.953
all place to throw in small
bits of data that you need.

6
00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:18.613
And wp_post_meta is another if you need
it to be associated with the post, and

7
00:00:18.613 --> 00:00:19.970
you could do it that way.

8
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.000
You don't wanna get carried
away with options table, but

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.640
for one entry with just the number
of likes on the site, it's perfect.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.462
So, we'll display the total
number of likes on the frontend,

11
00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.299
and when you click on a link,
it increases the count with AJAX.

12
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.421
And because not everybody is big on
jQuery and because sometimes you'll need

13
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:42.556
to run some AJAX using a different
library that doesn't usually use jQuery.

14
00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:46.997
Like a lot of folks who use View, prefer
Axios, then I have an example where you

15
00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:51.530
could do the exact same thing we do with
jQuery just with the different library.

16
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.460
Because how you set stuff
up is slightly different.

17
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.900
So, we'll do the jQuery together, and then
on your own you could play with the Axios,

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.860
and we'll kinda break at that point.
