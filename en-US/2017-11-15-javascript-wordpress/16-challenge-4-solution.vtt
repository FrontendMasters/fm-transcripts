00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.210
&gt;&gt; Zac: So in our second example, what
we wanted to do was use the admin hook.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.100
So all we were doing was we had the exact
same code that should all still be working

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.200
properly.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.975
And instead of using the in queue scripts

5
00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:19.415
that would display on the front end, we're
using this hook admin in queue scripts,

6
00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:21.325
and that would load our
code on the backend.

7
00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:22.815
So if we activate this plug-in, and

8
00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.695
pop open the console anywhere in
the admin area, we will see this code.

9
00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:28.765
So that works well for us.

10
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:33.210
Then, in the final example, same thing,

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
except now we have a little
bit more PHP getCode going on.

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.083
So for the sake of you all
who haven't built plugins and

13
00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:43.185
might wanna use this as a little template
later on, for building a plugin,

14
00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.392
what we have at first is we're
setting the URL of the menu.

15
00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:50.165
And this is why I said don't activate too
many of these at once, because if you have

16
00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:53.557
the same URL structure for the same
plugins, that's gonna be an issue and

17
00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:57.166
just remember, that if you wanted to
create a plugin, you probably wouldn't

18
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.030
want to name your string edit, cuz there's
already gonna be one in the admin area.

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.470
So again, this is why name spacing,
various places, is a helpful thing.

20
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.010
Then, this function here is just
adding a link to the admin area.

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.127
I won't go into all the different
things there, but you could search for

22
00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:18.650
add_menu_page, and then you'll
see the different parameters and

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.930
it should make just sense by looking
at it, kind of what that's doing.

24
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.950
Then, this is some
horrible best practice for

25
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.450
putting a bunch of HTML right
inside our PHP template.

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.430
Of course, you'd wanna abstract
this out in to an actual template,

27
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.020
do this a little bit cleaner.

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.430
But for our purposes, it's okay,
and I'll also mention that,

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.210
again, this is all PHP stuff,
but in WordPress, all text

30
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
should be passed through something
that could be filtered and translated.

31
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.810
So if I just said here,
give me an h2 with JS for WP plugin,

32
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.660
that would be a problem, because that
can never be translated into Spanish, or

33
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.400
German, or Portuguese, whatever.

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.710
So whenever you pass stuff through, you
wanna make sure that 's translatable, and

35
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.330
then just in case somebody tries to
do some hockey, I got your site now,

36
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.970
JavaScript.

37
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.760
It's also gonna strip out type like that.

38
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.530
What we've got is we're setting up
the URL, we're setting up a page.

39
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.550
All the stuff is PHP.

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.830
It's not as important for us.

41
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.407
What we really wanna is come down
into our back end scripts, and

42
00:02:19.407 --> 00:02:24.150
I mention this because,
what we probably want to start doing,

43
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.990
is having both frontend scripts,
and backend scripts.

44
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.520
We can't put them into the same function,

45
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.320
because they're tying
into different hooks.

46
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.870
And weird things will start happening,

47
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.290
if you try to start hooking in things when
they're not supposed to be there, right?

48
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.920
This is a perfect example.

49
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.210
So we don't want all
of a sudden some admin

50
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.670
js to be going off on the page telling
them that they did some error wrong,

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.010
when really they're just
trying to read a blog post.

52
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.250
So break those two up, and we're making
sure we use admin_enqueue_scripts, and

53
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.340
then, we're throwing in
this extra code here

54
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.160
just to make sure that it's
only loading on our page.

55
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.200
So if I come into plug-ins,
and I activate 2.3 completed.

56
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.580
Notice that it's gonna throw
up this link over here.

57
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.270
That was setting up our admin.

58
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.380
This is that page, HTML,
that's hard coded, and

59
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.870
if I pop open my console, I should see
that there is now back in plugin loaded,

60
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.580
but if I go to a tools section or
another page, notice that it's not there.
