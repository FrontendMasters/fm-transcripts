00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Zac: That's just a little general
outline about introduction to JavaScript

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.160
in WordPress.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.020
Now, we don't have time today to get into
how to work with every core feature.

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.990
So, what we are gonna talk about
first is the process of what

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.770
WordPress calls enqueuing.

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.890
So, this is basically getting
your JavaScript into a theme and

7
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.590
you don't just put it in your footer and
hard code it.

8
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.400
You have to actually load
it through some PHP code.

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.940
So, we're gonna walk through the different
ways that you could do that,

10
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.380
some of the tricks around it, some of
the different things that you may or

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.410
may not know about with that.

12
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.800
And then, of course, we'll shift
from there to talk about plugins.

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.090
It's pretty much the same process but

14
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.760
it's just enough difference that it is
important to mention and of course,

15
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.030
when you have a plugin, you can run
JavaScript anywhere in the admin area.

16
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.760
So if you wanna plugin that
hijacks the edit pages,

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.240
and loads your own custom JavaScript,
you could do that.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.180
Now in both of these examples, I'm not, we
don't have time today to teach JavaScript.

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.120
So, I'm going to give you code examples
that are already fully coded with

20
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.930
the JavaScript, and there'll just be some
core things missing or wrong with them.

21
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.520
And you'll have to go in do that.

22
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960
And I pick things that or you mostly
likely to have to copy paste and

23
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.760
change next time, right?

24
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.162
So if you have one project and

25
00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:12.910
then you're, I need to that again you're
gonna have to copy this block of code.

26
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.320
You are gonna have to put it here
change this three things and

27
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.440
then you can write the rest of it.

28
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.300
So all the examples today
are really built around that.

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.780
And I hope that, that's helpful.

30
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.386
I will say,
depending on your JavaScript level,

31
00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.488
the examples do get more complex
as we go on, so you may end up

32
00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:31.280
getting to a point where you're, I don't
know what is happening, but it's working.

33
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.850
And that's awesome, and you could
take these and play around with them.

34
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.510
And I hope that if you have
projects that explore this more,

35
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.060
that you'll be able to use those
as kind of jumping off points.

36
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.010
Then we gotta talk briefly about AJAX.

37
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.735
We're shifting away from relying so
heavy on AJAX in WordPress and

38
00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:51.390
we're moving more to,
I guess you could still say it's AJAX.

39
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.320
But API driven AJAX, instead of custom
PHP functions that you're writing and

40
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.290
are returning a certain request.

41
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.690
But it's a little funky, so
we do have to look at it.

42
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.370
So we'll look at how to
do that in WordPress.

43
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.703
And that's gonna be kind
of where we break, so

44
00:02:07.703 --> 00:02:12.587
this is what I'd call the more
traditional WordPress JavaScript.

45
00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:17.050
And then we'll shift in the afternoon into
getting into the WordPress API driven

46
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.819
stuff and
that's kind of a more modern take on it.

47
00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.722
So from there, excuse me, we'll look
at all of the different end points and

48
00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:28.970
what comes up out of the box what
you may expect to see customized.

49
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.240
And then we'll go back to our themes and
plugins and we'll say okay if we're in

50
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.190
a theme or a plugin how can we pull an API
and use it just piecemeal or completely.

51
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.890
And then if we're
decoupled from WordPress so

52
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.710
if we're launching on a completely
different server somewhere else

53
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.860
nowhere connected to WordPress,
how do we pull in posts?

54
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.770
How do we pull in pages?

55
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.830
How do we authenticate and
save data and stuff like that.

56
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.260
So these last two projects, what we'll
be building is something that will

57
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.690
list all of our posts in JavaScript,
give us a single page view of them and

58
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.400
also allow us to log in and add posts,
edit posts and delete them.

59
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490
So we're not rebuilding everything.

60
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.500
You're not gonna be able to edit
categories around featured images and

61
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.550
things like that but from this foundation
it should be a pretty good jumping off

62
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.460
point, especially if you have
some comfort with API's.
