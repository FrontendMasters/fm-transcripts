00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's go ahead and
take a practice with this, shall we?

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.840
Now, we could open up to 4.1 and

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.210
we could see this will make
a little bit more sense now.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.860
So first, it's telling you, go ahead and
access the root of your URL,

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.090
the root of your API, and see what's
there and we'll look at that together.

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.360
And then, go ahead and
try to access posts.

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.160
And pass a id to it.

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.130
Now you might not have a post id one for
some reason, it might've been deleted or

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.830
something happened.

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.750
So I'll show you how in the admin
area to figure out exactly what

11
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.130
id a post has with it.

12
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
And then go to pages and
you should see a list of pages and

13
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.430
then we'll have a little bit of
time to go to the other one so.

14
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.440
Go to media, go to users,
go to those other ones.

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.820
Try creating a second user,
that sort of thing, okay?

16
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.040
So let's go ahead all and open up our
sites and take a look at the WP JSON root.

17
00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.490
So if I go to mysite.com/wp-json.
&gt;&gt; Female: Is there

18
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.910
a plugin to make it look all organized?
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yeah, there's a really nice one

19
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.990
it is called thank you for that.
&gt;&gt; Male: Jsonview.

20
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.311
&gt;&gt; Zac: Jsonbeautifier is that

21
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:18.390
the one.
&gt;&gt; Male: That's for wordcross really?

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.910
&gt;&gt; Zac: No, it's a chrome extension.

23
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.090
There is one and
then it wasn't there anymore.

24
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.400
Okay, I think it's JSON view.

25
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.890
I'm not sure which one I'm using, there's
a few of them but different browsers have

26
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.980
different ones and you definitely
want to install one of these.

27
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.610
That is an awesome question, thank you.

28
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.230
If you ever wanted to get the name
of your site, what's the URL of it.

29
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.610
Again you kind of have to have
the URL in order to get the URL so

30
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.860
that's a little bit silly.

31
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.090
But definitely remember how we
passed in blog info name or

32
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.980
blog info description through
localized scripts before.

33
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.360
Now if we need that data we could
just hit our main JSON endpoint and

34
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.200
convert this into an object and get .name
and it will be the name of our site.

35
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.545
The namespaces is another important thing
so remember how I said there are certain

36
00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.820
plug-ins that you can install that
will give you other namespaces.

37
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.630
So soon,
we're gonna look at authenticating with

38
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.570
JavaScript web tokens or JSON web tokens.

39
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.770
So that adds its own endpoint for
authenticating.

40
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.096
I have this simple one
here that's adding it.

41
00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:26.040
There's an oembed/1 because if you take a
WordPress site URL and embed it in another

42
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.940
WordPress site it will do a certain
design and like frame it all party.

43
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.800
So that's it, we don't have
authentication, anything in there,

44
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.370
the biggest one we wanna look at is in
routes, and so if i start toggling some of

45
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.746
these down,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Notice

46
00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:52.451
that now we're starting to see
the routes that I'd pulled up before and

47
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:58.534
not only that we have things like pages
but then you could pass an ID into it and

48
00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:06.244
there's our revisions one media
&gt;&gt; Zac: And

49
00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:09.310
there's some other information we'll
see here, which are the methods.

50
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.090
So it's a little bit outside of the scope
to get into the depths of HTTP,

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.890
as much as I would love to.

52
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.190
But each route will let you know
what you could do to that route, so

53
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.560
If we're on media, we could get media
objects and we could post media objects.

54
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.910
If we come down to media with a specific
id, we can get that specific media item.

55
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.610
We could post new ones.

56
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.770
We could also put and patch,
which are versions of updating,

57
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.960
so it's only gonna update that
certain information you need and

58
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.310
we could delete it, why do you think you
can't delete all your media at once?

59
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.400
Well, probably cuz you probably
don't wanna do that, right?

60
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.510
So that doesn't exist cuz it would
wipe out your entire media library.

61
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.812
They're gonna assume, hey if you really
wanna delete something then you've

62
00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:00.876
gotta go ahead and tell us specifically
what it is that you wanna delete.

63
00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:06.440
So this has a lot of different information
about everything that we're looking for

64
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.710
and this is our root or
our index and we're done.

65
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.137
So, now let's go to the next

66
00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:19.487
exercise wpv2posts1 so

67
00:04:19.487 --> 00:04:24.471
we put /wp/v2/posts/1.

68
00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:29.590
&gt;&gt; Zac: Does everybody get a 1?

69
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.530
If you don't have that,
let me show you something.

70
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:51.177
&gt;&gt; Zac: So if I go into all my posts and

71
00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.420
I open up a,

72
00:05:03.764 --> 00:05:08.580
&gt;&gt; Zac: A specific post up here in
the browser, it'll say post is equal to.

73
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.390
Mine is saying 1.28.

74
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.940
If you ever need to get the ID of a post,
you could get it that way.

75
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.840
So go into the admin area,
go to all your posts or all your pages,

76
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.970
click on a specific one, get something
that has valid id or if you go to all

77
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.180
posts you'll see all of your posts and
it will tell you the id right there, okay?

78
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.750
But let's go back to post slash 1 or
post 8, whatever gives you the data.

79
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.320
So at this point, what we could do is
explore what data is available to us.

80
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.180
And every time you go to
a different end point,

81
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.530
it's gonna have different data available.

82
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.330
But this is all of the basic
post information you need.

83
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.810
We have things like The ID, if you
ever wanted to link directly to a url,

84
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.380
if you put this ID in with
question mark p equals,

85
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.520
it will automatically redirect you to
the right url structure for your site.

86
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.630
We could get some date formats,
the slug, the status, the link to it.

87
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.620
Now this is important, notice how title
is title and then rendered inside of it.

88
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.810
So we can't just call post.title,

89
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.000
we have to call post.title.rendered,
and then we get what we want.

90
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.440
And the reason is,
is because if we authenticate and

91
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.570
make the same request,
we're gonna get more access to more data.

92
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.390
So for example, we can get things like
the raw data before it's filtered, or

93
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.850
the four different paragraph tags or line
breaks and put in and things like that.

94
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.080
So there are for title,
content, and excerpt, usually

95
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.750
we want to use dot rendered, and we can
never do just dot title on it's own.

96
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.680
So it's a little weird thing that
you'll get comfortable with.

97
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.280
Notice then, we've got the author.

98
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.430
There's no featured media.

99
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.720
If there was, there'd be detail there and
then a lot of metadata.

100
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.320
So it just links to the author and
all this other information.

101
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.100
Watch what happens, though,
when you put ?_embed and go ahead and

102
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.590
type this in on your own.

103
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.550
So what this does Is now if I scroll down,

104
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:24.878
&gt;&gt; Zac: Under links I have _embedded.

105
00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:28.578
So previously, all I had about
the author was their ID, but

106
00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:32.500
now WordPress is going to go,
sorry let me make this a little bit

107
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.780
bigger,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Now WordPress is going to go when

108
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.030
I say get the embedded content And

109
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.091
it will get all of this information
about the author, their description,

110
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:48.990
the links to their Gravatar images,
their name if they've changed it,

111
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.300
the slug to them,
all these other information, right?

112
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.150
It also will get us replies so

113
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.138
if there are comments
it will pull back in.

114
00:08:02.138 --> 00:08:07.660
And then wp:term, so
this will get us before we add categories.

115
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.780
Categories and tags are part of a larger
term in WordPress called taxonomies.

116
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.340
And so
a category could be considered a term.

117
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.360
And so this will get us, not just the ID
but the actual category name, right?

118
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.060
So this is more helpful for
us a lot of the time.

119
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.330
And this is why we would use embed.

120
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.390
Now, a lot of folks use embed and
pretty regularly, but

121
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.860
making all these extra requests to pull in
all the author data, all the reply data,

122
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.370
and all the term data,
especially the more and more you have.

123
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.400
Then that makes the request
more expensive.

124
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.330
So, again you really wanna
thinking about,just because

125
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.493
is it possible to do it and
get more data, is it the smart thing to

126
00:08:48.493 --> 00:08:53.662
do?
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's look

127
00:08:53.662 --> 00:09:02.502
one last example go to pages
&gt;&gt; Zac: And

128
00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:04.660
pages should have all your pages.

129
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.220
I've only got one page, but
it's got my content here.

130
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.996
Notice that again title.rendered
will give us the title and

131
00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:17.602
content.rendered will give us the content.
&gt;&gt; Zac: And

132
00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:21.800
the same thing happens where we have
the author but no author information.

133
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.240
But if we put ?_embed,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Then when we

134
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.875
come down underneath the links then we've
got all the author information again,

135
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:36.240
no replies because it's not a comment.

136
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.700
But we have those extra details, cool?

137
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.445
So what we'll do is put like
two minutes on the clock or

138
00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:48.774
something and try accessing some of,

139
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.382
&gt;&gt; Zac: These ones, okay?

140
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.710
So I'll leave this up.

141
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.620
We already did post pages.

142
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.460
See if you can find specific ID's.

143
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.660
If not, just put them up.

144
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.720
And again, you might only have
one uncategorized category.

145
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.820
So then go and try adding some more,
assigning it to a page,

146
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.640
really see how things adapt and change and
what format you'll get it back in
