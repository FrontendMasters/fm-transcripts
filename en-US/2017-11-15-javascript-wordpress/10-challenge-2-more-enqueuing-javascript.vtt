00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.162
&gt;&gt; Zac: So what I will do now is
I will pause at this point and

2
00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.104
you can go through the rest
of exercises yourselves.

3
00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:09.485
Now I will say this, there's stuff in
there I haven't explained yet, okay?

4
00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:12.211
But it's all documented and
it should make sense if you

5
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.130
understand basic conditional
statements in some programming.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.680
But keep your questions in mind.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.930
Jot them down, put file them in a file
as we go, and then I'll circle back and

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.240
go over it all and
answer them together, okay?

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.740
So, let's take about [COUGH] 10,
15 minutes and

10
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.650
see how far we get through with all of
these and then we'll go from there.

11
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.670
Like I said, it's not too much typing and
if you wanna just copy and

12
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.700
paste the things into the right places,
completely valid.
