00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; Zac: So I realize as folks
are still working here that

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.320
I just want to point out a few things
about the structure of this app.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.890
So if you're still working go ahead but

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.290
if you're following along you may have
hit some of these problems as well.

5
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.740
So I just wanna address them quickly.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.950
The first thing is that both
your local host site and

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.440
your WordPress site need
to be running on SSL.

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.400
So depending on whether you're using
DesktopServer local by Flywheel or

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.360
chassis, they all have different ways for
configuring SSL.

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.090
By far, locals is the easiest, you just
go into your site, there's an SSL tab and

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.518
click Trust, and then you could come
back and load your site in https.

12
00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.840
I'm using a different environment,
so my setup is slightly different.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.140
But whatever you're using,

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.100
just Google search how to use SSL
with DesktopServer or whatever.

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.740
You'll also notice that it's not secure.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.980
And the reason for this is because

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.480
your computer is telling
the browser that it is secure.

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.920
And your browser is saying,

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.420
I don't believe you,
I need extra documentation now.

20
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.220
Local will handle all of this what's
called signing the certificate and

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710
doing all of this on your behalf.

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.190
So it won't show up there but
I'm taking the lazy way.

23
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.620
Now, you don't want this
on a production site but

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.810
for local development
it's completely fine.

25
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.330
And if you see a warning that says,
are you sure you wanna proceed,

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
click Proceed and then click on Save and
you're fine for local development.

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.880
But your request will fail
if you're not on HTTPS.

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.210
And the same is true although it
will happen automatically when you

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.122
run your localhost 3000.
&gt;&gt; Zac: You

30
00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:41.950
will need to have http up there.

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.840
Now that should happen automatically.

32
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.530
So in order for this all to work,
that's one thing that needs to happen.

33
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.140
If we come into our code,
there's some stuff I didn't mention about

34
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.770
the configuration of this sort of app,
so let's talk about that briefly.

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.940
The first is that in our config.js file
is where we're gonna build out any

36
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.590
dom elements that may potentially
change from one app to another.

37
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.130
So, let's say in every app we know
we need like an app container and

38
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.960
maybe a main page container.

39
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.430
So we could just change this on
the fly and everything will work.

40
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.500
Or if our markup ever changes
we only go to one place.

41
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.990
When you code a lot of J query and

42
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.120
you have these selectors all over
the place it's easy to miss something.

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.780
So this practice of having
a configuration file is great for that.

44
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.610
But you'll also need to
change your rest URL to be

45
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.160
whatever your site.dev is,
or whatever it is.

46
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.750
Mine's made green, .local.

47
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.020
Yours is probably going to be
something like yoursite.dev.

48
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.030
So that's another thing that you'll
have to change in order for this to work
