&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Just to kind of review,
what we're going to do here is we're going

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.750
to focus first on just
enqueuing regular JavaScript.

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.690
That first step of just getting
a file to load on the page,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.860
then we're going to look at
how to do multiple files.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.890
Like I said, the helper and the theme and
how to make one dependent on another and

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.870
what happens when you
switch that dependency.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.060
Then we need to talk a little bit
about my friend jQuery because

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.890
there's a little bit of stuff we have to
differently when working with jQuery.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.570
jQuery assumes that
the dollar sign is just for

10
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.730
jQuery, but y'all know dollar sign is
used in a lot of different libraries.

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.850
So, we have to do what is
called a noconflict wrapper

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.980
to make sure that we know, hey,

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.090
this really is jQuery in this instance,
and there's some stuff we'll do with that.

14
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.530
The other cool thing that we'll realize is
WordPress includes jQuery bundled in it's

15
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.970
core, so anything that WordPress
uses as a JavaScript library

16
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.230
we can access with our own code.

17
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.640
So, things like masonry, jQuery,
backbone, Underscore, just to name a few.

18
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.160
There's some thick box and
light box stuff.

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.440
Since WordPress uses these, we don't
have to go and get our own script and

20
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.360
in fact,
it's a bad idea to load your own jQuery or

21
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.310
load anything that WordPress
is already loading.

22
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.160
There's also an issue when we
have external JavaScripts.

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.440
So you're familiar with loading
stuff from a CDN, for example.

24
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.700
The problem is is that,
if WordPress attaches a version number to

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.110
the end of a CDN URL, so
let's say we're going to myCDN slash view.

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.650
And then, it decides to add
question mark v equals 4.1.

27
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.150
That very well could break the URL,
and it won't load.

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.810
So I got to show you a little bit of code
that you'll need to load if you're pulling

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.510
stuff down off of the CDN directly,
if you're doing that for some reason.

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.390
There's also some times where you
don't want your java script to load

31
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.500
on every page.

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.840
So for example, if you're building
a custom project section, or custom

33
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.605
portfolio section, and you want that to
be a react app, you don't want Want your

34
00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:06.705
react app loading every single page,
you just want it loading on that page.

35
00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:09.945
So I'll show you some conditional
code that will let you say, Hey,

36
00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.215
I just want my JavaScript to show up here,
and

37
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.535
that's gonna make everything else
around it more performative.

38
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.200
And finally we'll throw in that
localized scripts at the end,

39
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.570
passing some customed data.

40
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.170
A few links for you,
I will post up these slides so

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.250
that you can have them but
this is just to the straight docs.

42
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.240
You don't need this to do
what we're about to do, but

43
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.800
if wanna take it further WordPress
is pretty well documented.

44
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.550
Oddly, it has a code x and developer site.

45
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.062
So, it's kind of in the weird place
of having two documentations, but for

46
00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:42.245
most of the stuff where you see
developer.wordpress.org that's

47
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.109
the newer stuff.

48
00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.769
And when you see codex in the URL,
it's gonna be a little bit older, but

49
00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.070
it might not necessarily be
outdated is kinda the tricky thing.
