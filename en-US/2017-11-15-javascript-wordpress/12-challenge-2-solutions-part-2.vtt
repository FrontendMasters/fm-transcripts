00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Next,
let's come down to conditionally loading.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.940
So, this is something, as I mentioned,

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.320
is helpful when you only want your
JavaScript to load on a certain page.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.970
For example, if we look at all of
the different conditional tags that we can

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.760
use, I don't know why, sometimes I
just like looking through this page.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.764
I don't know,
it's cool to see what's out there.

7
00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.324
Is home, is it the front page?

8
00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:27.387
Is it a single page,
is it a single page with an ID of 17 or

9
00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:30.287
Irish Stew, or is it an array of things?

10
00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:35.265
Is it, there are so many different of
these, not all of these are appropriate,

11
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:39.892
but certain things like, is it a certain
page, or is it the about me page?

12
00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:43.104
If it is,
then I want to load my JavaScript there or

13
00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:44.712
I don't want to load it.

14
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:50.230
What I did is single, and
this means is it a single blog post page.

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.277
The other thing you could do is put
a exclamation point in front of it,

16
00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:59.986
and then this will check to make
sure that it is not a single page.

17
00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:03.318
We'll see some other stuff
later when it comes up of.

18
00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:06.408
We could say,
is it a specific page template, and

19
00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:09.070
we'll create some custom stuff to use it.

20
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.650
So, we'll come back to
conditionals a little later.

21
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.660
It may not apply to you, but it's helpful
to know that it's there because there's

22
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.690
nothing more painful than trying remove
stuff when you can't figure out how to

23
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.860
get it off the page and
it's your own code.

24
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.827
All right, so.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: All right,

25
00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:32.450
last exercise, and
this is super important.

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.390
So, if we wanna get into the API stuff,

27
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.660
we have to know how to pass data
out to our JavaScript file.

28
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.830
The few important parts here is what
file are we attaching this to, or

29
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.270
what needs to have access to it.

30
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.669
So, in this case,
it's jsforwp-theme-js, and

31
00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.468
anywhere that's available it
will make this available.

32
00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.990
We can name this whatever we want, but
because it's in the global namespace,

33
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.004
you don't want to name
this something like, well,

34
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.491
you probably wouldn't want vars anyway.

35
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.454
Like globals, or something that's going
to possibly be used by another app and

36
00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:09.942
then be overridden, right?

37
00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:12.997
We do have to worry about
that with JavaScript, so

38
00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:16.488
I always namespace it and
then call it vars, or globals,

39
00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:19.721
just depending on the mood I'm in,
or lets or cons.

40
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:23.125
I don't know,
you can do whatever you want, and

41
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:28.619
then here I'm passing out the URL of the
site which is one of the template tags.

42
00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.893
And there are literally hundreds of these,
so this is where knowing the PHP and

43
00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:36.910
theme and plugin side of WordPress
before we get into the JavaScript stuff

44
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.032
is really helpful.

45
00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:43.010
Because this stuff and blog info is
very common anytime you're displaying

46
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.119
the name of the site, or
I could change this to description and

47
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.940
things like that and
get different values out of it.

48
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.009
On the frontend,
I'm going to actually load this one,

49
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.443
I'm going to come in and do 1.6

50
00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.727
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: 1.5.

51
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:17.765
Looks like I broke something,

52
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:23.890
sorry, one second.
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Is

53
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.460
it maybe not on the complete one?
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: That's it, thank you sir.

54
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.340
Okay, Line 16.

55
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.995
Okay, thank you.

56
00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:42.395
Okay, 116 is loaded,
let's see we should get our site now.

57
00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:47.175
Okay, and now notice,
down here in the console, I'll start in

58
00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:56.580
the theme.js So in my theme.js I
now have access to jsfawrp_vars,

59
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.490
again this is exactly what I named in my
functions.PHP down here jsfawrp_vars.

60
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.210
And then whatever the property is
that I set so the site URL and

61
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.170
the site name are the two one's.

62
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.560
And then when we load this,
we're going to see this data.

63
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.400
Again not the original use case but

64
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.780
this is how we're gonna pass
things like nonsenses and

65
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.440
the URL to access the API correctly
into our java script and get that.

66
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.590
That's probably the most common
things we'll be using it for, so For

67
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.570
authenticating and for
getting dynamic data that we need.

68
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.070
Okay?

69
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.510
So that pretty much wraps it up now.

70
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.090
I think we fielded about
all the questions we have,

71
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.610
so if there's any?
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Well,

72
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.840
there's one question.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Is there?

73
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.190
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Yeah,

74
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.670
from the chat just looking
to see if there's a theme.

75
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.770
That uses View that you can think of.

76
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.390
Do you have an example?
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Let me come back to that

77
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.970
later cuz I'm actually going to,
when we get in a little bit further,

78
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.570
I have a View demo.

79
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.960
And there are some, but
I'd have to go back and look them up.

80
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.830
There are more React and Angular themes
at the moment than there are View.

81
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.040
And there's more instances of
people doing small stuff with Vue.

82
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.690
I know a good one.

83
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.196
Go to xwp.co.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: xwp

84
00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:21.938
is one of the WordPress VIP shops, and

85
00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:27.010
they recently rebuilt their whole
site using Vue, so great example.
