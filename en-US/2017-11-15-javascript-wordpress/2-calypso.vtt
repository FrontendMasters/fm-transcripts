00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.900
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: One of the biggest things
that's come out lately is a product called

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.150
Calypso.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.850
And so Calypso is built on React,
it's completely a single

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.280
page web app design and not only does it
rebuild the entire admin area of WordPress

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
in JavaScript in React, but it also has
other abilities like checking stats.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.850
Letting you manage multiple
blogs all in one place.

7
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.650
Letting you track and read other
people's blogs all from one admin area.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.130
And so Calypso was put out
by the folks at Automatic.

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.440
And this is where if you're not
as familiar with WordPress,

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.370
it's important to make a distinction.

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.205
There's something called WordPress.org,
which is the open source version of

12
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.090
WordPress that we're working with
today and that you could download and

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.810
run in your site or run locally.

14
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.180
And then you have WordPress.com,
which is a hosted version of WordPress.

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.730
Free to use but paid features, and
this is run by a company automatic.

16
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.170
So automatic has contributors that
work full time on WordPress, but

17
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.160
also on Calypso.

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.570
So now there are people who's jobs
are just to support the software.

19
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.160
Now, you can not easily just take
Calypso as this new admin interface and

20
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.970
run it in a .org installation it's
really set up for the .com environment.

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.880
And it's doing some things
like some node interactions

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440
that you cannot do on a traditional
WordPress server because it's PHP based.

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
But, this is a pretty big
move because right after

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.660
the API became available to do this stuff
this was dropped and made quite a splash.

25
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.290
I'm a pretty big fan of it, I try to use
WordPress.com on some of my projects,

26
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.260
just so
I can stay exposed to these things.

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.900
And one of the nice things about it
is because it's JavaScript based,

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.060
it's not hard to roll out a desktop
version of it and mobile versions for

29
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.610
Android and iPhone that are all native.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.610
But are also running on
the same rough JavaScript base.

31
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.800
So, the influence of Calypso
should not be underestimated.

32
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.090
Even though I'd say the majority
of WordPress users and

33
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.130
people unless your on .com,
they don't use it.

34
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.240
They're not contributing to it but
because you

35
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.260
have such a big company that has such a
big influence on the future and direction.

36
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.760
The fact that this big software
that is used in production and

37
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800
is based on React has some influencing
power on the JavaScript world today.
