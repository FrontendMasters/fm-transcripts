00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.060
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Welcome back you all,

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.240
you've have sometime to
work through the exercises.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.360
What I am just gonna do now is
go through the completed codes.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.240
So, I won't activate every theme and
show you all the steps, but

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.540
I will point out some important
things that are worth knowing about.

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.420
So let's start of in our 1.2 exercises.

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.165
And I am actually gonna be playing
around with the completed ones,

8
00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.570
cuz it has all the code already done.

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.360
So if I come into my functions.php
in my completed 1.2,

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.360
what we're trying to work
on here is dependencies.

11
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.040
So we have two different versions of this,
or

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.170
I'm sorry,
two different files being in-queued.

13
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.480
We have a config file and
we have a theme file.

14
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.391
And the important thing that we wanted to
do was to make our theme file dependent

15
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:50.396
and load after our config file, and
the way we do that is by passing in

16
00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:54.505
the parameter of the handle from
whatever it is that we wanted to use.

17
00:00:54.505 --> 00:01:01.450
So in this case so it's jsp Config-js and
that's what we're plugging in here.

18
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.310
And then when we load the page we should
see one load and then the other after it.

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.850
So, that's our 1.2.

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.300
In our jQuery example there's
two things we have to look at.

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.480
One is in the functions.php.

22
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.190
Notice that,

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.410
we are not enqueuing jQuery anywhere here
all we're saying is make it a dependency.

24
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.120
And because jQuery is included with
WordPress Core, we don't have to do

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.910
any extra work, it's just gonna make sure
that jQuery is loaded on our page and

26
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.934
I'm pooling in jQuery masonry as well
here, shoutout to you Dave, buddy of mine.

27
00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:39.560
Okay, and this URL is very important and
worth going and

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.300
checking out as well because
it is gonna show you all

29
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.590
of the libraries that come
bundled with WordPress.

30
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.890
So some of them are a little bit older.

31
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.600
A lot of them are like
the jQuery UI library and

32
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.090
then some are very Word Press
specific as you get further down.

33
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.620
But some things maybe like a lightbox or
different things could be helpful for you.

34
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.040
TinyMCE for example is used
in Word Press internally, and

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.150
then some internal Word Press stuff.

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.000
Coming down, we see Backbone
in Underscore are included,

37
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.700
which we talked about why some of
the features that built with that, and

38
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.240
you could also see
the stuff that's removed.

39
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.460
So we're way past the days of
scriptaculous and prototype,

40
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.260
although I remember them no
longer in WordPress core.

41
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.830
So all I did was pull in jQuery, you
may have played around with other ones,

42
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.380
there's really no right or wrong way.

43
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.160
And then the other thing that's important
to mention is our actually theme.jsfile.

44
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.360
And when we work with
jQuery in Word Press,

45
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.580
we cannot rely on the dollar sign
just being available to jQuery.

46
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.930
So what we're doing here is we're saying,
hey, when this Function is

47
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.200
being called here,
pass in jQuery to it and rename jQuery

48
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.260
as a dollar sign when you pass it in
to the inside of this function here.

49
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.160
So we don't need to use this,
we can actually remove all of this and

50
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.880
just type jQuery,
instead of the dollar sign.

51
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.620
And a lot of WordPress core or some of
the WordPress core code that you may see

52
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.030
uses this method just because
it's a little bit safer.

53
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.442
However, for convenience sake one of the
reasons you're using jQuery is probably

54
00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:22.723
you want it to be easier
if you are using it.

55
00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:27.694
So follow this method it's very important
otherwise you'll get some unexpected

56
00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:28.610
results.

57
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.350
Yeah, question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So If you didn't include

58
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.720
that, is the dollar sign going to default
to a different library, elsewhere,

59
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.550
or is it assigned it all in elsewhere?
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: It's going to depend,

60
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.050
I mean, this has existed since you
still had people using prototype and

61
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.845
other ones that were very dollar-signy.

62
00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:49.760
So nowadays we don't see as much of that,
so it would depend on what's loaded.

63
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.766
It may actually still work, but you may
potentially get some issues, I think.

64
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just wanna make sure

65
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.360
that you're

66
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.520
saying which one you'll be on every time.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Yeah,

67
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.950
although I don't think, no, Word Press is,

68
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.150
I don't think it's actually
anywhere in it doing this for you.

69
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.190
But you could test it out just by
deleting this and checking it real quick.

70
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.418
I'd be curious what you find, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: But it's definitely,

71
00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:16.566
it's in all the docs and

72
00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:19.790
everything saying that you really
want to work with them that way.

73
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.840
Okay, so the next one up is in
queuing external libraries.

74
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.030
So sometimes it's faster to load stuff
off a CDN instead of having it in your

75
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.250
own repository, specially if its something
that's being used commonly a lot.

76
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.720
So in this case we're pulling
in view right down off the repo.

77
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.600
And then we're including
it as a dependency,

78
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520
the same as we did with jQuery.

79
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.720
The difference here is that WordPress is
going to try to attach this time code or

80
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.910
if we didn't have a time code, and
let's just say that we left it blank.

81
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.920
If we leave this blank WordPress is
automatically going to change it to

82
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.140
the version of WordPress at its end.

83
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.990
So there's no way to set
this to null which is

84
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.940
kind of annoying sometimes I wish
that this worked, but it doesn't.

85
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.880
So we're going to leave this as is and

86
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.520
then use some WordPress hooks to make sure
that nothing is added to end of this.

87
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.710
Because if we had ver=4.8 and
we try to load that in the browser,

88
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.550
it's going to give us an invalid URL and
that won't work.

89
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.380
So that is not an option for us.

90
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.990
So down here is some code where all
I had to do is change cdn to unpkg,

91
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.030
and that will make sure that,
this is stripped

92
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.950
anytime that a JavaScript file is loaded.

93
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.090
If it has this in the URL it will
not apply the version number.

94
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.010
Or it will remove the query
argument of versions.

95
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.530
So depending on how much
PHP you're familiar with.

96
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.130
The other thing I could show you here
is that if you ever start working with

97
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.610
multiple CDNs, you could just do an or,
and then this could be other.

98
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.836
And it'll get a little nasty if you have
too many of them, but completely valid,

99
00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:13.353
it'll work.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So this block of code,

100
00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:15.091
keep in mind, and copy and

101
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:21.450
paste it anywhere that you need to remove
that version number because it's breaking.

102
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.150
I also left some code down here
that you could uncomment and

103
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.840
what this will do is apply
the same thing to any CSS.

104
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.660
So sometimes CSS could be more forgiving,

105
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.060
it does depend on they're
serving stuff up.

106
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.290
But if again you're trying to link
to some external CSS thing and

107
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.510
it's adding a version number and
breaking it.

108
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.450
Then you can run it through
that filter as well.

109
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.360
But you'll notice that down here I'm
linking directly to a Google Font, and

110
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.060
it doesn't break it.

111
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.910
So that's pretty nice.

112
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.490
But Google fonts are used to
take other parameters, so

113
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.010
it's probably just ignoring those,
notice that it already

114
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.550
has like he stuff going on, the arguments.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

115
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.740
are both of those necessary?

116
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.280
You have to do the time stamps,
and then you also have to

117
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.370
remove the version of function?
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: No,

118
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.770
you don't have to do time here.

119
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.210
I'm just leaving it because it's not
actually possible to set it to null.

120
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.640
If we didn't do time, and we left at this,

121
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.590
it would set it to
the version of WordPress.

122
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.890
So I'm just leaving time but
maybe this would actually be

123
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.910
a little bit more clear and make sense.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

124
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.170
then, if you use that function,

125
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.481
that's gonna take care of the same thing?
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: It will actually solve it,

126
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.631
this won't take care of the problem.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

127
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:31.338
at this point.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And

128
00:07:31.338 --> 00:07:35.464
this won't take care of the problem,
you actually have to go in and

129
00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:37.239
hardcore remove it itself.

130
00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:41.005
Because it always wants to fall back so
that even if you don't know what version

131
00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:44.120
your on it will be able to
catch it based on some data.

132
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.860
And again when you go to
push to production for

133
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.596
your own you wanted then
start tracking these.

134
00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:55.146
So remove time and change it to 1.5,
1.6 as you roll out new versions.

135
00:07:55.146 --> 00:07:57.211
And that will allow it
to be cached better,

136
00:07:57.211 --> 00:08:01.006
cuz if you have this then it's going to
assume that it's new stuff every time.
