00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.460
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: We've got,
in queuing JavaScript in a theme.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.280
Now luckily, in a plugin,
it's not going to be too much different.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.860
There's basically just one line of
code that's slightly different,

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.110
which is how we link to the file itself.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.890
And then there's going to be an extra
hook, which will not only let us put our

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.800
code onto the front-end like
we did with the theme, but

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.890
then also load it in the admin area.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.510
So we should be able to get
through these pretty quickly.

9
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.580
This should look very familiar, right?

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.310
What's the one thing that's different?

11
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.379
I'll give you a hint, it's in bold.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Remember

12
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.658
last time it was something like
something something URIs, scripts,

13
00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:38.861
child's template,
something like that, right?

14
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:42.648
So, now we have a different
convention which is plugins_url,

15
00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:46.992
we still have the path name the same but
then the actual location of where we

16
00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:50.168
are is being passed in
dynamically with FILE, okay?

17
00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:53.598
So this is kind of the go
to default way of doing it,

18
00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:58.663
because if we tried to use a PHP code
that gave us a link to our theme folder,

19
00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:02.300
that would not help us if
we were in a plugin, right?

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.900
So this code is going to give us the
plugin, but everything else is the same.

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.440
So, no big differences there.

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.060
The big difference comes from this,
again, is the exact same.

23
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.310
But we also have this option.

24
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.160
So there are two hooks that we could use,
we could use wp_enqueue_scripts, and

25
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.420
that will take the code that we wrote and
it will put it out on the front-end

26
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.170
of our site, on every page and
we could do conditional stuff as well.

27
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.900
And if we do admin_enqueue_scripts
that will put it on

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.190
every page of the admin area.

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, this may not be what you want.

30
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630
If you want to build a plugin
that has a plugin page, and

31
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.200
you have custom code that you only want
running your plugin page, or you want to

32
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.410
edit, let's say you want to put some
custom JavaScript on the edit page.

33
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.070
You don't want that dynamically loading on
the media page and all that other stuff.

34
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.220
So, there's some conditional logic
we could do by passing in the actual

35
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.720
hook in of where we are.

36
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.200
And then making sure that it's, I'm sorry,

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.275
if it's not equal to the page that we
want, this URL structure is weird.

38
00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:10.240
toplevel_page_, and
then the name of the actual page link.

39
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.910
So when you're in WordPress,
if you're editing a post, it's edit.php.

40
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.720
If you have a custom plugin,
it could be whatever you want.

41
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.580
So this is whatever you want but
it's usually written more like this.

42
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
[COUGH] So, we'll assign the variable
somewhere else because you're gonna use

43
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.550
that URL in more than one place
if you're building out pages.

44
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.320
And then we have to use global
to pull it into our function and

45
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.510
then we just concatenate
the strings together.

46
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.247
So, top level page is gonna be
the exact same thing as we saw

47
00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:44.539
before.
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: It's the exact

48
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.429
same thing as this, it's just being
abstracted out into it's own variable.

49
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.656
So again,
what this code is saying is saying, hey,

50
00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:57.179
if you're not on my plugin page, return
now, which is gonna end that function,

51
00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.595
exit out of this hook, and
enqueue_script will never run.

52
00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:03.308
And this is something that's
fairly common in WordPress.

53
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:08.284
It's saying, hey, if you don't have this
ability or if you don't have this running,

54
00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.850
die now or exit out now or
return now and stop.

55
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.680
Cool?

56
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.850
So this is not code that
you need to memorize,

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.550
and honestly, to go from what we learned
today into building a full plugin and

58
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.290
a full plugin page, I'll give you
the template code but it's not really

59
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.970
something that you'd probably jump
into without reading a bit more.

60
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.120
And there's a lot of documentation.

61
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.979
I have whole other courses just
on doing that kind of stuff.

62
00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.900
So I wouldn't worry about it too much but

63
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.850
I do need to point out that this is
the case and it's worth practicing.

64
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.680
So, again, we have these
three different options here,

65
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.900
we can get it on the front-end, we can
get it on the admin area, everywhere,

66
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.000
or we can get it just on our plugin page.

67
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.300
And so, guess what we're doing,
I'm sorry, the links again I put these

68
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.200
in the repo now so if you look in
the repo you should see slides so

69
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.830
you could follow along if you
wanna click on any of these.

70
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.210
Again, everything is
documented pretty well.

71
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.690
You can see this last link
here now is on the codex, and

72
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.220
it has some stuff that hasn't made its
way over to the newer documentation yet.
