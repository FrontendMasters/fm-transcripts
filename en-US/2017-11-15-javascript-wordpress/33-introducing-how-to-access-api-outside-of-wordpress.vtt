00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.770
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Now we're gonna do
basically the same thing we did before,

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.540
we're gonna create decoupled though.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.440
So we lose some things when
we move outside of WordPress.

4
00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:15.741
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So some of the benefits
of being inside of WordPress are,

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:18.560
we know what the URL of our site is,
right?

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.450
We could get any data and pass it through
localized scripts very easily, and

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.860
we can also do things like
authentication very easily.

8
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.180
So, the fact that all we had
to do was pass in a nuance and

9
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.210
everything works, or
with the backbone client.

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.560
You didn't do any authentication.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.910
Notice, when you saved,
you weren't passing any crazy things,

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660
you weren't checking cookies, you
weren't seeing if they were logged in or

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.930
had permissions, right?

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720
It was all doing it for you.

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.490
When we stepped away from WordPress and

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.320
built it on our own,
we've got to do all that on our own.

17
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.730
But there are some advantages.

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.720
One advantage is WordPress runs in
a Linux environment, it runs with PHP and

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.460
it runs with MySQL.

20
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.170
You can't run Node well in that
environment, it's not built for it.

21
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.320
And you can't run WordPress
well in a Node environment.

22
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.480
So if you wanted to do server side
rendering like pull the API request in and

23
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.720
serve it directly to the page.

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.940
And this is approach more people are
taking because it's gonna get there right

25
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.930
away and you don't have to
worry about the fallback,

26
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.320
that stuff is already loaded there, right?

27
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.067
If you want to leverage server side
coding, the WordPress.com site,

28
00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:31.610
the Calypso, it's not running in a normal
Linux WordPress hosting environment,

29
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.250
because it's doing special
stuff behind the scenes.

30
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.200
So that's something to keep in mind.

31
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.320
And without any real good reason,
I just think it is kind of fun and

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.940
cool and sometimes that's enough
reason to explore something until you

33
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.300
realize that it's not the best approach.

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.590
So, here's what we're gonna
do outside of WordPress.

35
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.834
Guess what, it's the exact
same thing until we get here.

36
00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.651
So, figuring out all the URL requests,
it's very easy.

37
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.876
And when we talk about modular code,
you'll find that most of the code that we

38
00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:07.060
wrote in WordPress, we can pull out
of WordPress and use decoupled.

39
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.910
And likewise,
if you build some sort of app decoupled,

40
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.140
you could use those React components, you
could use those view elements, you could

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.400
use that vanilla JavaScript, pull it
right into WordPress and it should work.

42
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.690
And then we'll just use this for the rest.

43
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.400
So what I'll do is I'll show you the demo.

44
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.970
And then we'll work through
the first part together again.

45
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.180
And then I'll give you some time to try to
get to the rest and then we'll go back and

46
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.300
talk about some bit and pieces of it.

47
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.300
Particularly, I want to stop before
we get to authentication and do that

48
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.380
one together because it is leveraging some
tools you may or may not be familiar with.

49
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.080
But let me just show you the setup for
these.
