00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.180
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let me thank you again.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm making JavaScript for
WordPress kinda my work and my shtick.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.800
It's what I'm focusing on.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.690
So if you're interested in this,

5
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.320
my Twitter handle is
a pretty good one to follow.

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.280
I encourage you to follow.

7
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.140
Ask questions.

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.978
I can point you to a lot of people if
I can't always answer the question or

9
00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.202
know something.

10
00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:22.542
I know most of the people that can,
so I could point you towards them, so

11
00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:23.980
check me out there.

12
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.460
And then if you do want to
go in depth in this, and

13
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.080
you do wanna invest in some education.

14
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.050
I am taking about 20 students 3 times
a year and working with them one

15
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.140
on one through hours, and hours, and
hours of content at javascriptforwp.

16
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.170
So maybe if you wanna recommend it to
a friend you're welcome to, or for

17
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.080
yourself to check out.

18
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.410
But again,
there are some free resources there, and

19
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.090
I hope that this was super valuable for
you.

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.960
I thank all of you here in the workshop.

21
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.040
Give yourself a round of applause, please.

22
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.130

25
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.820

26
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.992
Say hi, ping me with questions,

27
00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:07.051

I hope everything went well.

28
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.489

gratitude goes to Mark and

29
00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:12.940

I know that was not easy sitting
in those chairs that whole time.

And we had some set backs, I am very
