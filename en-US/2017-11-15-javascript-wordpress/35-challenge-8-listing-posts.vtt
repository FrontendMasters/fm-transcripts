00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.870
&gt;&gt; Zac: Section six again.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.110
That's how we're gonna run through it.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.547
What I'd like you to do is take
a stab at doing list-posts and

4
00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:11.073
doing single-posts on your own.

5
00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:14.641
And then we'll come back for
authentication together cuz there's some

6
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.580
more things I have to talk about
there that are gonna go on, okay?

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.430
So remember the steps.

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.120
You've got to run MPM install,
you've got to run MPM start, and

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.091
then you can start coding everything
out https://localhost3000.
