00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Before I get rolling,
I just have to plug Frontend Masters for

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.370
one more second, because Mark and
the team here has done some amazing stuff.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.880
And me coming to be here is a huge honor,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.360
because some of the instructors that
they have on this site are the top-notch

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.160
people out there writing books, lecturing,
talking about JavaScript in super depth.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.600
So if you haven't checked out their other
courses and stuff, I highly suggest it.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.070
It will take any level of JavaScript
you have and go way, way deeper.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.220
So that said, way to go you all,
Frontend Masters, where it's at.

9
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.400
Now, this JavaScript for WordPress
workshop is a little bit interesting,

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.120
because we're coming to WordPress
from a very unconventional avenue,

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.410
which is from the world of JavaScript.

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.790
So we've already gone through hopefully
everybody has everything set up

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.330
that we need.

14
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.430
So I wanted to start off just talking
about why as a JavaScript developer,

15
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.059
or why as a developer,
we should care much about WordPress.

16
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.762
And I don't have my notes here but
we're gonna make this work.

17
00:01:05.762 --> 00:01:09.910
So, first of all, if you don't know what
WordPress is, it say content management

18
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.610
system, which means that it let's
you edit and manage your data.

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.670
It could manage media,
anything form videos to audio to pictures.

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.010
It could deal to post and pages,
it can also deal to custom content.

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.350
So you could set up your own thing
like projects or events, and

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.320
you could set up your own custom fields
to have whatever conditions you want.

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.220
It's also very extendable, so it has two
kind of directions of extendability.

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450
You have themes, which controls
how all the content looks, and

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.750
then you have plugins which extend
the functionality of WordPress itself.

26
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.850
Now, traditionally,
all of this was done in PHP and

27
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.580
WordPress is build on
a very open source stack.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.670
But that's shifting a lot.

29
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.430
As a developer that knows JavaScript you
have a huge win in the world of WordPress,

30
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.510
because it's becoming more and
more JavaScript driven, but not as many

31
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.690
people in the WordPress space, even
experienced developers know JavaScript.

32
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.820
So if you have some of that foundation and
you learn just a little bit of WordPress,

33
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.910
you're already much ahead
than a lot of other folks.

34
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.930
So that's one of the main
benefits coming into this.

35
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.290
The other is that if you're
building applications out there,

36
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.190
WordPress can offer a lot in terms of
taking care a lot of what you would maybe

37
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.040
call like the application framework or
foundational stuff, handling login,

38
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
handling user credentials,
handling user roles, managing the content,

39
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.950
having the database synced up,
having an API available.

40
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.060
So if you're rolling your own,
that's gonna be quite a lot of work and

41
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.650
it may be something helpful there.

42
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.850
So that's kind of the two areas of why,
as a JavaScript and general developer

43
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.810
it's helpful to know about WordPress,
especially in the time we're at now.

44
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.985
So historically, WordPress
developers have lived in a bubble,

45
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:04.269
just like a lot of us live in bubbles, and
this bubble has been a very safe place for

46
00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.050
learning how to develop.

47
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.660
Some of the top WordPress plug in and
theme developers out there

48
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.830
learned everything they know about
Web Development from WordPress.

49
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.310
You could learn HTML, CSS, PHP and

50
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.800
JavaScript all at the very
easy barrier to entry.
