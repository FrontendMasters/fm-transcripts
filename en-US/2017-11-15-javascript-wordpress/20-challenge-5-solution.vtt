00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.570
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's go ahead and
look at this together, shall we?

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.108
AJAX and WP, go ahead and
copy over all of these

3
00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:13.150
3.1 through 3.2 files
into your plugins folder.

4
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:22.070
&gt;&gt; Zac: So again, we're copying just over
our 3.1 files, Into our plugins folder.

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.170
[COUGH]
And let's go into our plugins.

6
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.163
So, let's come down and
activate 3.1 jquery example.

7
00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:42.180
All right and now again,
we need to make sure that we're not

8
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.240
opening the actual example
files that wherein the repo but

9
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.800
we're opening the ones that
are in our plugins directory.

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
So I'll just grab that and
pull it into my editor.

11
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.220
And now I've got my plugins here.

12
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.470
All right, so, in our README,
there's a few steps here.

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.100
Right, we've got to set up the enqueue
to pass in all the data, we've gotta

14
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.100
hook in our AJAX function,
we've gotta make the actual

15
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.090
AJAX call in our JavaScript, and
then we've gotta test out that it works.

16
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
So, let's start up by going into our
main plugin file ,we're gonna look for

17
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
our scripts find localized scripts and we
are basically just gonna make sure that we

18
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.530
are passing in the url we
need the total number of

19
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.130
likes that are currently in the data
base and then the nonce, okay?

20
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.898
So that's our first step,
we will open up main plugin

21
00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:44.720
file
&gt;&gt; Zac: And

22
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.430
we already have this done for us.

23
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.040
So, nothing we need to change here.

24
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.840
And again,
because we've done this so much,

25
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.950
we won't go through the practice of
changing those values every time.

26
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.479
But what we do need to change,
is all of this.

27
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.510
So, let's just do some quick copy and
past here, make it easy.

28
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.780
We're gonna change ajax url to admin url,
admin ajax dot php,

29
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.520
total likes is equal to, and
this is why the options table is so

30
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.410
easy, look how easy it is to pull
in a value from the database.

31
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.460
Just get option and
then the option we want and

32
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.640
it was actually up here further in
our code, at the very top we see,

33
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.880
hey are there any likes currently and
if it's null then go ahead and

34
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.240
set likes equal to zero, so
that's how we get the number to start off.

35
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.460
Get option and add option are very
simple and if you ever want to start

36
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.880
storing stuff in the database,
little things, that's a really easy way.

37
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.580
And then finally we need
to create the WP nonce.

38
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.400
And again, I like to name them something
that is going to make sense for

39
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.120
what it is and sometimes I'll just add the
word nonce's even though it's repetitive.

40
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.740
Just to make it clear for

41
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.910
me what I'm working with,
show me what you're working with, okay.

42
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.250
So we've got all that set up, let's see,

43
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.870
the next step was to hook
in our AJAX function.

44
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.510
Okay, so this is gonna run
once our JavaScript executes.

45
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.560
And we want to find the add_action
function directly after jsforwp_add_like,

46
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.040
okay.

47
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.130
So let's go check that out.

48
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.800
Here's jsforwp add like, and

49
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.570
while we'll get to the add action in
a moment, but there's something up here.

50
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.480
Notice that check_ajax_referer
doesn't match what we just set it to.

51
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.880
So this name here, create_nonce,

52
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.630
needs to be the exact same as what
we see down here, nonce_to_check.

53
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.460
So paste that in, that works and
just to show you what this is

54
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.170
doing is saying is getting the value of
the database is increasing it by one and

55
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.590
then it's updating the option and
passing in the new number, and this could

56
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.044
definitely be consolidated a fewer
lines but just trying to make it clear.

57
00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:01.740
And then we're saying
if this goes through,

58
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.690
so if the update passes then go ahead and
set my response

59
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.500
total likes to new likes and
set their response type equal to success.

60
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.960
So this is gonna be the data because
we have response total likes bein

61
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.650
json encoded, that will turn into response
dot total likes and response dot type.

62
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.360
When we get it back on the front end.

63
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.940
Now the last thing we have to
do is this wp_ajax_your_hook,

64
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.482
and your_hook right here, have to
both be changed to jsforwp_add_Like.

65
00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:42.090
And what that's gonna do is say,

66
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.060
whenever there's an ajax request coming
in for this function then go ahead and

67
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.390
call this function, which is again
right here, super redundant but

68
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.750
this is just how Ajax works and
once you know these few steps, it's fine.

69
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.480
You'll also notice,
because I wanted to simplify this,

70
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.350
there's some extra code
that I'm not showing you,

71
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.230
that's put out into a little library
folder that we will ignore for now.

72
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.870
But just so you know, if you want to
explore some of the other stuff that's

73
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.830
going on, because there is a back end
page, and I'll show you that in a second.

74
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.840
But we won't go through all of the code,
it should already be working.

75
00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:25.155
&gt;&gt; Zac: All right, so now we need
to come into our JS front end and

76
00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:28.280
we've got some things to change here.

77
00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:35.150
All right, so change the HTML value to

78
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.140
response total likes because we
set this up in the back end and

79
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.550
we passed it back here,
we could simple do this.

80
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.010
So response just like global
variables we set is available to us.

81
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.044
It's getting kicked back,
and now we need to.

82
00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.052
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, this is gonna load
initially so when the page loads

83
00:05:57.052 --> 00:06:01.756
is what determine what the total likes are
to start and then here's our ajax call,

84
00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:07.240
and we need to update a few things, the
url, the data action and data _ajax_nonce.

85
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.590
Again, this is a little bit weird
format just keep that in mind.

86
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.259
So we'll change our URL.

87
00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.440
&gt;&gt; Zac: That's gonna go to admin ajax.

88
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.980
We'll change our add_like
that was all ready.

89
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.761
And then our nonce is right here.

90
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.990
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, should we try it?

91
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.720
Who thinks it's gonna work?

92
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.180
Did we miss a step.

93
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.290
Let's come check our read me.

94
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
Changed all that stuff.

95
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.260
I think there's one last thing.

96
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.100
Once it is successful, then we want to
change the count to the total number.

97
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.080
So then we pass in response total like,
which again has been

98
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.180
Updated and given to us, so
that should fix everything.

99
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.774
Now let's go ahead into our site.

100
00:07:11.774 --> 00:07:16.436
We activate 3.1 JQuery example.

101
00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:25.479
&gt;&gt; Zac: And you'll love how much,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Broken this is,

102
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.020
okay, let's see what's going on.

103
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.220
Response is not defined in front end.

104
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.400
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yeah.

105
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.326
Because the first time we get it, it is

106
00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:46.440
&gt;&gt; Zac: it's actually js for wp globals.

107
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.660
So the first time the page is loaded
this localized script kicks off but

108
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.570
it's important to note that
localized script is not updated

109
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.850
every time you make a new ajax call.

110
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.640
So, this is good for the first load of
the page but after that it's static and

111
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.930
doesn't get repushed out to the site.

112
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.370
So the first time we get the total count,
we have to do it that way.

113
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.920
And then the second time we
should be able to get response.

114
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.980
So sorry,
that instruction is a little off.

115
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.678
I’ll make sure to change
that in the examples.

116
00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:20.587
Zero likes, [SOUND] look at me go.

117
00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:29.700
No validation, I don’t even remember if
it’s set to you do have to be logged in.

118
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.800
So because it's relying on sending
out that nonsense stuff, it's

119
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.660
not going to let us perform this if we're
not logged in, which is a good thing.

120
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.480
But you'll also notice that,
on the back end now in our admin page,

121
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.650
we could reset it to 0.

122
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.230
So remember I said there's
this extra library folder.

123
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.070
And it's just the exact same code,

124
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.230
except showing you how to
reset all the data to 0.

125
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.260
And now if we look at our site,
it will be set back to 0 and

126
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.360
we could do the whole thing again.

127
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.440
So again, this code is going
to be something you wanna save

128
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.040
as an example because at some point,
you might need to use it.

129
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.170
But we're moving past this direction
in terms of architecture of how

130
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.590
we're interacting with Ajax it's

131
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.250
being driven a bit more API instead which
is what we'll look at moving forward.

132
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.320
But from here there are two
things that you could try.

133
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.390
The first is you can go back and look at

134
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.030
the library folder and
look at the plug in page.

135
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.040
And this has some code that is
running something very similar but

136
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.880
it's resetting everything
to zero using AJAX.

137
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.990
And there's a backend main JS.

138
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.730
Because what happens is sometimes folks
get like the code that shows, hey,

139
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.270
here's how you do this on the front
end but then it's confusing.

140
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.770
Like, I don't know how to translate that
to doing it on the backend in a plugin.

141
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.507
So I'm giving you both there And
then because,

142
00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.166
&gt;&gt; Zac: jQuery is not everybody's jam,

143
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.650
there's also an Axios example.

144
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:12.270
So we won't go into that there and
that's kind of on your own to play with.

145
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.080
But I'll show you just one small piece
of code that's gonna be kinda the main

146
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.680
difference is that,
notice that this is called params.

147
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.140
I think that's basically it and then
it's using a slightly different format

148
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.630
in terms of how data is coming back and
how you access that.

149
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.910
So, those two are really the only things.

150
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.300
The rest is pretty much the same.

151
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.270
But these are the things
that have to be right.

152
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.000
Everything else you could swap out and
change to your heart's desire.

153
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.200
So at this point, we have so

154
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.360
confidently plowed through so much.

155
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.230
And everything else out from here
is gonna be looking at the API and

156
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.630
how do we get this in themes and
plug ins and decoupled apps, okay?
