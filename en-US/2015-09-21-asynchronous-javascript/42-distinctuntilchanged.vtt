[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Now the autocomplete box
could probably be a little bit better.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.620
It's probably not ready to ship just yet.

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.780
I'm probably gonna turn around
throw this in production.

5
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.126
How can I make this better,

6
00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:15.770
this auto-complete box?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.140
make the result matter if your in JSON.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: [LAUGH] That's true.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.660
I like that one but
this course isn't about HTML formatting so

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.970
why don't we come back to that.

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580
That's a totally fair request but

11
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.180
I don't want to spend a lot of time with
CSS, you can learn that in another class.

12
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.767
I'm sure Front End Master's
got some great classes for

13
00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:34.520
it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: People don't often type

14
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.638
things in correctly the first time they
backspace then they go forward and

15
00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:38.720
back.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah,

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.160
yeah, that's interesting, they backspace.

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.580
What's going to happen
if somebody backspaces?

18
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.993
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's gonna work.

19
00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.068
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: It will probably work,

20
00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:48.570
but will it be optimal.

21
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.290
If I literally hit the backspace key,
what will happen?

22
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.482
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's a key press.

23
00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:54.910
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: It's a key press.

24
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.940
So it'll trigger another request.

25
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.630
Maybe that's what we want because if
we went from ab to a we should trigger

26
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.910
a request for it.

27
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.318
But what happens if I go left to right?

28
00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:09.840
It'll work kind of.

29
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780
It'll also hit my server for
a network request for

30
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.100
the identical text because
key presses are key presses.

31
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.310
How can we make this better?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Caching?

32
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.260
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Caching is absolutely

33
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.360
true, right.

34
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.080
But the question is, cache where?

35
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.760
Right, you could cache at the http layer,
you could cache in memory, right.

36
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.418
Presumably if the server is caching
its search results at the http layer,

37
00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:34.196
caching might not be as important.

38
00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:36.611
You could probably do a little bit
better by caching it in memory but

39
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.470
that's not what I'm after.

40
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.477
I'm after just making sure we
don't issue that request at all.

41
00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:43.504
Cuz I don't know if under
the hood it's cached.

42
00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:45.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Limiting it to alpha numeric

43
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:48.600
characters?
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yep or we can filter for

44
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.470
the key code.

45
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.390
We can absolutely filter it for
the key code.

46
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.730
The fact is that there's
a lot of those key codes and

47
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.870
I mean that's a totally
reasonable approach.

48
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.430
There's actually a really helpful RX
operator I want to take this opportunity

49
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980
to teach you right now.

50
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.940
And the way it works is
if you think about it.

51
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.600
What we're really doing is
when we take keypresses,

52
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.060
I actually want to break
this up a little bit.

53
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.060
I wanna show you guys that maybe
this warrant's breaking up.

54
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.320
This is as nice and short as this query
is, why don't we instead of going

55
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.260
directly from the key,
directly to the search results.

56
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.820
Why don't we just break it
into a couple steps and

57
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.490
the reason for that,
you'll see in a moment.

58
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.630
So I'm gonna go from
the key to the search.

59
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.394
So now, instead of ab,

60
00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:34.822
we have,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Now

61
00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:39.538
you have a stream of input values that
you can do to the collapsey thing to

62
00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:43.250
compare the values to see if they changed.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: You're right.

63
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.830
Now, we've turned it from key presses,
into searches.

64
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.310
And now with searches, we should be able
to do some sort of thing to make sure that

65
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.060
we don't get two searches
in the same stream.

66
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.650
And it turns out there's a helpful
operator, called Distinct Until Changed,

67
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.770
that will compare successive values in
a stream and will be dedupe them for us.

68
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.670
Okay, so let's try that out.

69
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.920
So now that we've got searches,

70
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.870
I'm gonna make this code work again
cuz now we need to map search

71
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.130
into this, and so
instead of returning input.value.

72
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.923
I'm gonna return or, text box.value,
I mean, I'll just return search so

73
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:25.860
you notice how that went from
key presses to searches?

74
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.872
And then we map from searches into
searchResultSets and then we flattened and

75
00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:34.472
we're good.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay, so

76
00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:37.290
now that I've got this stream of searches,

77
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.581
I am going to run distinctUntilChanged.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

78
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:52.085
that turns something like this
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Right, if we hit the left

79
00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:55.397
arrow we'd end up with a stream like this
right because it's still the same searche,

80
00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:57.545
it's ab and then av right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And

81
00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:01.058
then you have to hit the right arrow.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yes and

82
00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.950
you'd hit the right arrow exactly

83
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.078
into.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: If

84
00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:14.840
ever you are in doubt of what your
stream looks like try and write it out.

85
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.410
Try and write out and visualize each step.

86
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.600
It's really important cause let's face it
it's hard to picture all the stuff in your

87
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.540
head and
console logging it works great for arrays.

88
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.880
But you can't console log
an observable data structure, right?

89
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.280
If you have an array in memory.

90
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.460
You can console log it and
you can see it all in JSON.

91
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.560
But you can't console log an observable.

92
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.430
You can put breakpoints in your handlers,
right?

93
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.980
But this is where you're going
to have to actually sort of

94
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.310
live in your head a little bit.

95
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.216
And it helps to get that stuff out on the
page and sort of see what it looks like.

96
00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:47.430
So that, is going to take this stream and
turn it into this stream.

97
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.384
Right because we got two abs
in a row in the stream and

98
00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:52.118
we de-duped them to just ab.

99
00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:53.890
Does that make sense?

100
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.030
So now let's try and
I don't think we'll see a result but

101
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.430
we'll know we'll know that it's worked.

102
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.570
We'll see less network requests.

103
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.805
We could probably see that
if we went down the chrome.

104
00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:09.560
Uh-oh
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you save?

105
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.310
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: No, I'm not saved.

106
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.205
But I don't expect that I
need to save that action.

107
00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:15.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Usually it says like locked

108
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.600
or something when you click save.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay.

109
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or freeze.

110
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.760
It turns to freeze.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Well,

111
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.446
run would presumably work.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I might have a typo or

112
00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:33.260
something.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's comment out

113
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.731
distinctUntilChanged and
see if that's the problem.

114
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.723
Input.value.

115
00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:39.884
It's textbox.value.

116
00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:44.909
I'll save and run, and
now we have our auto

117
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:51.766
complete hopefully
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Has

118
00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:54.090
somebody actually been
changing the text box?

119
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.845
I think somebody changing it out from
under me because before that text box

120
00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:59.160
appeared to the right maybe not maybe
I just made that window smaller.

121
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I think it's smaller.

122
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.903
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah that's what it is

123
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:05.149
I'll leave it like that, it looks better.

124
00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.130
Textbox.values not working.

125
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.170
Let's just make sure I don't have
a I'm seeing a little air here.

126
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.205
Is Plunker helping me out?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Map

127
00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:20.960
search should be map function search.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Thank you very much.

128
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.520
This is why I love the arrow function.

129
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.240
I never make that mistake
with arrow functions.

130
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.350
Thank you, Plunker.

131
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.488
It's actually turning out
to be a pretty nice tool.

132
00:06:31.488 --> 00:06:32.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah, yeah,

133
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.480
it's working,
especially with the streaming.

134
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.990
Hopefully worth the wait.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: There we go.

135
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.618
And if I make a left here, now,

136
00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:41.208
how can I prove that I'm not making
any outgoing network requests?

137
00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:43.295
Let's just keep me honest here.

138
00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:47.938
Always good to keep me honest.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And bring up the Network

139
00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:52.153
tab Plunker might just make an arbitrary
network request I'm not sure, but we hit-

140
00:06:52.153 --> 00:06:54.442
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: You can shrink the size of

141
00:06:54.442 --> 00:07:01.309
just that debug tool without you know
like click over here focus on the debug

142
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.732
thing and then I think somewhere down-
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: We just want to make sure

143
00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:07.811
it's readable for the folks at home.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah that, that.

144
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:08.495
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So I am going to

145
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.420
clear out the network requests and
we're gonna hit b.

146
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.470
We should see a network request bam.

147
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.140
But now if I go left a no
network requests right?

148
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.640
Cool.
