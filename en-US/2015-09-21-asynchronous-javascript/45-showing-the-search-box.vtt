2
00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's make this
a little bit more interesting.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.480
Let's make it actually
kind of mirror the types

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.720
of things that we happen in applications.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.020
Because sometimes
applications have come up and

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.260
they have an auto complete
box all the time.

7
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.410
It's just up there in the corner, but
maybe you've got an application where

8
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.700
an auto complete box only
appears when you open a form.

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.960
And then it disappears
when you close that form.

10
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.080
Right, so maybe you don't wanna have this
autocomplete box around all the time, or

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.690
certainly you might not want to
hook up to that event all the time.

12
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.940
In fact, maybe the autocomplete box
doesn't even exist all the time.

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.580
What would it look like to open a form,
and

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.350
then begin listening to
the auto complete box?

15
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.630
And then close the form, and
then stop listening to it.

16
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.450
So let's zoom out just one level,

17
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.300
because maybe your whole app
isn't just this one form.

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.370
Does that makes sense?

19
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.520
So what if I click a button, and

20
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.310
then we open a form with
an auto complete box in it.

21
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.220
And then there's an x button and we click
that x button and then we close that form.

22
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.910
And make sure that we're no longer
subscribed up to that text box event?

23
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.010
What happens if you have
an event listener on a text box?

24
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.430
And then you remove
the text box from the dom?

25
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have a zombie listener.

26
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.580
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Right, what's
happening is you might actually have

27
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.830
the dom object still in memory right,
because it's holding onto your closure and

28
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.595
by extension you.

29
00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:26.050
So, you wanna avoid that.

30
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.360
So, what we'd like to do,

31
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.440
is when we get rid of the text box we'd
also like to kind of stop listening.

32
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.670
We want to stop listening to our
search results sets, observable.

33
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.420
So let's make this HTML
a little more interesting.

34
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.810
I'm gonna have a button, which I click
again this is not about design this class.

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.692
So I'm gonna trust you guys have the HTML
chops to make this a lot prettier.

36
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.056
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And
we're gonna call this the search forum.

37
00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:00.587
And I'm gonna have a button,
which is going to show this search forum.

38
00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:27.452
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: We close this,
we buy ourselves some room.

39
00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:32.470
So now, the search area is only going to
appear when we click the search button.

40
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.370
So what should I do?

41
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.470
If I want the the area to only appear
when I click the search button.

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.476
What should we do?

43
00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:45.250
What's the first step?

44
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.194
Well what's the asynchronous API I'm gonna
be working with in order to listen for

45
00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:52.204
that search button.

46
00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.127
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The button clicks?

47
00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:54.700
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: The button click right?

48
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.180
So what should I do first?

49
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.217
Should I just add an event
listener to the button click?

50
00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:01.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You should
subscribe to the button clicks.

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.700
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I should adapt
the button clicks to an observable and

52
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.350
subscribe to them, right?

53
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.040
Now I mean maybe that
may seem like overkill.

54
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.394
Because maybe all I'm doing is I'm
just [INAUDIBLE] over this thing.

55
00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:12.647
And then displaying something,

56
00:03:12.647 --> 00:03:15.090
maybe there's no point in
adopting it to an observable.

57
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.110
Well let's see let's find
out if there's a win her.

58
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.690
So I'm going to go into script J.S.
I'm going to you grab

59
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.375
a search button referenced
using document get element ID.

60
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.494
Does anybody know how to
make auto complete darkness?

61
00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:33.841
Does anybody out there in the web know
how to, because tab isn't working so

62
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:37.360
that would be an awfully nice
way to save me from some typing.

63
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.558
And now just like we got key presses,

64
00:03:42.558 --> 00:03:48.665
we can also get,
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Search button clicks.

65
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.505
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And
what's the last argument to form event?

66
00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:03.035
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Click.

67
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:03.876
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Click.

68
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:11.660
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So first thing's first.

69
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.350
What do I wanna do when
search button gets clicked?

70
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.260
All I got is an observable.

71
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.310
What do I wanna do,

72
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.840
and do is the operative word here,
because I'm changing something.

73
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.904
When the search button gets clicked,
what am I changing?

74
00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:36.260
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Well,
let's go back to the index HTML.

75
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.730
I've got this hidden div,
which contains the search screen.

76
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.770
And I want to show it when
the searchButton is clicked.

77
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.430
So, because I'm changing the dom,
what I want to use is foreach.

78
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.590
Can anybody tell me why I
would want to use foreach?

79
00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.555
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because your
just going to do it once.

80
00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:02.187
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Well I might
do it many times, right,

81
00:05:02.187 --> 00:05:04.700
every time somebody clicks
search I want to open it.

82
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.960
My point is as soon as I
am changing something,

83
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.120
an object that I don't own that
I didn't create a global object.

84
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.110
I always want to do it
inside of a foreach block,

85
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.130
because when you're looking
through your code and

86
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.380
you wanna know where the code is that's
causing some side effect to occur.

87
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.510
Ideally, not always or some exceptions
will come back to that, but

88
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.230
ideally you should just be able
to look at your foreach box and

89
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.180
then you can see where all of the affects
are happening in your application, right?

90
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.150
So why don't we start there?

91
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:42.822
I actually I'm gonna call foreach,
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

92
00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:46.007
then every single time
the search button is clicked.

93
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.910
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I'm just
gonna delete this now

94
00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:02.518
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I'm gonna go ahead and

95
00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:06.667
display the search green,
which is named search one.

96
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.939
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: What's
the opposite of none?

97
00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.576
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Block.

98
00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:24.296
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Block?
Thank you.

99
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.482
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So
let's see if that works.

100
00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.160
Search didn't work.

101
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: If you go up to
where you registered the button.

102
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.940
Do you have that in quotes?

103
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.530
From event.

104
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.050
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I do.

105
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.988
Thank you.

106
00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:51.280
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's run it.

107
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.210
Now when I click search, we see our box.

108
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.606
Okay, now we want to be able to again
not about design you get the picture

109
00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:01.474
it'll pop up a nice pretty dialog, but

110
00:07:01.474 --> 00:07:05.402
that's the idea with a little styles of
CSS we can make this look little prettier.

111
00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:09.120
But we also when we pop up a dialog we
usually have some sort of button to close

112
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.780
it, right?

113
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.180
We wanna be able to like
close that dialogue.

114
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.230
Usually in X button in the top right?

115
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.170
But let's just make it
a little easier than that.

116
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.880
And we can worry about the CSS
afterwards or not at all.

117
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.809
I'm gonna put a close button in here.

118
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.614
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay and
we're gonna stop and we're gonna save,

119
00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:34.780
we're gonna run again.

120
00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:42.230
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay,
now let's make this close button work.

121
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.600
Now the interesting thing is,
this close button is always there, right?

122
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.830
It's just hidden on the screen, but
it doesn't have to work that way.

123
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.840
I could actually remove these elements and

124
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.770
only create them when
somebody clicked search.

125
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.180
So rather than just subscribing
to the close button,

126
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.950
why don't we only subscribe to the close
button after we display the form, right?

127
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.749
Because then that gives us the flexibility
later on to lazily create these dom

128
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:07.750
elements, right?

129
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.050
Does that make sense?

130
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.670
Rather than have them on
the screen all the time,

131
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.080
because that uses a lot of memory,
potentially.
