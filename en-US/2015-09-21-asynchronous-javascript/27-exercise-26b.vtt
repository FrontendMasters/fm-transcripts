[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.220
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: How do we manage to
get a variable bound to both of these

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.390
at the same time, right?

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.616
Cuz that's what we need, yep?

5
00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:12.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Zip.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.000
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Zip, right?

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.710
Cuz zip will allow us to go through
both of these arrays positionally at

8
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.500
the same time and execute and
pass them both to a function,

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.330
one from the left hand side and
one from the right hand side.

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.229
So if I use array.zip, and
I pass in time, and I'm actually gonna,

11
00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:29.656
to be very clear here,
I'm gonna be, I always name arrays,

12
00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:33.477
array variables plural,
even if I only expect to have one in them.

13
00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:36.580
Cuz we don't want any any confusion
about whether it's an array of one or

14
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.710
just one value.

15
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.974
So I'm gonna call it times.

16
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:41.155
And boxarts, cuz who knows?

17
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.070
It could have more than one.

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.930
And then we have time.

19
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.560
Now we have a single time and
a single boxart.

20
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.090
And here,
notice I have a variable bound to time.

21
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.530
That is the time for
the the video, the one time.

22
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.580
I have variable bound to
the smallest boxart for the video.

23
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.750
In fact, I'm actually gonna emphasize
that by calling it smallestBoxart.

24
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.100
I have a variable bound to video.

25
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.210
I have a variable bound to list.

26
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.190
I have everything I need in
order to create my final result.

27
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.610
So, inside of here, I'm gonna take what
I was doing earlier and paste it in.

28
00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:27.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're saying you're
missing an opening param at 162.

29
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.110
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: 162, is that, am I?

30
00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:39.590
That's why that was saying that I,
perfect.

31
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.600
Okay, thanks guys.

32
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.393
Time, smallestBoxart.

33
00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:51.246
Now, I think actually I had to
grab not just the boxart, but

34
00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:54.460
the URL of the boxart if I remember
correctly, or is that correct?

35
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.320
Okay, so
we've got more to it than just that.

36
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.540
Now we could throw a map in there, or
right here, we can just pull out the URL.

37
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.389
That's probably what I would do so
I'll just do that.

38
00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:15.644
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Also on 158 to
159 you have both boxarts.

39
00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:17.706
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Thank you.

40
00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:22.608
Yes, that is not good.

41
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.296
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So
now we have an editor, so

42
00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:36.627
it's much easier to line up our brackets.

43
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.570
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: I'm gonna lower this
font size just for a second, guys.

44
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.489
I'll bring it right back up.

45
00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:06.013
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So let's see if we've
got, now we've done the first step,

46
00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.633
which is just keep mapping,
just keep mapping until, or

47
00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:12.401
zipping as the case may be, until we've
got a variable bound to everything that we

48
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.130
need to create our result.

49
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.640
Now let's just see where we are.

50
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.940
I mean,
maybe we don't have the right result.

51
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.250
Maybe we're off by a few brackets or
something.

52
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.180
So let's copy.

53
00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:31.355
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Paste, and
then see what it looks like when we run.

54
00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:34.228
Uh-oh, I'm missing a semicolon.

55
00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:40.671
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: That's
always a challenging one.

56
00:03:56.177 --> 00:03:58.338
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So the first thing to
do is make sure all of our brackets

57
00:03:58.338 --> 00:03:59.020
are matched up.

58
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.840
That looks good to me.

59
00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:17.421
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Anybody out
there see my syntax error?

60
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.065
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Maybe right here?

61
00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.657
Hm, looks good.

62
00:04:29.657 --> 00:04:33.109
Starting parentheses.

63
00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:33.949
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Return needs perim.

64
00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:34.985
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Sorry?

65
00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:37.199
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you
just catch that object?

66
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.297
Return needs perim,
is what they're saying?

67
00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:43.785
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Line number, guys?

68
00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:48.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 170 [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: 170, this one?

69
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I think you got it.

70
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.250
That's what it was.

71
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.096
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: That was
the missing piece, okay.

72
00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:10.100
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Mm-mm, well,
I'm pretty sure this is the right answer.

73
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.883
So, well, I wanna,

74
00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:17.740
I think I'm missing another
parenthesis here actually, to end zip.

75
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:22.714
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yes.

76
00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:40.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Have you tried
the browser console for debugging?

77
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.160
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah,
well that's actually what I'm doing.

78
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.630
So if we switch over,
we should see the printed results here.

79
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's the web console.

80
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.450
There's something different
called the browser console.

81
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.130
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: In Firefox?

82
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.205
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
look under the developer,

83
00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:03.280
the Webtools menu on the browser.

84
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.710
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: On the browser side?

85
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.799
Well actually, do you mind, I think
we've actually got the result here,

86
00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:07.840
can we just take a quick look at this?

87
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.470
And then I'll, I think we're
actually in a good place now.

88
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.660
I'm just not sure if we've got
the right one, so let me just clear.

89
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.465
And I'll run that one more time.

90
00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.620
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So it's complaining that
we don't have the right expected output.

91
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.650
But let's take a look at
what we actually have.

92
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:33.090
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Now can anybody see
if I've done something wrong here?

93
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.641
Cuz to me,
it actually looks reasonably good.

94
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:39.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You have to,
don't you have to concat and work on it?

95
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.770
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yep.
It looks like we've got an extra level of

96
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.970
array nesting here,

97
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.533
because within each video,
we have an array of one video, right?

98
00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.320
That's probably not what we want.

99
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.290
So we see right here under videos,
we actually have a two dimensional array.

100
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.080
So this is the key to
actually debugging your code.

101
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.320
Do a map, print it out,
take a look at it and

102
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.680
see if it actually matches
up with what you expect.

103
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.850
So we forgot to go through and
do our level of nesting.

104
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.041
So, or want to one level of nesting here.

105
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.650
So what I'm gonna do
right here in this map,

106
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.230
this doesn't seem like a two
dimensional array to me.

107
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.040
Because, what we've got is we've
got a list and for each one,

108
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.170
we're returning a list object.

109
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.270
So this isn't the problem.

110
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.370
It's over here at videos that we seem
to have an extra level of array.

111
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.950
So how do we get it out?

112
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.150
How do we get it out?

113
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.800
Concat.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Concat.

114
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.950
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Concat?

115
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.450
I don't know.

116
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.950
That might be the solution,
but I don't think so.

117
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.880
I think we actually have the exact
same problem that we had before.

118
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.760
I could be wrong here, but maybe not.

119
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.890
Maybe we just need concatMap.

120
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.670
You're right.

121
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's just
an array of arrays.

122
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.650
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: You're right,
videos is an array of arrays.

123
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.660
So right here,
we know that we can apply a concatMap.

124
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.410
I can just make that change
directly in Firefox.

125
00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:11.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You have to implement it.

126
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.900
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah, I loaded this
up this morning and I restarted it.

127
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.760
So we just have to make sure.

128
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.920
If you ever run into a problem where you
can't find concatMap, just go up and

129
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.128
rerun your concatAll function.

130
00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:22.280
If you've closed your browser and
then opened it again,

131
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.620
remember that concatAll and
concatMap don't exist on the array.

132
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.910
And so you've just gotta go up and
make sure to run your concatAll example.

133
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.580
So to add it back into the browser.

134
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.160
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And
then run your concatMap example.

135
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.988
Now hoping that it'll work.

136
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:46.560
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Worked.

137
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.430
So no news is good news.

138
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.660
Actually, yeah, we're returning results.

139
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.410
So as you can see,
you can attack this iteratively, right?

140
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.620
Just keep printing it out to the console.

141
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.500
My Firefox lack of proficiency
notwithstanding, whatever your browser is

142
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.120
that you feel comfortable using,
write it out to the console.

143
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.130
Take a look at the expected output, and
you can just apply the right operator,

144
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.040
whether it's concats.

145
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.630
Figure out how many levels deep you are,

146
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.250
and then apply the concats
where you need to apply them.

147
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.760
So that's the coping mechanism for

148
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.460
trying to deal with these large
expressions and print them out, so.
