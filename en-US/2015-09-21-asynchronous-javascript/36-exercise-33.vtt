[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.657
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's move on, but this
example is great but anybody think of,

3
00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:08.410
I mean usually when you
see a mouse drag it,

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.260
it actually it's kinda got something
that's not so great about it.

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.518
Can anybody tell me what we can
improve about this mouse drag?

6
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.315
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We will transition
like through the glide.

7
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.407
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Well, the glide is
not that bad but if I click here and

8
00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:23.880
then I move, notice what happens?

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.517
It kinda [SOUND] jumps
to the mouse position.

10
00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:29.817
What we wanna do with a mouse drag
is usually, wherever we click,

11
00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:33.897
the click point on that button, we want it
to maintain the same offset from the top

12
00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:36.470
left of the sprite as we move around.

13
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.501
So, let's try that.

14
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.600
How would I do that?

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.838
So here, we start off with
the exact same program that we

16
00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:47.463
started off with before, right?

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.886
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: But notice that for every
mouse down, we get an event object that

18
00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:59.840
within it contains the contact point,
the offset on the object where we clicked.

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.390
So remember, whenever we convert
an event to an observable,

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.160
every single one of the objects in the
stream is actually that event object that

21
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.110
you would have gotten on your handler
from out of that listener, and

22
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.470
so this event object for a mouse
down has a lot of information on it.

23
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.026
It has for
example the absolute position pageX pageY.

24
00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:21.681
I believe it also has offset x and
offset y, right?

25
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.686
So this is what an object looks like,

26
00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:26.802
at least some of the properties
on an event object we get.

27
00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:31.271
So offsetX and offsetY describes
how far we were from the top left

28
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:34.350
of the sprite when we clicked on it,
right?

29
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.950
Does that make sense?

30
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.530
So what we'd like to do is we'd like
to turn the objects that come out of

31
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.830
the mouseDrag stream, instead of
the X being the mouse move position,

32
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.160
cuz that's what it currently is, right?

33
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.880
Where for every mousedown we're returning
all the mousemove event objects

34
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.100
until the mouseup.

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.160
What we like is we like to translate that
mouse move position so that instead of it

36
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.020
being the exact position, we'd like to
offset the X and Y positions by the amount

37
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.080
of offset that there was when we first
clicked it, when we got the mouse down.

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.254
So for every mouse down, when we
remove some of these comments here so

39
00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:08.797
we can see all the code on screen.

40
00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:20.585
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So for every mousedown,
we get the mousedown object which is what

41
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.509
we can use to get the contact point,
how far we were offset from the object we

42
00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.651
clicked on by looking at the offsetX and
offsetY property.

43
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.881
And then what we wanna do is instead of
returning mouseups, mousemoves just one of

44
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:36.236
those mouse move objects are, it's almost
like we wanna substitute each mouse move

45
00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:40.159
object for an object that has the same x
and y positions offset by the amount of

46
00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.750
distance we were when we clicked the
original top left position on that button.

47
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.596
So, what we really wanna use is
we wanna use the offsetX and

48
00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:58.151
offsetY
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: On the contact point.

49
00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:08.578
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And then we want to
translate the mousemove objects before we

50
00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:09.777
send them back.

51
00:03:09.777 --> 00:03:11.503
So we wanna convert all the x and

52
00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:15.762
y positions on the mousemove events
that we get, before they get returned.

53
00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.775
What operators am I gonna use for this?

54
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:21.691
So I wanna take every mousemove event and
I wanna substitute it for some other

55
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:25.502
object that has different properties
that are offset by certain amount.

56
00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:30.194
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Anybody know?

57
00:03:31.326 --> 00:03:32.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No Map is it?

58
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.800
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah,
we heard map, right?

59
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.370
Just like if I wanna take one
two three and map over them and

60
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.890
turn them to two three four by adding one
to every single one, I can map over all

61
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.866
the mousemove event objects and
change their x and y positions, right?

62
00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:45.780
It's the same thing.

63
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.450
We're just applying a math operation
to each one of those event objects.

64
00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:55.619
So, I'm actually not sure am I show
answer on this because we faster but,

65
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.876
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So pageX and pageY,

66
00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:07.200
are what we read in forEach,
when we position things.

67
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.326
Cuz we actually position
is absolutely in the page.

68
00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:12.239
So position this drag point
absolutely on the page.

69
00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.616
But, notice we're subtracting the X and

70
00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:21.290
Y position of the contact point that
we got from the mousedown event.

71
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.040
Cuz, we captured the event object we got
from the mousedown in the closer scope.

72
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.221
So we have access to it and
we can use it to offset the pageX and

73
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:35.100
pageY position of the mousedown
event that we're returning.

74
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.632
And so now we should see
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Oops

75
00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:43.445
[LAUGH] should see a bug.

76
00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:44.481
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Reset?

77
00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:45.517
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Sorry?

78
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:46.553
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Reset?

79
00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.018
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Might be.

80
00:04:48.018 --> 00:04:49.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And then [INAUDIBLE]

81
00:04:54.585 --> 00:05:00.740
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Live coding people.

82
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: A lot of public speaking.

83
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.767
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah,
a lot of public speaking too.

84
00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:19.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Keep going,
it's the next one.

85
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.202
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Next one?
Thank you.

86
00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:33.420
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Darn it.

87
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Well, if you refreshed
didn't it lose your concatAlls and such?

88
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.080
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah, but
those are on the array, so

89
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.670
all the methods are already
defined on the observable.

90
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.030
So I'm not sure what's going on here, but

91
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.262
we can probably find out,
it's not too much effort.

92
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:48.122
I'm gonna remove my map statement
which should mean that it works

93
00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.945
exactly the same way as the last example.

94
00:06:02.957 --> 00:06:03.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: One more down.

95
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.060
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Thank you.

96
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Chatroom saying they
had switched to Chrome to get this

97
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.350
one to work.

98
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.170
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay,
this might be a Firefox thing.

99
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.080
If so, I apologize.

100
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.330
This was originally written in Chrome.

101
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.640
So there may just be an event,
what I expect is different

102
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.740
dom implementations may have
different properties, so

103
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.580
I may have used a proprietary property
like offsetX or something like that.

104
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.543
So, if so, I apologize.

105
00:06:32.772 --> 00:06:34.793
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: It's always good
to test on multiple browsers.

106
00:06:39.147 --> 00:06:41.500
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's checking
it out working on Firefox.

107
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.369
Or, excuse me, on Chrome.

108
00:06:53.482 --> 00:06:54.900
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: There we go.

109
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.887
So I'm probably just using
a proprietary property like offsetX or

110
00:06:58.887 --> 00:07:03.442
pageX on Chrome or it doesn't work the
same way in both browsers which I think

111
00:07:03.442 --> 00:07:06.658
all of us in here have probably
run into at some point.

112
00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.441
But that's effectively all I'm doing.

113
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:12.075
I'm mapping over each one of
these mousemove objects and

114
00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:14.640
I'm translating the points.

115
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.870
So we're just using the same
functions we use an array for

116
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.410
the same purpose to translate
each one of those objects.

117
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.910
Okay?
