00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.649
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So
let's make it a little bit shorter so

3
00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:08.210
we don't see that whole event there and
go key code.

4
00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:19.920
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah, once again.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.450
So now we've got a collection of all
the key presses, from now until eternity.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.940
It's never gonna end until we
dispose of the subscription.

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.600
What we wanna do now, in order to be able
to go get search results from Wikipedia.

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.176
We need to be able to
make a network request.

9
00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:38.010
So that's gonna be a little bit of
a challenge, cuz in JS Bin, from within

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.940
JS Bin anyway, you can't make an XHR
request, because it would be cross domain.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510
But who here has heard of JSONP?

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.690
Anybody heard of JSONP?

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.210
Right, so that's a neat little
trick we can use to get around

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.570
the cross domain restriction.

15
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.400
And thankfully,
Wikipedia supports JSONP APIs.

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.140
So let's try and
pull in a jQuery API to do that.

17
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.330
So let's see how we would
do this with jQuery.

18
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.890
So I'm gonna pull in a Wikipedia search.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.070
And let's take a close
look at this function.

20
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.660
There's not much going on here.

21
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.560
You take a term, right, and
then we embed that term into a url.

22
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.590
And notice I've got that little on
the very end, I've got url parameter,

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.740
just callback equals question mark.

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.570
What jQuery does, it's gonna use that,
it's gonna enter enter something in there,

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.140
and then create a callback under the hood.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.200
That's how the JSONP machinery works.

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.920
When you download a JSONP request,

28
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.020
it's actually a script,
that invokes a callback.

29
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.060
And so, what's gonna happen, is jQuery is
going to create a local function, give it

30
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.150
a name, and then take that same name,
and give it the callback URL, and then

31
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.880
Wikipedia gives us the request, it's gonna
invoke the function that we just defined.

32
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.970
So if you don't understand all the JSONP
stuff, don't worry too much about it.

33
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.790
It's not really core
to understanding this.

34
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.120
What is core to understanding this,
is that when we execute this function,

35
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.010
all you need to know is that
we've gone to jQuery and

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.940
we're printing the result
that we get back from jQuery.

37
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.728
So I'm gonna run search Wikipedia, and

38
00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:06.706
let's look up Terminator.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

39
00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:12.404
now I'm gonna clear the console.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: And

40
00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:16.350
run, and look what we got.

41
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.720
We got this object back from Wikipedia.

42
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.070
I'm gonna close the other tab, just for a
momen,t so we can take a close look at it.

43
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.470
So what does it look like?

44
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.900
Well, it looks like it's got this object,
it looks like possibly an array,

45
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.910
with zeros,
that seems like the search we made, and

46
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.526
here seems like an array
of possible searches.

47
00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.960
So that array of possible searches is what
we're gonna use for auto complete box.

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.220
Does that make sense?

49
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.480
So as we type things in we're
gonna keep hitting Wikipedia and

50
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.992
bring that array of
possible searches back.

51
00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:52.924
But, we don't wanna work with
this weird callback API.

52
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:56.467
We wanna convert this API into returning
unobservable, cuz that's gonna give us

53
00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.910
the powerful combination operators
to squeeze them all together.

54
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.830
So now that we know what
this thing looks like.

55
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.308
Hopefully I can get JS bin to show me

56
00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:12.255
the.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: JS bin

57
00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:16.078
gets a little bit finicky every now and
then, there's a little toolbar up here.

58
00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:20.260
Bear with me.

59
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.370
All right guys we're back.

60
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.690
[LAUGH] Let's get started with Plunker.

61
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.254
Plunker to the rescue.

62
00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:29.329
So I've got J Query and I've got RX.

63
00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.599
So now that I've got my text box,
remember we're gonna create

64
00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.042
the key presses collection and that's just
a matter of going, well for some actually

65
00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:40.590
going to bring in the observable
sort of keep typing RX observable.

66
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.930
This is implicitly done in your exercises,
by the way, when you go, when you've been

67
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.050
using observable, is the rx, we're
implicitly writing that line of code so

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.520
you can use observable
without going rx.observable.

69
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.366
So, let's go Observable.fromEvent,
textbox,

70
00:03:56.366 --> 00:04:01.802
keypress.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Now,

71
00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:10.793
if I go keypresses.forEach.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: By the way,

72
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:13.310
anybody know how we can use ES6 and
Plunker?

73
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.526
If you do, just shout it out on
the chat room and that would be better.

74
00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.816
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: So now if we've done this

75
00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:32.290
correctly, and we can find the run button.

76
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.609
Anybody know what happened
to that run button?

77
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:40.955
Stop, okay, here we go, run.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Great,

78
00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:42.330
so did everybody see that?

79
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.800
We've converted our keypresses on
the text box to an observable stream.

80
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.350
So we've got one of our collections.

81
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.800
We've got key presses, and

82
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.324
now we need the other, we need a function
that will give us a collection of one.

83
00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:55.840
That will make a network request for

84
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.390
us from Wikipedia to get those
search results we saw earlier.

85
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.900
So I'm going to comment this out.

86
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.211
So let's go, so I've got jQuery,
so I'm gonna paste in a piece

87
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:13.850
of code that I had earlier on JS
doc which, somewhere, here we go.

88
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.242
This piece of code which we'll use jQuery
to go out and get a network request.

89
00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:31.270
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: From Wikipedia.

90
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.190
So I'm gonna go, see there seems to be
some sort of collaboration going on here.

91
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.530
I notice a people are selecting stuff.

92
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.720
Is that expected?

93
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.820
I think everybody out there
can actually edit this code.

94
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.698
So if you'll tread lightly,
that would be ideal.

95
00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:50.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] didn't

96
00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:51.725
you?
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Yeah I did.

97
00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:55.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE].

98
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.520
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Might be like

99
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.300
collaboration mode.

100
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.230
It's all right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think maybe just

101
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.836
the highlighter's messed up.

102
00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:03.584
Maybe it's just the highlighter?
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: It seemed to

103
00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:05.170
be actually moving.

104
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.930
So, there you go, more.

105
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.010
I don't know if somebody out
there is selecting code but-

106
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.985
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I just [INAUDIBLE].

107
00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:13.979
[LAUGH] I think maybe
people can highlight, but

108
00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.383
I don't think they can edit.
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Okay, interesting.

109
00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:18.319
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]

110
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.730
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: All right.

111
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.600
Okay, so
you see we explained JSON P already.

112
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.949
I'm gonna call searchWikipedia and
then I'm gonna pass in Terminator.

113
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.030
We get a keyboard event.

114
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.240
That's fine, but, we haven't gotten
our request from the server yet.

115
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.517
I hope that pans out.

116
00:06:55.627 --> 00:06:59.571
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] it's
weird to see the before we.

117
00:07:13.043 --> 00:07:13.636
&gt;&gt; Jafar Husain: Let's try and

118
00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.620
run through debugger, will that work?

119
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.132
Come on plucker.

120
00:07:18.132 --> 00:07:23.289
I may just have, nope.

121
00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.184
I see,

122
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:31.980
we're good.

123
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.860
There we go.

124
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.510
De bugger should make that network
request and we get, not so obvious, but

125
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.930
we get an object back from the server.

126
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.450
And that all object looks like,
I believe, if you remember,

127
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.590
we had an array where the first item
was actually the search we made, and

128
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.050
the second item I believe
was an array of the results.

129
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.180
So, there we go there's our array
of search results for Terminator.
