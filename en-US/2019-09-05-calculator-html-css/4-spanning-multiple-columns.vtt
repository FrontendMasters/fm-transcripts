00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.
With that in mind, how we just did that,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.670
that's how we coded that
exception to the rule.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.690
I want you to take a minute, and
I want you to think about the last row.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.460
So, what's the difference between
the last row and the one above it?

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.960
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's triple

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.600
the size of those.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.110
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have one
button that's triple the size.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.360
Correct?

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.290
Go on ahead and try coding that row, now.

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.240
Fabulous.

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.000
So, hopefully you came up with
a solution kinda similar to mine.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.530
So, I have, in my row,
I have a button here.

13
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.420
It's just 0, and
I added a class called triple.

14
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.350
Since I added one called double,
before, we'll call this one triple.

15
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.950
Okay?

16
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.760
And then, my other button says =.

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.570
Right?
So, now,

18
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.480
if we take a look at this in the web
browser, that's how it's looking now.

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.183
Hey, it's kind of vaguely,
sort of, calculatory.

20
00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:54.692
Isn't it?

21
00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:57.303
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

22
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.310
This is what I mean by you have to
actually get these things on the page,

23
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.490
before you can start saying, I know, now,
what I need to do to make it pretty.

24
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.910
Right?

25
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.310
So, I’m looking at it like, okay,
I can sort of see the calculator now.

26
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.120
It's sort of coming together.

27
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.413
Clearly, there’s more work to do.

28
00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:15.202
Yes, Dave?

29
00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:20.246
&gt;&gt; Dave: Is there any disadvantage
to have just used the equals

30
00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:25.452
button on my keyboard or, instead of the-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not necessarily.

31
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.340
You might be able to do that.

32
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.690
This is a better methodology,
is actually coding the names in.

33
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.571
Yeah.

34
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:35.920
Sometimes there can be
processing errors or whatever.

35
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.940
Yeah.

36
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.510
So this is just, generally,
the better way of doing things.

37
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.870
So, now, let's go through, and
let's start putting in some CSS.
