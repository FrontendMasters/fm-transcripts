&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let me just leave
you with this final parting thought,

2
00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:06.472
that we have been working a lot
on HTML and CSS this week.

3
00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:10.059
There are more parts of web development
that we haven't talked about yet.

4
00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.459
So before you actually start coding your
website, there's a huge process that comes

5
00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.758
in thinking about what it is you're
going to put on the website,

6
00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.569
what kind of pictures you're going to
choose, what are you going to say?

7
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:24.482
Why is it that you're building
this website in the first place?

8
00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:29.582
So this part of the development process
is called user experience or UX.

9
00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:33.047
You'll also hear something referred
to as UI which is the development

10
00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:34.347
of the interface itself.

11
00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:38.058
So if you like HTML and CSS,
you like graphic design,

12
00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:42.696
you wanna do more of that kind of work,
you might also check out UX.

13
00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:44.621
Just go ahead and type in UX,

14
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:48.490
you'll probably pull up
a zillion resources in Google.

15
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.175
And you can make great careers in UX and
UI.

16
00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:57.423
In fact, we're I'm from in the Boston
area of Massachusetts here in the US,

17
00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.869
there is an enormous UX community.

18
00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.000
This is making websites
actually usable and

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.306
achieving the goals that are set out for
them.

20
00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:10.137
And then of course Brian is gonna be
talking about JavaScript this week.

21
00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.979
JavaScript is, I think,
is the mostly focusing on the front end,

22
00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.284
JavaScript is definitely moving
to the back end as well.

23
00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:22.283
So there's a whole another realm of
programming on the back end in terms

24
00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:25.127
of database design, and programming.

25
00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:27.839
It's been absolutely fabulous being
here with all of you this week.

26
00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.287
I had so much fun.

27
00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:30.536
Thank you all so much.

28
00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:33.410
I will see you out there online, bye.

29
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.685
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Thank you, thank you.
