00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the last thing we're
gonna work on is this calculator.

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.440
In order to get started, make sure you
download your Zip, the Zip files here

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.055
from our instructions up here at
the very top of the GitHub page.

4
00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.685
Go ahead and download this.

5
00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:18.655
As you know next week,

6
00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:21.945
you're going to need working with
JavaScript with Brian Hope, and

7
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:27.655
Brian is going to teach you how to make a
fully functional calculator that you can.

8
00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:29.015
You're going to coat it with JavaScript.

9
00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.615
It will do all the adding and
subtracting and multiplying and

10
00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.780
dividing, which is totally awesome.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.180
But before you start that calculator and
all that programming that goes with it,

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.880
you actually have to make a calculator,
yeah.

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay, so we're gonna do another
one of these exercises.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.230
We did one with the blog earlier
where I gave you the picture and

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.530
said code the thing.

16
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.690
We're gonna do exactly that same kind
of exercise here with this calculator.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.710
So this is the way
the calculator is going to look.

18
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.920
You'll see the calculator here.

19
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.250
You'll see that at the top it's got sorta
the area where the numbers are gonna go.

20
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.290
As you click on the numbers and
you type them in,

21
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.500
they're gonna show up there
on the top right, correct?

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.910
We've got, a row of functions, so we have
divide, multiply, subtract, and add.

23
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.970
We have an equal sign.

24
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.200
We have a backspace key, we have a clear
key, and we have some numbers, right?

25
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.780
Okay, so, according to
the instructions here, as it says,

26
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.440
a few things to know
about this calculator.

27
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.880
Here are some things we need to know.

28
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.890
So we are gonna have to first of all
look up some symbols for math, okay?

29
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.700
Because clearly the divide key and
multiply key and

30
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.480
so forth,
they are not here on your keyboard so

31
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.150
we are gonna actually have to look
these up and code those symbols.

32
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.700
So that's something we
are gonna need to do.

33
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.220
These calculator buttons, they're
going to need to be clickable, right?

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.660
We need to be able to click those buttons
just like a regular calculator in real

35
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.750
right life, right?

36
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.223
You guys have actually worked with
the actual calculator, right?

37
00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Those are still things.

38
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.780
Okay, and it was a long time ago.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.680
And then there's some colors
that are used in the design.

40
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.230
Those are all spelled out for you here.

41
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.370
I've given you all of the color codes and

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.280
I told you that the overall width
of this calculator is 400 pixels.

43
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.780
Okay?

44
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.666
So, then I have a suggested
approach down here at the bottom.

45
00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:37.631
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so, what I've suggested
is that we create a wrapper with a width

46
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:40.320
of 400 pixels to set up the calculator.

47
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.550
And we're going to determine how
many rows and columns we need.

48
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.000
And so we're gonna work
through these instructions.

49
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.310
So part of this exercise is trying
to get you to think through

50
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.090
this type of specification.

51
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.100
So this is very typical,

52
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.750
the graphic designer has designed this
beautiful calculator for us, here it is.

53
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.640
And we know that ultimately it's
gonna get coded with JavaScript, and

54
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.310
the buttons are gonna
need to be clickable.

55
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.000
We know that, but we haven't been given
anything else in terms of how to code it.

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.076
And we have to figure out all
the rest of it on our own.
