00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:02.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We've got
the easy rows done, right?

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.315
Those are the ones with
four things in them.

3
00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:11.755
So let's go and take a look at this one
here, the one with three things in it.

4
00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:16.740
So clearly, what is the difference
between that row, this C,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.267
backspace, division versus the 7,
8, 9 times row?

6
00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:22.775
What is the difference between them?

7
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.014
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One of your
buttons spans two columns.

8
00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:31.085
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One of the buttons
has to span two columns, correct?

9
00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.085
But are they all still buttons?

10
00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:33.653
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

11
00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:36.599
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're all still buttons,
okay?

12
00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:40.095
So what we should do then for
that first row,

13
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:45.876
we're just gonna have three buttons
instead of having four, correct?

14
00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:47.391
We'll go ahead and copy that.

15
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.094
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can paste
those buttons in place.

16
00:00:54.067 --> 00:01:00.942
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Change what they are,
so one button is gonna say C.

17
00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.166
One button's gonna say divide, right?

18
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:10.863
Look up our divide code,
so it's just divide.

19
00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:16.976
So &amp;divide, okay.

20
00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.435
And this middle button,

21
00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:22.824
you're going to need the other web page
that I mentioned here in the notes.

22
00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:28.169
So the one about arrows, same website,
but it's the one about the arrows.

23
00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:44.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Look at that,
there's an arrow right there,

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.948
that one looks pretty good.

25
00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:51.002
And so you can go ahead and
copy the code for that,

26
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:57.183
which is &amp;larr, L-A-R-R,
and put that code in place.

27
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.506
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so the C, though,

28
00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:21.016
that button is twice the size
of the others, correct?

29
00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:24.558
That one's spanning two columns.

30
00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:28.359
And so we're going to need a way,
probably another class, right,

31
00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.912
to differentiate that button and the way
it looks from the other buttons, true?

32
00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:34.667
That's a reasonable thing to do.

33
00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:39.860
So what I'm going to do here for
this next button, here in calc button,

34
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.857
let's go ahead and
give this a second class of double.

35
00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:46.709
I've seen some people online doing this.

36
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.427
You can have a lot of classes applied
to the same thing in your document.

37
00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:56.265
You don't have to have a single
class per HTML element.

38
00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:58.396
If you want to use multiple classes,

39
00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:01.228
you're going to have
a single class attribute.

40
00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:06.050
So in other words,
you don't say class=, class=, class=.

41
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.734
That will not work.

42
00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:13.195
Say class=, and then you're gonna put
both class names here inside, all right?

43
00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:15.620
So in this case,
it's gonna say calc button.

44
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.000
And I've added this class of double
because I want it to go over two columns.

45
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.462
So it's a double width button,
that's how I came up with that name.

46
00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:27.254
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
even though it's one string,

47
00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:30.017
the space means that it's
considered two things.

48
00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:32.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's considered two
things with the space in between.

49
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.581
Yeah, no commas.

50
00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.658
It's a space this time.

51
00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:43.000
And I am sorry, [LAUGH] welcome to
the wonderful world of computer science
