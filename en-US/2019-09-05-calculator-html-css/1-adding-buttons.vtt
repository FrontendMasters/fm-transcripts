1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
let's go on ahead and get started.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.750
Let's look at what I have
given you to start with here.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.160
Some of this is important to
the programming side of it, so

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.660
I've given you a little
bit here to start with.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
So we have a section
with a class of screen.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.570
And we have a section with a class
of calc-buttons, all right?

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.290
And there are lots of ways to
code this with HTML and CSS.

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.070
You might be thinking, why do we
have a separate area for a screen?

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.570
Why do we have a separate area for
the buttons?

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
The answer is,
sometimes it matters in JavaScript, okay?

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.680
And Brian actually gave me this
formula here for us to code, and

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.460
so I am going to bow to his future lesson.

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.470
And we're going to keep these divided
up into two areas, a screen area and

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.030
a button area, okay?

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.780
So after that, then we have to go forward
and code the rest of it on our own.

16
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.480
Over here on the side we have our wrapper.

17
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.640
And so this is gonna set up our
calculator here on our webpage, okay?

18
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.275
So as always,
let's start with thinking about the HTML,

19
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:18.986
because if we can't actually see it to
start with, we can't code it later, right?

20
00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:22.718
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
according to our instructions,

21
00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:29.530
I'm suggesting that we start with
how many rows and columns we need.

22
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.650
So given the fact that this area up here,

23
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.390
that's going to be the screen area
there in the in the calculator, right?

24
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.090
We're really worried
about this bottom part.

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.624
So how many rows and
how many columns do we have here?

26
00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:48.531
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Five rows.

27
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.402
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Five rows.

28
00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:51.939
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Four columns.

29
00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.583
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Four columns, correct?

30
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:56.298
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Isn't it six rows?

31
00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:57.697
With the-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well,

32
00:01:57.697 --> 00:01:59.774
we're not gonna count the screen.

33
00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We're-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're not gonna count

34
00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:03.055
the screen, that's gonna be its own thing.

35
00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, I got you.

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's cool,
that's gonna be its own thing.

37
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.400
But everything else, that we are going
to need to rough that out, correct?

38
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.940
Okay, so here's what I would recommend.

39
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.420
Well, first of all, let me just ask you,
what would you recommend?

40
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.770
How do you think you would start this?

41
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.174
Knowing that we have five rows,
and four columns in each row,

42
00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:27.894
how do you think you would start this?

43
00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just to sort
of start some HTML, yeah?

44
00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:33.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can we create
a grid of some sort?

45
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's create
a grid of some sort, right?

46
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.728
Let's go ahead and
code some tags that are gonna be rows, and

47
00:02:39.728 --> 00:02:43.552
let's throw in some other tags that
are gonna be columns, sound good?

48
00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:45.171
Sound reasonable?

49
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:48.967
Okay, so let's go on ahead and do that.

50
00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:57.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So up here for
the screen, we can just simply say 0.

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.758
Yeah, I mean,
that's what's showing right now.

52
00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:03.333
All right, [SOUND] that's done.

53
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.090
Let's move on to the rest of it.

54
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.312
Okay, so down here for calc-buttons,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's

55
00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:12.750
make that a little bit bigger.

56
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.800
So we're gonna have five rows, correct?

57
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.680
So what if we start with a div tag?

58
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.965
We're really not trying to
communicate any meaning to this,

59
00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:26.961
these rows are just here because we
need to have numbers on the row, right?

60
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:29.775
So div tag is a good choice.

61
00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:37.099
And let's give it a class=calc-button-row.

62
00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:51.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
there's our row, whoo-hoo!

63
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.670
Now how many of these do we need?

64
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.040
Five of them?

65
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.540
Right, five of them.

66
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.346
Pull up the picture and take a look again.

67
00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:04.256
So one,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Two,

68
00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:08.866
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three,

69
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.164
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's gonna be a mess, one,

70
00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:18.789
two, three, four, and one more, five

71
00:04:33.464 --> 00:04:34.485
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why would we call them

72
00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.620
all the same thing if some of
them have different formats?

73
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.450
Like some only have three buttons,
some have two buttons.

74
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great question.

75
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.940
Why are we calling them all the same
thing If some of these have

76
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.440
only three buttons, and some of them have
four buttons, and some have two buttons.

77
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.819
That's kinda crazy, isn't it?

78
00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.520
Hmm, okay, that's because when we
actually specify the rows themselves,

79
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.370
those are literally the rows, right?

80
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.253
Inside of it we're going to have to have
some kind of unit that's gonna represent

81
00:05:05.253 --> 00:05:07.386
how many things we have in each row,
right?

82
00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:08.659
Correct?

83
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Correct, okay.

84
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.682
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Jen, can I ask, real quick?

85
00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:14.053
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: How did you highlight and

86
00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:17.028
move everything to the same-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How did I do that?

87
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:20.010
Highlight, click and drag the highlight.

88
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.890
And I have a Mac, so
I'm using the Apple key on Windows,

89
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.790
I think it's just the Ctrl key.

90
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.284
And then the the bracket keys,
sort of to the right of the letter P,

91
00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:36.199
the square bracket keys, that will
move everything together as a unit.

92
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.389
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
let's skip the very first row right now,

93
00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.381
that one's gonna be tricky.

94
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.850
We got some sort of weird
Spanish thing going on.

95
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.320
Let's work on the second row for

96
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.140
the moment, cuz the second
row is pretty typical, right?

97
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.550
There's four things in that row, right?

98
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.440
Four things in that row.

99
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.320
And it's three numbers and
a multiplication sign, correct?

100
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.020
Okay, so tell me how those
things are gonna function.

101
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.280
How are those things gonna function?

102
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.850
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're all buttons.

103
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're buttons.

104
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.835
Do we know how to code a button?

105
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

106
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet,
let's go ahead and code some buttons.

107
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.565
So in that row, we're gonna need
to have four buttons, correct?

108
00:06:20.504 --> 00:06:22.869
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
I'm gonna put in a button, and

109
00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.260
I'm actually gonna give
these classes again.

110
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.040
We have a lot of classes
in this particular example.

111
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.213
This is not the way I normally write CSS,
but again,

112
00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:39.062
this may be very helpful to the JavaScript
example that Brian is gonna show you.

113
00:06:39.062 --> 00:06:43.746
In JavaScript, it's really easy to select
things by class or select things by ID.

114
00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:46.315
So I didn't rewrite his code
to take all the classes out.

115
00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:51.267
I've left them all in because he may be
doing some selecting stuff with that.

116
00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:55.751
So we're gonna go ahead and
set these classes up as calc-button,

117
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.162
cuz that's what they are, right?

118
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:07.241
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now does anybody remember
what goes in between the button tags here?

119
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:08.211
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What you
want on your button.

120
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What you
want on your button.

121
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.148
So what do I want on the first button?

122
00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:15.729
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What do I
want on the first button?

123
00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:16.965
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Seven.

124
00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:18.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Seven, okay?

125
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.380
So we're gonna go ahead and
put a 7 on the first button.

126
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.845
Great, guess what we're gonna do for
button number eight?

127
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:28.688
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Same thing [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about the same thing,

128
00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:30.927
except it's gonna be an 8.

129
00:07:30.927 --> 00:07:34.824
Guess what we're gonna do for
button number nine?

130
00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:37.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Same thing.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Wow, you guys are so smart!

131
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.681
Same thing, except we're gonna
make the button say 9 this time.

132
00:07:43.554 --> 00:07:48.032
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
now for the last button, here.

133
00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:50.477
What is that button gonna be?

134
00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:51.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Times.

135
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.280
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This weirdo
multiplication symbol, right?

136
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.330
We could probably fake it with letter X,
but

137
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.470
there is in fact a multiplication symbol.

138
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.450
And if you refer back to the little
text file that I gave you with this,

139
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.250
up at the top of the page,
I mentioned that there are codes for

140
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.180
some of these funky symbols
that are out there online.

141
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.400
And I gave you a place where
we could look those up.

142
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.873
So if you just go on ahead and
copy that URL.

143
00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:22.173
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's go on ahead and
look at that in a webpage.

144
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.886
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And you'll l see here,

145
00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:39.967
this is a nice little reference that
has lots of great symbols here for us.

146
00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:43.099
If you're putting up math on the web,
this is gonna be super useful to you,

147
00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.000
because there's all kinds of crazy
math symbols out there, right?

148
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.040
But fortunately, they put the ones that
are most used right here at the beginning.

149
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.165
So you'll see that there is
a multiplication sign here, and

150
00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.814
there's a couple of different
ways to write that.

151
00:08:57.632 --> 00:09:01.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
you can either use the HTML code.

152
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.416
Which is this &amp;#215 semicolon,
or you can use the quote,

153
00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:12.845
HTML entity, which is &amp; times semicolon,
either one of those will work.

154
00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:18.219
I'm gonna go ahead and use the actual
times down here on the bottom

155
00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:25.465
because it's much easier to look at that
code and know what that means than &amp;#215.

156
00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:26.921
So you just need to copy that.

157
00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:33.076
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then you can
drop that in, for your button.

158
00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:38.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense?

159
