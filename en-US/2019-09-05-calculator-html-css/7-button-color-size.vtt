00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.014
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so what did we get?

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.634
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Background-color,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And the color,

3
00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:14.607
what did you guys get for
these, background-color?

4
00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Light gray?

5
00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:19.845
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Light gray,
is that what is said in the spec?

6
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.247
It did?

7
00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:24.857
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

8
00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It did?

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.260
No, it said light grey and
then it had code here next to it, right?

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.460
That's the code you should use,

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.165
that one right there, D eight, D nine, DB.

12
00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.769
That's gonna be our background color.

13
00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:48.429
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then our text color is just black.

14
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:58.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, take a peek
at what's going on here so far.

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.541
Whoo, we got like Windows three
point one buttons, sweet.

16
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:09.190
Those Windows three point one buttons
are kinda like very 80s looking.

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.940
So let's see what we can do about
making them look a little better.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.320
Anyone having any suggestions?

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.317
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Border none.

20
00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:17.197
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about border none?

21
00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:20.811
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Get rid of that border.

22
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:28.287
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm also gonna
make the font-size nice and big.

23
00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:32.110
How about we make it 40 pixels
to match what we had before?

24
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.730
It looks like in our spec that all those
font-sizes are more or less the same.

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.292
So, I'm gonna go ahead and set my
font-size here to 40 pixels once again.

26
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.621
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see
how it's looking now.

27
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:48.567
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Better?

28
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:49.687
Getting better and better.

29
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:58.817
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now, one of the problems
that we have here with this calculator at

30
00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:04.234
the moment is that those lovely buttons,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In the calculator,

31
00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:07.126
they're as wide as their content, right.

32
00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.660
And they're kind of as
tall as their content.

33
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.280
Whereas in our spec,
there is like a ton of space around these.

34
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.470
And there's a lot of
ways to accomplish this.

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.490
My first choice would
probably be to go ahead and

36
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.030
do some stuff with padding on this.

37
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
But what Brian has done instead, which
in the case of a calculator is legit,

38
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.450
we're never gonna add any more content
to those particular containers, right?

39
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.468
So, what he has done here
as he has said that we're

40
00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:41.016
going to give this a height of 100 pixels.

41
00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:47.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we're working in flex
box, so there's actually no width, right?

42
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.037
There's just a flex basis.

43
00:02:53.037 --> 00:02:57.853
And the flex basis is gonna be 24.5%.

44
00:02:57.853 --> 00:03:02.551
In other words this is not quite 25%.

45
00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:06.682
We have just a little bit left over, and
that's because we wanna have that little

46
00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:10.099
bit of space shining through
between those buttons, make sense?

47
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.620
Okay, so if we go ahead and save that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And look at our code, ooh.

48
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.559
Suddenly, we got a calculator that
actually looks like a calculator.

49
00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:26.436
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet?

50
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:31.637
So, the way we made that magic happen was
we added a, we made our font size kind

51
00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:37.590
of big, we added a height of 100 pixels,
and a flex-basis of 24.5, not quite.

52
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.987
Obviously, times for
that doesn't quite add to 100%.

53
00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.640
That gives us a little bit of extra space.

54
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.260
And that's distributed as
called four in the row and

55
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.730
space between, so we wind up with a little
bit of space in between those buttons.

56
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.630
And we achieve of that effect that kind of
looks like a black border in between them,

57
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.300
make sense?

58
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.460
It's a wrapper that's black,
the buttons are on top.

59
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.100
So we kind of have a mostly done
look to this already, nice?

60
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.060
So I went ahead and got rid of my
lovely blue borders on the rows.

61
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.060
I don't think we need those anymore,
so I just deleted that.

62
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.030
And so now when we refresh it.

63
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.317
It'll look a little bit more buttony,
little bit.

64
00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:27.617
So we've got the lines in
between the buttons, but

65
00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:30.520
we don't actually have the lines
going horizontally, right?

66
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.960
So, we can add a little bit
of margin here on our row.

67
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.486
Margin-bottom, 0.5%.

68
00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:49.987
If you actually do the math with this
flex basis of 24.5%, right, that gives

69
00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:55.825
you two percent lift over, divide that all
up, thatâ€™s about half a percent per line.

70
00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:58.390
Okay, so
we're gonna do the same thing here.

71
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.058
If we had a margin bottom
of 0.5% on the row,

72
00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:05.740
that's gonna bring in
our lines on the bottom.

73
00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:12.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So
while I was just playing around,

74
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.166
I did a margin-top of two
pixels on the calc buttons.

75
00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.989
I mean, is it-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That would work, too.

76
00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:18.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's fine to do it that way?

77
00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.876
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Many different
ways of doing these things, yep.
