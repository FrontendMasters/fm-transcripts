00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I wanted to show
you some amazing stuff that

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.150
those of you who have been working
on online through our lunch break.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.370
So this is Corinne here and Corinne has
done a really cool thing with her article.

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.040
So notice that she
rounded the corners here.

5
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.570
That's actually something
I didn't mention.

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.524
It's in the notes.

7
00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:24.835
She's rounded the corners
of a picture here of St.

8
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.771
Nicolas Cage down here
a little bit further.

9
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.412
She's got a cool thing
with her quote here.

10
00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:32.845
Look at that she turned it into a pill.

11
00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.513
This is done with rounded corners also.

12
00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.801
So I'll show you that trick
here in just a second.

13
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.200
And then we have crazy Nicolas
down there on the bottom.

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.095
So, she's doing some fun things
here with borders and margin and

15
00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:45.703
floats and so forth.

16
00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.067
So well done Corrine, very nice.

17
00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:52.990
And we have Brandon here, and
Brandon has been working on

18
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.926
his book chapter, and
he has some cool effects here too.

19
00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.467
So first of all, notice that what
Brandon's done over here on the side.

20
00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:04.234
He's actually put in a navbar,
how cool is that?

21
00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:08.516
So he's actually putting together
a website about some of the pages

22
00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:13.489
that he's been making here in class,
and he's got a little navbar over here.

23
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:16.211
And he's been styling some stuff here too.

24
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.776
Take a look at this,
pull quote right here.

25
00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.182
Now look what he did.

26
00:01:20.182 --> 00:01:22.936
We have a fat line here
on the left side and

27
00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:26.111
then something thinner
all the way around it.

28
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:27.785
How might we go about doing that?

29
00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:32.335
First of all what property did we
use in order to put that there?

30
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:33.804
&gt;&gt; off screen: Border.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Border, right?

31
00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:39.106
And then, so that's gonna put a line
on all four sides, and then what?

32
00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:39.638
Yeah?

33
00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:41.381
&gt;&gt; off screen: Border weight.

34
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:42.995
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is no border weight.

35
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:44.828
&gt;&gt; off screen: Radius.

36
00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:46.509
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [INAUDIBLE] left.

37
00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.360
&gt;&gt; off screen: The left border
then we gonna make it what?

38
00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:53.259
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Five pixels.

39
00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:53.836
&gt;&gt; off screen: Pixels or something.

40
00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:56.167
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's like five pixels or
something right,

41
00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:57.872
even though the others are one.

42
00:01:57.872 --> 00:02:02.062
On the left side we're gonna make its
width something more like five pixels

43
00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:04.190
instead of one pixel, right?

44
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.200
And that's the way you would come
up with that sort of effect.

45
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.750
Brandon didn't actually have to
put that border on all four sides.

46
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.510
He could have just put in the left border,
right?

47
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360
Correct, a left border, correct?

48
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.537
That would have been a little bit
that would have been nice also.

49
00:02:19.537 --> 00:02:25.274
This nice fat left border,
kind of a cool sort of looking effect.

50
00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:26.047
Alright?

51
00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:28.957
So he's got a nice picture
of a camera down here.

52
00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:32.812
And he's used that same styling
consistently through here which really

53
00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:35.853
ties things together very
nicely visually doesn't it?
