00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See my picture doesn't
align over here on the left anymore.

2
00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.168
And now I've got some
weird space on the top,

3
00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:09.088
the text sort of starts before the picture
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No margin on the top

4
00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:09.632
it looks like.

5
00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:13.521
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We actually don't
want any margin on the top, do we?

6
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:17.490
Okay, so probably where do we want
this margin applied for real?

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.538
What sides of picture do we
want the margin to be put on?

8
00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:22.090
Yeah.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The right.

10
00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.936
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We want it on the right and
anywhere else?

11
00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:28.563
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The bottom.

12
00:00:28.563 --> 00:00:31.583
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably the bottom,
the right and the bottom, and

13
00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:35.504
we want the top and the left to be
shoved up in the corner here, okay.

14
00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:39.261
So now there you can write
this in the following way.

15
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.716
You could say margin right.

16
00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:49.623
One rem and
you can say margin-bottom, one rem.

17
00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:51.447
Right?

18
00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:53.112
You can go on and on and on like that.

19
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:54.962
That's one way of doing it.

20
00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:04.101
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
the other way of doing it is to

21
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.799
use something called shorthand, okay?

22
00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.339
And this is something you're gonna
see a lot, a lot, a lot in code.

23
00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:18.600
And the way that we're gonna do this, is
we're gonna use the margin property just

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.220
as margin, but
we're gonna put in four numbers.

25
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.039
Okay, and the four numbers we're
gonna put in are this way.

26
00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.416
TRBL, top, right, bottom, left, and

27
00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:39.187
if you remember that you will stay out of,
trouble.

28
00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:48.261
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] Okay, so
the first number on margin here

29
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:55.046
is going to be our top number,
which is what what value?

30
00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:55.676
Zero.

31
00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.132
We don't want anything on the top.

32
00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:00.770
Our second number is
going to be on the right.

33
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.227
We definitely want some margin there.

34
00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.075
Yeah.

35
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:09.332
Okay, our third number is
going to be on the bottom.

36
00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:16.182
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One rem there, and
our fourth number is on the left, zero.

37
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.894
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
you see how I wrote that, TRBL.

38
00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:26.600
And if you take a look at your notes here,

39
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.080
it'll be,
I have a little diagram here for you.

40
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.689
So as you write these,
this can be true for margin or padding.

41
00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.293
The numbers work the same way.

42
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.990
Some people like to think of
this as the hands of a clock.

43
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.900
So we start at 12 o'clock or
the top of the box and

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.707
we go around in a clockwise manner.

45
00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:49.384
That never worked for me I don't know why.

46
00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:49.928
Okay.

47
00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:52.556
I rather remember the acronym.

48
00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:56.513
And in fact when you hear me teach you'll
hear me mutter this acronym all the time

49
00:02:56.513 --> 00:03:00.296
as I start writing numbers t r b o,
because I don't know why I can't remember

50
00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:03.280
what order these numbers go in
I just remember the acronym.

51
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.983
So, top right bottom left,
that's the order of the numbers.

52
00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:09.073
Okay?

53
00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:11.074
Your four numbers can be and

54
00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:15.433
I put it here with four totally
different units of measure.

55
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.885
They don't all have to be
the same units of measure.

56
00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.496
You can mix them up if you wish.

57
00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:21.055
Okay.

58
00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:23.452
10% or 10 pixels on the top,

59
00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:27.823
two M's on the right 3% on the bottom,
2rems on the left.

60
00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:34.325
I don't know why you do that, but
you can, you're right, it's legal.

61
00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:38.246
So hopefully that helps some,
for those four numbers.

62
00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:41.910
There's some more here in the shorthand,
we'll probably be covering more about

63
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.049
shorthand, and
exactly how shorthand works.

64
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.525
But there's plenty of reading
here on your page as well.

65
00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.016
So you can take a look at how that works,
okay?

66
00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.961
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Any questions on that.

67
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:58.758
So we've floated our picture, and
we have a margin going around it and

68
00:03:58.758 --> 00:04:00.557
now it looks much better.

69
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:03.166
Not perfect, but better.
