00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it accurate too that,

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.650
when I reference the class in the HTML
file, I have to do that after the href and

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.820
after the target, or it doesn't
matter if I put it before the href?

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so you're you're
in the HTML, and you're talking about?

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When I create the class.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This line of code
right here where you're linking to

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.100
the stylesheet?

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No,
when we created the class Harvard.

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.320
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: When we created the class
Harvard, so we're in the CSS, uh-huh.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, we have to put
it into the HTML file too, right?

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.135
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, and
then we need to add it to the HTML.

12
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:43.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, when I add it into the
HTML, does it need to be after the href?

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, so
these attributes here,

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.910
in our tag, these attributes,
in the case of this a tag,

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.710
we have href, target, and class, all
three of those, they can be in any order.

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.643
We can change them to whatever
order you want, HTML doesn't care.

17
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Other questions?

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.688
Yes.

19
00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:12.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I missed that, and
when we're using the extra classes,

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.050
they have to be in a certain order?

21
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.102
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They do have to
be in a certain order, yes.

22
00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:17.543
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So does that mean you can't
leave any out? &gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can't

23
00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.450
absolutely leave them out.

24
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.670
I could leave out this visited link,
just like that.

25
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.770
So now I've only styled my unvisited
links in my hover state, but

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.310
those need to be in that exact order,
yeah.

27
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.889
So this is addressed in your notes.

28
00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:38.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.437
This is addressed in your notes.

30
00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:45.271
Any time you're working with these
pseudo classes, like link, visited,

31
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.738
hover, active, and focus,
they need to go in a very specific order.

32
00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:55.416
And that is rememberable by the acronym

33
00:01:55.416 --> 00:02:00.404
Lord Vader Former Handle Anakin,

34
00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:03.880
so, link visited FHA.

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.510
So F is for focus, that has to do
mostly with touch devices, but LVHA.

36
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.901
The other one, we had LVHA for
many years before focus came along, and

37
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.330
I told people to live happy.

38
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.120
That's another one you can think of,
live happy.

39
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.800
But now with focus that
comes in the middle.

40
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.570
So Lord Vader Former Handle Anakin.

41
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.290
Yay Star Wars.

42
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.270
Yes, Jenna?

43
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Only for a tags or,
when you're using them on anywhere?

44
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anywhere, any time
you're using those pseudo classes.

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.480
In order for the cascade to work
correctly, you'll want them in that order.
