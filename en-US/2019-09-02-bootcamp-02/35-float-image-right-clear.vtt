WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.592
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But we have some of
the other things that have happened here.

2
00:00:03.592 --> 00:00:04.732
Take a look at this.

3
00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:08.665
So, let me just make this a smidge wider.

4
00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.149
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make it 30 rems,
there we go.

5
00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:16.132
So we've got all our text wrapping
around our image so nicely.

6
00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:19.000
You can see we have our space, yeah.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.497
We have some space here underneath.

8
00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:24.940
Then we've got this weird image here.

9
00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.971
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Can you
guys write a class for

10
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:31.734
this image here to float
this over to the right?

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.818
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Try to do that right now,
take two minutes,

12
00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:44.155
see if you can float the image over here,
crazy Nicholas Cage.

13
00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:47.892
See if you can write a class that
will float it over to the right.

14
00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.224
Okay, so did you guys get it?

15
00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:52.748
Did you guys get it?

16
00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:54.011
Floating right?

17
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:58.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My crazy Nicolas Cage
popped out of my article.

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.844
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have a problem,
don't we?

19
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:00.666
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He's.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Goes crazy.

20
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.008
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so tell me what
happened here with crazy Nicolas Cage,

21
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:04.919
what did you do?

22
00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.758
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I created class.floatright.

23
00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:09.678
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, floatright,
that's a great name.

24
00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:10.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and

25
00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:12.992
what did you put in here?

26
00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:14.854
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Float right.

27
00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:17.085
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] Fabulous.

28
00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:21.112
And then here on your image,
you put in your class, right?

29
00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:27.015
Class=floatright.

30
00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:29.357
And what happened?

31
00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:34.385
Crazy Nicolas Cage is hanging
on by a thread, isn't he?

32
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.243
Dear.

33
00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:38.792
So this is a problem
that happens with floats.

34
00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.404
Because of the way floats happen to work,

35
00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:45.893
we have actually pulled the float out
of the normal flow of the webpage.

36
00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:51.937
One thing after another, and we make it
its own thing, it's floated in space.

37
00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:55.888
It's floating around there,
the space that it previously occupied.

38
00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:59.799
Do you remember before
we had this in place?

39
00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.627
That crazy Nicolas Cage was just here,
we had this gaping,

40
00:02:03.627 --> 00:02:06.537
we had this sentence that was going here,
and

41
00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:11.074
then we had this gaping hole before
we finished our sentence, right?

42
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:15.637
And now that gaping hole in
our sentence is gone, but

43
00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:20.733
Nicholas is hanging out of the article,
here on the side.

44
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:25.088
So this is part of the problem with
floats, is that they're gonna do this kind

45
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:29.577
of thing on occasion, and if you want that
red line to continue all the way around

46
00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:33.750
Nicolas Cage there at the bottom,
we have to do something called a clear.

47
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.992
If you float, you must clear,
if you float, you must clear,

48
00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:40.123
if you float, you must clear.

49
00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:41.883
Have you tattooed it on your forehead yet?

50
00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:43.743
If you float, you must clear.

51
00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:48.391
I say this many times because my students
tell me they hear me in their head

52
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.603
saying to them, I floated,
I have to clear.

53
00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:54.179
So Jen just said, all right.

54
00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.471
So, this is the number one problem that
people encounter when they're doing

55
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.850
layouts and something crazy happens,
and you have no idea.

56
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.587
If that happens to you, it's probably that
you have a float that hasn't been cleared.

57
00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:11.366
And there's a bunch of ways that
we can go about doing this.

58
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.915
So I'll show you a couple
of these methods.

59
00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:22.616
Here in our float notes, there are some
clear properties that you can use,

60
00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:28.376
the actual clear property itself,
and that will help.

61
00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:31.553
This is another methodology
that's right here.

62
00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:34.771
And this is the methodology we're gonna
use in this particular situation.

63
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:38.411
So, if you scroll on down here,
this is about,

64
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.882
a little less than three quarters
of the way down the page.

65
00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:47.156
There's this paragraph here, it says,
there's other methods to clear as well,

66
00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:50.287
a popular one is to self clear
the parent using this formula.

67
00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:53.966
And you'll see this little
formula up here on the top.

68
00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:58.002
Go ahead and copy that little formula.

69
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:02.028
And we're gonna paste that
on into our web page.

70
00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:05.164
And we're gonna change the selector.

71
00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:11.311
We don't have a class called group, but
we do have an article, that article.

72
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:13.772
That we can make use of this.

73
00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:21.776
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I don't know
why that's commented out.

74
00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:26.225
Take out the two slashes in front of
clear: both, that shouldn't be there,

75
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:27.947
that's an error on our part.

76
00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:29.793
So the parent, remember,

77
00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:35.189
the parent of this paragraph that contains
our image is the article, correct?

78
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.385
So what we're doing is, we're putting
this clear formula on our article.

79
00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:44.113
And this is the formula here
that will clear our float, and

80
00:04:44.113 --> 00:04:48.935
you see here, very nicely,
that our red border now goes all

81
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:52.623
the way around our image and
the text itself.

82
00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:58.606
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The thing that you
see up here on the top, this after,

83
00:04:58.606 --> 00:05:01.317
this is called a pseudo element, and

84
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:05.786
it's shockingly the little bit
of space after the article.

85
00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:08.443
Guess what,
there's also one called before.

86
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.639
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These are little
formulas you can look up online for

87
00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.858
clearing your images.

88
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:17.856
How are you doing?

89
00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:21.747
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Both refer to.

90
00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:25.989
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Clear both, we're quite
clear to the left and clear to the right.

91
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:29.369
And so that, any floats that are out
there have now been totally cleared.

92
00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:36.918
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is what we would
call an incantation in programming.

93
00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:39.644
This is a little formula that
somebody's come up with,

94
00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:43.654
that have determined that this is the best
way to make something clear on a parent.

95
00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:48.585
We just copy it and paste it in,
and that's what we wanna do.

96
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:51.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: This specifically
would go in to anything, or

97
00:05:51.962 --> 00:05:54.306
whenever you float something?

98
00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.965
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you float something,
this should go on the parent.

99
00:05:56.965 --> 00:05:58.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Exactly as it is?

100
00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:02.328
Adding empty content and
displaying it as a table?

101
00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.077
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.

102
00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:06.258
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, that exact thing.

103
00:06:06.258 --> 00:06:06.986
Yes.

104
00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:10.894
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Where should this
article after go in your CSS?

105
00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:16.414
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It could go pretty
much anywhere you wanna put it.

106
00:06:16.414 --> 00:06:17.947
I have it here after the floats.

107
00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:21.304
It could be after the article if
you wanted to keep things neater.

108
00:06:21.304 --> 00:06:25.126
My CSS is kinda messy here because
I've just been typing away.

109
00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:29.861
So, probably to keep things neat we would
wanna put our float left and float right,

110
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:32.309
we'd probably wanna put those together.

111
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:36.381
We probably wanna put article and article
after together, just to make our code

112
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.747
a little easier to read, and
make things a little easier to find.

113
00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:41.772
That's a great question.

114
00:06:41.772 --> 00:06:45.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there ever a situation
where you wouldn't want to clear

115
00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:46.553
something?

116
00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:51.003
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, if you like that look
of Nicolas Cage hanging on for dear life,

117
00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:55.790
and he is crazy Nicolas Cage, then
that would be cool, you could do that.

118
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.101
But chances are,
you actually want it to look this way.

119
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.865
So clearing your floats
is probably good to do.

120
00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:05.706
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I hate the idea that, yeah,
in order to make this work, you have to

121
00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:09.956
add some code that you'll always add,
but it isn't just in there by default.

122
00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:11.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's not
in there by default.
