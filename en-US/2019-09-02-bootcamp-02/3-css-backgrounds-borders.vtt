1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so we'll
refer back to our document for today.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.561
Remember this is at
frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp.

3
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:13.676
Click on the link for CSS,
this is our reference document for today.

4
00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:17.383
And we have tons of things that
we're gonna look at today,

5
00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:21.255
I wanted to point out to you that
these are all listed in here.

6
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.560
Scroll on down to the CSS properties and
values section.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.420
This is where you can start looking into
font families, font sizes, font styles.

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.170
All kinds of interesting things
that we can do with fonts for

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170
the most part for today.

10
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:41.404
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
some background colors, all right?

11
00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:42.634
So that document is here for

12
00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.475
you to refer to anywhere along
the way if you happen to get lost.

13
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:50.687
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

14
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.237
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
anybody have any suggestions for

15
00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.650
what you'd like to style in this document?

16
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.217
Would you like to change in
order to make it look better?

17
00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:09.946
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have any suggestions, yes?

18
00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.136
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Frame around
the picture of the cat.

19
00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:15.678
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A frame around
the picture of the cat, all right?

20
00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:18.482
Let's think about putting a frame
around the picture of a cat.

21
00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.888
That'd be kind of fun, wouldn't that?

22
00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:22.661
So we have a little kitty cat there.

23
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:28.314
Somehow we need to select
the picture on the web page, okay?

24
00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:32.980
And then we can write the actual code
to make it do a frame around them.

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.570
So one way of doing that would be, what?

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.550
First of all we need to select the thing.

27
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.740
So, what is the thing?

28
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.599
What is the HTML that we can
call to select the thing?

29
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.503
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The image.

30
00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:47.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Img, right?

31
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:50.972
This is the img tag, the image tag.

32
00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:55.492
So all we need to do is just
go on ahead and put img.

33
00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:01.046
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now to
put a frame around this,

34
00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:06.825
there's a property that we call border
that we can use to take advantage of this.

35
00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:11.737
Border does a whole bunch of different
things, but we can just write it this way,

36
00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:12.327
border.

37
00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:15.885
What color would you like your frame?

38
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Neon green.

39
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.990
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Neon green, okay.

40
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
So neon green, so let's say it's

41
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.460
a 10px solid green border, okay?

42
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.880
So that's gonna put a 10px wide line on
all four sides of that particular image.

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.647
Solid and green,
which will be neon enough.

44
00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:46.417
[LAUGH] All right,
if you go ahead and save that.

45
00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:51.352
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
refresh the page, did you get it?

46
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:54.558
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet.

47
00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:00.948
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
other suggestions, yeah?

48
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:03.259
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What about
creating a box around our header?

49
00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.862
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Create
a box around our header?

50
00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:07.907
Sure, how do you think we might
do that based on what you know?

51
00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:11.393
Go ahead and tell me.

52
00:03:11.393 --> 00:03:15.659
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would we be
able to select this here, and

53
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.681
just use the same sort of border name?

54
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:21.329
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, we certainly could.

55
00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.500
So what would we select?

56
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:25.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: H1.

57
00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:26.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: H1, exactly.

58
00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:31.560
And then what would we
say here inside of h1?

59
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Border.

60
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.972
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Border, once again,
and then what do you think?

61
00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:37.889
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 5px.

62
00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 5px?

63
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.130
Okay, we have solid, that's an option.

64
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.120
We also have dotted,
that might be kinda fun.

65
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.730
What color would you like?

66
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Pink.

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.340
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pink, okay.

68
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.930
So go ahead and save that.

69
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.737
And let's look at the web page again.

70
00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.288
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
change mine to red, just so

71
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.875
that it projects a little bit better.

72
00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:19.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, it's kind of like all
about me your name in lights, isn't it?

73
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.300
Okay, so other things that we can do
here for our body of our web page.

74
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.420
Maybe we're kind of bored with the fact
that this is a white background with

75
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.160
black text.

76
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.740
Maybe we'd like to have a different color,

77
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.350
and it may want a different
background color for our web page.

78
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.824
Sound good?

79
00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:40.950
All right, so we can go ahead and
continue to add properties and

80
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.620
values here for the body tag.

81
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.641
So let's go ahead and add one,
then for a background color,

82
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:49.258
anyone wanna guess what
the property name might be?

83
00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:50.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Background color.

84
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have a background color,
background-color.

85
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.130
All right, so
after that we can put in color names.

86
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.300
And you can type in color names,
and you'll get colors.

87
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.610
They may not be the ones you want or
the ones you expect, but

88
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.540
you can type in names.

89
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.913
So we can type in a name like yellow, and

90
00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:16.943
it will probably pick a really
ugly yellow for you, okay?

91
00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:23.224
So that's one way of doing it,
that's a pretty bright yellow.

92
00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:32.463
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you don't want to have
colors like that there are other choices.

93
00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:38.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can go ahead and
type in color values for this.

94
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.280
And the way color values work on the web
is that they are are six digits long.

95
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.310
In number that is so called base 16.

96
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.340
Maybe you had this somewhere in school.

97
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.015
We talk about base ten numbers, one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

98
00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:54.330
nine, ten.

99
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.971
Base 16 we count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

100
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:03.871
6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, and

101
00:06:03.871 --> 00:06:08.422
then we're at 1 followed by 0, okay?

102
00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:12.030
So that's the way this works,
it has to do with binary numbers.

103
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.790
And that's all you need to know about it,
it's just kind of magic.

104
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.655
So the actual color number
will look something like this,

105
00:06:18.655 --> 00:06:26.420
ffffcc, which is a much
nicer shade of yellow.

106
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.600
So this is actually a six digit number.

107
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.436
I know it looks like letters but
they're actually digits.

108
00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:36.890
The first two stand for the value of red,
the second two stand for

109
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.310
the value of green, and
the last two stand for the value of blue.

110
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.420
And that's how you form
a color on your web page.

111
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.854
And why I know that this is a lovely
shade of yellow is because I've

112
00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:51.171
been using it in teaching for years, okay?

113
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.155
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So to all those people
who are out there on the Internet,

114
00:06:56.155 --> 00:06:56.820
you're right.

115
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.580
There are five or six other ways
we can write color on the web.

116
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.360
We're gonna stick with these ones for
right now.

117
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.000
We'll probably come back to some of the
other ways we can write color on the web

118
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.460
maybe later on.

119
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.491
Maybe we won't get to it in this course,
but this way of writing color in the six

120
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:18.084
digit format works everywhere, and
it's a great way to manage color.

121
00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:23.076
All right, so if you go ahead and
save that, let's take a look

122
00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:28.260
at our web page one more time,
much better not quite so glaring.
