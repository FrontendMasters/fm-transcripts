00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:04.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We've done a really bad job
of picking colors, I hate to tell you.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.854
Okay, and I know some of you graphic
designers out there are really

3
00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:12.632
bothered by the color violence
we've committed today.

4
00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:16.750
So let's talk about a little bit more
about color and where to get good colors.

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.558
So this is a website,
it's called color.adobe.com,

6
00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:26.530
okay, where people smarter than you have
picked nice color palettes, all right?

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.063
And if you go to color.adobe.com and
you click on the link on

8
00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:39.155
the top here called Explore,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: People smarter than you and

9
00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.120
more talented than you have come up
with some beautiful color palettes.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.417
That they have shared right here on this
website that you can take advantage of and

11
00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.450
use, isn't that a wonderful thing?

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.560
So you can come here, and
you can look at all of these.

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.930
And you will never run out of colors,
[LAUGH] they have

14
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.080
a ridiculous quantity of color
palettes here for you to choose from.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.150
Right now,
I'm looking at the most popular ones.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.472
Notice that we can look at most
used ones or random ones or

17
00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:10.794
what's popular this month or all time,
all kinds of different things.

18
00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:15.940
And they give you a few colors here to
work with, they've been voted on and

19
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.430
commented on, and
these are great things to use.

20
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.050
If you click on these,
roll your mouse over them, for example,

21
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.330
you'll see this Info
button that comes up here.

22
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.600
This will show you the colors
in a larger format.

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.810
So then the next problem is, and
you can click on them again, and

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.110
they get even bigger.

25
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.700
The next problem is how do we determine
exactly what those color values are?

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.800
Cuz it's super pretty and we'd like to
use them, but what are the color values?

27
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.850
So one of the things that you can do for
your browser is install this wonderful

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.110
extension called ColorZilla,
and that is at colorzilla.com.

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.110
Click on ColorZilla for Firefox and
Chrome, go ahead and click on that.

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.466
And then once you get in here, look for
the button to install ColorZilla 3.

31
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.110
Go ahead and click that and
install that on your browser.

32
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.930
And if you have both Firefox and
Chrome on your computer,

33
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.520
you may want to install it in both places,
it's a pretty useful kind of thing.

34
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.487
So once you have ColorZilla installed,
when you go ahead and

35
00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:25.909
click on the little eyedropper that's
gonna show up there on the corner,

36
00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.140
it'll tell you that the page
color picker is active.

37
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.320
And then you can now roll your mouse
over one of those lovely colors, okay?

38
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.315
So let's say I want this one right here,
notice that just rolling my mouse over it,

39
00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.770
it'll tell me that hexadecimal code.

40
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.090
If we click on it, it's gonna go ahead and
copy that color to my clipboard,

41
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.740
all right?

42
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.162
And so now when I come back to my CSS,
I can just paste in that

43
00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:59.723
lovely red that I had there from before,
very, very nice.

44
00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:02.770
And we can actually start to make
a color palette that actually works.

45
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And those color themes are
here for you, they're here to help you.

46
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.520
If you are a talented graphic designer and
you can create your own color palette,

47
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.250
please feel free to do so.

48
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.050
You can go ahead and get these hex codes
right out of Photoshop or Illustrator.

49
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.740
Or lots and

50
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.260
lots of other image processing packages
that are available out there online.

51
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.914
But having it right here in
the browser is a super-helpful tool.
