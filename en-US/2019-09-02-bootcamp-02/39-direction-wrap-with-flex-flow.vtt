00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is there anyone who wanna
make any observations about those boxes

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.710
for Flexbox?

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.710
How big are these boxes?

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; off screen: Only as
big as what's in them.

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're pretty much
as big as what's in them, right.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.350
Okay, and so it doesn't stretch
all the way across the page.

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.340
They're as big as what's inside of them.

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.686
If we put some more text in here, blah,

9
00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:31.530
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.080
Okay, so they're just getting bigger and
bigger with the text, right.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Okay, so we have, it's sort of taken
the space that it has here and

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.750
it's just made a box around each
one of these individual items.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.654
Okay, the next thing we're
gonna wanna do is we're gonna

14
00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:52.328
wanna declare something called flex-flow.

15
00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:56.840
And the flex-flow property is
described here in the notes.

16
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.040
And as it says here there's two values
we're gonna specify for flex-flow.

17
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.670
And they can actually be spelled out
individually, flex-flow is the shorthand.

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.000
The actual individual properties
are flex direction and

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
flex wrap,
combine those together you get flex-flow.

20
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.614
And so for flex-flow, we're either gonna
set this to a row or a column, all right.

21
00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:25.240
So by default flex-flow is set to a row,
right.

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870
Let me just put row wrap here.

23
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.650
So nothing changed,
that's sort of the default setting.

24
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.150
We can also change this
to a column instead.

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.070
And guess what's gonna
happen if I say column?

26
00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:40.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's gonna
happen if I say column?

27
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.740
&gt;&gt; off screen: Go vertical again.

28
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's gonna go vertical,
boom.

29
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.470
Okay, that's pretty easy.

30
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.390
You want it to go in a row,
you tell it to go in a row.

31
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.350
If you wanna go in a column,
you tell it to go in a column.

32
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.420
So far so good?

33
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.610
Okay, that second property,
I went ahead and put in wrap.

34
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.070
There are some other options for
that as well.

35
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.330
So this specifies whether the boxes
should wrap onto another line.

36
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.643
So we have the row going across the page.

37
00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:14.930
If our boxes got big enough and we ran
out of room, what should happen then?

38
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.900
Okay, so right now my window is such that
we don't actually see wrap in action here.

39
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.510
But if I make my browser a little bit
smaller you'll see what happens, right.

40
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.794
The boxes just wrap onto another line,
pretty straightforward, okay,

41
00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:34.600
cuz I have that set to row wrap.

42
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.470
So what if I said row no wrap?

43
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.260
What's gonna happen then?

44
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.100
&gt;&gt; off screen: To scroll
if it's too small.

45
00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:45.440
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Gonna have to scroll if it,

46
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.330
do you think we're going
to get a scroll bar?

47
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.965
It's not gonna wrap, right,
thus the name no wrap, okay.

48
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.503
So if we go on ahead and
make the screen a little bit smaller.

49
00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Look at that.

50
00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:06.179
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See how all those
boxes are trying to resize?

51
00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.530
They'll actually wrap
the text onto other lines.

52
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.086
It's trying desperately
to keep it all in one

53
00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:16.987
row,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Working very hard,

54
00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:18.610
we lost it.

55
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.100
Okay, so now it's off the page, all right.

56
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.360
So this means, this no wrap means that
it's gonna keep on resizing those boxes

57
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.720
and it's gonna try to keep everything in
a nice row like this as best as it can.

58
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.350
Make sense?

59
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.766
Okay, yes?

60
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:39.360
&gt;&gt; off screen: And would you scroll over,
or it would just be off the page?

61
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.080
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It would
actually just be off the page.

62
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.120
&gt;&gt; off screen: So it's not viewable?

63
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's not viewable, okay.

64
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.910
So most of the layout you're
gonna do with Flexbox,

65
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.990
you're probably gonna set
Flexflow to no wrap, okay.

66
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.020
If you want it to wrap you're more
than welcome to set it to wrap, but

67
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.704
chances are in the assignment I'm about to
give you you're gonna set it to no wrap,

68
00:03:58.704 --> 00:03:59.526
pro tip.
