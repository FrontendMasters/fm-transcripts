00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.645
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The other thing that we can
do with the flex property is this other

2
00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:07.238
property called justify content.

3
00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.431
So do you want all of these boxes pushed
to the beginning, which is called

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.722
flex-start, or push all the boxes
to the end, it's called flex-end?

5
00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.854
Do we want to center these boxes or

6
00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:21.215
do we want to distribute
some space in between them?

7
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.075
And so there's some properties for that.

8
00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:28.347
So right now based on the descriptions
that you see here, what's going on?

9
00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:35.946
What is the default property of that,
of this justified content property?

10
00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:36.730
What is the default?

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.435
&gt;&gt; Class: Start.

12
00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:39.789
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex-start, okay.

13
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.334
So if we type in here justify content,

14
00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:49.713
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex-start, absolutely

15
00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:55.066
nothing changes, well done, okay.

16
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.231
Cuz it's gonna shove all the boxes
to the beginning of the row.

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:06.074
So let's change it to flex-end
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool,

18
00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:08.434
all the boxes are now at the other end,
right.

19
00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:18.651
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If I change this to center,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hey, they're in the center.

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.477
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You all look
really excited by this.

21
00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:29.531
Okay, and then the last one that
I gave you was space-around.

22
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:33.855
There's a couple of other values,
you can look up what the other values are.

23
00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.667
But I've tried to give you just a few.

24
00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.686
Space-around, so that's actually

25
00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:43.412
gonna divide it into boxes with
some space in between them.

26
00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:48.173
And there are some things here that
are really important to notice, okay.

27
00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:51.432
Look a the space between
say boxes number three and

28
00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:55.010
four and the space between one and
the edge of the page.

29
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.601
What can you tell me about the space
between three and four and

30
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.357
the space between one and
the edge of the page?

31
00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:03.925
So what's the distribution of space here?

32
00:02:03.925 --> 00:02:07.955
Take a look at the distance between
whatever, two and three, three and

33
00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:12.004
four versus one and the edge of the page
or seven and the edge of the page.

34
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:15.510
&gt;&gt; Student2: Twice as much between
two items as it is on the ends.

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.487
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly,
there's twice as much between three and

36
00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:20.782
four as opposed to the ends of the page.

37
00:02:20.782 --> 00:02:24.734
So what the browser did is it took
all of the space that was there.

38
00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:26.634
It said how many boxes do I have?

39
00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:30.904
And I'm going to divide up my space such
that I'll put the same amount of space on

40
00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:33.800
the left and
the right side of each one of these boxes.

41
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.688
So you see how you get to those
units between the boxes but

42
00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:39.194
only one on the ends.
