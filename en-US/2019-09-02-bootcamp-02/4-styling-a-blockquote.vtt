00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, we're continuing to
on our little styling journey here.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.520
And, I had a request on the select
channel to go ahead and

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.630
style up one of the quotes.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.090
So, here on the page, I have this
lovely block quote going on here.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.720
Let's think about ways that we
could make that look even prettier.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.370
So this is a pretty common thing
that you see done on, let's say,

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.470
on newspaper sites.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.584
These are called pull quotes, often
the newspapers will take a relevant quote

9
00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:33.385
from, especially a particularly
long article, they'll pull it out,

10
00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.089
they'll put a nice pretty font on it,
maybe make the font really big.

11
00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.780
And so that is something that we can do
something like that here with our CSS.

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.810
So, does anyone wanna tell me how we could
start by selecting the quote itself?

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.505
Yeah.

14
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:50.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we
just like block quote?

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can
just like block quote.

16
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.740
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

17
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.155
So we'll go ahead and select blockquote,
pick some curly brackets,

18
00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:06.574
and then, then the question will be,
what should we do?

19
00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:08.596
I'm gonna suggest that we go ahead and

20
00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:11.070
change the font to something different,
so.

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.203
So far we have this Arial font
that's in use on our web page.

22
00:01:15.203 --> 00:01:18.550
What if we try something
a little bit different here?

23
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.912
So if I say my font family,
is Georgia, instead.

24
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:30.134
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And, these are called font
stacks, by the way, if you ever hear that

25
00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:34.540
term, font stack, this is what they're
talking about, all the different fonts.

26
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.650
So VS code is suggesting Georgia,
Times New Roman, Times and Sarif.

27
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.850
And if you take a look
at that font static,

28
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.800
you'll notice that Times New Roman
is in single quotes.

29
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.594
Anyone have any idea why that one
font name is in single quotes,

30
00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:51.900
when all the other ones
are just sort of written there?

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.733
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's more than one word?

32
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cuz it's
more than one word.

33
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.060
So if your font has more
than one word in it,

34
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.490
your font name, you're gonna need
to put some quotes around it.

35
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.800
If the font name is only one word long,
then you don't need the quotes.

36
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.450
Okay, so we'll go on ahead and
change the font family.

37
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.835
How about we change the font size too?

38
00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:15.264
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll make
this a little bit bigger.

39
00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:17.114
So size is interesting in CSS,

40
00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:20.610
there are lots of different
ways that we can measure size.

41
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.780
And I'm gonna try to teach you the ways
that are most useful right now for

42
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.250
the way people are coding web pages.

43
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.460
So, there is a unit of measure
that's called the REM, R-E-M.

44
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.402
So what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to make my font size 3REM,

45
00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:41.414
just like that, R-E-M.

46
00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:48.602
It's not a band from the 80s, it's not
rapid eye movement, it is relative M's.

47
00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.679
Okay, great, so what's an M?

48
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:56.340
An M is, a size that's established by your
browser for the font size by default.

49
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.920
Okay, so one m,

50
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.240
in this particular case, in your browser
happens to correspond to 16 pixels high.

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.620
That's that ugly Times New Roman
font that we've been working with,

52
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.980
it's the same size font that we
were working with, with Ariel.

53
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.900
Some fonts look a little bigger, some look
a little smaller, because m as a unit of

54
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.502
measure, actually measures the width
of the letter, m, m, lowercase m.

55
00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:25.596
[LAUGH] It's a lot of M's.

56
00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:28.423
So, some fonts tend to be a little bit,

57
00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:32.196
the font size looks a little
bit bigger overall, but

58
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:37.463
the width of the letter m is the method
by which we're measuring things.

59
00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:41.504
So 3REM, we take 3 and
we multiply it by 16,

60
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:46.568
the size of this font would
actually be 48 pixels, okay?

61
00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:47.940
So it's gonna be really, really big.

62
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.201
The reason that we
are not using 48 pixels,

63
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:54.661
cuz wouldn't that seem to be easier?

64
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.091
Is that we are gonna eventually,
as web developers,

65
00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.260
work with a whole bunch of
different devices, right?

66
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.160
People are gonna maybe looking
at our site on a phone,

67
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.690
they may be looking on a tablet, they
might be looking on a refrigerator, right?

68
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.009
Game console, there's all kinds of crazy
places they might be looking at it.

69
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:14.364
And by using REM's, we're gonna be able
to have this nicely adjust to whatever

70
00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:16.290
device that we're using.

71
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.678
Pixels maybe, maybe not, okay?

72
00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:22.020
So this tends to be an industry standard.

73
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.829
So if you go ahead and save this.

74
00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:28.669
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we go ahead and
take a look at our web page.

75
00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:36.009
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go, we have
a great big huge honking quote here,

76
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:36.874
all right?

77
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now we might want to
continue styling that a little bit.

78
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.300
Maybe we'd like to make it italic?

79
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.970
Anybody wanna go for a italic?

80
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:56.840
So we can say font style is italic.

81
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:01.356
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

82
00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:02.560
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is one M going to

83
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.340
be different,
depending on the font that you're using?

84
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.831
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So if you're using Georgia,

85
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.054
one M is different than
the Times New Roman.

86
00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:13.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They're all 16 pixels,
but the size that you see, maybe,

87
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.570
it might look like George's a little bit
bigger, Arials' a little bit smaller.

88
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.380
So we have a nice little
quote going on here.

89
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.095
What if we center it on the web page?

90
00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:26.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Think we should center it?

91
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.330
Okay, let's center it and make it pretty.

92
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.694
Text, the line is our property,
center's our value.

93
00:05:43.653 --> 00:05:44.592
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

94
00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:48.072
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

95
00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:56.554
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And finally, how about
that, my name there, that's kinda big,

96
00:05:56.554 --> 00:05:57.190
right?

97
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.106
Usually the person who said
it gets a tiny little font,

98
00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.679
whereas the quote gets a really,
really big font.

99
00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:04.499
True?

100
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.278
Okay?

101
00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:10.395
So, how would we go about changing things,

102
00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:15.525
changing my name, so
that it is something different?

103
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:16.080
Yeah?

104
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You cite.

105
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so we can just
go on ahead and list cite right here.

106
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.917
And then, what do we do?

107
00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:29.055
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Change font size?

108
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.076
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Font size?

109
00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:34.975
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe
we'll go back to 1REM?

110
00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:45.512
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
Maybe that's a little small?

111
00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:46.863
This is the other part of CSS,

112
00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:49.850
you never know if you get the right
size right off the bat, right?

113
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.690
So you just sort of experiment.
