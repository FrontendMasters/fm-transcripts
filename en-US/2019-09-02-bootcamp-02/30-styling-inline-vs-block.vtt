00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Do we wanna
have any space on the top and

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.500
the bottom of those clickable,
those buttons?

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.610
Are you happy with the way that it looks?

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.670
Do you want a little more space
on the top and the bottom?

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.620
Around the word?

6
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.925
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is that padding or
is that margin?

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.480
So I guess it must be padding.

8
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.770
Where are we gonna put that,
on the li or the a?

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: on the A, okay,

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.440
why on the A?

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because we're dealing with
the item itself, like we want more space.

12
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
we're going to put some padding on that.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.701
So let's say padding, one rim that'll put
one rim of padding on all four sides.

14
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.150
Except it didn't actually, did it?

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.550
What just happened?

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.510
Well, I haven't told you.

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.030
In line elements, which are the A's right

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.120
is there the A's are only as wide as
their content their inline elements.

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.071
You can only add padding to either side.

20
00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:06.116
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And, so
you see there that we,

21
00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:10.520
actually looks like the border
might have moved a little bit.

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.450
Maybe it's in line with
that top border there.

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
But it hasn't really done
what we want it to do.

24
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.820
We'd actually need to put
this padding on the Li for

25
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.090
this to work a little bit better.

26
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.240
That made really big honkin big buttons.

27
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.340
And that's probably
a little too much padding.

28
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.822
So let's dial that back just a smidge.

29
00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:34.381
Okay.

30
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:38.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that true for
margins as well?

31
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is not necessarily true
for, well yes, actually that is true for

32
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.280
inline elements and margins as well.

33
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100
Yep, yeah, that is true.

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.650
Okay, so
before we move on to the clickable area,

35
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.750
anybody want a hover state?

36
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

37
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right now, we have lovely
buttons, and when we hover over them,

38
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
nothing happens, right?

39
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.047
So let's say that we wanna
go to a hover state.

40
00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:03.869
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So how do I write that?

41
00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690
Yeah?

42
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A colon hover.

43
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is it A colon hover,
or is it something else?

44
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I, M?

45
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's definitely
a colon hover is part of it, but

46
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.010
what is this gonna do for me?

47
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.290
That's a hover state for
every link in my whole document.

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.033
If I just want to do the nav bar,
my what's my selector?

49
00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:30.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Nav a.

50
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.897
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nav a.

51
00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:35.150
Nav a hover, okay?

52
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.920
And you can do whatever you want here.

53
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.755
But just to keep things moving
let's say background color white,

54
00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:46.730
color: red.

55
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.443
So now when I roll over these buttons,
they are going to invert.

56
00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:57.106
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But
only in the clickable area,

57
00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:01.410
which is the actual a tag itself,
see that?

58
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.630
It's not the whole button,
it's just the word.

59
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.550
Anyone bothered by that?

60
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.990
Don't you think like if I roll over here
on the edge of the button that it is

61
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.181
a whole thing should change color?

62
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.746
Okay, so this is big trick.

63
00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:22.200
When you're working with this
a it's an inline element.

64
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170
It's only as big as its content.

65
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.660
The Li is a is a block level element.

66
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.460
It's as big as its container.

67
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.410
We set that up to be 10 rems or
something in width.

68
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.640
So now what we need to do is somehow we
have to figure out how to make our a,

69
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.150
which is the only thing that's
going to be clickable here.

70
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.409
We need to make it as big
as the rest of the button.

71
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:47.254
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So a way to do that, is we
need to change it from being an inline

72
00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.943
element to being a block-level element.

73
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:52.776
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Does that make sense?

74
00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:56.230
So then our A becomes
as big as its parent.

75
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.010
What's its parent?

76
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: LI?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The LI And

77
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.600
now the whole button
area becomes clickable.

78
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.620
Does that make sense?

79
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.420
Okay, so that's actually
easier than you might think.

80
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.380
Right here on the nav a, all we have
to do is use the display property.

81
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.928
And we're gonna change our
display property to block.

82
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.037
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can see how that's
going to then move that clickable area to

83
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.410
fill that button area.

84
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.280
Except it's not quit
going out to the edges.

85
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.930
Why is that?

86
00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:43.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have some
padding on our li, right?

87
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.240
And now that this a is
a block-level element,

88
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.120
we can move that padding to the a itself.

89
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.760
And now, see, we've stretched our whole
clickable area to fill the whole button.

90
00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.780
Does that make sense?

91
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.800
Okay, yeah.

92
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Will that trick work for
horizontal as well or just vertical?

93
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It will work for
horizontal as well, yep.

94
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.520
Okay, how's everybody doing?

95
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.814
Have your heads exploded yet?

96
00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:23.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you successfully get
the background color to change on hover?

97
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.860
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now the whole
button background color changes.

98
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.742
See that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mine doesn't.

99
00:05:28.742 --> 00:05:32.730
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yours doesn't?

100
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.260
Do you have a syntax error somewhere
maybe, missing semicolon, easy to do.
