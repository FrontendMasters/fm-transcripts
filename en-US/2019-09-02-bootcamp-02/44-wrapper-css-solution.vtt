00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.183
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now I'm going to go
back up to the top of this web page.

2
00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:07.789
One of the things that you might have
noticed about the particular layout of

3
00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:12.246
this website was that even here,
just looking at the picture by itself,

4
00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.854
things don't go all the way to
the edge of the screen here.

5
00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:19.193
We have a little bit of
space on either side, right?

6
00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:23.466
Okay, so we don't have lines going all
the way to the edge of our browser window.

7
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.583
We have a tiny little bit
of space on either side.

8
00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:31.781
So what I did to make that happen was

9
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:37.761
here in my styles,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Appear

10
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.959
towards the beginning,
I have this div with a class of wrapper.

11
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.701
And that actually goes all the way
around my particular document.

12
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:48.258
All the way from up there,
all the way down to the bottom.

13
00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:50.349
That's where that div closes.

14
00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:54.324
So it's one great, big,
huge box around my entire webpage.

15
00:00:54.324 --> 00:01:00.475
And that can be useful because then I
can go ahead and do something like this.

16
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:04.379
I can say .wrapper.

17
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.952
And then I can say that we want
to do a width of something like,

18
00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.379
let's say, 80%, something like that.

19
00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:16.143
And then we can say we want
to center this on the page.

20
00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.572
How would I center this on the page?

21
00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:21.110
Anyone remember?

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.259
&gt;&gt; off screen: Margin with 0 auto
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Margin 0 auto.

23
00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.134
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

24
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:35.765
that's going to go ahead and get this
a little bit off the edge of the page.

25
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.101
All right, remember we can put
borders on this at any point in time.

26
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:44.401
If a border helps you to see
what's going on, by all means,

27
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.731
put a big border on this border.

28
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.781
5px solid red.

29
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.475
I recommend ugly colors for these borders.

30
00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:55.030
You don't want them looking too pretty
because you don't wanna remember to turn

31
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.768
them off later.

32
00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:59.246
If you make them honking big and
ugly, you won't forget.

33
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.443
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Ask me how I know.

34
00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:06.600
Okay, so go ahead and do that.

35
00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:11.133
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now you can see what's
going on there pretty clearly.

36
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:17.747
All right, so now we have a nice
centered div here on our webpage.
