1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
we're gonna introduce a new tag today.

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.590
We're actually probably gonna
introduce several new tags today.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.570
But the very first tag that we're gonna
learn about today is called the div tag.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.030
So you see it here in the HTML.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.385
Anyone know what the div tag is?

6
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.361
Have you heard of it before?

7
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.111
What does it stand for?

8
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:18.275
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It makes a box.

9
00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:19.930
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Makes a box.

10
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.590
It's good.

11
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.390
It's yet another tag that has a yet
another box with it, which is awesome.

12
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.710
What else?

13
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Division.

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is the division, okay,
so the div tag stands for division.

15
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just had a quick question,

16
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.130
if we were gonna, the difference
between div and section tag.

17
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, the difference
between the div tag and the section tag.

18
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.540
The div tag is just a generic box,
we need a yet

19
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.950
another box somewhere on the page, we're
trying to combine some HTML elements,

20
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.790
we wanna make a big box to
go around those elements.

21
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.380
The div can be very handy for that.

22
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.160
It doesn't add any meaning
to the page at all.

23
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.810
In fact, generally divs are used just for
the purpose that I showed here.

24
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.820
My div is holding a class, okay.

25
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.040
The section tag has some meaning to it.

26
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.510
So section, that's yet another tag,
that's yet another box.

27
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.190
That implies that the information inside
of that box is related in some way.

28
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.940
It's a section of the webpage.

29
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.030
Maybe it's a series of blog articles.

30
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.850
Maybe it's a series of images.

31
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.360
Maybe it's a bunch of links
that's a section of the web page.

32
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.690
We'll talk more about that too.

33
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.780
Yes.

34
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I get confused
with section and articles.

35
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Which goes in which?

36
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now I'm third-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or is that later?

37
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here's two more tags for
you.

38
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.790
So that we just talked about section.

39
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.030
There's another one that's called article,
we'll get to that later on today too.

40
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640
An article is what?

41
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Stand alone content.

42
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a piece of stand
alone content basically speaking, right.

43
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.890
It's something that I could pull
out of my whole webpage and

44
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.010
put in a Word document and email to
somebody and its still makes sense, right.

45
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.370
It's a whole unit of content.

46
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.950
So articles usually consist
of what kinds of features?

47
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What
might go in an article?

48
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A title.

49
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably a title,

50
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.230
which would be in a, probably a heading
tag, right, some kind of heading tag.

51
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.326
It's got what else usually in an article?

52
00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:13.864
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The author's name.

53
00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Maybe an author's name,
maybe some paragraphs,

54
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.700
maybe some images, right.

55
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.840
That whole thing, a big unit of stuff,
that would be an article.

56
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.460
You're gonna see these tags in action.

57
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.900
But for
right now let's focus on our div tag, and

58
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.380
let's focus on the HTML
that I've given you here.

59
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.800
So we've got a div with a class
of box one, all right, and

60
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.410
that's going around one paragraph here.

61
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.420
And then after that we have a div
with a class of box two, and

62
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.780
it's going around two more
paragraphs here, okay.

63
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.940
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

64
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.896
if you didn't have the div tags,
the HTML, it would look the same.

65
00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:50.788
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not HTML,

66
00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:52.650
the website would look the same.

67
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly, so if I didn't
have those div tags in there right now

68
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.219
there would be no difference in
the way that this web page looks.

69
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.090
It just looks like three really
long boring paragraphs, right.

70
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.360
Okay, so let's go on ahead and
start exploring some of these properties.

71
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have a quick question.

72
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

73
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you look
at the source code for

74
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.180
many websites, every element is
surrounded by div, is that best practice?

75
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,
it's a terrible practice.

76
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's a horrible practice.

77
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.480
We call it divitis.

78
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.220
There are some some people that put way
too many divs on their web pages, yeah.
