00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.113
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So to save a little
bit of time, let's go on ahead and

2
00:00:03.113 --> 00:00:05.630
copy the styles that we just created here.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.846
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if you refer back to
your web page, I've given you a horizontal

4
00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:19.187
navigation mark CodePen, go on ahead and
open that up and you can fork it.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.060
And I'm gonna paste in the same
styles that I just had for

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.350
my horizontal navigation, or sorry for

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.690
my vertical navigation bar and
pasting those same styles in.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.010
Because actually, there's not much we need
to change to make this go horizontally.

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.434
What we need to do in order to make this
go horizontal is actually the same kind of

10
00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.851
trick that we just used.

11
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:43.932
We use this trick to take
our inline element and

12
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:48.290
we turned it into a block to fill
the whole entire button, right?

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.840
There is another property for
display that we can apply to our li's,

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.820
in order to make this go horizontally on
the page as well and this is a different

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.080
one, it's called display inline block and
we're gonna put that on the li.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.228
That's it, we're done.

17
00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:14.360
One property, you just made
a horizontal navigation bar, okay?

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.880
Now you can go ahead and tweak it and
make them the right size.

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.370
It's lapping on to another line
cuz my screens not that big.

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.000
But you see here on the nav li,

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.470
what I did here is I changed my
display property to inline block.

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.260
That's a weird one, okay?

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.380
You know inline, you know block.

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.610
Now we have one called inline block.

25
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.727
[LAUGH] It's kind of the best
of the inline world,

26
00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:43.540
with the best of the block
world matched together.

27
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.260
Basically, this is going to allow
you to put these navigation buttons

28
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.240
all next to each other, but

29
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.070
still maintain some of the properties like
the width of these navigation buttons.

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.768
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

31
00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.917
the wrapping is a CodePen thing, not a or

32
00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:03.285
just will the browser will
automatically do that, or?

33
00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:03.996
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the code pen

34
00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:04.820
automatically doing that?

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, this is a browser,
well, it's actually my screen size,

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.590
what I have here projected for
my screen size.

37
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.180
If I reduce the width of my buttons,
let's say I make them eight ligne wide,

38
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.932
they're all going to go on one line.

39
00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

40
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.760
And if you were doing this in
real life on a web page you

41
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.470
probably wouldn't make enough bar
with buttons this honking big.

42
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.496
These are really big.

43
00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But it was fun, wasn't it?

44
00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.882
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
that's as simple as it is to make

45
00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:41.330
a horizontal versus
vertical navigation bar.

46
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.962
The thing you need to add to make it go
horizontal is this one line right here.

47
00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:49.385
Display inline block, put on the li, okay?

48
00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:50.920
And you can style things up.

49
00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:53.976
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All the rest
of it on your own.

50
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:57.512
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How's everybody doing?

51
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, what does that,
line of code essentially mean,

52
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.200
like you're turning each link or
each part of the list in the navigation

53
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.820
bar is now inside of a block,
which is the full length of the web page?

54
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so inline elements as
you know they go next to each other, so

55
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.830
we can line up inline
elements forever after.

56
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.050
So that's the inline
portion of inline block,

57
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.710
we're gonna stack these things
next to each other in space.

58
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put every in
line element into a block?

59
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.866
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So our lis,

60
00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:32.253
we're gonna put them one after
another horizontally in space and

61
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:37.848
there's some block level properties that
those lis, are gonna maintain as well.

62
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.901
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Like the ability to have
width, and be able to put margin, and

63
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.370
padding on all the sides.

64
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.613
That those kinds of properties
from the block world apply, but

65
00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:51.408
putting everything next to each other
from the inline world applies, and

66
00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:53.200
that's what makes inline block.

67
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.956
I wish they came up with a better name.

68
00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:56.699
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I really do.

69
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.374
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What I'm looking for

70
00:03:58.374 --> 00:04:02.900
is like a translation in English that
helps you remember to do that [LAUGH].

71
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, just think
about it as the nav bar property.

72
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.829
This is where inline block gets
used a lot is on nav bars.
