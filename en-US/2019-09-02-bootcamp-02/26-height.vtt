00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.614
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is also
a height function in boxes, okay?

2
00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:06.382
There's also a height function in boxes.

3
00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:09.741
Somebody ran into this
yesterday with their code pen,

4
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:13.475
they had a background image on
a div that had no content to it.

5
00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:17.532
And this is a very typical situation
where you might wanna use one of these.

6
00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:20.477
So let's go ahead and try this out.

7
00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:26.529
I'm gonna go to placekitten,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Dot com and

8
00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.739
I'm gonna just go ahead and

9
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.632
copy one of these links
up here on the top.

10
00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:38.586
And some of you have remarked on
the numbers in the placekitten links,

11
00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:41.746
this is the width and
the height of the pictures, okay?

12
00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:43.964
So you can change those
numbers to whatever you want.

13
00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:46.897
That's the width and
the height of the picture in pixels, okay?

14
00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:52.865
So we know we have a picture here that's
200 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.

15
00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:58.501
In my code pen,
if I drop that in, this code pen,

16
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:03.860
I'm gonna go ahead and
drop in a div with a class

17
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.822
of box three, cuz I'm creative that way.

18
00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:15.210
And I'm just gonna end
the div right there, okay?

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.460
And then over here in my CSS,
let's go ahead and

20
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.673
put in a background image, .box3.

21
00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:27.674
We'll put in a background image.

22
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:33.917
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which is URL,
and we'll use that place

23
00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.422
kitten image as our background image.

24
00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:45.651
And if you look,
what do we see on the web page and why?

25
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.636
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

26
00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.450
&gt;&gt; Students: Is it because
it's just too big?

27
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No.

28
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.215
First of all where is box3
displaying here on this web page?

29
00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:04.375
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Down here on the bottom.

30
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.104
This is what, this orange one is?

31
00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.507
Which one?

32
00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:09.154
&gt;&gt; Students: Box1.

33
00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:10.601
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Box1.

34
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.044
What's this here?

35
00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:13.194
&gt;&gt; Students: Box2.

36
00:02:13.194 --> 00:02:15.793
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Box2, right?

37
00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:17.173
Then we have this weird line here.

38
00:02:17.173 --> 00:02:18.874
What's that?

39
00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:19.932
&gt;&gt; Students: Box3.

40
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:23.687
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is box3.

41
00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.597
Why does it look like a weird line?

42
00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:30.925
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's going on?

43
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.144
Yeah, Cassie.

44
00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:36.397
&gt;&gt; Cassie: Div like our first
one is working with that.

45
00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:36.928
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.

46
00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:40.271
So this very first div is
applying to box three.

47
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:44.011
We said we had a five
pixel blue solid border.

48
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:49.039
So that's our top border and
our bottom border smashed together,

49
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:54.887
making what looks like a 10 pixel blue
line and nothing in between, right?

50
00:02:54.887 --> 00:02:58.854
The problem here is that our
div has no height to it, and

51
00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:01.880
we're working with a background image.

52
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.053
So background image just
fills the image in,

53
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:07.441
no matter how big your box happens to be,
or how small it happens to be.

54
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:08.605
It doesn't care, right?

55
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:13.091
It will repeat until that box is full and
covered with the background image, okay?

56
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:13.957
In this case,

57
00:03:13.957 --> 00:03:18.879
we haven't specified the height of the box
and the width is it's at its default.

58
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.899
If we specify our height to this box.

59
00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:29.294
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if we say height is
now 300 pixels which is the height

60
00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:33.332
of the image,
which is why I'm using pixels.

61
00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:36.161
Now our kitten will show up.

62
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.630
[SOUND] Isn't that lovely?

63
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.801
Okay, or we could cut up
the kitten's body, just like that.

64
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:53.257
[SOUND] Now we can only see her head,
so sad.

65
00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:55.727
So you can change the height and

66
00:03:55.727 --> 00:04:01.247
just change the various parts of
the kitten that you can see, right?

67
00:04:01.247 --> 00:04:03.248
So that's our div with
our background image.

68
00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:06.864
This is a good situation for using height.

69
00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:12.494
I am using pixels because I'm working with
an image its height is defined in pixels.

70
00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:16.540
You don't have to use pixels here,
you could use rems, okay?

71
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.022
So we could say instead,
we could say, make it 10 rems high.

72
00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:25.215
[SOUND] There it is, it's still working.

73
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:28.054
That works too.

74
00:04:28.054 --> 00:04:28.565
Yes?

75
00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.208
&gt;&gt; Student1: Looks like using
percentages doesn't work.

76
00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:34.521
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Using percentages doesn't
work, which is a great observation.

77
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:37.694
So if I said make this,

78
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:42.208
instead make this 25% high.

79
00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:46.695
We actually get something that's broken,
okay?

80
00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:50.384
And that is because, once again,
there's no content in this div.

81
00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:53.415
We can't use percents in
that particular situation.

82
00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:55.089
They just don't work.

83
00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:58.759
So you're gonna have to use
some other unit of measure,

84
00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.284
whether that's pixels or
rems, or something else.

85
00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:05.380
And that will that will
actually give the box height.

86
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.986
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Student1: So

87
00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:09.939
it looks like both when we used width
percentage was width of the screen, so

88
00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.797
that would change why isn't it like
percentage of height of the screen?

89
00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:16.863
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because height is
always defined by your content.

90
00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:21.087
However much content you
have is how tall it is.
