&gt;&gt; Jen: Go to finish your book chapter,
think about including some images,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.470
float those images in place,
don't forget a clear.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.585
Think about quotes, you could actually do
some floats with a quote as well, okay?

4
00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:15.230
You may need to put a width on your quote.

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.720
So, take your block quote, put a width
on it, try floating it in space,

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.304
see if you can do something cool by
floating an actual, your block quote.

7
00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:28.243
You can try by practicing that here
with this Nicholas Cage example.

8
00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:30.994
So, you can take this whole aside,

9
00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:35.213
try sitting a width on the aside,
float that in space,

10
00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:39.914
style it in some kinda cool way
as part of the article, okay.

11
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:44.470
So, as you work on your book chapters
post them up on code pen, remember,

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.584
if you want to keep your book chapter
from last night the way it was,

13
00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:51.981
fork your current book chapter,
make a new copy of it.

14
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:54.523
And then, you can continue
putting in your formatting.

15
00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:58.108
Your new images, maybe doing
something cool with block quotes and

16
00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.141
floating things.

17
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.464
Think about padding in margin.

18
00:01:01.464 --> 00:01:06.526
Some of those gaps and spacing that
you wanted to put in your web page.

19
00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:09.074
You can try all that stuff
with your book chapter, okay.

20
00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:13.457
and when we come back at 1:20 PM,
put those URLs in slack and

21
00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:18.515
we can take a look at a few of those
before we go onto Flex Box, sound good?

22
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.518
Okay, see you all then.
