00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're going to be
talking about CSS layouts today.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.020
So before I move forward,

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.320
let me just address this Slack chat
from what has been going on overnight.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.810
I'm so proud of the CodePens,
you guys have been posting,

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.190
showing your book chapters,
they are so much fun.

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.160
You have some really creative ideas and
you've done some wonderful stuff.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.390
At the same time, there's been a couple
of questions that have come up over and

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.710
over again.

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.620
One of the very most common
questions had to do with images.

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.950
So you had an image on your computer here
and you were working away in your HTML and

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.070
your CSS and VS code.

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.500
You were doing great, the picture
was showing, everything was good and

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.765
then you copied everything on to
your CodePen and what happened?

14
00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.855
&gt;&gt; Class: [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The image disappeared,

15
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:49.885
didn't it?

16
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:53.009
Yeah, the image disappeared and
so what happened was,

17
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.731
when you move things on up to
the internet, you moved up your HTML,

18
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:00.000
you moved up your CSS, but
you didn't move up your image.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.350
That's just a thing with CodePen,
CodePen doesn't have a way for

20
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.100
you to post images online, so you need
to find a resource somewhere out there.

21
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.460
Somebody had mentioned Imager,

22
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.640
there's a couple of other places you
can go to post your pictures online.

23
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.430
Then you can change your Image Source

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.460
to point to that online resource instead,
and then your CodePen will work.

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
So that was kind of like
the number one question.

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.820
What we're gonna talk about today,

27
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.340
we're gonna talk about box models, we're
gonna talk about the display property.

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.800
We're gonna talk about how to make your
navigation bar so that they go horizontal,

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.340
vertical, look pretty.

30
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.300
We're gonna talk about floats and
we're gonna talk about flex box.

31
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.650
That is about like five weeks
of material we're gonna cover.

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.130
[LAUGH] Which is why we need to
go a little bit long today, and

33
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.740
then I have a project for
you at the end of all this.

34
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.230
It's gonna combine everything that
I talk to you about today and

35
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.710
you'll be able to put that
together into one document.

36
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.280
It's gonna be a blog website that
you're gonna lay out, sound good?

37
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.130
So that is the roadmap for today.

38
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.045
We are gonna rely heavily
on our website here at

39
00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:15.240
frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp.

40
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.300
Be sure to click on the third link for
layout and

41
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.960
we're gonna be working from this today.

42
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.640
There's links in here, a lot of links
to CodePen that we're gonna work with,

43
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.920
rather than doing so much in in VS code,
we're gonna more with CodePen.
