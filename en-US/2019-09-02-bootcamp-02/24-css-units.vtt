00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
there are a lot of questions in Slack and

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.520
here in the classroom about units
of measure in working in CSS.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.410
So yesterday I mentioned that the best
units of measure to be using for

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.960
your website designs and
there are a lot that are possible.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.656
But the best ones and
the ones that the professionals are using,

6
00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:23.440
especially for responsive design
include rem, and percent.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.420
Those are the three big ones that
you're going to see in use now.

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.520
There's a lot of other ones,
believe it or not,

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.780
there's pixels, which are something
we tend not to use as much anymore,

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.480
there's points those are possible but
points are for print.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810
We don't use points in web design.

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.480
You might use them in a print style sheet,

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.240
which is a thing which we're
not going to talk about.

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.580
There are millimeters and centimeters,
those are things, there are inches.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.220
I don't know why you would ever use
any of those in your CSS but you can.

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.830
And so the things that we really want
to focus on then are Rem, and percent.

17
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.783
And so the big question was what
is the difference between Rem and?

18
00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:08.730
So rem, as I said, was root relative
where i talked about this yesterday.

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.956
Ems were very much an adaptive
type of measurement,

20
00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:18.910
depends on where you are on
a particular webpage as one is defined.

21
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.780
So, I just dropped this code pen url,
I just rip this up on the break.

22
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.230
We're looking at a h1 and
a paragraph here.

23
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.240
And I put in a little bit of styling,
I put in some background color, so

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.010
you can see what's going on here, okay?

25
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.546
So what I'm gonna do here now,
for my h1, I'm gonna put in

26
00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:44.310
padding of one just regular old.

27
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.600
One around my h1 and
you will see what I get there.

28
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.660
Now I am gonna put one of
padding around my paragraph.

29
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.239
Do those look like the same
amount of padding?

30
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.590
Anyone bothered by the fact that
they're significantly more on the green

31
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.120
one than there is on the blue?

32
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.580
That's weird isn't it?

33
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.510
But it has to do with the way
works as a unit of measure.

34
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.810
So is relative to the lowercase letter m.

35
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.780
That the width of the lowercase
letter m that is one m, and

36
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.720
obviously a lowercase letter m and
an h1, by default is much bigger.

37
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.370
And therefore the padding
around that h1 is much bigger

38
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.660
than what you're going to see
in a lowercase letter m and

39
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.910
just a plain old paragraph with
the default sizing set, right?

40
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.210
So you see how those don't even line up or
anything.

41
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.270
But if I change my ems here
in my padding to rems,

42
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.870
look how nice and
neat everything lines up now.

43
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.530
So this is as they say a root relative.

44
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.250
In other words, they're going back
to an being defined as the size of.

45
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.120
What is the font size of
the root tag of the document

46
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.020
root being the very first tag?

47
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.820
What is the first tag in your document?

48
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.800
After doc type?

49
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.340
HTML.

50
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.070
So what is the size of the font for
HTML by default?

51
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.780
16 pixels.

52
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.000
And we scale up from there for
the h1s and down.

53
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.429
So if I say one of padding here for
my h1, at one rem of padding for

54
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.781
my h1 in one rem of padding for
my paragraph and we're now talking

55
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:40.000
about exactly the same amount of space,
not a relative amount of space.

56
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.070
But an absolute amount of space and so

57
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.470
you can really see the difference
here in this example.

58
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.080
Okay yeah.

59
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why is there less
padding on the left hand side

60
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.880
of each of those than on
the top in the bottom?

61
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Less on the left rather
than on the top and the bottom.

62
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is because

63
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.690
that's a great question actually.

64
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.479
Why do you think?

65
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And
it is wider than it is tall?

66
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then is
wider than it is tall?

67
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.630
Close but not qiute.

68
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.646
Remember the h1 has got some margin on it.

69
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:19.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Earlier you used Pixel.

70
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.105
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For borders.

71
00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:21.570
For borders.

72
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

73
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And so for is that
because one rem would be too big or

74
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.260
can you use it part of
a rem like half around.

75
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.770
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You
absolutely could put in.

76
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.399
I mean we could make a border

77
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:39.450
here of one rem solid orange.

78
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.440
That's a really big border, right?

79
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.200
So we could reduce that in size,
we could reduce it to 0.5 rem,

80
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.376
we could reduce it to 0.01 rem.

81
00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:52.555
That's pretty thin.

82
00:04:54.423 --> 00:04:56.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 0.1rem, okay.

83
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.800
So we can do all of that and that's fine.

84
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.340
But borders in my mind
are something that aren't

85
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.080
necessarily scaling like text does depends
on your device like it's really important

86
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.870
that text scale on your device so
it's readable across tiny devices,

87
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.870
big devices and
borders are kind of decorative.

88
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.650
So I tend to stick with pixels
in borders because that

89
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.523
is reflecting like I want to really
thin one, through thin line.

90
00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:27.253
But you can absolutely do
your borders in rems as well.

91
00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:28.753
That's not a problem.

92
00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:32.173
I think you'll see most people in
the industry using pixels for border.

93
00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:34.633
That's like one of the only
places that we use them.
