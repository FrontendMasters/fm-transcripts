00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I had a couple of things
that came up here that I wanted to talk

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.770
with you about, a couple of concepts.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.240
So as we have learned this much CSS so
far and there's a lot of

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.120
concepts that I haven't even talked
about that are really important in CSS.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.520
So I wanted to in my code
point out a few things that

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.380
may come up as you were writing your CSS.

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.474
So for example,
here on line ten I start with a H-1, okay.

8
00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:28.926
And then the H-1 here for my styling,

9
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.430
I'd say that it has a dotted
red border with white text.

10
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.890
Okay, as you know,
that's not how it looked, right?

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.170
That's because later in my document
I have another H1 down here, okay.

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.022
And this H1 says make
the background color black, and

13
00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:51.384
the text align,
make it centered, all right?

14
00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.791
And so, what browsers will do,
very happily,

15
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.630
is it will take those two styles and
mush them together.

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.710
No problem.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.930
It'll go ahead and
do all those things to the H1 Okay?

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.170
What happens though if I said this?

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.374
Up here on the h1,
I said a five pixel dotted red border,

20
00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:18.286
and then down here later
on my next stage one,

21
00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:23.481
I said instead a five
pixel dashed Blue border.

22
00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's gonna happen now?

23
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.431
I have the border in both places?

24
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:35.586
How many people say it's gonna
be the red one with the dots?

25
00:01:37.538 --> 00:01:40.989
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many people say it's
gonna be the red one with the dashes?

26
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.192
All right, we're about splitting
the classroom between red,

27
00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:48.290
blue and nothing, okay?

28
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.929
Yeah, Genesis.

29
00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.390
&gt;&gt; Student1: Ever combine, and
it'll be red and blue like so.

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.990
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Like red and
blue, but dotted am dashed,

31
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.020
that would be, that would be awesome.

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870
But no, unfortunately.

33
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.490
Yeah, that would be
really be awesome though.

34
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.130
That'd be kind of fun.

35
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.940
So what happens here?

36
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.230
This is the C in CSS.

37
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.550
What is C and CSS stands for?

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.380
&gt;&gt; Student1: Cascading
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The cascading

39
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.780
style sheet right.

40
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.300
This is a style sheet.

41
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.860
The C is the cascade part.

42
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.290
So cascade means, if we list
a style earlier in the document and

43
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.690
we say it's one way, and
then later in the document,

44
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.309
we say it's different way, the thing
that's later in the document wins.

45
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.050
Okay, yes?

46
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.655
&gt;&gt; Student3: Like he was saying,
if the first one was more specific,

47
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.040
will that win, or
was it always just the later one?

48
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.510
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It gets more
complicated than that.

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.070
&gt;&gt; Student3: Okay.

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so the classes and
IDs, and we can make this super

51
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.820
complicated, but for right now,
if it's later in the document,

52
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.800
the thing that's later in the document,
that's what's gonna win.

53
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.230
So all right, so that's the first thing.

54
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.440
The second thing is, by the way.

55
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.786
If you do this and you write an H1 early
in your document, and you write an H1

56
00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:03.048
later in your document and your
document's only 50 lines of code long.

57
00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:04.846
You're a terrible programmer.

58
00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:05.501
Okay?

59
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.790
Don't do this,
cuz you're just going to confuse yourself.

60
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.800
So, what I would recommend that you do.

61
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.050
In a case like that,
this is very easy to do.

62
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.200
You're you're working away today,
right you're H1 style.

63
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.580
Later on, you go, yeah,
I need an h1 and you write it later.

64
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.250
Just combine them, because it'll make your
code much more easy to maintain over time.

65
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.940
Go ahead and go back on up and
then paste in what you've got here.

66
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.770
Okay, now so I wanna hid and I did what
I just said to do, I combined my styles.

67
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.780
Anyone see any issues with the code
that I just combined here?

68
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.570
Yeah.

69
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.650
&gt;&gt; Student2: Two different borders.

70
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.738
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have two different
borders now within the same style, right?

71
00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:48.207
Which one wins?

72
00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.050
First never wins, last wins.

73
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.640
Last wins in CSS, okay?

74
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.850
So in this case,
the border will be dashed in blue.

75
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.060
And again, if you do this,
especially in one style like this,

76
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.630
you're a terrible programmer.

77
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.010
Don't do this.

78
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.030
So pick one and

79
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.630
get rid of the other one because
otherwise you just confuse yourself.

80
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.680
So what do you really want?

81
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.310
I want a dotted red border so
that -blue thing is gone.
