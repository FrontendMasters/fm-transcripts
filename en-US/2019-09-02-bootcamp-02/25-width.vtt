00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, one of the things that,
two more properties that all boxes have,

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.020
of course, besides margin, padding,
and border, is width and height.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.479
And, so, as we were just saying before
the break, block-level HTML elements,

4
00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.607
their width by default is
the width of their parent.

5
00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.980
Since we haven't set a width to
our parent, these paragraphs and

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.040
these divs are really, really big.

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.650
What if I wanted to make a smaller one?

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.660
What if I wanted to make a smaller box?

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.400
Those are absolutely possible.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.733
So, let's say here for box1,
we'll go ahead and add a width to that.

11
00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.351
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so once again
widths are typically gonna be done in,

12
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:48.767
in fact, the way I'd recommend you do
your widths is probably more in percents.

13
00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:52.252
And there's a reason for that, because
as you add things up on the web page,

14
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:56.230
it's easy to add things up to 100% when
you're calculating widths of things going

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.119
across web pages.

16
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.535
You can absolutely do your widths,
and ems, or rems,

17
00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:07.611
those are totally legitimate as well,
you can totally do them that way also.

18
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:12.219
But let's just say,
I wanna do a box width of about 25%.

19
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.480
So that's a width of 25%,
about a quarter of the page.

20
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.480
And, you can see there,
that's the way that looks.

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.610
We could change the width of our box2,
just to show you that rems work also,

22
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.360
we can do that.

23
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.335
So, we could do a width of,
let's say, I don't know,

24
00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:35.250
10rem, how big is 10rem in pixels?

25
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 160.

26
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 160 pixels, right?

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.120
How many of you were bad at math and
couldn't get that answer like that?

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.250
Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.199
So, there's a great website, and

30
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:51.326
I've got it in your references,
it's called PXtoEM.com.

31
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:56.450
And this is a calculator,
[LAUGH] very handy calculator.

32
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.318
So, you can simply put it in your rem or
size.

33
00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:06.141
In this particular situation,
if you use your base-16, the ems and

34
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.810
the rems are exactly the same.

35
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.298
So, if we said, I wanted to make
a box that was 400 pixels wide,

36
00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:19.576
this would convert it for me to 25 ems,
which is also the same as 25 rems.

37
00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:21.290
And we could just go ahead and do that.

38
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.072
So we could say, we want it to be 25 rems,
and there's my box.
