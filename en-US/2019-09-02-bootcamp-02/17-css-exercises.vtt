00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.718
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Fabulous.

2
00:00:00.718 --> 00:00:05.023
So let me go through your exercises for
you to work on today.

3
00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:09.866
We'll scroll on down here to
the bottom of our CSS document today.

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:14.144
[COUGH] So as always,
I've given you some references for

5
00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:18.603
some reading some things that
we've talked about today,

6
00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:22.986
I'll add the reference to
the Cclor picker color zilla.

7
00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:24.965
So we've got the link to
color it out adobe.com there.

8
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:26.962
We've got the link to the validator.

9
00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:29.453
We've got some more reading on CSS.

10
00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.485
So your exercises include
to style your book chapter.

11
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:36.223
So you did all that work on
your book chapter yesterday.

12
00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:38.110
You've got some amazing HTML markup.

13
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.232
Now we wanna go through and
try to start making it pretty.

14
00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:46.165
So, think about colors and
background images, styling text, and

15
00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:50.029
think about elements, classes,
IDs and descendant selectors,

16
00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.937
and make your styles and
an external style sheet.

17
00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:56.725
Okay, do whatever you want,
whatever makes you happy.

18
00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:00.302
Whatever is pretty as you know
it's a book about photography.

19
00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:03.116
Maybe that'll give you some ideas.

20
00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:07.961
And then we have some additional practice
here for you just like we did yesterday.

21
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:10.136
So this is the W3Schools.

22
00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:14.286
There are some links here that will
talk to you about the inline styles,

23
00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:15.539
the embedded style.

24
00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.650
So you get a little practice with those.

25
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.153
Also, some limited styling exercises here.

26
00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:25.990
And then much more extensive styling
exercises here, in terms of syntax,

27
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.615
backgrounds, text links, and fonts.

28
00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:33.224
And then if you get through all that,
and you still need more to do, or

29
00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:38.155
you're still having fun, and you wanna
do some more remember those pages

30
00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:42.237
that we put together yesterday
about you and the hobby page?

31
00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:44.419
Keep on styling those too.

32
00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:47.838
Go grab pictures,
start putting some pictures in those,

33
00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:51.208
start changing some colors and
make it pretty as you can.

34
00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:56.161
There's only so far you're gonna be
able to get it pretty today because you

35
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.450
don't know how to do layouts yet.

36
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.321
Right?

37
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.169
Don't know how to do any columns,

38
00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:04.302
don't know how to make your
text wrap around your images.

39
00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:07.952
That is all stuff we're going
to be talking about next time.

40
00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:08.469
Okay?
But

41
00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.952
this this will be plenty of stuff
to get you thinking about things.

42
00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:17.244
The other thing you should not hesitate
to do is look up more CSS styling

43
00:02:17.244 --> 00:02:19.660
beyond what I've talked to you about.

44
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.533
So feel free to dig into some of the CSS
references that are out there and

45
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.016
try out new properties and
values as well, okay.

46
00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:32.625
&gt;&gt; Student1: I just recommend both MDN and
CSS tricks as great places.

47
00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:36.802
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Perfect, CSS tricks and
Mozilla Developer Network or

48
00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:41.794
MDN as you'll often hear it referred
to those are two great places

49
00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.896
to read up on CSS styling and
Jenna you had a question?

50
00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:49.219
&gt;&gt; Student2: Was why you're
using W3Schools over?

51
00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:55.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm using W3 schools for
because they have these lovely exercises.

52
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.062
Okay, W3Schools is a very controversial
resource in a lot of ways.

53
00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:03.791
Because if you actually read the W3Schools
website, it will tell you that they

54
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.041
don't guarantee that any of
the information they tell you is correct.

55
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:11.176
[LAUGH] As opposed to
the Mozilla Developer Network,

56
00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:14.320
which does promise that
they give correct answers.

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.657
However W3Schools does have a lovely
way of presenting the information.

58
00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:24.132
It's much more beginner friendly, I think
over the Mozilla Developer Network,

59
00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:27.640
which is kinda hardcore
professional kinda thing.

60
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.050
Plus W3Schools has these
exercises which are really nice.

61
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.330
That you can try this out write
code right there in the browser and

62
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.894
get answers as to whether you're right or
wrong.

63
00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:38.952
So that's why I've pointed
you there to those.
