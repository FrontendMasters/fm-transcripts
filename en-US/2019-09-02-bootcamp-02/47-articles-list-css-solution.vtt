00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now comes the last part,

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.926
which is the sort of the main
body portion of this webpage.

3
00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.679
And I used floats on this one just to
make everything comprehensive from what

4
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:10.579
we did today.

5
00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.897
We did all these different techniques.

6
00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.505
And so I've used floats here for
the middle.

7
00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:19.127
It would be totally fine if you
wanted to use flex box instead.

8
00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:20.649
Absolutely appropriate.

9
00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.024
So I did a bunch of stuff.

10
00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:24.230
So I'll tell you all the things I did.

11
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.182
So we'll start here with our article.

12
00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:36.252
And if you look at our html
here we have a section.

13
00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:39.374
Okay so we have a whole section
of this web page in the section

14
00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:40.756
contains some articles.

15
00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:41.677
So we have an article there.

16
00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.152
We have an article there.

17
00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.102
Okay.

18
00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:49.711
So first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna set up my article,

19
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.879
such that it has a margin of two rem and
zero.

20
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.025
And so this is gonna give me a little
bit of space between these articles and

21
00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.693
let's put on a border.

22
00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:06.439
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just to show you
that is in fact what's going on.

23
00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.941
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
you can see now we have our articles.

24
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:14.728
There is one article,
here is another article, and

25
00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:20.505
they have a bit of space between them,
just because it looks prettier that way.

26
00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.332
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we'll
deal with the images.

27
00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:26.211
So we have article image.

28
00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:32.728
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'm gonna float those images left.

29
00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:39.225
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we're gonna put in a margin around them.

30
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:43.874
Remember trouble, t r b l,
top, right, bottom, left.

31
00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.210
So we're gonna put in four values for
this margin.

32
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.156
And that will be zero one rem,
one rem zero.

33
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:58.226
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then finally the bonus
thing I didn't talk to you about in

34
00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:03.040
class today, but it's in your notes,
border hyphen, radius, one rem.

35
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.693
Okay so that border radius even though I
haven't called the whole border property.

36
00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:13.384
The border radius is going
to around all four of

37
00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:17.970
the corners on my image
at a radius of one rem.

38
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.458
So if you save that and refresh the page.

39
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.090
Cool.

40
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.841
Now we have lovely rounded corners there.

41
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:25.896
Right?

42
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.956
Lovely rounded corners, and
we have text all next to this, and

43
00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:30.527
it looks just perfect, right?

44
00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:31.391
We're done.

45
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:36.169
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But

46
00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.241
wait I floated, so
what else do I need to do?

47
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.063
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Clear.

48
00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:40.217
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We need to clear, don't we?

49
00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:44.629
Because what happens,
if I make this page smaller, what happens?

50
00:02:46.617 --> 00:02:48.815
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Possibly
weird things right?

51
00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.953
Maybe some weird things might
happen with these floats.

52
00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.344
So we need to make sure that we clear.

53
00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:57.890
And so
I copied the little formula to clear and

54
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.641
I don't have it in hand so
I'll just type it article after

55
00:03:06.203 --> 00:03:10.129
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that will be content.

56
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.973
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Double quotes.

57
00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:18.482
Display table, and and clear both.

58
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.682
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so
that's gonna clear our float, and

59
00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.429
you'll a tiny difference here.

60
00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.543
You see how the image is actually
technically hanging over the edge of

61
00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:29.194
the article?

62
00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:34.019
Once we clear that,
that problem will go away, okay.

63
00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.340
So now all I need to do is go back in
my code and turn off my ugly borders.

64
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.054
Which are easy to find because
I made them extra ugly.

65
00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:49.015
There's one on the wrapper there we go and

66
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:54.554
save it and refresh my web page and
there we go.

67
00:03:54.554 --> 00:03:56.669
