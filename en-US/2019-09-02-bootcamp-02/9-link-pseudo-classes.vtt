1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so did anybody style
any of their links in their code pen?

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.820
Yeah, so what did you do,
sort of broadly speaking?

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.990
What did you do for styling your links?

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I made it so
that when you hover over the link

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.610
the background is fuchsia.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool, all right, so

7
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.010
we actually have hover state,
somebody's already coded a hover state.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.940
What have you got?

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.576
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I did hover and then I
enlarged the text and changed the color.

10
00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:30.270
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You made it big and
different color when you hover over it,

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.510
very nice.

12
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.180
Okay, so let's talk about how
we go about styling links.

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.960
So I went ahead and
make my link set up this way.

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.370
So we just have an a here,
we have a font weighted bold,

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.620
a text decoration of none and
a color brown.

16
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.480
What does that text decoration none mean?

17
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.980
Anybody?

18
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.330
Anybody know what that is?

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The underline.

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It takes out the underline.

21
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.850
So remember by default links are blue and
underlined.

22
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.350
And you can turn off that underline by
turning off the text decoration, okay?

23
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.180
So if we go on ahead, and just to remind
you what my links look like here.

24
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.239
So my links are right here,
Frontend Masters, Google.

25
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.356
University of Harvard Extension School,
these ones right here, okay?

26
00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:28.020
When I roll my mouse over there
there's not a lot going on here.

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
You have to pay attention to the cursor
to know that these are even links, okay?

28
00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.787
If you notice that.

29
00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:39.938
Part of that issue is right now
with what we have to work with,

30
00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:44.840
with our CSS selectors,
we can select our a tag.

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.270
But a is actually a really
complicated thing, right?

32
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
links can be visited, they can be
unvisited, we can be hovering over them.

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.149
There's a lot of different things that
can be going on with a link, right?

34
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.680
So we have some additional items

35
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.630
to work with to describe the states of
our link that are called pseudo-classes.

36
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.210
And so one example of this is a:link.

37
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.960
Okay, so a pseudo-class often
starts with a colon like this

38
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.060
followed by something else.

39
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.850
There are many of these pseudo classes,
I'm only introducing you to a few of them.

40
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.720
And this is a:link.

41
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.436
So these are the unvisited
links on the web page.

42
00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:28.780
Only the unvisited links.

43
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.081
So if we do that and save that and
refresh our web page,

44
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.297
all my links look exactly the same.

45
00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:41.750
Because I guess I've never
visited any of these things.

46
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.340
So, let me visit a page, and
then I'll come back and refresh.

47
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.680
So now you see that I have the first
link there selected, it's now purple.

48
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.620
Why is it purple?

49
00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:59.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cuz we've
already gone there?

50
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.000
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cuz we've already
visited that place before.

51
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.100
And purple is the default visited color,
right?

52
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.670
So we can also style that visited link.

53
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's a visited,
all right?

54
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.133
We can change that do something different,
color, green.

55
00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Font size,
2 m or 2 REM, okay.

56
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.828
We'll make them really big
if they've been visited.

57
00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:43.090
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Font weight, normal.

58
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.470
Normal is how we turn off the bold.

59
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.860
So if it's bold in the link state,
we can change that

60
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.370
font weight by saying font weight
normal in the visited state, okay?

61
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.981
Okay, so then we also have
our hover state, a hover.

62
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.120
And hover, of course is what happens
when you actually hover over the link.

63
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.010
Move your mouse, hover it over the link.

64
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.601
So you can do something crazy here,
you could say, color is orange.

65
00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:20.627
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Text-decoration none or
underline.

66
00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.465
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we'll turn back on
that text-decoration when we hover

67
00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.253
over our link.

68
00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:36.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then like Emma did,
we can say background-color, white.

69
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.730
That's certainly a legitimate thing to do.

70
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.480
You can also set a background
color on anything.

71
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.690
And if we go ahead and
look at that in Firefox,

72
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.950
you can see we have how the links
change when we hover over them.

73
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.098
Maybe I should change that
background color to a black,

74
00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:53.569
that'll show up a little bit better.

75
00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:57.955
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Black.

76
00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:01.841
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go.

77
00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:05.283
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool?

78
00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:13.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Any questions on that?

79
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.440
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When I was originally

80
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.430
trying to do this I was trying
to change the look of it in

81
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.200
the using the list tags, I noticed that
these links are lit are in the list.

82
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But that didn't work.

83
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.854
I had these to a tag.

84
00:05:26.854 --> 00:05:27.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Have to use the a tag.

85
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the,
I guess hierarchy going on there?

86
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.266
Because the thing in the a tag is
also in the inside of a list element.

87
00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.550
Why doesn't that work?

88
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.540
And that's the only
thing inside of the list

89
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That is an excellent

90
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.480
question and it requires a lengthy answer.

91
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.290
So I'm gonna try to simplify which is,
it has to do with the cascade and

92
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.770
the way the cascade is working.

93
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.980
In the browser style sheet, your links are
styled already to be blue and underlined.

94
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.590
So to try to override that blue underlined
style with just a general list item,

95
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.860
that actually is not going to work.

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.000
So you would actually need to
override the style by using

97
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.280
a selector that's similar to
the one that your browser used.

98
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.894
So the a or better, a colon link.

99
00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:15.710
Or a class might be involved with that,
too.

100
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.040
So let's talk about how we would go
about adding a class to this as well.

101
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.980
So let's say that we want, [COUGH],
that link to Harvard.

102
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.440
This link here to Harvard.

103
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.918
So I'm on line 36 in my HTML.

104
00:06:33.918 --> 00:06:37.083
As we all know, Harvard is Maroon, right?

105
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:41.090
This lovely Harvard red, so we want
out link to be Harvard red as well.

106
00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we're going to put
in a class here on my Harvard link.

107
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.020
Right inside of that a tag,
we can add a class.

108
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:53.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we can call this whatever, Harvard.

109
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.739
Okay, so we'll add a class of Harvard
in our HTML right inside of that a tag.

110
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Over here on the side,
we can write a different kind of selector.

111
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.250
You haven't see this one before.

112
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.744
We can say a.harvard.

113
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.930
So what we've said here,

114
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.810
notice it's a.harvard, no spaces,
everybody see how that's done?

115
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.920
So what we're saying here is for

116
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.060
any a tag that has a class of
harvard inside of it, okay?

117
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.885
And then we can say whatever additional
part with it, link or visited or

118
00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:37.940
hover or anything else, and
write our style that way.

119
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.040
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And we could put the class

120
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.900
in anywhere within the a tag?

121
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

122
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.540
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The attribute order

123
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.520
here does not matter.

124
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.450
You can put the attributes
in any order you want.

125
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.545
It will work just fine.

126
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:57.803
So here we'll say, color: maroon.

127
00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:03.999
&gt;&gt; [COUGH].

128
00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.183
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
save your CSS and save your HTML.

129
00:08:09.568 --> 00:08:12.749
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And,
let me refresh the webpage.

130
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.740
Harvard is maroon there, but it's
really hard to see with my brown links.

131
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.400
So let me change the link color for
my other links.

132
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.450
Make them, I don't know, light blue.

133
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.306
And now you'll see that it worked.

134
00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:36.710
There we go.

135
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.100
So you see that Harvard
is definitely different.

136
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.520
Frontend Masters is different because
it's one that's been visited,

137
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.280
these other links have not.

138
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.292
Okay, but Harvard now as that
maroon color to it, makes sense?

139
00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:52.740
Sorta kinda, yeah?

140
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So is it considered
good form to get that specific,

141
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.090
by putting like a.harvard?

142
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.280
Because if you don't have anything
else with the class Harvard,

143
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.040
you can say harvard.harvard in your css.

144
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.320
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can.

145
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.922
So if we did not say anything else here,

146
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.420
we could just say .harvard.

147
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you not
use the link or hover or

148
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.760
visited unless you put the a in there?

149
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well, let's try this.

150
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.170
So, if we say just .harvard.

151
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.710
So, we've called a class with just
.harvard and we refresh the page.

152
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.170
That quote doesn't work, okay?

153
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.156
And the reason why again has
to do with the cascade in CSS.

154
00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:39.830
And so this,

155
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.040
this is considered not as specific enough
to override the color of the link from

156
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.500
some of these other ones that
we have earlier in the document.

157
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.270
So here, and
there's a very long explanation,

158
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.140
please just say, yes, okay, fine.

159
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.770
It doesn't work,
it has to do with the cascades.

160
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.650
If anybody's really interested,
I'll tell you the whole story.

161
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.680
[LAUGH] But I don't wanna blow up
everybody's heads in the process.

162
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.220
This is like really advanced stuff and

163
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.526
I don't wanna quite go there
with the full explanation.

164
00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:08.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the hover
functionality work for links or

165
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.900
can it work for just the paragraphs?

166
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hover can work for
anything, but

167
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.150
hang on just a second lemme finish this
example and then we'll try that out.

168
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.510
So you definitely need the a in front
of this in order for this to work.

169
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.192
At least you need the a in front of this.

170
00:10:24.412 --> 00:10:27.410
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
that will bring that back.

171
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.795
And then you can add on the link state or
anything else.
