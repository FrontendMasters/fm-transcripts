00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.720
This is CSS.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.900
And so now that we have the basics
of HTML under our belt,

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.660
we are moving on to the wonderful
world of CSS and making things pretty,

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.620
which will make everyone happy after
a day of truly ugly web pages.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.718
So to get started today what we're going
to do is set up our initial HTML document.

7
00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:25.697
I've already written this for you.

8
00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:28.338
[COUGH] If you go to GitHub and
take a look,

9
00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:33.570
we have here on this fine GitHub page,
we have the HTML we'll be using today.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.648
Go on ahead and highlight the whole thing.

11
00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I laid it all,
and copy, and

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.240
then we're going to jump
on into Visual Studio Code.

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.760
Go ahead and start a new file.

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.610
Paste that on in.

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.540
One of the giveaways that this has not
recognized as an HTML file is that

16
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.840
everything you see is white.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.200
That means you haven't saved it yet.

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.880
And VS Studio doesn't know
that this is actual HTML code.

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.485
So go on ahead and save this.

20
00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.595
File &gt; Save.

21
00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:14.205
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna
make a folder on my desktop,

22
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:19.820
I'm gonna call it day2,
New Folder, day2 on my desktop.

23
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.163
And I'm gonna save this
as learningcss.html

24
00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:28.727
right into that day2 folder.

25
00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:33.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Boom,
all the color comes up.

26
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.020
Isn't that great?

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.290
And then the last step here, just to make
this a little bit easier to work with,

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.500
is if you take your day2 folder, and
just drag and drop it right on top of VS

29
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.700
code, it may prompt you to save
the workspace configuration as a file.

30
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.960
If you wanna do that, you can.

31
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.877
I'm not going to.

32
00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:00.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Actually I
should probably say don't save.

33
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.330
There we go.

34
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.399
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then if you take a look
over on the left side of your screen,

35
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.320
you'll see that you should
have a column over here.

36
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.440
You should have
learningcss.html listed there.

37
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.830
If that is not in place, look for
the icon in the very upper left corner,

38
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.510
the one that looks like a couple
of documents and click that.

39
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.550
That's what toggles
that particular column.

40
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.150
And then we can go ahead and
open up learningcss.html.

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.750
Phew!

42
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.265
File management is always the hard part
of all of this and we'll go ahead and

43
00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.810
we'll get started writing some CSS.
