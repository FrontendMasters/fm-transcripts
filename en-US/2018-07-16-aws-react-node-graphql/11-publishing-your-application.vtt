1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is one more thing
we need to do to make this for realzies.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.920
Anyone know what that is?

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.930
What's the problem with
my application right now?

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.025
Where do I have to go to get it?
&gt;&gt; Student: It's on

5
00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:15.560
Logohost.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Logohost,

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.650
if I'm on the go and someone wrongs me,
how am I gonna deal with that?

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290
How am I gonna record that infraction?

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.030
All right this needs to go to
the Internet before it's really reals.

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.810
So enter awsmobile publish.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.188
And this is going to first push up
any backend changes that I made,

11
00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:36.890
cuz that's important.

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.980
And then it's going to build my react app.

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.630
And then it's going to take
that build react app and

14
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.940
move it to an S3 bucket in Amazon.

15
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.690
And then it's gonna take
that origin source and

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.570
put it behind a CDN distributed
around the world, right?

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.440
Because I picked USC one.

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.990
We discussed earlier
that's Northern Virginia.

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.520
Right, if I was in DC,
super quick to get to.

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.310
Jersey, not bad either.

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.670
Here, pretty fast.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.550
Sydney, Melbourne,
that's gonna be a lot like speed of light.

23
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.930
There are physical limitations to how fast
you can get to stuff on the Internet.

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.610
So rather than trying to guess,

25
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.650
well, actually all my users
are actually in Bangalore.

26
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.810
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it
in India, and then, no, don't do that.

27
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.920
The trick is just put your app everywhere,
right?

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.290
And so with the CloudFront CDN,
you basically distribute it to 77 and

29
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.010
growing, hopefully like my suspicion is in
a month that number will already be old,

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.600
which is great.

31
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.160
Places around the world and

32
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.430
then basically all of your users
go to wherever this is closest.

33
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.930
We actually did this at our
clients up at Sun Grid.

34
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.900
Originally it was hosted
out of Chicago and

35
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.005
we saw that our response time before
somebody in China even got the first byte.

36
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.625
We noticed that despite the fact,
I’ll tell you a little site secret,

37
00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.325
is that we don’t even know how
to take non-American dollars but

38
00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.785
we still have an eighth of
our customers in India.

39
00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.275
They would have to go all the way to
Chicago to even figure out what the first

40
00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.040
byte of the HTML page was.

41
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.765
So by switching that at the CloudFront
you can see huge performance gains really

42
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:12.613
quickly simply by taking the web page and
moving it closer to them, physically.

43
00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:16.190
That seems like the most silliest
thing but I'm gonna take it and

44
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.422
I'm just gonna move it closer to you and
now you get it faster.

45
00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:23.060
Cool, so now we've pushed everything up.

46
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.070
Let's take a look.

47
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.950
I was busy talking.

48
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.090
We're retreiving,
I think we're still building the back end.

49
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.130
Right, this is gonna be distributed
on S3 via CloudFront and

50
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.630
we see a bunch of kind
of interesting stuff.

51
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.282
All of this is configured for
us, all right.

52
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:41.369
Another course that we're gonna do at one
point is a whole thing about okay, so I

53
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.640
actually have an application, and I wanna
do all this AWS infrastructure by hand.

54
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.200
And that is a workshop in and
of itself, right.

55
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.900
It takes a lot of time,
configurage, and tweaking.

56
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.650
Here, we're gonna get a pretty solid
configuration right out of the box.

57
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.510
I actually looked at the CloudFront
distribution that was made, and

58
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.420
it was almost identical to the one I spent
the better part of a day tweaking by hand,

59
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.240
which makes you feel really great and
warm inside.

60
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.440
And the thing is too, I could literally
spin up a CloudFront distribution

61
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.950
using Mobile Hub, and then go take and
use it for some different app.

62
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.210
Or even copy those settings, so

63
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.260
it's also a great way if you're trying
to figure out what is a thing that I do.

64
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.120
So here it is on S3 and
we can go ahead and

65
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.475
we'll say hello and now I have to play
the game of remembering my password from

66
00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:34.652
earlier.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hey,

67
00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:38.280
there it is and
you can see my data's already synced.

68
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.051
This is the same day that I was
working with a development.

69
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.620
So I was basically working on the
production back end as I was going along.

70
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.670
Here it is.
It's in production.

71
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.260
That is a real website that I can hit.

72
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.970
If you don't like that one, there's also
a CloudFront one which is shorter but

73
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.940
equally as hard to remember.

74
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.760
That'll work for you.

75
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.070
The CloudFront one is obviously
better cuz it's distributed globally.

76
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.450
Also it has HTTPS by default because
this is very sensitive information.

77
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.480
We would like to encrypt it over the wire.

78
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.690
Amazon, well you can actually register
domain names in Route 53 through

79
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.520
the middle and also get free SSL certs.

80
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.150
So if you register through Amazon Route
53 there's just a button that says

81
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.780
generate me a certificate.

82
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.470
And then you go into CloudFront, and
you hit a drop down, and then you put it,

83
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.780
and you're good to go.

84
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.780
That's another course
that we'll do one day.

85
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.150
So here's my application.

86
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.000
It's deployed, it's in production, it has
got a back end, I did very little work.

87
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.240
As you saw, just basically
adding the API endpoints but

88
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.640
all of our infrastructure was built for
us.

89
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.560
And again, this is weapons
grade infrastructure, right,

90
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.860
this is serious, and
I know DB can scale, right?

91
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.140
That is a known factor, but
this is bulletproof authentication.

92
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.710
This has a user dashboard,
this has all of these things in place.
