00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, we're gonna
talk a little bit about, honestly,

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.310
what might be the most interesting and

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.960
arguably, crown jewel of the whole
set of tools that we've seen today.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.200
AppSync originally was, we saw it as
one of the options in Amplify, but

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.090
I'm gonna treat it as slightly separate
because it is a big enough topic

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.400
in itself, and it's very cool.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.570
All right, so what is AppSync?

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.730
We think about it as GraphQL as a service,
which probably leads to the next question,

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.940
which is what is GraphQL?

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.320
And what is GraphQL as a service?

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.220
We'll get there momentarily, I promise.

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.990
But it's basically most things,

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.890
a running theme of today is hey this thing
that was kind of involved to server side

14
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.670
arguably, it's one thing to
do something server side.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
It's different to do it well server side,
again,

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.405
I have some certification but do you
actually have email confirmations and

17
00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:02.125
forgot passwords and
all this other stuff, right?

18
00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:06.265
GraphQL is really cool, but I kinda
mentioned earlier, is that Scott Moss

19
00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:11.222
put out a whole workshop on of
multiple workshops on GraphQL, so

20
00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:14.092
we're not gonna go to that level of depth.

21
00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:15.102
Spoiler alert,

22
00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:19.102
the next slide is enough GraphQL to
be dangerous is the title of it.

23
00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:22.812
So, we'll kinda take a whirlwind tour of
GraphQL and if you're, I am into this,

24
00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:24.602
go check out those courses.

25
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:29.552
But what AppSync does is, it allows you to
easily, most things that we've seen today,

26
00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:33.610
easily set up a server, for
GraphQL that you can use on the client.

27
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.530
And then Amplify provides you with some
very basic tools for working with GraphQL.

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.660
Now there are much more robust client side
libraries, Apollo and Relay that all work.

29
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.750
But we're gonna use just the very
simple ones cuz this is not necessarily

30
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.860
a workshop on GraphQL.

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.940
This is a workshop on using Amazon's
infrastructure to get up and

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.110
running very quickly.

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.770
Right?

34
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.450
So, we're not gonna go all
the way into this, but

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.290
like the first time I saw GraphQL I was,
sold.

36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
And when you actually see how easy it is
to kind of get up and running with it,

37
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.560
you're, sign me up.

38
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.910
The first time I heard about AppSync I
was, how can this even truly exist?

39
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.560
And hopefully,
you'll feel that way at the end.

40
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.070
So, it can be used with existing
back ends with AWS Lambda,

41
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.040
in the same way we've been
doing throughout the day,

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.510
which is spinning up a dynamoDB
database as we need it.

43
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.260
I was thinking it takes that to a whole
new level, but if you have existing back

44
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.350
ends and when you wanna GraphQL over that,
you can actually have them call

45
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.950
Lambda functions which will then go
ahead and talk to your back end as well.

46
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.290
Obviously, that's slightly
more complicated.

47
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.340
Finally, it supports real time
subscriptions out of the box,

48
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.874
real time's in quotes
cuz what is real time?

49
00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:49.400
Right, really, we can argue that, is
anything on the internet truly real time?

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.030
I'm not having that conversation right
now, and it can be used off line with

51
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.910
the appropriate clients side libraries so
that's slightly out of scope for today.
