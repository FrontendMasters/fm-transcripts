1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we had a problem
statement in the very beginning here.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.870
[LAUGH] The problem statement is,
we wanna make this app real.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.210
We wanna persist our mortal enemies in
a database where they'll live forever.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.840
And so we haven't done any of that yet.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.000
So first thing we wanna do is
we want to be able to show

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.750
our client set application, like where
to find all of this configuration.

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.080
You can do this anywhere
in your application,

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.311
I'm gonna do this in Index.JS.

9
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:36.600
Index.JS is again that I first start
a file, is where this application

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.220
begins is the very first file loaded
when we start up the application.

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.320
So that seems like a really great
place to do some configuration.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.639
So all we'll do is we'll say, import

13
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:59.160
amplify from this AWS amplify library.

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool and so
we've brought it in there but

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.446
we also that can configuration
file that was generated for

16
00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:14.750
us we need to tell our application, hey
can you look at this configuration file.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.220
So what we'll do is we'll say Amplify or
actually,

18
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.350
we'll pull in that configuration.

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.860
We'll say import and
you'll call this whatever you want.

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.960
Import configuration from
dot slash AWS export.

21
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800
That file that we looked at
before that said do not edit in

22
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.290
all capital letters like
it was screaming at you.

23
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.200
You can, don't edit it but
you can totally read it and

24
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.760
use it cause it's really important.

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.290
Actually pull it in was import
configuration from AWS exports.

26
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.890
Cool, so now we have amplified,
we have our configuration,

27
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.520
we just have to have the two of them meet.

28
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.790
So what we'll do is actually
say amplify.configure.

29
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.709
And we'll give it our configuration.

30
00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:06.284
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool and
so this is basically,

31
00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:10.440
we had a client side app
that didn't have a back end.

32
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.680
We spun up a back end that
doesn't really do anything yet.

33
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.018
And now we're basically, this is the kind
of link between our front end and

34
00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:21.200
our backend together.

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.170
All right, very cool.

36
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.720
I wanna talk a little bit
about how to turn on and

37
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.810
off features in AWS mobile hub.

38
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.770
So we go back over to our terminal.

39
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.700
We can do AWS mobile and you just type

40
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.730
features and I actually, kind of,
tell you which one's are on and off.

41
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.180
So I can turn off analytics for
instance and

42
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.280
I hit Enter as I,
I noticed you turned it off.

43
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.210
Do you want to disable it?

44
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.310
You're right, I do.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.170
And it turns it off and now you see
the only one you have on is hosting.

46
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.960
I can't think of a world where
you'd want to turn off hosting.

47
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.170
Because eventually you do want to put
this application on the Internet.

48
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.150
I mean, I assume.

49
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.820
I guess, maybe if it's some kind of
electron application where it's going to

50
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.750
be built into the app,
you wouldn't need that.

51
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.540
But I'm really stretching at this point.

52
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.020
Anytime that you make a change
to the backend though,

53
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.210
like you only made it on your computer,
the backend is again, in the cloud which

54
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.420
is again someone else's computer, so we do
need to tell Amazon that that has changed.

55
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.110
So do AWS mobile, push.

56
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.750
And it says connecting to
the back end AWS mobile project

57
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.500
is preparing it's updating it and
there's pulling down the configuration.

58
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.290
So it made a bunch of changes, it pulls
down the configuration an effectively

59
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.460
changes all those files that I told you
not to edit because it's changing and

60
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.840
if you start changing them,
it's going to blow away your settings.

61
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.500
Cool, so I'm going to do a git commit

62
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.620
wire in basic SWS mobile hub settings.

63
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.590
Probably need to do git add first.

64
00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:24.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Git commit "Wire
in basic AWS Mobile Hub settings".

65
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.480
However, I just said that

66
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.050
made Siri on my iPad believe that I was
talking to her so that's a fun thing.

67
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.150
Cool and when you look at git status
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll push it out,

68
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.720
or get log, rather.

69
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.360
There, we have the change.

70
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.260
And we'll push it right up to git.

71
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.980
So if you want to see any
of the changes I've made.

72
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.040
Other than adding those
three lines into index.js,

73
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.230
I have not done anything
super important yet.

74
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.610
But this is the kind of major change
right now, which is just again,

75
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.580
telling the front end about the back
end and that everything is in place.

76
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.730
So now what I want to do is I
want to start off effectively

77
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.740
we're gonna have a database and an API but
we know that those are bound by user.

78
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.870
So we need some way to
identify specific users first.

79
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.620
The very first thing we'll likely set
up is we'll set up authentication.

80
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.790
Now, the authentication that
comes out of the box if you

81
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.650
don't give it any custom
settings is pretty solid right.

82
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.060
You'll actually define a unique
identifier to anonymous users so

83
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.650
it knows that given an anonymous
user moving around your app.

84
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.880
Which is again useful if
using the analytic stuff.

85
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.870
Slightly creepy as well, but it's fine.

86
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.950
It actually has two factor
auth out of the box vis SMS.

87
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.690
Where when they sign up it'll
send them a text message and

88
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.040
every single time they log in,
it will also send them a text message.

89
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.950
Which is really strong but it's also kind
of cool to think about the fact that

90
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.080
you don't have to wire up any of that.

91
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.740
It's not like,
let me go get a twillio api and

92
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.130
then go send them this thing and so on.

93
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.130
It's just like saying,
I want authentication,

94
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.640
it's like, here's some rock solid
authentication, you're like,

95
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.130
wow, calm down a little bit here,
that's a bit much.

96
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.040
But, let's take a look
at what that looks like.

97
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.480
So anytime we want to
create a new feature or

98
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.100
change one of our backend settings,
awsmobilehub.

99
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.110
Again, that's kind of like our
hook into everything here.

100
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.420
And then, if we wanna change a feature,

101
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.270
we just kinda give it
the name of that feature.

102
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.150
And again, you can always type
in awsmobilehubfeatures or

103
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.650
you just awsmobilehub or
just AWS mobile, sorry.

104
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And you can see the
features that it supports at this moment.

105
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.520
So looks like and we will take
a lucky guess which one we need

106
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.354
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or what you use for

107
00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:54.230
sign in or
do I just give away the [LAUGH].

108
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.880
I meant to say authentication and
authorization but do user sign-in.

109
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.780
There's a quick thing
that you need to realize.

110
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.770
If you just do aws mobile hub or
awsmobile enable,

111
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.140
you're gonna get the default settings.

112
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.440
Again, with user sign-in,
that's not terrible.

113
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.720
It's a rock-solid authentication system.

114
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.820
There is stuff, though, like the database.

115
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.770
Or the API layer, or
any of these others ones where it's like,

116
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.580
listen, I have opinions on
what this database looks like.

117
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.880
So if you want to be asked
a bunch of questions,

118
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.870
you can actually type it in --prompt.

119
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.800
If you know what you want and
you just want the defaults,

120
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.367
you don't need to do --prompt,
totally fine.

121
00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:40.528
But if you know that there's a whole
bunch of things that I want to configure,

122
00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:42.570
we'll do --prompt and

123
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.380
it'll basically ask you a bunch of
questions and walk you through this.

124
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so first question
is you want the default settings?

125
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.310
Which I guess I could have just not
typed --prompt if I really wanted that.

126
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.390
So go to advanced settings.

127
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.210
So incognito is Amazon's Identity service,
that's gonna be the one

128
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.180
that we use because otherwise we have
to go get Facebook or Google sign ins.

129
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.270
We have to get API keys and configure
all of that, but that effectively would

130
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.590
allow you out of the box to be like login
with Facebook or login with Google.

131
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.100
You can do that as well,

132
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.600
we're just not going to because I think
I've I think I've gone on the Internet and

133
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.550
gotten enough secret keys and
displayed them all to you, okay?

134
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.570
I think I'm gonna call
it at this point and

135
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.320
stop finding more secret keys
to display on the Internet.

136
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.370
Cool, so we'll do incognito user pools.

137
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.060
And then, you can see, okay,
how are users going to log in?

138
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.580
Email, username, phone number.

139
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.120
The phone number is required for
a multi-factor authentication.

140
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.030
Out of the box we'll also see
that like if you do email,

141
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.180
it'll actually send you
an email with the code.

142
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.060
Generally speaking,
this is probably a pretty good idea.

143
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.840
Like it means that whoever
uses an email to sign up

144
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.040
needs to be in control of that
email in order to use it.

145
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.520
Generally speaking, this is a good idea.

146
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.330
There's a really great piece that came
out a month or two ago which is like, for

147
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.610
Gmail you can put a dot anywhere in
the first part of the email address.

148
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.950
Right, so like, I could be like,
I could put a dot in between my first and

149
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.790
last name and
it'll still go to the same place.

150
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.760
I can put a dot in between every letter,
it'll still go to the same place.

151
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.060
What somebody found out is that people
were signing if a Netflix putting dots and

152
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.270
that weren't the right email address and

153
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.950
somebody else could like reset
the password to their real email address,

154
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.070
and basically take over
the Netflix accounts, right?

155
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.810
Now, if they were email
the code to that email address,

156
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.790
it had to verify it,
they could have never got an opposition.

157
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.190
So some of these features like,
effectively make your authorizations

158
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.450
scheme better than Netflix is
which is kinda cool, right?

159
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.920
So we'll go with the username, is like,
let me tell you why emails are great and

160
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.540
then pick season and cool.

161
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.630
And then you can still like
a minimum password length.

162
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.320
Sure it seems right you can like

163
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.790
go out of your way to make your password
less secure you are interested?

164
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.350
Like you are not gonna have
to write the logic for

165
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.599
enforcing how a password like rosswork.

166
00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:14.460
It's basically, you're just gonna say
what you want it to be you can either,

167
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.449
we are gonna use the default built
in sign on page right which is.

168
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.830
It's got its rough edges, right?

169
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.040
But the idea that you get this all for
free and

170
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.020
you're getting good practices for free.

171
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.730
Because let's be honest, if I was wiring
up a webpage, what do you think the first

172
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.630
test that I would skimp out
on is doing this stuff right.

173
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.030
Let me tell you how badly, especially if
it's like a nights and weekends project,

174
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.860
like how badly I wanna spend all of
saturday enforcing password roles.

175
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.970
I don't, ever.

176
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.610
It's never going to happen, right?

177
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.540
Also let's say I'm doing this at my job.

178
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.260
Let me tell you what my employer
would like not to be paying me for

179
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.430
stuff that is tried and true,
done a thousand times, right?

180
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.440
Let's leverage this up, and

181
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.670
let's focus on the things that make
our applications unique and special.

182
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.070
This doesn't seem particularly onerous
though, so we'll go with it Cool.

183
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.080
And you notice we're
back on the command line.

184
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.520
And if I fire off something of the Github
application, you can kinda see.

185
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not a lot
has changed just yet.

186
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.550
And so if we look at this, we can see
that we have our authentication service.

187
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.900
We haven't actually didn't change
something again cuz I just remembered I

188
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.680
did ignore that entire folder so it's not
gonna [LAUGH] we're not gonna say like,

189
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.260
hmm, that's strange, and act like
it's casually normal, but it's not.

190
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.790
So let's actually go back into the code.

191
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.393
And we can kinda see
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We've got this file

192
00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:49.750
here and we've also, if we go in
here as well, we can see sign in.

193
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.740
That way we've got this idea
that sign in is enabled.

194
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.170
We're using user pools.

195
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.520
We're preferring the user name.

196
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.860
Multifactor configuration is off.

197
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.000
The minimum password length is eight.

198
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.060
All right, this is what I was talking
about before as your configuration in your

199
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.300
infrastructure as code, right?

200
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.580
This isn't like somebody
tweaked a few buttons.

201
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.910
You can do everything via
the command line tool or

202
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.870
you can just go into the UI and
change a bunch of stuff, right?

203
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.030
But this is kind of cool because
all of your basic settings here

204
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.510
are kind of codified.

205
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.560
And you can kind of tweak
them if you need it and

206
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.200
that will be deployed as your backend,
which is incredibly cool.

207
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:36.680
All right, so here we go and what we
need to do next is an AWS mobile push.

208
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.356
I guess I need not work with VS

209
00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:46.930
code,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool and

210
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.530
so we're gonna push that back end up.
