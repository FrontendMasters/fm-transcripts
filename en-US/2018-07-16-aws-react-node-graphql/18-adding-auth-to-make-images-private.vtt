1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.413
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
how do we implement authentication?

2
00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:11.430
So, the chance to redeem myself after
having to do it by hand the other time.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.064
What is the command?

4
00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:19.068
What is the command we do all
AWS mobile help stuff with?

5
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.617
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] AWS mobile.

6
00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:25.302
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, AWS mobile.

7
00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:27.870
And what's for authentication?

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.150
I can type, just type a thing or
two and we'll see.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: User-signin.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.908
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: User-signin, very cool.

11
00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:37.600
User-signin, and we'll do enable,

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.778
we'll try it out with --prompt.

13
00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.844
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And here's hoping,
we'll go to advanced settings.

14
00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:50.400
Again, we, for sound interference
we turned our cell phones off.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.410
So the text messages is
not really a great thing.

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.410
We'll use email.

17
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.860
Sure, all the defaults are fine with me,
other than the phone part.

18
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.131
Now, we'll do awsmobile push,

19
00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:19.689
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool, and

20
00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:25.750
now we're just going to wrap
this in the authenticator.

21
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.848
So do import,
withAuthenticator awsmobile react,

22
00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:37.945
[COUGH] Go to bottom it'll say,
withAuthenticator,

23
00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:42.685
and I'm gonna have to make a new account,

24
00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.060
cuz this is a different app.

25
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.580
It's not like one global across
all of your Amazon apps.

26
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.550
Each one has its own of
all of these resources.

27
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.870
It's not shared across any of them.

28
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.649
Now, if you wanted them
to have the same one,

29
00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.825
you could grab the configuration
from the backed directory.

30
00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.369
You can grab the configuration for all of
the Cognito stuff you're using that user

31
00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.054
pulled they're using for one,
and bring it over to another.

32
00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:12.603
That's totally a fine thing to do,
but by default,

33
00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:16.330
they're all gonna be completely unique,
all right?

34
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.310
So let's see what we got here.

35
00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:22.889
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The authenticator
is not defined.

36
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.130
Now, if I go up which
one did I spell wrong?

37
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:41.142
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Authenticator,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

38
00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:43.236
all right, so
I just spelled the first one wrong.

39
00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:44.879
So, we'll go ahead and Sign up.

40
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:47.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, here's open.

41
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, we'll go ahead,

42
00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:11.130
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I got
a verification code.

43
00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:15.251
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I was excited.

44
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:30.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and we're in.

45
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.300
Cool, so
now we've got authentication in place.

46
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.053
It's really interesting without me talking
about it a whole bunch, to see how actual

47
00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:41.958
quick that is to wire up with email
verification and everything else.

48
00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:47.384
What I want to do,
I want to make this all private.

49
00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:54.070
One thing I can do if I want to
get this up and running quickly

50
00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:04.442
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can say level private,

51
00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:07.990
and this is just gonna
change the defaults.

52
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.188
If you wanna have different
levels at different worlds,

53
00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:12.497
you can like literally go on and
do that for every given one.

54
00:04:12.497 --> 00:04:14.566
But this should be a private level for

55
00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:17.727
everything
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

56
00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:19.210
what's the first thing that you notice?

57
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.960
What's not on my screen anymore?

58
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No images.

59
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.281
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No images, why?

60
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:27.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're not yours.

61
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I didn't ask for

62
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.120
the public ones, I asked for
all of my privates ones.

63
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.580
Which is super cool that means
that already I'm getting images

64
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.760
scoped from my user, right?

65
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.910
Without a whole bunch of authorization,
right?

66
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.478
It's like yeah,
we're just gonna get yours.

67
00:04:42.478 --> 00:04:45.639
Under the hood is actually putting
in a directory under my user ID,

68
00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.700
which is what makes this possible.

69
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.200
So it's actually the by
default looking in there.

70
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.350
Soil sensor?

71
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.070
Sure,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool.

72
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.860
And so now this is unique just to me.

73
00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And over ten seconds
later guess what doesn't work?

74
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.630
That URL, right?

75
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.000
It's totally no good anymore.

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.039
So if I even all of a sudden got to that
computer, they went to the bathroom,

77
00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.383
I'm gonna right-click on whatever that is,
that URL.

78
00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:27.790
I mean, they could have just dragged
it off the screen, I got it up.

79
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.780
What's the whole security thing?

80
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.891
What if somebody has access to your
computer, physically access, game over?

81
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.110
But it does mean that
this URL at this point,

82
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.940
you can see request has
expired which is super cool.

83
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.534
Cuz again, didn't take me a lot of work
to do a relatively sophisticated thing

84
00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:45.424
which is really, really neat.
