00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.395
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And what I'm gonna do,
after this backend goes up,

2
00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:04.170
is I'm gonna fire up this AWS Console.

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.477
So we can actually go ahead,
and we can see it, in the UI.

4
00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.404
And we can do additional tweaks and
changes,

5
00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:12.036
just to kinda get that work flow down.

6
00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:16.378
This is a great way to say hey,
I made this change, is it true?

7
00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:17.411
Did it happen?

8
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:18.501
Is it really real?

9
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:21.335
Cuz sometimes,
here's the thing about things being easy.

10
00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:25.550
Sometimes you don't know if they
actually worked, [LAUGH] right?

11
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.752
Cool, so we pushed it up,
we do awsmobile console.

12
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:40.376
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You see it spinning up,
and this is my application.

13
00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.233
This is like, you don't have an app yet?

14
00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.870
You do,
this is if you want to add another app.

15
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.414
This tricks me out every time.

16
00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:47.957
Just ignore it and scroll past it,
make believe you didn't see it.

17
00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:52.485
[LAUGH] Your life will be better
just making believe it's not there.

18
00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.829
So you can see here, the two backend
services that I have turned on.

19
00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.705
User Sign-In, and Hosting and Streaming,
I turned off analytics before.

20
00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:02.326
You can see that there's a NoSQL database.

21
00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.896
Now you can, you're like,
I hate the command line.

22
00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:08.541
You can turn everything on here as well.

23
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.028
You can do all that kinda stuff.

24
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.452
This one isn't in the command line tool,
and this is also new.

25
00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:18.828
I don't have a lot to say about it,
it seems really cool.

26
00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.417
So when you go to user sign-in,
we actually see those settings.

27
00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.855
So we're doing email and password.

28
00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:28.197
You can see the settings that we
set before are all here as well.

29
00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:32.261
And if you go to action,
we can do edit in cognito.

30
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:35.693
What I wanna point out here is this is
not, again, some fancy abstraction.

31
00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:39.343
This is a real deal cognito user,
for which you can use, for

32
00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:41.909
real enterprise-grade applications.

33
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.875
This is not like toy
versions of everything,

34
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:49.258
it's simply a nice abstraction that
gets the stuff set up for you.

35
00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:50.941
So we can go ahead and edit in cognito.

36
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.240
We're not gonna do too many changes here,
I just wanna show it to you.

37
00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:57.043
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and

38
00:01:57.043 --> 00:02:01.091
here are all of the different [INAUDIBLE]
You can see estimated numbers of users,

39
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:04.913
zero, which makes sense cuz no one has
ever logged in with this one before.

40
00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:09.615
All right, [COUGH] so
we can have all of this in place.

41
00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:13.075
[COUGH] You can see there's
other stuff you can do in here.

42
00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.815
You have a logo, and
stuff like that as well.

43
00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:18.335
CSS customizations, so on and so forth.

44
00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:23.792
I'll leave this as an exercise to the
reader in order to play around with it,

45
00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:24.317
cool.
