1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're going to talk
a little bit about some terminology.

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.480
As you saw when I did
the drop down before,

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.570
Amazon has no shortage of services.

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.710
There was a whole bunch I could
put in alphabetical order.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.070
It didn't make you feel any
better about the number of them.

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.740
It's increasingly growing, and
it's already overwhelming.

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.630
We're only gonna talk about a few,
which is kind of a cheat because the few

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.470
that we're gonna talk about
are actually wrappers over many more.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.370
But they kinda fall in
a few different buckets.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.710
But when you have that many things in a
given service, you tend to have ones with

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.590
very similar names and the boundaries
between them are a little fuzzy.

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.030
So what we'll do is first come
just talk about them each

13
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.490
almost like definitions
of what each one is.

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.180
And you'll see there is some overlap and
sometimes you're using

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.640
two of them in conjunction to
get a job done, totally cool.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.550
And if at one point you're kind
of confused on the different

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.230
boundaries between them,
that's probably normal.

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970
But let's actually just take
a little bit a time to kind of

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.740
look at each one of them.

20
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.150
So the three that we're gonna spent
most of our time with today, and again,

21
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.350
I told you that's a lie because they
wrap other ones, is AWS Mobile Hub,

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
which is targeted as letting mobile
application developers get up and

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.950
running really quickly with
industry standard best practices.

24
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.560
Now I would argue that front-end web
developers fall into that same bucket.

25
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.805
I think that there's no difference
between a single page react app and

26
00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:29.186
an iOS application, right?

27
00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:32.959
They are effectively applications that
are installed on the client that talk to

28
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.080
a back end API.

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.150
So, what is good for mobile developers,
even my bread and butter today,

30
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.290
we don't a mobile Singrid app.

31
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.570
I'm a desktop JavaScript developer,
but everything that applies for

32
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.620
mobile developers works for
me just as well.

33
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.290
So it doesn't really matter either way.

34
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.955
Amazon, AWS Mobile Hub is an abstraction
over a number of different services.

35
00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:58.242
We're also gonna talk about
AWS Amplify and AWS AppSync.

36
00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:00.300
We'll look at each one
of these individually.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.560
So the first is AWS Mobile Hub.

38
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.992
This is an abstraction for
managing a database service on AWSA,

39
00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:11.550
identity/auth indications/authorization
service on AWS.

40
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.770
It's one for managing S3 buckets.

41
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.780
It's basically a way to kind of
spin up all of these services

42
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.950
with good configurations, configurations
that will get you from user one

43
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.550
to user ten million with a scalable
architecture out of the box.

44
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.920
And what's really cool about some of
this AWS Mobile Hub stuff is that,

45
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.450
while some services might be like
a black box of how they actually work,

46
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.710
you're getting a real DynamoDB,
you're getting a real S3 bucket,

47
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.500
you're getting like weapons
grade CloudFront distributions.

48
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.250
You're getting everything
that we use at Singrid for

49
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.750
building all of our applications.

50
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.440
You're getting it with a command line tool
to initialize, push it up to the web,

51
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.340
everything is kind of configured and
set up for you, which is very, very cool.

52
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.090
And basically what Mobile Hub is,
it's an abstraction over that.

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.940
It's got a dashboard that you can look at.

54
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.290
It's got a command line
tool to spin things up.

55
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.650
It's pretty cool.

56
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.760
The command line tool, for

57
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.320
us we're gonna be focusing mostly
on the JavaScript aspect of this.

58
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.464
Mobile Hub kinda targets
four-ish platforms.

59
00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:22.165
It targets Swift/iOS development,
Android development, React Native,

60
00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:27.002
which can kind of be Android and
iOS, and React web development.

61
00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:28.563
All right, so
kind of the four major platforms.

62
00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:32.557
We're gonna be looking at it from the
perspective of just React web developers,

63
00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:35.212
but those are kind of four
platforms that it targets.

64
00:03:35.212 --> 00:03:39.633
And it's basically for, again, spinning
up these back-end services easily.

65
00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:44.980
And so the awsmobile-cli is an npm
module that you install globally.

66
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.880
And it basically gives you
an awsmobile command line tool.

67
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.390
And from there,

68
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.990
you can initialize projects, publish
them to the web, all sorts of stuff.

69
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.970
You can install either.

70
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.040
If you feel like npm,
it's npm install -g awsmobile-cli.

71
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.840
If you're into yarn, yarn add global
awsmobile-ci it's the same code,

72
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.640
it's just how you wanna get
it installed on your system.

73
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.670
AWS Amplify, again, is a JavaScript
library, and it's basically

74
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.140
JavaScript code that you can use to
interact and control AWS services.

75
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.080
And it lets you talk to an S3 storage
layer, it will let you talk to an API,

76
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.060
will let you handle authentication.

77
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.120
It's basically JavaScript bindings for

78
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.060
working with AWS in general and
Mobile Hub in particular.

79
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.119
There's also AWS Amplify React,

80
00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:40.667
which is a bunch of React components
that are also integrated with Amplify.

81
00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:44.541
And there's also,
if you're into React Native,

82
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:49.772
aws-amplify-react-native which
is react native components for

83
00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:52.850
building native mobile applications.

84
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:57.645
There's a lot of overlap.

85
00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:01.418
When you initialize a project
with the AWS mobile CLI,

86
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:06.926
it will automatically install AWS Amplify,
which is the JavaScript library.

87
00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:10.726
And if it senses that it
is a React application,

88
00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:14.590
it will also install AWS Amplify React.

89
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.735
So setting something up as an AWS mobile
project will also get you the Amplify

90
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.603
library, Amplify helps you
talk to AWS mobile hub.

91
00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:25.099
You can already see how some of these
boundaries are beginning to blur

92
00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:25.830
a little bit.

93
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.380
The last one, which we'll talk
about at the end, is AWS AppSync,

94
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.170
which was officially announced in
November along with Amplify and

95
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.190
effectively allows you to
create GraphQL as a service.

96
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.940
So GraphQL is very cool.

97
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.160
Scott Moss has a really great
workshop on setting up a server.

98
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.520
This allows you to actually
spin one up very quickly.

99
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.910
If you want to do more complicated stuff,

100
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.140
then you definitely need
to watch Scott's workshop.

101
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.650
But it allows you to basically say,
hey, I'm gonna have this data,

102
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.470
it's gonna look like this.

103
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.180
It'll actually go ahead behind the scenes.

104
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.540
It will create the DynamoDB databases for
you and set everything up.

105
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.030
It will actually, out of the box,
support real-time push.

106
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.652
If something on the database changes
you can actually subscribe like,

107
00:06:06.652 --> 00:06:08.143
I wanted to know when this model changes.

108
00:06:08.143 --> 00:06:10.350
Hey it changed, and
you can handle it in your code.

109
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.090
And you get that all out of the box for
free.

110
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.172
If you kind of use some of the more, like
heavy weight GraphQL client libraries,

111
00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:20.655
like Apollo, you can actually get
offline first, and caching, and

112
00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:22.352
stuff along those lines as well.

113
00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:24.911
We're just gonna look
at some of the basics.

114
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.846
You can kinda define the schema and
say hey, create me all the DynamoDB

115
00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:34.560
databases that I need in order
to use this GraphQL schema.

116
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.350
Or if you already have
Elastic Search in place and

117
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.570
you wanna use that, or Lambda functions
are basically little snippets of code that

118
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.330
you can execute when stuff happens.

119
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.958
So if you have a custom back-end and you
just want GraphQL, and you want to have

120
00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.520
the subscriptions and the notifications
and stuff along those lines, you can

121
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.530
actually write your own lamda functions to
hook on to your existing back-end, right?

122
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.785
So we're gonna use the DynamoDB,
out of the box cuz we don't have a legacy

123
00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:02.070
back-end and
that's not my real idea of fun today.

124
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.827
We'll actually just spin up
the database as we need as

125
00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:09.058
fresh as we go.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: AppSync can be used

126
00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:12.073
with Amplify a Mobile Hub,
it doesn't necessarily need to.

127
00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:15.980
It actually has its own JavaScript library
if you just wanna use it by itself.

128
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.620
So you can kinda mix and
match and integrate any of these.

129
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.873
Amplify is aware of AppSync,
so is Mobile Hub, so

130
00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:24.821
they all kind of blend and
can work together.

131
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:28.129
But the really cool thing is,
unlike some other services,

132
00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.237
let's say for
some reason you want to go really custom,

133
00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:34.942
you can just peel away the abstraction
layer and you have, again,

134
00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:39.210
DynamoDB databases, everything along
those lines and do stuff yourself.

135
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.750
And you're gonna customize and
tweak stuff,

136
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.329
it's not like a black box where you
can't really see what's going on.

137
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.210
Cool.

138
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.240
So again,
let's just kinda review that real quickly.

139
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.110
What does Mobile Hub offer?

140
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.770
Again, it's an abstraction of
a bunch of different services.

141
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.980
It's an abstraction over AWS Cognito,
which is their authentication service,

142
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.520
which handles all sorts
of crazy authorization.

143
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.882
You can put different users in different
groups, and they can say these users have

144
00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.342
the right to do this,
these users have the right to do this.

145
00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:08.830
And it can actually work with federated
identities, like Facebook Login or

146
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.490
Google Login.

147
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.470
Really cool, really like,
really easy to set up with Mobile Hub, but

148
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.039
if you need to get a very granular,
it's incredibly powerful as well.

149
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.600
Storage is just a wrapper over
the infamous AWS S3, which is one of

150
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.510
the oldest services that AWS offers as a
way to put files on the internet, as well.

151
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.972
Serverless functions,
which we're also gonna call it cloud API.

152
00:08:35.972 --> 00:08:38.760
Again, Frontend Masters has
a whole course on serverless.

153
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.030
But we can actually spin up API's really
quickly using a combination of AWS Lambda

154
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.760
and API Gateway.

155
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.030
Databases out of the box
will usually be DynamoDB,

156
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.640
which I've mentioned a few times.

157
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.120
It'll also support hosting out of the box,
not just hosting in one location, but

158
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.403
actually globally distributing
your application.

159
00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.976
So everywhere people around
the world can access it quickly, and

160
00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:01.700
not just have to travel all the way around
the world, depending on where they are.

161
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.110
Finally, and we're not going to
play too much with this one today,

162
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.910
supports analytics and notifications.

163
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.640
A lot of native mobile platforms
support push notifications.

164
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.170
The web does, but
it's kind of a little more tricky.

165
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.160
But Pinpoint will actually let you track
users' actual moves and different things

166
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.800
that they're doing in the application,
which is fine for regular analytics.

167
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.470
But you can say, I saw you looked at
this product, or this restaurant.

168
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.330
And then you can send them a text
message or something along those lines.

169
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.530
You can actually figure
out really interesting and

170
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.040
unique ways to engage with your users.

171
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.630
That one is only available in us-east-1,

172
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.390
which is one of the reasons that we're
not going to be using it too much today.

173
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.405
Amazon has many, many data centers, and
so a lot of times, not all the time,

174
00:09:41.405 --> 00:09:42.998
some things are global.

175
00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:46.884
But in a few cases, you can host your
code at this one data center, and

176
00:09:46.884 --> 00:09:50.980
that data center may have all of
the Amazon services or a subset of those.

177
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.110
We'll actually define that
as we set everything up.

178
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.280
And so finally, just to kind of review,
we talked a little about AWS Mobile CLI,

179
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.240
just a command line interface for
working with Mobile Hub.

180
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.380
Amplify is at JavaScript library for
using it in your code, and

181
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.380
we're ready to get started.
