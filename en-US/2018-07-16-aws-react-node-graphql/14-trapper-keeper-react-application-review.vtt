00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're not gonna
worry too much about that,

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.010
because it's kinda difficult to spin up
an app that has a whole bunch of users and

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.920
stuff along those lines.

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.370
We're just gonna kind of look at
the storage API kind of in isolation.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.126
I think it becomes fun.

6
00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:15.790
This is one of those ones where if
you look at the database one, and

7
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.371
you look at the storage one,
you're like cool they're init.

8
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:23.020
And then, I guarantee you a week
from now you're I could store that

9
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.761
stuff in the database, have the key and
then have the file over in there.

10
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:31.623
And then kind of have the lock and the key
to go get it, and stuff along those lines.

11
00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:34.830
It's really hard to come up
with a contrived use case.

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.790
And also, in order to keep just
learning the storage API kind of clear,

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.060
we're kinda look at it in isolation.

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.509
That does involve looking at
a slightly different repo.

15
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.022
So this one is under my GitHub and
it's called trapper-keeper.

16
00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:51.035
So, we'll kinda look at it together.

17
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.146
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna check out
a new branch called basic-implementation.

18
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:26.414
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so again, this is
kind of an excuse to play with this API,

19
00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:29.850
which I think is kinda init.

20
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.399
So what is the first thing we need
to do for a new awsmobile project?

21
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.958
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Init.

22
00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:42.754
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Init, awsmobile, init.

23
00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:43.442
You know what?

24
00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.378
Let's try something.

25
00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:50.759
-y, don't ask me questions,
just do it, right?

26
00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.740
And so that once skips all the questions,
right?

27
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.131
Before it was,
it detects all the things correctly.

28
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.324
I purposely chose to use create react app
not, I mean, I like create react app,

29
00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:01.464
I don't dislike it.

30
00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:04.894
But I also want it a bunch of
sensible defaults in this case.

31
00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:09.166
So because I did that, I can just type -y,
and it knew what to do with everything.

32
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:14.612
It's going to install
aws-amplify-react and

33
00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:20.199
aws-amplify and
put those both in place as well.

34
00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.849
And then, we're gonna start our just
turning on one API, we're gonna turn on

35
00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.320
the storage API, cuz that's the one
we wanna play around with, right?

36
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.256
And so, wait very patiently for this,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

37
00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.906
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: One more.

38
00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:41.616
All right, so the storage API
is gonna be called user-files,

39
00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.110
is the name of that one,
until I turn on that API for us.

40
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.410
So when this fires up,
we're gonna type awsmobile user-files, and

41
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.426
that will give us
the ability to turn that on.

42
00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:57.125
So, awsmobile user-files.

43
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:02.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we gotta say
enable or else it's not a thing.

44
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.556
Cool, and so you can see we have analytics
which I'm gonna turn off real quick.

45
00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:18.551
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool, so we
have hosting and we have user files, and

46
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.410
that seems like a good for a start.

47
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:29.326
So we'll,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There

48
00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:33.699
won't be a lot to push in this case,
because we are get ignoring the AWS stuff,

49
00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.367
and we actually haven't
written any code yet.

50
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:40.622
That was probably just a change
to my package json for

51
00:03:40.622 --> 00:03:42.855
the AWS stuff in this case.

52
00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:46.498
All right, very cool, so
he says that's what it was,

53
00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.805
he didn't look, but it's fine.

54
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.580
So what we literally wanna do is let's
fire up this app and take it for a spin.

55
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.856
Again, we haven't set up
AWS to find this one, so

56
00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.905
it's just gonna be the kind
of app au naturel.

57
00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:07.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you need
to push to AWS first?

58
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Likely, except that I
haven't configured it in the application,

59
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.600
at all, yet.

60
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.473
So the application is completely agnostic,
starting the development server.

61
00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Probably yep, I'm gonna
have to do it in port 3001 in this case.

62
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.248
Cuz I left the other one going.

63
00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:42.586
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
cool, it'll be up in one second.

64
00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:52.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
as you can see, I'm very good at CSS.

65
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.750
It's almost like I took the CSS
from the previous project, and

66
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.457
turned it to purple instead of pink.

67
00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:02.076
And all this does is allows us to
choose a file from the desktop.

68
00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:06.765
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And eventually,
do something with it.

69
00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:17.258
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [SOUND] So we can grab
a picture, it's not gonna show up here.

70
00:05:17.258 --> 00:05:19.960
And hit Submit, and right now,
it just logs into the console.

71
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.330
But we chose a file,
we log the file object to the console.

72
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.827
I would love to be able to
put that into the cloud.

73
00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:30.883
It seems like a good
place to put this file.

74
00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:33.649
It's a picture of an Arduino or
a Tesla board.

75
00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:34.986
It's pretty cool.
