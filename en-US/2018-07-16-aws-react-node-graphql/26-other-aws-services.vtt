00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
just a few final thoughts.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.800
A lot of these AWS services
make making a lot easier.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.610
And I kind of just said is that with
really professional grade tools.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.030
Just, that you had a lot of helpers
from Amplify, Mobile Hub and AppSync and

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.500
other services, you can use either
one of them without the other one.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.900
It's very much take all you want,
take everything, right?

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.980
We looked at everything and
how you use them together.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.600
But if there's one of these technologies
that interests you more than the other,

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.110
if you have a particular use case
where you only need one of these APIs,

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.700
you can just use that one, right?

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.852
You can theoretically just use and stuff.

12
00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:42.958
I have actually learned a lot from
spinning up stuff in Mobile Hub and

13
00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.430
then looking what Amazon did for me.

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.328
Like because a lot of
getting started guides,

15
00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:50.312
at this point I've read most of them,
they're like 500 pages each.

16
00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.830
And they start out good and
get esoteric as they go on but

17
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.890
it's very interesting to see some of
these configurations in practice.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.950
So AppSync makes it really easy to
configure GraphQL which is, for me,

19
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.380
as a front end engineer,
a very life changing technology.

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.750
The idea that I can basically
make it if you are request again,

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.220
just the data it need
from a single end point.

22
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.360
To build my UIs is incredibly powerful.

23
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.500
I also wanted to leave you with
some areas of further research.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.870
We use React,
you can use all of this with Angular.

25
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.330
We used React because I use
React on a daily basis.

26
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.940
They also have bindings for
Angular if that's your thing.

27
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.810
Pinpoint we talked a little bit
about allows you to fire a whole

28
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.900
bunch of tracking events if you've
use something segment IO Or

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.640
something like that,
it has got a lot of that built in.

30
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.400
It also allows you to send notifications
out to users either via SNS,

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.540
email or push notifications.

32
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.200
MobileHub recently supports Lex for
building conversational experiences.

33
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.770
I have not gotten a chance to play with
that yet but it looks super interesting.

34
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.180
I'm not totally sure what you can do with
it yet but, I will find out shortly.

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.030
And then lastly the kind of point that I
just made and I just want to reiterate it,

36
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.440
one final time.

37
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.831
Is that Mobile Hub applications
are real applications they are using

38
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.701
the same technology as many
other very large applications.

39
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:21.717
And a great way to kind of get started
with a very good infrastructure that you

40
00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:25.420
can scale and you can focus on making
the parts of your application that

41
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.470
are important and differentiated rather
than implementing for for the 700th time.

42
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.380
It's very interesting to see some
of these conventional configuration

43
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.190
things come back.

44
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So the [INAUDIBLE] you
know you showed us the graphs thing.

45
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The graphQL and

46
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.370
before that we were doing
the database the other way.

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.080
Are those just two ways
of putting a preference?

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just two ways.

49
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.280
Yeah there's just two ways to do it,
graphQL it's own complicated thing.

50
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.889
Sometimes it might be
power than you need too.

51
00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.153
For instance right now at Sun Grid
we want to use graphic QL on

52
00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:56.539
our front ends, right?

53
00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.240
And the architecture team wants
to give us graphQL endpoints.

54
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.980
Right?
The big problem is how do we, because,

55
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.270
a given resolver,
we looked at very simple examples.

56
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.770
But if you think about okay, an event
could have some numbers of comments.

57
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.530
Right?

58
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.210
And those comments could
also have another relation.

59
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.820
Right?

60
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.515
And if you're not careful you
could DDoS your entire system,

61
00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:21.300
because each resolver
kinda works independently.

62
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.210
And so as you're doing all these things
you could have these, because it's

63
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.453
a graph you can have these effects that
you weren't really thinking about.

64
00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:33.500
Now with the Amazon stuff you're a little
bit safer, because you can scale,

65
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.640
but also you need to be a little
bit careful with that stuff.

66
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.054
For most new projects,
I would likely go with graphQL.

67
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes so here we had one
table, so you're kind of saying,

68
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.790
yay when you start having
your relational tables.

69
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can start to just go

70
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.170
down the rabbit hole.

71
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The thing
about very powerful tools

72
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.690
is they can be very
powerful foot guns as well.

73
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.822
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I use NT Framework it's
a .Net thing for plugging in your SQL

74
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.398
tables it's almost the same,
I could start to pull in all my tables.

75
00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:04.000
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

76
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.578
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
cause everything to go [SOUND].

77
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep, yeah.

78
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.230
That's exactly,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have done up to

79
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.051
20 includes, knowing [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Believe the saying goes

80
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.821
with great power comes
great responsibility.

81
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.320
[LAUGH] graphQL is incredibly powerful.

82
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It goes for
starting and like how far can I go?

83
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.646
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, exactly.

84
00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:22.982
So we are very cautiously optimistic
about for implementing it.

85
00:04:22.982 --> 00:04:27.200
Because for us we started our
business as a API company which, so

86
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.530
we build very good backend the APIs which
means we don't build, particularly.

87
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.040
We haven't always built particularly
good APIs for our frontend, right?

88
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.080
So you get one resource and it gives
you a link to go fit the next one.

89
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.690
All of a sudden, I'm making 18 HX requests

90
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.190
to get the data I need to display the UI,
right?

91
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.360
If we can find some way where
I can ask for that one thing,

92
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.600
this could be really powerful and
helpless on a performance level, right?

93
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.759
But we could also take down the company,
[LAUGH] right if we do it poorly, right?

94
00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.552
Especially like if some of these
are publicly accessible, right?

95
00:04:57.552 --> 00:05:00.349
It's like, we could be diligent but
so on and so forth.

96
00:05:02.813 --> 00:05:05.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes,
on that view models and get just that so

97
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.013
imagine there's something
similar where you say this is.

98
00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:08.666
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,

99
00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:13.840
even like the connections that
way you can have a default.

100
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.070
You're gonna get back 20 unless
you say otherwise, right?

101
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.974
And then you'll get a next token if you
want more and stuff along those lines.

102
00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:23.247
So there are patterns and protections, but

103
00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:27.239
we saw connections because made them for
us.

104
00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:29.960
They're not like a graphQL convention.

105
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.770
They're not like,
you automatically get that all the time.

106
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.157
No.
If you're building your own

107
00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:35.410
graphQL server.

108
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.003
You're not having a schema
magically generated for you.

109
00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:44.070
It could be very likely that you could be
minding your own business and thinking

110
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.693
about some edge case where all of a sudden
things exponentially get more complicated.

111
00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:51.025
Cool.
Thank you so much.

112
00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:55.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
