&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hello, my name is Steve,
and I work at a company called SendGrid.

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.550
Our major cash cow is providing an API
that sends a billion emails a day.

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.460
I do not work on that API.

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.433
[LAUGH] I work on a WYSIWYG editor for
making emails that's built in React, and

5
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.770
build on top of that.

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.080
We're gonna talk a little bit today about
building applications using React and

7
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.820
using Node, with a little special twist.

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.119
We talk about them in terms of building
them on some infrastructure that can

9
00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:43.214
support not only your first user,
but your first 10,000 users or

10
00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:45.075
your first 10 million users.

11
00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:47.516
We're gonna talk about building React and

12
00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:51.392
Node applications quickly on
a powerful infrastructure, right?

13
00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:54.898
We're gonna look at
Amazon Web Services and

14
00:00:54.898 --> 00:01:00.960
see that we can actually use a lot of
these tools to build our applications and

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.042
deploy them with relatively little
effort compared to what we might think.

16
00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:09.684
Me, personally,
when I'm building an application,

17
00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.607
it all starts out with hopes and dreams.

18
00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:15.679
It starts out with, I have this great
idea for an app, you design it, you start

19
00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.817
thinking about filling up a swimming pool
full of money after it goes viral, and

20
00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:21.640
it's gonna be really great.

21
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.569
And then you have to start worrying
about things like deployment.

22
00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.757
Or you have the fact that it's
starting to timeout because you are so

23
00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:32.726
popular, and all of a sudden
you're getting crushed with all of

24
00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.976
your new friends that want
to use your application.

25
00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:40.595
Because doing this stuff, and doing this
stuff at scale, is difficult, right?

26
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:44.902
And one of the things that Amazon
learned is they can figure that out and

27
00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:48.740
then they can rent it out to us
to use it so we don't have to.

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.470
We can do a lot of the parts that make
our applications really special, right?

29
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.730
There are exceptions, but

30
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.860
usually, just having off does not make
people love your application, right?

31
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.330
Definitely being able to reach
it if it does get very popular

32
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.440
is incredibly important, but

33
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.790
there's a whole bunch of non-glamorous
parts that don't make our apps special.

34
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.456
And what we can do is leverage these
services to focus on what makes our

35
00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:18.773
products and our applications unique and
to kind of outsource all of the rest.

36
00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:24.666
So this is a course on building React
applications with Node backends on AWS.

37
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.772
And we're gonna take
a look at a bunch of very,

38
00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:30.080
very new tools on the AWS platform
that we'll talk about in a little bit.
