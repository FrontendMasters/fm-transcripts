>> Hi everyone, my name is Lydia Hallie. I'm a software engineer and mainly focused on JavaScript and today I'll be giving yet another kind of quiz formatted workshop. If you see my last one on the web development quiz you'll already be kind of familiar with this format. It's a Q&A style of 50 questions in total of various topics in JavaScript that you'll encounter like event loop, closures, classes, prototypes.

Just a lot of random stuff and also just like miscellaneous content like numbers and week maps, all that stuff. So I'll give you like a couple minutes to answer the questions and then I'll give the answer in as much depth as I can. So that's what we're gonna be doing today.

I hope that it's gonna be useful for all of you. And of course, if you have any questions about any of this, please let me know. I'll love to answer them.
