00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.317
Anyway, that was the very last question.

2
00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:06.893
I hope I didn't burn you out too much
with all the JavaScript questions.

3
00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:09.072
It wasn't really about getting
all the answers right.

4
00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:13.066
I think my goal was more to kind of
remind you that certain things exist,

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.541
how certain things work.

6
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.401
So anyways,
I hope you enjoyed today's workshop.

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.062
And if you have any more questions,
you can always reach out to me online or

8
00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.136
in person, I guess.

9
00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.056
Thank you.
