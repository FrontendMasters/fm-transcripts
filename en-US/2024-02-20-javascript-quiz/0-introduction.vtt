Hi everyone, my name is Lydia Hallie.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm a software engineer and
mainly focused on JavaScript and

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.510
today I'll be giving yet
another kind of quiz formatted workshop.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.125
If you see my last one on the web
development quiz you'll already be kind of

5
00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.548
familiar with this format.

6
00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:19.517
It's a Q&amp;A style of 50 questions in
total of various topics in JavaScript

7
00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:24.658
that you'll encounter like event loop,
closures, classes, prototypes.

8
00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.272
Just a lot of random stuff and

9
00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:31.160
also just like miscellaneous content like
numbers and week maps, all that stuff.

10
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.126
So I'll give you like a couple
minutes to answer the questions and

11
00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:38.240
then I'll give the answer
in as much depth as I can.

12
00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:41.104
So that's what we're gonna be doing today.

13
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.164
I hope that it's gonna be useful for
all of you.

14
00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.894
And of course, if you have any questions
about any of this, please let me know.

15
00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:48.323
I'll love to answer them.
