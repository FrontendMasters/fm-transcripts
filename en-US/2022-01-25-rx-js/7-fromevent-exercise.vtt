00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:02.855
We have a little application
called fromEvent.

2
00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:07.323
At this point, you do want to clone
down the repro and do npm start.

3
00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:11.712
Because if you just go to the published
version and you change code,

4
00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:15.101
nothing will happen because
that's not your code.

5
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:20.198
So you can spin up the local server, it is
at local host one, two, three, and four.

6
00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:23.700
And, in this case, what we wanna do is,
this is real simple.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.978
There's a helper method
called addMessageToDOM,

8
00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:31.222
we just wanna get a little bit of
experience using a fromEvent helper

9
00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:33.616
in the same way we did with of and from.

10
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:38.134
And then we're kind of getting all
these small pieces, collecting them,

11
00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:39.712
understanding them, and

12
00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:43.740
we will build to somewhat bigger and
better things as time goes on.
