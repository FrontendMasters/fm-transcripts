1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.992
So as we break into the exercise, right?

2
00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:05.594
This is a good opportunity for
you to answer this question for yourself.

3
00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:09.322
And we have a series of just kind of
making observable some all sorts of

4
00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:10.426
different things.

5
00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:13.939
You got to see me do it the simple version
now I give you the hard version cuz

6
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:14.696
that's fair.

7
00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:19.356
And you kind of go through some of the
basic versions, and kinda, yeah, exactly.

8
00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:24.378
Answer that question for yourself,
and find out how exactly we would go

9
00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:30.250
about testing a synchronous value versus
a synchronous value, so on and so forth.

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.120
Cool.

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.719
So, if you, I'm gonna give you
a little bit time to download NPM and

12
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.088
install all that fun stuff.

13
00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.310
There are instructions
on the site as well.

14
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.272
If you just wanna run the tests for

15
00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:48.971
creating observables which is where
we're gonna be doing this next exercise,

16
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:52.070
you just run NPM test creating
only run those tests.

17
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.763
You do need to un- skip them, and

18
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.920
then we will kind of go
through them each together.
