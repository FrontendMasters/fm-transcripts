00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:00.938
So with that,

2
00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:05.680
what we kind of wanna do is see if we
can get that working with our counter.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.760
Because we have a lot of
the infrastructure in here.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.468
We had a play in a pause button,
we had an observable that we care about.

5
00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:15.028
What we wanna do is now take,

6
00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:19.003
we wanna merge together those two
buttons in our basic counter, right?

7
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.737
And then we wanna switch between
that interval observable and

8
00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:26.346
never based on the given state
that we're in at a given point
