00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.881
So your mission is to get comfortable with
some of these basic data manipulation

2
00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:05.686
operators.

3
00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:08.668
We have a kind of a series of
tests that we're gonna go through,

4
00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:12.100
just to kind of understand and
seeing just, again, like I said before,

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.795
sometimes the syntax is a little bit
different from what you might be used to.

6
00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.852
So this will kind of allow you to get
a little bit of muscle memory and

7
00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.397
some understanding around that as well.
