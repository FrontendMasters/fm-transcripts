00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.019
So we're going to play around with
this with another quick exercise,

2
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.919
which is we have a little counter that
we're gonna build where we're gonna

3
00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.960
have a start button.

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.790
And we're going to have a pause button or
stop button.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.149
And ideally when they hit the start
button, we should start counting.

6
00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.581
And we hit the stop button,
we should unsubscribe.

7
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:29.089
Now this counter, I'm gonna warn you right
now, it's not gonna be automatic just yet.

8
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.033
We don't have all the tools that
we need to build it the right way.

9
00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:37.176
Your job is to kinda figure out based on,
other pieces of JavaScript how to get

10
00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:42.322
this to work, and then we will over
a series of other exercises this morning,

11
00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:47.728
we'll add more and more functionality,
and we'll get it to be idiomatic RxJS.

12
00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:50.559
But it's not gonna be
in the very beginning,

13
00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.952
so worry less about getting it right.

14
00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:56.226
Worry about using a timer interval,
and getting it working at all.

15
00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:59.548
And then we'll kinda play around with
that, and build on it as we go along.
