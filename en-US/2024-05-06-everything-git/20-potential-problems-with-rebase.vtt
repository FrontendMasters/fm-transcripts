1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.424
We're gonna do it again, except for
this time instead of accepting ours,

2
00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:05.990
which is theirs,
we're gonna accept theirs which is ours.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.240
Yeah, so in Hello Git let's do a plus
five in remote Git, let's do a plus six.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.878
So, let's go to.

5
00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:25.344
Let's go to our upstream,
hello-git and go and do A + 5.

6
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.867
A + 5, perfect.

7
00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.037
I'm gonna go to remote and

8
00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:40.512
I'm gonna go in here and go A + 6 6.

9
00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:41.532
Okay, there we go.

10
00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:47.532
Git status awesome, git add this,
git commit a plus 6.

11
00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:48.842
There we go.

12
00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:53.382
Now we need to pull in our
origin trunk and rebase on it.

13
00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:55.922
So git pull rebase.

14
00:00:57.142 --> 00:00:58.876
Again, we have the simple conflict.

15
00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:03.132
We just need the result now and
then remember,

16
00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:05.527
we're going to choose
theirs which is ours.

17
00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:07.667
We don't want to choose ours,
which is theirs.

18
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.477
So if you open up the read me,
you'll see there's a plus six,

19
00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:12.517
which is in the there's category.

20
00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:14.867
So, erase that.

21
00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:15.717
Save it.

22
00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.687
There we go.
We've now officially done that.

23
00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:18.875
We got a status We add it,

24
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.658
if you check in status, you can see
right here all conflicts are fixed.

25
00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:27.408
run this it's waiting for you to say that
you're done, I'm gonna take this command,

26
00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:29.048
rebase continue, awesome.

27
00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:31.348
Now, we have a chance to edit our
commit message if we want to.

28
00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:32.708
I'm gonna keep it as A+6, awesome.

29
00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:41.029
So I can go git log oneline And
you can see right here, there's that.

30
00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:44.119
Here's our previous change, and
now we have the a plus six change.

31
00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:47.619
All right.

32
00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.069
This is where it just
gets kind of annoying.

33
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.209
We're gonna do this a little bit.

34
00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.149
Let's just add a new line right
below a plus six and hello git.

35
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.349
Just one new line, okay?

36
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:05.685
So let's go to Hello git open
up the readme and go new line.

37
00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:10.306
Save it, git status,
git add, git commit, new line,

38
00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:16.176
go back to remote and I'm going to
git pull this one in with a rebase.

39
00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:18.813
Now remember rebase show.

40
00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:22.392
Checks out the thing I'm going to,
replace the commits one at a time, and

41
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.103
look at this.

42
00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:26.821
We got a conflict don't fix the conflict,
just check it out.

43
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.993
Look at that.

44
00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:32.413
It's like we're all over again.

45
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:33.933
We're doing the exact same thing again.

46
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.263
We've already fixed it yet.

47
00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:38.163
Here's the exact same conflict again.

48
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:42.707
So it can A little bit emotionally
painful if you have to fix

49
00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:46.893
the same conflict over and
over and over again.

50
00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:52.373
It's almost like I wish Git you
could reuse recorded resolutions.

51
00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.493
That'd be really, really nice, right?

52
00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.818
That's me saying to your face
the The thing you're supposed to use, and

53
00:03:00.818 --> 00:03:04.192
you don't realize that I'm saying
it if you don't know about it,

54
00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:08.552
yeah, it's like the joke, you get it,
it is like right there, it's pretty funny.

55
00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:12.612
All right, anyway, so
we see, this stinks, right?

56
00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:16.859
And so we could fix the conflict,
don't actually commit it,

57
00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.697
let's fix the conflict.

58
00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:22.097
To the point where we have
A+6 plus the new line, right?

59
00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:24.397
So I'm gonna have to merge
those changes together, right?

60
00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:29.037
So I'm gonna have to go delete that,
delete this, and then move that one down.

61
00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.987
Kind of stinks, right?

62
00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:34.870
This is where things really get crappy
when you have conflicts like that,

63
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.837
because then they get
really hard to understand.

64
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:43.406
All right, so we're not gonna resolve yet.

65
00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:47.536
By the way, does this make sense
now with how rebase works?

66
00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.726
Do we all understand why this happened?

67
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:55.528
The replaying of commits where we're gonna
conflict, add infinitum cuz we're just

68
00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:59.422
replaying something that has changing
the same Plays twice, remember,

69
00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:01.135
it always replays one at a time.
