00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.950
Creating a repo,
it's pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.530
A lot of people probably have
never actually created a repo,

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
they've always just cloned from
somewhere and worked on something.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.700
So if you've never done personal projects
you may have never created one or

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.403
if you always create it first on
say GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket,

6
00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:17.810
then you'll probably clone down from it.

7
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.287
Sorry, it's weird phrase to
leave my mouth, BitBucket Cloud.

8
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.487
So the very first step is Git init.

9
00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:26.133
Use Git init, to initialize Git.

10
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.257
It will add a .Git folder
inside the directory.

11
00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:33.387
And that's how you know it's a Git repo.

12
00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.473
So first problem,
I want you to go somewhere and

13
00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:38.977
I want you to create your first repo.

14
00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.867
You can name it whatever you want,
I named this one myfirstgitrepo.

15
00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.043
And by the way, for those that are like,
OK, I already know all the stuff I wanna

16
00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:49.307
move on fast, trust me, we're gonna
go really deep, really quickly.

17
00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:52.797
I just wanted to make sure we're all on
the same page with the exact same repo.

18
00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:57.755
And so I'm gonna go Maketer my first repo,
my first repo,

19
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:02.384
and I'm gonna go Git, that was Git init.

20
00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:03.012
There we go.

21
00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:07.606
And long as you have everything properly
set up, you should see this error message,

22
00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:11.421
which says, hey, by the way,
you don't have a default branch name,

23
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:13.316
here's the default branch name.

24
00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:16.323
If you wish to do something with it,
you can set your own config and

25
00:01:16.323 --> 00:01:18.944
it will magically work for
you from here on out.

26
00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:23.301
So everyone should get this error message
if you have the same setup that I do.

27
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:27.098
So every single repo comes
with this .Git folder.

28
00:01:27.098 --> 00:01:30.441
This is where all
the data structures kept.

29
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:35.179
Now it's kinda weird because a lot of
people probably think of data structures

30
00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.978
as things that run inside of a program,
a tree, a hash map, but

31
00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:42.550
you can also keep them just in files,
right?

32
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.330
You got a question.

33
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.188
&gt;&gt; If you accidentally initialize that Git
repo too high like at a parent folder,

34
00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:51.600
what's the best way to revert this?

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.350
&gt;&gt; The best way to revert that,
delete the Git folder, right?

36
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.840
Once the got Git folder has been deleted,
the repo does not exist.

37
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.976
All of Git's history is
inside this .Git folder.

38
00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:07.556
So you delete that,
you don't have a repo anymore.

39
00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:08.764
All right, problem.

40
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:13.591
Validate you have a new Git repo by
listing out all the files inside the .Git

41
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.936
folder or directory.

42
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:21.029
Whatever one you wanna use, I've been
in fact in one sentence just earlier.

43
00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.534
I said folder in your directory and
I just realized how many people

44
00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:28.149
are they're just shook by the fact
that I'm using those terms.

45
00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.985
I just love it.

46
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.490
All right, so if you don't know you can
use fine so if I go find out gifts,

47
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.859
it will list out everything.

48
00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.019
And you'll see a whole
bunch of stuff in here.

49
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.520
You'll see a bunch of
informational tracking items, and

50
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.431
then you'll also see a bunch
of sample scripts right here.

51
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.541
I'm not gonna talk about hooks today,
I think hooks are evil.

52
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.161
Don't use hooks that's
my personal opinion.

53
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.882
We're just not gonna cover them,
if you wanna learn about hooks,

54
00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:54.037
go read right here you have a bunch of
sample stuff they will just make your life

55
00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:55.451
miserable personal opinion.

56
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:56.631
Don't use hooks, okay?

57
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:00.103
That's what your CI is for, that's your
responsibility to test your own code,

58
00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:01.492
don't be ridiculous.

59
00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:02.638
All right.

60
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.792
A lot of people have really strong
reactions when it comes to hooks,

61
00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:09.572
either they absolutely love them or
they hate them.

62
00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:10.912
I'm on the hating camp.

63
00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:16.581
You may not like this, but
this is what peak empty repo looks like,

64
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:20.343
just a Git folder with
a bunch of files in it.

65
00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:24.249
So, this was kind of mind blowing to
me the fact that Git is in some sense

66
00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.043
stateless, like when you run Git,
it has to go, okay, where am I?

67
00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:29.773
It has to find the .Gitfolder.

68
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:33.875
It has to look for that stuff and
then it can tell exactly what's happened

69
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:37.233
inside this directory by
looking in the Git folder.

70
00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:41.280
And so that was kinda like a neat
revelation to me that it is its own entity

71
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.963
like that.
