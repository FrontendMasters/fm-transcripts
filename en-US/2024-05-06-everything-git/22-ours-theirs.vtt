1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.281
So we're gonna to talk about Ours and

2
00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:02.850
there's you've heard me
say this multiple times.

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.500
Now Ours is Theirs and
Theirs is Ours with rebase.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.387
Whereas it's the opposite for merge, so
long as you have one of those correct,

5
00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:11.770
you'll get the other one correct, or
you can just remember how rebase works.

6
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.760
So sometimes you just wanna be
able to pick just one side.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.931
You don't wanna have to go through and
manually resolve.

8
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:23.600
Each one of the things you just wanna say,
hey, file or

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.061
change A is better than change B,
I just want change A, right?

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.564
By the way, there's a very well-known
Netflix person named some coding guy, and

11
00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.291
he even says that Ours and
Theirs is like the worst thing to get.

12
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.361
So it confuses everybody.

13
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:42.433
So if you feel kinda confused about it,
don't worry, you're not the only one that

14
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:47.307
thinks completely ridiculous and
also makes perfect sense, but ridiculous.

15
00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:48.465
All right.

16
00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.605
When I say ours,
I do mean our current branch.

17
00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.965
When I say Theirs I do
mean the incoming branch.

18
00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:57.712
So if you wanna select a change,
you can just simply do Git checkout--

19
00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:02.640
hours path to the file and it will just
select the entire files change set.

20
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.781
And if you do Theirs, it'll select
the entire file change set for

21
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.420
just Theirs and it's only for that file.

22
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.440
So, let's do it again,
let's make another conflict.

23
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.224
We'll do A plus 7 and Hello,
A plus 8 and remote and

24
00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:23.637
let's do a merge from upstream to resolve
it and let's choose hours with a merge.

25
00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:28.038
So I'll go to Hello, and then the ReadMe,

26
00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:33.527
A plus 7 A plus 7.

27
00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:34.527
Do it again here.

28
00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:41.137
There we go.

29
00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.873
I've done both to Hello and to remote.

30
00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.904
Now all I need to do is just simply
merge those two together and

31
00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:49.523
then we'll get the conflict so Git pull.

32
00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:52.223
Notice I'm using a merge,
I'm not rebasing awesome.

33
00:01:52.223 --> 00:01:53.673
I have the conflict.

34
00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:59.853
Now I'm just gonna simply go
Git check out Ours ReadMe.

35
00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.602
So if I do that, and I go get status.

36
00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:05.136
You'll see it still says,
both modified cuz we haven't added it yet.

37
00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.776
If I cap the ReaMe,
you'll see it's just our change.

38
00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:09.966
It did it for us.

39
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:13.866
That also means if
the remote had other changes

40
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.966
that weren't conflicted,
what is it gonna do?

41
00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:20.486
&gt;&gt; Still pull them in.

42
00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.816
&gt;&gt; It's gonna pull in everything on Ours.

43
00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:24.456
So, just think things to remember,
choosing Ours,

44
00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.878
you're choosing this experience
versus that experience.

45
00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:28.858
So just remember that.

46
00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:31.478
It's the full deal here.

47
00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:33.712
So sometimes that's why you
wanna go through hand by hand,

48
00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:35.448
select what you want.

49
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.158
There we go, pretty straightforward.

50
00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:40.318
We checked out hours, now all we
have to do is just simply merge it.

51
00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:46.527
So I'll just simply go Git, add this,
Git Commit, let's see, merged, why not?

52
00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:49.538
These commit messages are just
getting worse as the day goes on,

53
00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:51.507
which really represents true using Git.

54
00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:55.204
This might be the most true version of
using Git is where your commit messages

55
00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.557
disproportionately get
worse as time goes on.

56
00:02:57.557 --> 00:03:00.085
It's just the worst, right?

57
00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:01.790
All right.

58
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.004
So we can do a quick little log.

59
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:07.914
I can go get log one line graph and
we'll just do like the last 10 commits.

60
00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:12.181
And you can see right here,
you can see the A plus 7 over here, but

61
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:16.984
then we just merged in A8 with A plus 7,
we get the merge.

62
00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.724
So there we go.

63
00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:22.635
I mean, I always go back and
forth in some sense of whether I did.

64
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.960
Do rebase or whether I do merge.

65
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.025
In some sense I do this
piece of history right here,

66
00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:32.516
which is I get to see that these two
things happened, and we did make a proper

67
00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:36.935
change to the code in such a way and
this is the result of the conflict.

68
00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.355
I do that experience.

69
00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:43.121
I think it is a little bit more sensible
for me to understand how a bug could form.

70
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:46.826
Cuz if you have a conflict and you use
rebase, it kinda erases the idea that you

71
00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.061
even had a conflict and
it just looks like linear history.

72
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:51.651
It's kinda like a you
choose your own adventure.

73
00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:54.681
I always go back and forth.

74
00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:58.791
I can convince myself either
way to love either one, right?

75
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:01.754
As for whatever reason,
I don't seem to have a solid like,

76
00:04:01.754 --> 00:04:03.430
this is the only way to do it here.

77
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.930
It's just like, you can visit me.

78
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.150
Tomorrow, I'll be all about rebase, today
I might be all about merge for conflicts.

79
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.578
It's the life I live as an engineer,
it depends just continuously and

80
00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:16.760
ad infinitum for
all of the rest of my life.

81
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.340
Anyways, good reminder.

82
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.992
If you don't wanna mix merge and rebase,
start getting these Commit merges and

83
00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:27.368
it's very hard to keep your tree kinda
straight so you really do wanna try to

84
00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:31.674
stick with one strategy and at least
make sure they're in sync and then you

85
00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:36.852
can kinda diverge once they're in sync,
but I tend to try to never mix them both.

86
00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.769
Cuz then you just start getting
merge commits constantly and

87
00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.473
just nothing feels good it's
just trouble after that.

88
00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:48.452
So, let's merge everything up, and
make sure that our Hello Git and

89
00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:52.637
remote Git are in the exact same position.

90
00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:57.337
And then we'll start doing the next part.

91
00:04:57.337 --> 00:04:58.900
Okay.
So Git, push origin,

92
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.765
I don't know why I'm saying
the whole thing here.

93
00:05:01.765 --> 00:05:03.883
Again, exactly got owned again.

94
00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:07.523
Get checkout bar, go back,
push it up, go back, get checkout.

95
00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:09.853
Trunks I don't goof that up.

96
00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:11.423
All right.

97
00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:13.995
We're in.
By the way, if you guys are wondering how

98
00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.453
in the world am I switching
between projects so dang fast?

99
00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:18.323
This is called tmux.

100
00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:22.385
I have an entire course on front end
Master is all about how to use your system

101
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.703
well, includes Vim and all the good stuff.

102
00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:27.453
If you don't use Vim, that's okay.

103
00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:28.053
Vim's awesome.

104
00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:30.503
It makes me entertained.

105
00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:32.773
I know most people don't like it,
but hey, I think it's great.

106
00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:34.893
All right, so
we're gonna do the exact same thing again.

107
00:05:34.893 --> 00:05:39.082
We're gonna create another conflict
with this A plus 9, A plus n add, add,

108
00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:43.270
by the way, forgot to say that,
there we go, add SEC rules now, wait, FEC,

109
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.190
which one is it?

110
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.566
Anyways, one of the governmental agencies,
you have to say add after things,

111
00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:50.880
I don't know.

112
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.016
Anyways, all right, so
let's do A plus 9 in Hello,

113
00:05:54.016 --> 00:05:57.589
let's do A plus 10 in remote,
don't laugh at me, [LAUGH].

114
00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:03.070
And do those two, and then let's do a
rebase, and then let's try to select Ours.

115
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.169
Let's just really drive home the point
that Ours is Theirs and Theirs is Ours.

116
00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.999
Even though we should already be there,
but let's just do it anyways.

117
00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:13.163
So I'll go back to Hello,
I'll open up ReadMe,

118
00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:18.038
set it to 9, Git add this,
there's no file name there,

119
00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:22.913
Git commit, A plus 9,
switch over here, then ReadMe,

120
00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:27.242
10 Awesome.

121
00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:28.036
Okay.

122
00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:33.192
So now if I get a whole, Rebase,

123
00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:38.126
we have the conflict, get check out Ours.

124
00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.916
Remember, we're doing
Ours here on purpose.

125
00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:44.370
If we do that, and then we can Cat
out ReadMe you'll see right here.

126
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.141
We selected Hello Git,

127
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:50.840
we did not select Ours cuz we
selected Ours, which is not Ours.

128
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.360
Okay, good.

129
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.556
I just wanna really make sure we,

130
00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:58.630
we really are all fully on the same page
here, so it's just such a goofy part.

131
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.907
So there we go.
So that means if you're gonna do this,

132
00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.931
we need to select Theirs.

133
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.171
So I believe I do a little
change right here.

134
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:06.671
We do this whole Ours as Theirs business.

135
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:09.881
Okay, so let's just check out and
use Theirs instead of Ours.

136
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:14.611
I'll go Git checkout Theirs ReadMe.

137
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:15.711
There we go.

138
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:18.781
So now when I cat that one out,
you'll see it's our change.

139
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:22.298
Awesome, Git add it, Git rebase continue.

140
00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:23.179
Fantastic.

141
00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:29.078
We've now done it, we've selected Ours,
and we have our changing.
