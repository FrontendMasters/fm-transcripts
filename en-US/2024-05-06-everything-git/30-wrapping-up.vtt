00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.533
I'm curious Prime's thoughts on large
files slash LFS since it isn't covered

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:10.980
in the content and any thoughts on
squash merged, keep repos smaller.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't care about the size.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.460
So there's two questions in there and
they're kinda both the same.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.454
So get large files at
the store is just like it's,

6
00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:20.530
it's it does some of efficiency.

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.598
So the thing that's happening if you
didn't notice that we could go and

8
00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:26.330
restore every commit having
every pointer to every file.

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.660
Now, we can restore those files,
those files were compressed and all that.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.768
So if you're storing like 100
megabyte image, it's gonna go and

11
00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:34.460
it's gonna compress this and
then you have to download it.

12
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.579
There's a lot you have to download,
so get a large file store just,

13
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.222
Effectively is an optimization for

14
00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.910
larger Files, which are just a huge
pain in the ass when it comes to Git.

15
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.407
That's why people argue
why Perforce is better,

16
00:00:45.407 --> 00:00:49.200
is actually specifically about large
file storage and binary assets.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
But now with Git, whatever it is,
large file store LFS, it's better.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.820
As far as history size, I don't think you
should really care about history size.

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.930
History is free, right?

20
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.747
I just like to have it clean,
so when I'm doing a revert,

21
00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:03.646
I don't shoot myself in the foot.

22
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:09.076
I really don't wanna revert like a six
item change with a bunch of merge commits.

23
00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:10.256
That's what I don't wanna do.

24
00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:13.166
I just wanna be able to just say,
revert e and like that's it.

25
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.741
So that's my only argument for
why I prefer rebase over,

26
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:19.507
it's cuz I inevitably bet against myself.

27
00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:27.468
&gt;&gt; Outside of just some of the techniques
you covered here for your own repo.

28
00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:32.368
Is there anything that you'd recommend for
people who contribute as far as working

29
00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:35.945
with forks and just contributing
to open source in general?

30
00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.616
&gt;&gt; Contributing their open source?

31
00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:42.567
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the question's more like,
is there any techniques here that you use

32
00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:46.314
to, when you're working with your
phone and pushing it back or

33
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.233
submitting the PR back to
some open source repo?

34
00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:52.203
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think everything I
already stated is exactly it.

35
00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.733
I try to do one commit,
make it really nice.

36
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:59.206
I try never, if I can, I try to never
make a change ever above about 150 lines.

37
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:03.837
There's some studies that suggest that
people will rubber stamp significantly

38
00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:05.888
higher rates if you add more lines.

39
00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:08.758
There just comes a point where
you can no longer review well.

40
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.295
So if you can keep things small and
do more reviews,

41
00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:12.888
it just makes life a lot easier.

42
00:02:15.378 --> 00:02:19.922
So that's my only real thing is, if you're
gonna be contributing to open source A,

43
00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:24.024
there's been a lot of angst over open
source commits in the last few months.

44
00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:25.914
So don't just make dumb commits.

45
00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:27.723
That's a good thing to do.

46
00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:32.884
Don't be mean, remember it's all free.

47
00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:34.534
No one's getting paid out there for
open source.

48
00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:37.456
I mean, they might be getting
paid like $20 a month, but

49
00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.746
that's not enough to
really be happy with it.

50
00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.713
&gt;&gt; And
just to follow up to the env question,

51
00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.347
what's a good way to handle env files?

52
00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:51.245
If you want everyone to have a base
template, but make their own changes,

53
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.517
do you add it to the repo?

54
00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:54.429
And then.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

55
00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:58.977
you can add it to the repo with like
a default one, save it, then ignore it.

56
00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:01.944
So then it's there, and
no further changes can be had.

57
00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:04.194
There's strategies, right?

58
00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:06.455
You can have the whole
like env template or

59
00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:10.214
whatever, and env default and
then you just copied over into yours.

60
00:03:10.214 --> 00:03:13.893
But that's all organizational stuff.

61
00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:17.904
&gt;&gt; All right
&gt;&gt; I always do like env-something.

62
00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:20.079
By the way, great,
also great plugin by the way.

63
00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.978
Great great great vim thing I don't
know if you guys know about this but

64
00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:26.109
wait, hold on.

65
00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.888
Chad stack that was using COBOL.

66
00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:31.021
If I go like this and by the way,
if you guys don't know,

67
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:33.689
you can get plugins so
that if you have your env,

68
00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.959
it will automatically put
little stars right there.

69
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.117
If you ever accidentally don't want, you
never want this thing leaked ever or for

70
00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:42.565
any reason,
it's always good to have this thing on.

71
00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.995
And so if you're in an env file,
it'll just always do that.

72
00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.265
You can just do a little cloak doggle and
boom, right there.

73
00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.655
And it's a fun little thing.

74
00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:53.275
If you don't have that,
I always recommend having that.

75
00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.855
Cloak, I think it's named cloak for
both VS Code and Vim.

76
00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:58.992
It's a good little plug and a half.

77
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.408
I just wanted to mention Vim more,
if possible.

78
00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:06.612
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'd love to talk to you about how

79
00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:09.843
your life can improve by using Vim.

80
00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:11.463
Is it possible to have
a personal gitignore?

81
00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:12.093
Someone's asking that.

82
00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:13.795
There is, right before we go,

83
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.813
there's actually a file inside
of git that you can do.

84
00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:20.297
So if I go like this here,
I'll try to do this really quickly.

85
00:04:20.297 --> 00:04:21.167
I'll just go like this.

86
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:24.757
I'll create a file like this, it's
some sort of divorce hack file, right?

87
00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:25.797
So it's right here.

88
00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:28.977
It's this thing right here,
get/info/exclude.

89
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:33.563
So if you add it to the git/info/exclude,
it's a gitignore but only for you.

90
00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:42.280
So if I save this, it's It's gone,
but nobody else gets it.

91
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.530
It's one of those like super secret ones,
but that's one of them.

92
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.645
There you go.
This is everything I think you need to

93
00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:49.590
know about, gets to be useful at your job.

94
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.090
Everything else is,
I don't think you need, just real facts.

95
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.690
There you go.

96
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.205
That's it.

97
00:04:56.205 --> 00:05:01.933
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
