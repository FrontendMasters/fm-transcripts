00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.894
All right, hello, is everybody ready?

2
00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:03.630
No, yes?

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.814
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I want more, come on,

4
00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:06.489
a little bit more, a little bit more.

5
00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:10.148
&gt;&gt; Yes.
There we go, all right, we're excited,

6
00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:11.218
there we go.

7
00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:12.994
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

8
00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:13.575
&gt;&gt; Everyone,

9
00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:15.207
we're gonna do a Linus chad now.

10
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.586
I actually heard a really great
quote before all this which is,

11
00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:22.694
Git was only invented so that the rest
of us could be nearly as smart as Linus.

12
00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:25.668
Because he is that good,
he can hold all of Linux in his head

13
00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:29.351
with revisions while the rest
of us are just mere mortals, so.

14
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:33.801
But for this grand course,
I did want to be a bit more professional.

15
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:38.437
So we're gonna undone the black hoodie and

16
00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.962
put on regular normal clothes.

17
00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:43.982
All right, so
I just think that's fantastic.

18
00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:45.479
So all right, so who am I?

19
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.452
For those that don't know,
I stream on Twitch, I make YouTube videos.

20
00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:53.292
I do handcrafted artisanal memes
every now and then on Twitter.

21
00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:54.412
I don't have a link there.

22
00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:57.622
I made this logo with ChatGPT,
it got so close.

23
00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:00.297
It's just so close, yet
it's just so far away.

24
00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:04.257
Also, those ones as well are from ChatGPT,
so pretty fantastic.

25
00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:06.278
So the goal here is to teach you Git well,

26
00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:08.607
it's not gonna go over
every single command.

27
00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:12.043
I don't know if you've ever played
around with the man docs, but

28
00:01:12.043 --> 00:01:16.237
there's about 147 different
commands you can put into Git.

29
00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.012
We'll go over 13 of them.

30
00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:20.757
We're gonna get pretty far into it, but

31
00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:24.404
the last 1% of knowing Git
is extremely difficult.

32
00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:28.574
You don't ever have to know it, I've
literally not touched most things in Git.

33
00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:32.218
There's just enough to make you good,
and that's where we want to be,

34
00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:36.314
is we want to be pretty dang good and
understand why they exist.

35
00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:39.094
All right, so before we git,
by the way, you should man.

36
00:01:39.094 --> 00:01:43.424
If you don't know what man is, man is the
manual pages for any kind of Unix system.

37
00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:46.372
So if you just jump in your terminal and
type man man,

38
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.134
you will see a bunch of
manual pages appear.

39
00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:50.934
It's really important to
be kind of good at these.

40
00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:55.157
You don't even have to be great at them,
just kind of good, because everything

41
00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:58.764
you need to know about Git is for
free and on your system at all times.

42
00:01:58.764 --> 00:01:59.849
You don't even need the Internet.

43
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.348
If you're on an airplane,
you can just man git whatever command and

44
00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:05.199
you'll read the manual page for it.

45
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:08.664
So it's always fantastic to have
the manual in the back pocket and

46
00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:10.239
just kinda know how it works.

47
00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.052
So if everyone can open up the manual for
a quick second and check it out.

48
00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:18.329
By the way, if you ever want to, you can
always do a man git-, press some tabs.

49
00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.589
And if you're on Zish,
you'll see that it has, like I said,

50
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.806
literally 147 possibilities there,
quite fantastic.

51
00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:28.889
So if you have man open, and
you've never used man before,

52
00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.348
j goes down a line, k goes up a line.

53
00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:35.044
d goes down a half page,
u goes up a half page, / or

54
00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:39.403
forward / any word will search for
something.

55
00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:42.047
n goes to the next search
term after you press Enter,

56
00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:45.363
capital N goes to the previous
search term after you press Enter.

57
00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:48.109
So now that you see this,
you probably think, okay,

58
00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.683
maybe Vim shortcuts aren't
like all that crazy.

59
00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:53.393
Maybe this has some precedent,
you're probably right.

60
00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:57.073
No one knows where F came from, but
the rest of it probably makes sense.

61
00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:02.173
All right, so quick exercise,
in man pages, you see bold terms.

62
00:03:02.173 --> 00:03:07.073
I want someone to find what is a bold
term, what is it's definition.

63
00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:12.933
Use the man pages, use man man to find
out why a man page has bold terms.

64
00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.916
So you can search, you can peruse
&gt;&gt; / bold,

65
00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:20.559
first result is bold text,
type exactly as shown.

66
00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:21.672
&gt;&gt; Correct, all right, so

67
00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:25.179
there's a bunch of different ways you got
to read commands out of the man page.

68
00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.391
You'll see kind of specified with italics,
with brackets,

69
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:33.659
with dot, dot, dot, ellipses,
all that kinda stuff.

70
00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.609
And so when you look at a man page,
everything has a meaning.

71
00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.208
And so this is just kind of your intro,
if you forget how a man page works,

72
00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:41.001
use man man.

73
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:42.811
You can go over it, you can look at it.

74
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:45.101
It's always in your back pocket,
fantastic to have.

75
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.491
And so there you go, bold text literally
means to type exactly as it's shown.

76
00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:53.389
So if you look at the man page, you'll see
something like man -k, and that shows up

77
00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.141
in all bold, and then you'll see the rest
of it kind of telling you how to use it.

78
00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:58.376
So that's how you use a man page,
fantastic.
