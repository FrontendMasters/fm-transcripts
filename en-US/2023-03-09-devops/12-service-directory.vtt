1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.762
So what I wanna do now is just I
want to as the other part of DevOps,

2
00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:05.909
take this, and

3
00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:11.396
build something out of it that actually
shows us how we get to what we need.

4
00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:16.364
So to do that, [LAUGH] we're gonna have
to basically go to the command line, and

5
00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.167
this is where we get to
start working [LAUGH].

6
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:24.951
So there's gonna be a couple of things
that I wanna kinda start with here,

7
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.775
and the first one is just
going to be a directory,

8
00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.497
a place where I can put all of this.

9
00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.800
Now I'm in a folder right
now in a repository,

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.709
where I have all of my slides and
everything like that.

11
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:42.895
But inside of this,
I have now created two new directories.

12
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:46.020
My first directory I'm calling
service directory, and

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.698
the second one I'm calling
service templates.

14
00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.706
Don't worry about service templates,
we'll get to that in a second, but

15
00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.688
let's focus on service directory.

16
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.373
Just out of curiosity by the name itself,

17
00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:00.837
can anyone maybe give me
an idea of what this might do?

18
00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:07.000
We talked about needing a way of
standardizing services, so that we have

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.965
the ability of giving off-shelf
solutions to front-ends and back-ends.

20
00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:15.130
And if we're talking about a directory,
what we're talking about is,

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.682
is a location where we can
configure everything in one space,

22
00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:23.277
and then those things will get deployed
throughout all of our infrastructure.

23
00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:26.143
And so we call this a service directory.

24
00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:30.560
Now, for anyone from my company
watching this, it's a generic term, so

25
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.211
don't get mad at me [LAUGH].

26
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:37.480
But it is, this is literally what
I use at my current job at Hippo.

27
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.087
We have a centralized place where
we tell developers you go here,

28
00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:46.293
you add what you want, and
then it will be deployed for you.

29
00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.945
And as a matter of fact,
that's another big

30
00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:55.845
thing we need to add to this is,
we need a way for

31
00:01:55.845 --> 00:02:01.784
developers, not DevOps,
to create cloud resources.

32
00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:05.543
No more asking for

33
00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:09.556
buckets in Slack.

34
00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:12.925
If this happens, you tell them no [LAUGH].

35
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.501
The main reason for that is this,

36
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:20.377
because we have opinions around
this specific thing, right?

37
00:02:20.377 --> 00:02:23.534
Our front-ends are to get a bucket,
I need a bucket.

38
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.288
Friend has already got one,
don't worry about it.

39
00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.140
I need two buckets, why?

40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.643
Right?

41
00:02:27.643 --> 00:02:31.903
That's the kind of conversations
we wanna be able to have.

42
00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:36.254
So, first thing I'm gonna
need all of you guys to do is

43
00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:39.273
basically just create a directory.

44
00:02:39.273 --> 00:02:43.018
Just create a directory where we
can kind of start working, and

45
00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:44.936
start putting all of our files.

46
00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:49.444
One other thing is we will need node,
so we will need Node.js,

47
00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:53.032
does everyone here have
node on their computers?

48
00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:53.958
All good, cool.

49
00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:54.963
Okay.

50
00:02:54.963 --> 00:03:03.494
The next thing that you
might not have is a Pulumi.

51
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:09.992
And it's actually very easy to get started
with, let me go to the documentation here,

52
00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:16.059
but we are gonna use Pulumi for automation
and i will explain why in a second here.

53
00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:22.031
But, if you can, where's the, there's
like a downloading of the CLI tool,

54
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.669
I don't know why I don't have it.

55
00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.985
I'll just google, download CLI.

56
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:31.214
Here we go.

57
00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:31.844
Cool.

58
00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:35.801
So, if you can, do me a favor and

59
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:42.265
download the Pulumi CLI
onto your computer please.

60
00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:47.147
We will need this, because we are going
to make one basic opinionation

61
00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:50.971
which is that we're gonna use Pulumi for
automation.

62
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:55.432
So yeah, the easiest way to do that is
just go to pulumi.com, forward slash docs,

63
00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:58.009
forward slash reference,
forward slash CLI.

64
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.640
And then you can download and install it.

65
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.917
If you have Brew,
you can just do Brew install Pulumi,

66
00:04:03.917 --> 00:04:06.635
you can also download
the binary if you want.

67
00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.992
I would recommend if you're using
Brew just to do it the Brew way,

68
00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.162
that's pretty easy.

69
00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:16.321
All right, so, while that's downloading,
let's talk really quickly about Pulumi,

70
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.089
and kind of what it is,
and why we're using it.

71
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:24.550
So Pulumi is basically automation
software just like Terraform,

72
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.432
or anything similar to it that
you might have heard before.

73
00:04:29.432 --> 00:04:34.565
The reason why we are using
Pulumi instead of something like

74
00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:39.401
Terraform is mostly because
of what we said right here.

75
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:44.527
We need simple interfaces that allow us
to pull off off-the-shelf deployments for

76
00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:46.629
a specific service type, right?

77
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.515
So what we literally wanna do
is we literally wanna use code

78
00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:54.257
to describe what these
interfaces are gonna look like.

79
00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:59.565
Just like a function or a object of
some sort with parameters, right?

80
00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:03.855
Because what we want to do is this, we
want to give the developers that interface

81
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.684
to work with, and
only that interface to work with.

82
00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:10.302
So that when they come in here to add a
new front-end, it can easily be done, and

83
00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:11.823
we don't have to worry about it.

84
00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:15.167
They'll use the interfaces
that we decide to them, and

85
00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:18.739
then they can just add their
block of code that they need to.

86
00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:23.932
So, Terraform can do this,
I'm not saying that it can't.

87
00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:28.445
We actually do this at Hippo with
Terraform, except for, one of the reasons

88
00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:32.694
why I like Pulumi is that it includes
all of it because it's a language.

89
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:35.370
If you were to do this with
something like Terraform,

90
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.473
you'd find yourself in a scenario where
you have to do a lot of auto-generation,

91
00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:41.742
because Terraform is
not really a language.

92
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.355
It's a DSL or
a Domain Specific Language, and

93
00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:48.047
so there are things that you just
can't achieve with it, right?

94
00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:52.467
We want to lean on a generic
language to be able to start

95
00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:55.920
creating these interfaces that we need.

96
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.920
So we're gonna do that, and you might need
to do one other thing, which is you might

97
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.436
need to do an npm install -g for
typescript, and then I believe it's tsc.

98
00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:11.408
So make sure that you do run that as
well so that you do have typescript,

99
00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:15.879
because we are technically
using typescript here.
