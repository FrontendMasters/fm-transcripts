00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:03.009
Let's do something a little
bit more complex now,

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.214
which is let's do our circleci.yml.

3
00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:10.812
Now I have a circleci.yml that I can use,
and I'm gonna just show it to you,

4
00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:15.188
but it's not gonna be directly
related to any type of tool,

5
00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:18.798
it's actually gonna be
related to automation.

6
00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:23.019
So I run all of my
automation in the cloud,

7
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.755
as I'm sure most of us do, however,

8
00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:32.559
I have made a decision to use
Pulumi everywhere, right?

9
00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.493
So what that means is if I've
made a decision to use Pulumi,

10
00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:42.046
I can also make decisions on
how jobs run in CI, right?

11
00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:47.401
And if we look at this configuration, for
example, this is a circleci configuration.

12
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.212
You'll see that I have an orb at the top,

13
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:53.949
the TLDR on orbs,
it's a reusable way of using code.

14
00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.764
It helps me so that I can use
the AWS CLI with their orb or

15
00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:01.452
their package essentially.

16
00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:04.486
So that's the only thing
to take away from that is,

17
00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.535
this just makes it so
I have AWS CLI available to me.

18
00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.802
The next thing, log into ECR.

19
00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.808
This is a Docker file, right?

20
00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:15.979
We're gonna use Docker files
pretty much everywhere.

21
00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.288
So we need a standardized way
of authenticating with ECR.

22
00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:24.128
Think about how many
configurations you've made,

23
00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:27.618
where you had a ton of
boilerplate you had to do,

24
00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:31.910
just to get it to work and
authenticate and all that stuff.

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.226
Here, you just get it out of the box.

26
00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.496
We know you need to connect to ECR.

27
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.414
So add that to the template so
that you have it.

28
00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:44.266
And so then we start talking
about build steps, right?

29
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:48.906
And so if we start looking
at this you'll notice that

30
00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:53.553
I have heavily standardized
how some of this works.

31
00:01:53.553 --> 00:01:58.003
But what we can do to kind of make
it fit for our circumstance is

32
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:02.914
instead of this saying SHA circle CI,
whatever, let's do this.

33
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:10.246
Let's say this is actually gonna
be the service name, Right?

34
00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:16.105
And then this will be the service name.

35
00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:20.160
As a matter of fact, there's more
places we can do that because look,

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.302
[LAUGH] I've got a bunch of names in
my configuration all over the place.

37
00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:26.524
So how can we fix that?

38
00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:29.240
Altf4llc pulumi github.

39
00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.916
There.

40
00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:42.273
Now, I can even inject image names into my

41
00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:47.380
configuration based off
of the standardization

42
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.622
of service names and
stuff like that, all right?

43
00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:02.178
And so then you'll see here after
we've got basically our job,

44
00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:05.372
so our first job is our build job, right?

45
00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:08.696
It sets up our AWS CLI for us, right?

46
00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:12.785
It installs just or some other
things that we need, but then again,

47
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:16.946
the main point here is is that we're
passing in the service name of our

48
00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:20.633
choice so that when we build it,
we just build this service.

49
00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.371
We don't wanna build a different
service with a different name or

50
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.727
anything like that,
we wanna just build this service.

51
00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:30.338
And after we build this service and
push that image right here,

52
00:03:30.338 --> 00:03:33.649
right, then we wanna
reuse that image here.

53
00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:40.836
But I don't know what the service
name is gonna be for the image.

54
00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:48.367
However, we standardized in service
directory how we name things.

55
00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:52.822
So because we standardize how we name
things and on top of it, we know that in

56
00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:57.565
service directory we'll get a registry
repository, right, now we can expect

57
00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:02.623
where our images are gonna be and automate
around it without being worried about it.

58
00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:10.408
Okay, and so, again you can see here is
our refresh, our preview and our update.

59
00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:12.460
Everything else is just
pretty much straight-forward.

60
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.036
So, again what we're really trying to
do is, we're just trying to look for

61
00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:21.256
anything that have Pulumi GitHub or
anything that made this unique and

62
00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:25.643
we're making it into a generic template
that we can then reuse, right?

63
00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:31.465
And so now what we'll do,
is we'll go here,

64
00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:35.451
and just like the dockerfile,

65
00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:40.065
circleci, circleci yml, right?

66
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.867
And then here circleci.yml
cuz we wanna create the file,

67
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:56.359
and then this is gonna
be the circleci render.

68
00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.683
I think I spelled that right,
circleci.yml.

69
00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:01.889
Yeah, is it yml or ymal?

70
00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.858
Yml, okay cool, all right?

71
00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.179
There it is, DevOps course.

72
00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:18.873
DevOps course.

73
00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:22.563
The image, DevOps course, right?

74
00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:26.078
The image, Devops course.

75
00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:29.737
Now you don't even have to
write configuration CI anymore.

76
00:05:29.737 --> 00:05:34.301
[LAUGH] So, as I said,
what is the purpose of this?

77
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.161
Is it to show you something cool and
just wow you?

78
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:42.011
No, [LAUGH] the main purpose of
this is to hope that you can see

79
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.386
how you can use programming
to save you time, right?

80
00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:51.196
It's not just about making features and
things like that when it comes to DevOps.

81
00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:54.037
It's about looking at
the time we're spending and

82
00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.483
making sure that we're utilizing
that time appropriately.

83
00:05:59.933 --> 00:06:02.546
I'm sure all of us can sit,
again, [LAUGH] here for

84
00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:05.659
hours at sitting around
configuration files and would have

85
00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.847
loved to just be able to hit up DevOps and
be like, can I just auto generate this?

86
00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.339
You know what I mean?

87
00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.826
Or, again, the service directory thing.

88
00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:16.201
I just want a whole front end deployment.

89
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:16.843
Okay, cool.

90
00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:20.656
Just add the configuration, you're done.

91
00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:24.445
These types of tools at Hippo,
where I work,

92
00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:29.629
have changed how we talk at Hippo as well,
because it's not so

93
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.718
much developers coming to us anymore for
help but

94
00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:38.328
they're now just coming to us for
approvals, right?

95
00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:45.754
The conversation shifted from, hey, can
we do this, to hey, can you approve this?

96
00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:50.653
And that's a lot easier than having to go
through this whole other conversation of

97
00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:52.854
like, why do you have to do it [SOUND]?

98
00:06:52.854 --> 00:06:57.761
Having these standards and
these practices that they have to, again,

99
00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:02.443
bump around, helps especially
with those kind of conversations.

100
00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:05.495
Because, again,
we say what we support, right?

101
00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:12.023
We support these docker files, we support
these CircleCI configurations, we support

102
00:07:12.023 --> 00:07:17.680
these type of deployments, and then we
basically just iterate off of them.

103
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.208
If we need more stuff in our front end,
what do we do?

104
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:25.312
We just simply add more to that, yep,
add more to the service directory.

105
00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:30.434
If we need a whole new template,
really quickly if I was to say,

106
00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:34.511
all right,
well I know some of them use a .npmrc.

107
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:38.220
Here's the best part,
you don't even have to template it.

108
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.124
You can just put it in there so
that they get it.

109
00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:44.730
It doesn't have to be a templated file,
It just simply is saying,

110
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.021
I want this CLI tool to give me everything
that a developer expects, right?

111
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:55.589
And so if we wanted to do that, right,

112
00:07:55.589 --> 00:08:00.461
we could just simply say, okay,

113
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:06.036
cool, npmrc.npmrc, and .npmrc.

114
00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:13.151
And within five seconds almost,
right, now,

115
00:08:13.151 --> 00:08:19.424
I can literally, Get an npmrc file.

116
00:08:19.424 --> 00:08:24.690
[LAUGH] And again, it's not templated, it
doesn't have anything unique about it, but

117
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.618
it's within the developer's expectations
of what they're gonna get, right?

118
00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:33.700
And on top of it,
it also takes their control away.

119
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.690
And it says,
we're in control of this file.

120
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.920
If you need it, we'll give it to you.
