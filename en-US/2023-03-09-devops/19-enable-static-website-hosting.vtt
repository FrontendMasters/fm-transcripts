WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.061 --> 00:00:05.203
So let's do this, let's go back to our
frontend really quickly and let's see

2
00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:09.372
if there's anything else that we need
really quickly before we move forward.

3
00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:13.753
So I'm just gonna get rid of this mostly
because I don't really need those

4
00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:16.592
variables, and
we also don't need getStack.

5
00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:19.164
So I'm just kinda cleaning up
the source code a little bit here.

6
00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:25.690
So at this point we have
a frontend with two buckets.

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.161
Oh-oh, [LAUGH] let me fix replica here.

8
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:35.679
A replica bucket, right,
and then a primary bucket.

9
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.151
Outside of some other things
that we would need to do, right,

10
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:44.709
let's think about one other thing
that we might wanna do here,

11
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.823
which is enable website hosting, right?

12
00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:52.510
And this is how you can actually
get even more complex with these

13
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.288
resources if you want.

14
00:00:54.288 --> 00:01:00.724
If I go back to here, and I say,
okay, I want static website hosting.

15
00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:02.088
Let me ask you something.

16
00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:06.435
Do you think it's fair for
me to go up to the developer and say, hey,

17
00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:11.321
add the policy, add the website
configuration, add everything else, and

18
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.950
then you're good to go?

19
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.613
You got web hosting.

20
00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:20.499
Basically having them add this block
themselves, do we think that that would be

21
00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:24.340
a good approach, having the developers
in the actual component source code?

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.557
[LAUGH] Probably not, yeah.

23
00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:27.829
So what are we gonna do?

24
00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.428
Can anyone maybe think of,
if we go back to our bucket,

25
00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:35.186
what might be one simple thing
that we can add that can help

26
00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:38.416
us solve that problem
with our existing bucket?

27
00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:41.907
I'll give you a hint.

28
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:45.097
It's within the DSL, or
the domain specific language.

29
00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:47.343
Basically, we just do this.

30
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:54.296
That's it.

31
00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:59.088
Adding that to the DSL now makes us
give the developer the option if

32
00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:02.853
they want to make the bucket public or
not, right?

33
00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:08.299
Again, we want the developers to be able
to use these resources on their own and

34
00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.435
give them the equivalent of bowling alley,
bumper lanes.

35
00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:16.838
We are creating the bumpers here,
oops, sorry.

36
00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:21.666
We are creating the bumpers here, right,
and that's what they bump around.

37
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:26.254
So, going all the way back to our
technical design conversation and

38
00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:28.437
everything we've had before.

39
00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:34.420
When we talk about solving problems,
especially with DevOps,

40
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.404
that's DevOps,
that three lines of code is DevOps,

41
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:43.191
the rest, any other engineer could do.

42
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:44.155
It's true.

43
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:47.942
But us saying if you want a frontend,
you have to give it a name,

44
00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:52.523
you have to assign it a product, and
it has to be known if it's public or not.

45
00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:56.452
Those are the DevOps opinionations and
standards and

46
00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:59.512
practices that we are basically adding.

47
00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.884
So now what we can do is
we can say if args.Public,

48
00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.856
right, it just becomes
a super easy change.

49
00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:16.903
And so we said that we needed
a circumstance where our frontends,

50
00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:22.472
right, have the ability of having
a statically-hosted bucket.

51
00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:25.954
Well, that's gonna be here, and

52
00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:31.846
a privately-hosted bucket,
that's gonna be here.

53
00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.899
I put true, [LAUGH] would help to do that.

54
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.127
Actually, what's a better
way of fixing this?

55
00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:38.667
Who could tell me?

56
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:41.555
Because I was just a developer and
I did a dummy.

57
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.626
&gt;&gt; The opposite of what
you're going to do.

58
00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:47.514
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's fair.

59
00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:52.454
But how could I lean on programming
language so that I make sure

60
00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:57.685
a developer doesn't run into
the literal gotcha I just ran into?

61
00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:01.523
Make it optional.

62
00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:06.252
So what we can do is instead of saying
the developer must give the boolean,

63
00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:08.478
that it's an optional argument.

64
00:04:08.478 --> 00:04:13.140
And so now what this means is this is now

65
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.237
a deliberate decision, right?

66
00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:19.700
Whereas this one is the default one.

67
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.053
So we stay on the course,
even with our sec ops and security world,

68
00:04:25.053 --> 00:04:30.802
where we are deliberately not allowing
access to anything by default.

69
00:04:30.802 --> 00:04:36.500
And then once we add that simple
public true, then we can.

70
00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:39.756
There we go.

71
00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:44.472
And so now we'll see that our FM
bucket actually is getting the public

72
00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:48.225
access block cuz I flipped it,
and our replica is not.

73
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:54.922
So let's just flip that because I am
a dummy and didn't do the right logic.

74
00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:58.046
So if not, public.

75
00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:05.172
So you can see our replica
is now blocked and

76
00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:09.694
it's not accessible via the Internet or
any kind of public access.

77
00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:13.423
But our other bucket is,
at least doesn't or

78
00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:17.459
it doesn't have that
public access block on it.

79
00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:24.181
However, we're not done yet, because all
we've done is just remove the replica.

80
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:27.865
Now what we wanna do is
just we wanna actually

81
00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:31.956
add the rest of the configuration here,
right?

82
00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:35.246
And so you might be like,
well, that's interesting,

83
00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:37.125
do we wanna reuse the same bucket?

84
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.778
Do we wanna create a new one?

85
00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:41.023
It's up to you.

86
00:05:41.023 --> 00:05:46.039
What I would suggest doing is trying
always use the same resource and

87
00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.503
then write logic around that, so

88
00:05:48.503 --> 00:05:53.349
we are doing this kind of configuration
when we need it approach.

89
00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.369
So if we go back to this bucket, right,

90
00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:01.493
we'll see here that there's a few
variables that we care about for

91
00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:07.465
both of them, the ACL, the policy, and
then this whole website block here.

92
00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:12.084
The website block is gonna be
specific to web hosting, right?

93
00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:16.574
The ACL is gonna be specific to both, and
I believe the policy is going to be for

94
00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:19.978
the frontend, yeah,
cuz we don't have anything there.

95
00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:25.009
So what we can do is,
because Pulumi is also typed,

96
00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.455
right, I can now say const bucketArgs,

97
00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:33.203
sorry, actually, let bucketArgs.

98
00:06:33.203 --> 00:06:35.674
And then we can start giving
it with some defaults.

99
00:06:35.674 --> 00:06:40.426
So we could say, all right, acl,
that can be private, right?

100
00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:44.218
Private by default, because remember,
we want sane defaults.

101
00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:46.728
If you set it to public by default,
well, that's your own fault.

102
00:06:46.728 --> 00:06:53.443
[LAUGH] So
then we're gonna do s3.BucketArgs,

103
00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:02.695
Just to make sure that we are typing them,
right?

104
00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:06.050
And then the other thing we want,
actually that's it.

105
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.467
Yeah, so that's it.

106
00:07:07.467 --> 00:07:13.382
So then what we can do is instead of
all this, so we can grab our tags too,

107
00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:20.996
We can now put this like this and then,

108
00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:27.430
see if we need bucket too,
sorry, put this right here.

109
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.881
So now we just say bucketArgs, like such.

110
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:36.766
However, it's still only
handling the private case.

111
00:07:36.766 --> 00:07:41.807
So what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna say if args.Public,

112
00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:49.525
Then we're gonna say bucketArgs.acl

113
00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:54.278
= "public-read", right?

114
00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:58.418
Because if it's public,
we need to give it public-read access.

115
00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:03.110
I don't know what policy they're attaching
here, I'm wondering what that is or

116
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.926
why they're doing that, but
then we'll do the website, right?

117
00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:09.697
So we'll copy this block of code here.

118
00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:16.365
And then we'll do bucketArgs.,
you see that, website, like that.

119
00:08:26.336 --> 00:08:27.289
Why don't you,

120
00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:36.785
Okay, I copied something wrong.

121
00:08:42.608 --> 00:08:44.310
No, I guess it's just how it formats it.

122
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.448
Okay, cool.

123
00:08:45.448 --> 00:08:51.526
Okay, so now if it's a public bucket,
right, we'll set the acl to public-read,

124
00:08:51.526 --> 00:08:56.166
and we'll set the website to
whatever we've got here, right?

125
00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:03.208
So now, let's go ahead and
save this, and let's do up again.

126
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:06.824
Okay, so let's do this.

127
00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:09.496
Let's look at the details, actually.

128
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:15.345
So if we look at the details, we get
a much more in-depth look of a diff,

129
00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:16.761
essentially, right?

130
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:21.494
And if we look at this diff, we'll see
that we are creating a frontend, right?

131
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:24.794
It is our devops-course-example frontend.

132
00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:29.670
We're creating our first bucket,
which is our DevOps course example bucket,

133
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.206
and this is our replica.

134
00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:35.852
We look at the replica,
we'll see that it's private replica, and

135
00:09:35.852 --> 00:09:40.021
look at this,
devops-course-example-replica-dev.

136
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:44.800
So even know, by just looking at the
bucket name, which environment it's in.

137
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.392
If we go down here, bucket,
here's our public one example.

138
00:09:49.392 --> 00:09:54.583
And look at this, public-read,
devops-course-example-dev, still same

139
00:09:54.583 --> 00:10:00.172
naming convention, right, environment,
with the website stuff set up here for us.

140
00:10:00.172 --> 00:10:03.117
So if we'd apply that,
then we'd actually get everything.

141
00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:04.497
And as a matter of fact,
I'm gonna do that.

142
00:10:04.497 --> 00:10:06.937
So I'm actually gonna go ahead and
apply this now so

143
00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:09.838
that we can take a look at what
this looks like in Amazon.

144
00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:11.896
No, that's not gonna work, sorry.

145
00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:13.842
Yes, I injected the secrets.

146
00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:17.813
Yes.

147
00:10:27.723 --> 00:10:30.000
Boom, so I've got seven created.

148
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.702
I hope my session didn't expire.

149
00:10:31.702 --> 00:10:33.166
Cool, it didn't.

150
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.361
All right, so let's do this.

151
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:37.052
Let's zoom in a little bit.

152
00:10:37.052 --> 00:10:38.176
Oop, not that much.

153
00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:44.097
All right, and then let's go to, Here.

154
00:10:46.714 --> 00:10:50.611
Now, what are we expecting
to actually see in Amazon?

155
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:53.503
Just a bunch of buckets,
[LAUGH] that's really it, right?

156
00:10:53.503 --> 00:10:54.880
So let's see if we get those.

157
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.294
So we go here, scroll down.

158
00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:00.404
Look at this.

159
00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:02.961
There's our bucket,
devops-course-example-dev.

160
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:04.386
And hey, look at that.

161
00:11:04.386 --> 00:11:09.189
It's actually saying, hey, this is public,
you might wanna be aware of that.

162
00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:13.508
So if we go a little bit further and

163
00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:18.302
we actually go down to, where is it?

164
00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:19.219
Website hosting.

165
00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:20.956
See, yep, there it is.

166
00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:22.645
All right, chat.

167
00:11:26.983 --> 00:11:28.711
Okay, there we go.

168
00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:36.471
Cool, now it's failing because I have
nothing in the bucket, of course, but

169
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:37.373
look at that.

170
00:11:37.373 --> 00:11:41.782
With the automation we have,
out of the box,

171
00:11:41.782 --> 00:11:46.778
developers can add a simple block of code,
right?

172
00:11:46.778 --> 00:11:47.828
I need a new frontend.

173
00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:49.223
Hey, DevOps, I need a new frontend.

174
00:11:49.223 --> 00:11:50.421
Okay, cool.

175
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.903
What is it called?

176
00:11:51.903 --> 00:11:53.371
It's called example-2.

177
00:11:53.371 --> 00:11:54.064
Okay, cool.

178
00:11:54.064 --> 00:11:55.815
What product is it for?

179
00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:57.132
devops-course.

180
00:11:57.132 --> 00:11:58.565
Cool, all right, done

181
00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:09.311
And there we go.

182
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:14.331
I have a completely separate frontend
infrastructure that I just created.

183
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:19.154
And if I go back here,
I go back here, sorry, and

184
00:12:19.154 --> 00:12:23.879
we close this, and
we'd find buckets my name.

185
00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:31.011
Now that this is done, should be
able to do devops, and look at that.

186
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:33.118
Now, I have four buckets, right?

187
00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:37.162
And they still keep that convention
of if it's a public one,

188
00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:40.663
it'll get the correct public
access that it needs.

189
00:12:40.663 --> 00:12:47.351
It'll also make sure it gets a replica
that's private, right, all that stuff.

190
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:52.133
And what's also very nice, let's say we
don't want the replica bucket anymore.

191
00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:52.918
We don't need it.

192
00:12:52.918 --> 00:12:56.524
We realize, you know what,
that was kind of an over-optimization.

193
00:12:56.524 --> 00:12:57.447
We really don't need it.

194
00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:00.907
Done.

195
00:13:06.692 --> 00:13:09.883
Now we've deployed two frontends, right?

196
00:13:09.883 --> 00:13:13.117
But I removed one resource.

197
00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:18.214
And because it's, again,
centralized, right?

198
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.561
Yeah, look at that.
Look at what it's removing.

199
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:23.902
Just the replicas and
everything related to them.

200
00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:32.168
So if I do that, I'm gonna go back here.

201
00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:37.025
Now we've just got our two.
