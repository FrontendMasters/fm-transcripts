1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.624
So, if we start from scratch and
we take the definition that we had before,

2
00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:08.228
well then what is DevOps, right?

3
00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:12.446
What is DevOps in the sense for us, right?

4
00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:15.643
And the goal of it really
is to improve the speed and

5
00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:18.933
reliability of software
releases by automating.

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.266
Parts of the software development and
deployment process, and

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.164
by fostering culture of collaboration and
experimentation among teams.

8
00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:31.007
Now, I'm gonna pause here really quickly
because one of the biggest things

9
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:36.090
that people will make a mistake of even
here is they'll jump on the automation.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.184
They won't jump on fostering
a culture of collaboration and

11
00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:42.359
experimentation among teams.

12
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.566
Because of that,
if you just do the automation part,

13
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.433
you're missing half of the solution,
right?

14
00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:52.819
This is why it's so crucial, to not just
create automating parts that help you

15
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.082
click a button faster and
move through something faster.

16
00:00:56.082 --> 00:01:00.597
But it's also good for your teams to
understand what that automation is.

17
00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:04.771
It's good for IT or QA to be able
to look at something and say, okay,

18
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.311
we automate this like this,
we're all on the same page.

19
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:13.045
We're not confused by what's happening or
anything like that.

20
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:18.862
So again, DevOps is two things,
it is first collaboration and

21
00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:22.046
essentially a joining of minds and

22
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:27.561
the second one is programming
which is the part we all love.

23
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.194
So, what is it not, right?

24
00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:33.233
We said, okay, well, this is what
DevOps is, well, what is it not?

25
00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:34.899
It's not a tool or technology.

26
00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.474
I'm gonna say it 5,000 times.

27
00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:39.838
It is not a tool or technology.

28
00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:43.262
It's not even a job title or
job description.

29
00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:47.062
I technically am not titled
as a DevOps engineer.

30
00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:49.081
I am a senior software engineer.

31
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:52.194
I did not want, in all seriousness,

32
00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:57.117
to have my title as a DevOps
engineer because that doesn't

33
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.748
really describe what I
actually represent myself as.

34
00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:07.072
I do DevOps, I follow practices and
things like that, but it's not a job.

35
00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:08.363
It's not a tool, right?

36
00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:13.886
And it's not a standalone practice of
one thing that you do versus another.

37
00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:21.126
It's a whole, again, ecosystem and
much other things as well.

38
00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:25.244
Again, I'm just gonna say it one
more time, DevOps is never tools or

39
00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.595
technologies, and thank you, Moss.

40
00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:28.451
It really isn't.

41
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:33.333
If somebody comes up to you in your
company and says, hey, we really want to

42
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:37.982
try this out to solve this problem,
then you should say, okay, cool,

43
00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:43.040
remove the technology and ask yourself
if we still have the problem, right?

44
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.892
If we could do that,

45
00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.611
then we should be able to solve
it with almost anything, right?

46
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.072
We don't necessarily need
that one piece of technology.

47
00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:53.267
So again, DevOps is never tools or
technologies,

48
00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:58.057
it's much more practice and
theory and things like that.

49
00:02:58.057 --> 00:03:00.899
It's really a philosophy
is what I'm trying to say.

50
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.811
And again, it's a mindset that emphasizes
collaboration, communication, and

51
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.048
integration between software and
developers teams.

52
00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:11.304
So if you're at a company and

53
00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.822
maybe they're not looking at
it as much of a philosophy.

54
00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:19.811
That's gonna be a barrier
you're gonna have to hit first.

55
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:24.551
A lot of companies do not fully
adapt the philosophy of it,

56
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.421
and so because of that,
not really interest and

57
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:33.186
adaption of the philosophy,
it is so hard to do anything.

58
00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:37.056
And this is something that a lot of DevOps
engineers have dealt with too where you

59
00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:39.133
want to start, you get into a new company,

60
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.986
you see all the things that
you'd like to start changing.

61
00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:46.285
And as I said before,
they're not drinking the Kool Aid.

62
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:48.164
So, what do you do?

63
00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:51.225
And this is another part of
DevOps where it's up to you,

64
00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:54.742
if you want to sit down and say,
okay, let's break this down and

65
00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:58.346
figure this out or let's just
keep doing what we've been doing.

66
00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:04.003
And that's why you have to
define your DevOps, right?

67
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.480
We're not just generalizing DevOps here.

68
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.433
We're not saying that again,
as I said before,

69
00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:10.969
it's something that you can take
from one company to another.

70
00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.212
What you're really doing
is is you're defining what

71
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:18.400
DevOps means uniquely to you and
the company that you work at, yeah.

72
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.352
&gt;&gt; So, how do you handle that fact of most
places have different understanding of

73
00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.409
what DevOps is?

74
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:30.011
&gt;&gt; Right, the easiest way to handle
that different understanding

75
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:35.312
is really just being open-minded,
being collaborative.

76
00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:38.791
If you go from one company to another,

77
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:44.026
you can't be disruptive unless
it has very good intent.

78
00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:49.819
And a good example of this is when I even
joined the company I work at now, we

79
00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.998
migrated all of our services from GCP to
AWS and we did it in about three months.

80
00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:59.083
And we're talking about 60 to 80 services.

81
00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:04.495
And think about moving
almost 400 people from one

82
00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:11.265
platform to another in three months,
how do you do that, right?

83
00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:14.216
Well, you convince them.

84
00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:17.409
That's what you do,
you sit down and you, again,

85
00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.386
break it down right out of the document,
figure out ways of getting people to buy

86
00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:27.165
into the team DevOps isn't just
programming, it's working with people.

87
00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:29.438
It's getting people on your side so

88
00:05:29.438 --> 00:05:32.708
that you can do the programming
that you want to do.

89
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:36.175
If you don't have that,
then that becomes very challenging.

90
00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:38.682
And so,
if you go from one company to another, for

91
00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:41.631
example, you want to make a lot of change,
that's good.

92
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:43.081
First, you're gonna have to get buy in.

93
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.446
First you're gonna have to get comfortable
with the people who I basically don't want

94
00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:48.654
you to break anything.

95
00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:51.374
But yeah, once you can get past that,

96
00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:56.656
then you can start defining DevOps at
the company that you work at, yeah.

97
00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:01.629
&gt;&gt; Earlier, I feel like you mentioned
something about companies trying to

98
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.679
put their own spin on DevOps.

99
00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:07.066
I'm wondering how is that different
from defining DevOps for yourself?

100
00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:11.688
&gt;&gt; Sure, so, companies putting a spin
on DevOps versus defining it yourself.

101
00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:15.911
Most companies try and define DevOps
from a marketing perspective.

102
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:21.413
So, companies like HashiCorp, AWS even,
they're focused on developer tools,

103
00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:24.645
developer productivity,
and stuff like that.

104
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:27.888
But the prompt is normally
very contrasting.

105
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:32.057
So something that you can kind of catch
is, when you're looking at a product from,

106
00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:35.513
again, any of like these big cloud
providers or anything like that,

107
00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:39.233
they're going to show you one way of
solving a specific problem, right?

108
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:43.897
But what we're saying is, is that we're
gonna start with the problem first and

109
00:06:43.897 --> 00:06:46.135
then figure out the tool to get there.

110
00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:48.368
So when you define DevOps,

111
00:06:48.368 --> 00:06:53.321
if it's being defined as a tool
that's solving something,

112
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:58.482
then that's where you kind of say,
okay, well is this for me?

113
00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:01.044
Is this actually the tool we need?

114
00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:08.131
And that is, again, what's really kind
of challenging about DevOps right now.

115
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:10.760
Listen, I love a lot of
the companies I've talked about.

116
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.929
I mean, HashiCorp is incredible,

117
00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.772
AWS as well as well as a lot of other
these companies that have, literally said,

118
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:21.415
we see what people are dealing with,
let's move quickly.

119
00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:25.666
And that's why Amazon's got
9,000 different products

120
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.550
that solve the same thing.

121
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.202
But, their hope, and this is what they
don't talk about, I think as much,

122
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.850
is that they're trying to hit
your target of your problem.

123
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.617
You know what I mean?

124
00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:39.318
And if they can do it with this one,
then they'll do it with this one.

125
00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:41.502
And if they can do it with this one,
then they'll do it with that one.

126
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:44.619
They're just gonna keep making
more tools to solve your problem.

127
00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:48.974
Whereas your problem might be quicker
solved by just sitting down and

128
00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:51.836
writing it out and being like, okay, cool.

129
00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:56.360
So, that's, I guess the contrast
between the two is one will

130
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.975
normally be focused on tooling,
solving a specific problem.

131
00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:05.159
Whereas the other one is more focused on,
how do we solve our problem and

132
00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:06.847
then find the tool for that.
