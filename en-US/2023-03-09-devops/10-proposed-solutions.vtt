1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.272
So I'm hearing what you're saying.

2
00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:07.841
And also a lot of people echoing in the
chat have like, the challenge of having

3
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:13.513
to do them the mental gymnastics of write
the code in the repository over here.

4
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:17.209
And then write down a description
of the code that you

5
00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:20.318
wrote in a completely different platform.

6
00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:21.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.610
&gt;&gt; And yes that there's some
solutions like just as you had

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.739
mentioned acknowledging that
it's important to write docs.

9
00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.100
I think that requires
a level of discipline.

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.292
And if teams for
whatever reason aren't adopting

11
00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:47.985
that level of discipline,
the problem will persist.

12
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:52.964
And th is all just that
it really resonates with

13
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:57.950
how we are approaching
solving this problem.

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.490
We're starting to stand up
a tool called Backstage

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.578
&gt;&gt; I think I know what that is, yeah.

16
00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:06.354
&gt;&gt; It was originally
implemented at Spotify.

17
00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:08.623
&gt;&gt; And building something like that.

18
00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:14.325
&gt;&gt; Yeah they open sourced a bunch of
what they've built for for internal use.

19
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:17.771
And a big part of it is
like a documentation.

20
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:23.051
Think of it like a virtual centralization
of all the documentation so

21
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:26.964
you can pull in readmes you
can pull in things static

22
00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:30.528
documentation that was
built with make docs.

23
00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:34.886
You can write your own plugins
to pull in wiki content or

24
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:39.073
you can write your own READMEs or
whatever you want.

25
00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:43.305
So that's kind of the avenue
we're exploring where we've

26
00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.088
got the fragmentation.

27
00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:50.656
How can we at least unify it so
that it makes it more easily indexable,

28
00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:55.941
but teams can still manage it in
a way that's ergonomic for them.

29
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.259
It's co-locating the docs
next to the code so

30
00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.418
that it's more likely
to stay up to date so.

31
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:03.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, wow, okay.

32
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.293
&gt;&gt; So great conversation and
reassures me that yep,

33
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:10.805
we we're listening to our customers and
we're hearing what they have to say.

34
00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:11.866
&gt;&gt; And, right, yeah.

35
00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:16.024
Okay, and this is what I love
about writing documentation is,

36
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:21.280
when you start getting comfortable with
it, you start finding yourself like,

37
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.272
okay, I'm ready for the next step, right?

38
00:02:24.272 --> 00:02:29.375
So what I would say is, what is our
proposed solution, right in this case,

39
00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:33.276
right, and
it doesn't have to be technically, right?

40
00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:37.938
But I think one of the things that we
need to propose across the company as

41
00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:43.162
an organisation is standardisation and
culture around these issues, right?

42
00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.912
And I think really
the bigger one rather than

43
00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:49.115
standardization is really just culture,
right?

44
00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:53.322
As I said before I've written
documents where it's basically been,

45
00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:55.319
hey solve a technical problem and

46
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.113
then I've had to be like yeah
this isn't a technical problem.

47
00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:00.875
[LAUGH] This is a culture problem.

48
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:04.118
You need to be able to write
that as your first line and

49
00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:08.042
be confident that you're going
to go into a meeting with that.

50
00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:12.099
Be like listen, we could do I can
make pigs fly if you want, but

51
00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.938
it doesn't mean that like
it's gonna solve our problem.

52
00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:20.898
And I do think that hands down before
going anything else culture is going to be

53
00:03:20.898 --> 00:03:21.904
a big one here.

54
00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:28.389
Whether it be culture of making sure
our co workers are creating tickets.

55
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.653
And making sure that we have like again,

56
00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:35.785
I actually love the idea
of keeping it close to the.

57
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:40.467
&gt;&gt; Essentially, contextually what you're
working on, but it's harder, right?

58
00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:41.902
And so you need to be aware of that.

59
00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:43.833
Okay, we're doing this purposely.

60
00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.874
If anybody brings up why we do this,

61
00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:50.034
it's because we want that information
to be consumed quicker, right?

62
00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:52.613
And so
that's going to be culture around that.

63
00:03:52.613 --> 00:03:57.187
The next thing I would say too is
improve standards for messaging, right?

64
00:03:57.187 --> 00:04:01.696
We talked a bit about how we
want messaging to happen.

65
00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:05.573
So we're going to need to
improve standards around it.

66
00:04:05.573 --> 00:04:10.521
Again, when a problem is raised,
making sure because

67
00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:14.940
it's not just like
an overall culture problem.

68
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.770
But we really need to make sure we're
still tackling the topics we've discussed.

69
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.342
And sometimes even though it sounds like
these may be, twice, it doesn't matter.

70
00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:26.542
We're iterating that this
is a huge problem, right?

71
00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.494
And this is impacted by that problem,
right?

72
00:04:30.494 --> 00:04:35.043
And then I would say as
well improve standards

73
00:04:35.043 --> 00:04:39.000
around linking information, right?

74
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.774
And this could be something as
simple as saying like, okay,

75
00:04:42.774 --> 00:04:46.332
we are going to decide to put
things in different places.

76
00:04:46.332 --> 00:04:48.273
How are we gonna link these things, right?

77
00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:52.952
How do we make sure that when we send
out an email that it always gets back to

78
00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:56.497
the place that it needs to get to,
you know what I mean?

79
00:04:56.497 --> 00:05:02.102
So again, this can be our emails, or so?

80
00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.421
Yeah, our emails basically,
this is our messaging, right?

81
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:09.564
And here is really where we
talk about our documentation.

82
00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:17.440
And you can see how we're kind
of addressing these problems.

83
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.646
The one that we're not going to
go into because then it gets,

84
00:05:21.646 --> 00:05:26.347
[LAUGH] It probably would make this
document 10 times bigger is what

85
00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:29.992
solution we would write our documents in,
Rright?

86
00:05:29.992 --> 00:05:35.049
I would leave that to you guys
because again, I would say we are open

87
00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:41.300
to fragmentation of documentation, but
want to provide the best tools, right?

88
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.018
Like, what did you say
it was called again?

89
00:05:43.018 --> 00:05:44.196
&gt;&gt; Backstage.

90
00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:51.221
&gt;&gt; Backstage, right, backstage to be
the GLUE of these information, right?

91
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:55.644
And I think that like this
is the biggest takeaway.

92
00:05:55.644 --> 00:06:02.206
That we need something that's going
to be the GLUE of all of that.

93
00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:06.014
And if we have that GLUE as well
as standards around linking,

94
00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:08.776
as well as standards around messaging, and

95
00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:12.522
making a good overall culture
of just documenting things.

96
00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:17.962
Then there's a solid chance that at least
it won't be as crazy as it was before and

97
00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:21.173
hopefully you can start
taking steps forward.

98
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:25.148
Again, these are very simple,
proposed solutions here, but

99
00:06:25.148 --> 00:06:29.959
this helps us at least get us in the
mindset of it's not a technical problem.

100
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:33.320
We got to fix this.

101
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.140
There anything else we feel like we
would add to this proposed solution?

102
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.708
Cool, if that's the case,
then realistically,

103
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:49.310
what you should be able to do is take
this and then take it to your team lead.

104
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.917
Take it to more friends don't just
go directly to the team with that

105
00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:56.403
because they will shred you alive.

106
00:06:56.403 --> 00:07:00.643
Yeah, I would at this point,
I would go to a coworker and be like, hey,

107
00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:02.219
what do you think of this?

108
00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.504
I would have the same conversation that we
had or that we had, and break it down and

109
00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:08.850
be like, man, I didn't think about that.

110
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.449
Go back, do it a couple times.

111
00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.737
And then by that point, we'd be good.

112
00:07:11.737 --> 00:07:13.914
&gt;&gt; Just to comment from chat.

113
00:07:13.914 --> 00:07:14.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.373
&gt;&gt; Institutional knowledge should
be treated with as much respect.

115
00:07:17.373 --> 00:07:21.783
There's tangible assets or even
revenue yeah but there's no process or

116
00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:24.605
pipeline around maintaining
cultivating and

117
00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:29.243
proliferating institutional knowledge
the whole organization suffers.

118
00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:33.162
&gt;&gt; Yep, and that is money literally
that's money that people.

119
00:07:33.162 --> 00:07:37.359
A lot of the business just doesn't
fully realize because the developers

120
00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:39.364
aren't portraying that enough.

121
00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:44.111
And saying this is money guys you're
gonna either hire somebody new or

122
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:47.092
you know I'm gonna do it for
you, but yeah.

123
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:47.775
[LAUGH]
