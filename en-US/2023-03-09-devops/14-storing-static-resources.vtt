1
00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:03.353
So let's actually start programming
now and start focusing on our problem.

2
00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.859
So if we go back here, right,
why don't we start with front ends?

3
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.603
We have store our static files
in an ingress of some type.

4
00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:13.709
And we said that basically,
in some regard,

5
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.402
we will need at least a bucket or
something like that.

6
00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:21.711
So, how I like to structure things,
and again this isn't standard,

7
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:25.815
this is just how I like to do it,
is I like to lean on two main things.

8
00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:27.866
The first one is just folder structure,

9
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:32.044
having good structure around where things
are so that you can easily access them.

10
00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:36.812
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to first create a directory and

11
00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.919
I'm going to call it resources, right.

12
00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:43.898
These are going to be what we can kinda
consider as our raw resources that

13
00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:47.630
are gonna get reused over and
over and over and over again, right.

14
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.801
And then the second thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna create a directory called

15
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.411
services.

16
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.425
Services use resources, right?

17
00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:00.587
So what we want to do is we want to
first set up a base of resources, and

18
00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:05.409
then we wanna create services that
are reusable, like a front-end service,

19
00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.494
a back-end service,
things like that, right?

20
00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.610
So we're gonna go into here.

21
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.892
And we're really just gonna delete
everything outside of the main three

22
00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.170
lines, or
actually the main two lines at the top.

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.971
So we're just gonna keep those two lines.

24
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.995
And so then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go into resources and

25
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.550
we're going to create a new file for that.

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.417
And we're gonna say file
bucket.ts because we're

27
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:33.516
automating, right, we're automating.

28
00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.792
Why do two things twice?

29
00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:39.602
If necessary, we can create one
bucket definition and make that,

30
00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:42.332
even an interface as well
that we can work with.

31
00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:46.681
And this is a common concept in Pulumi
that I'm going to introduce you to

32
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.429
called Pulumi components.

33
00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.189
Now, if you've ever worked with TerraForm,

34
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.381
you might have heard of TerraForm modules,
basically the same idea.

35
00:01:55.381 --> 00:02:00.183
Pulumi allows you to take
a series of resources, and

36
00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:04.989
then logically group them
into a component resource

37
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.820
very similar to how front end even works.

38
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.265
And so the whole idea here
is is that we're basically

39
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.587
saying we're gonna create a class
called my component, right?

40
00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:20.375
And this is going to extend
Pulumi's component resource.

41
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:21.558
Well, what does that mean?

42
00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:26.837
It means that we're literally taking the
component resource class that Pulumi uses,

43
00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:29.018
and extending it to making our own.

44
00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:32.673
After we do that we then create
a very simple constructor and

45
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:37.436
use the super to define what the actual
name of the component in that stuff is?

46
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:42.405
So if we wanted to,
we could literally just copy this.

47
00:02:42.405 --> 00:02:44.078
Go back to our source code.

48
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.010
Right, and then paste it.

49
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.859
Right, we're gonna change
a couple things though.

50
00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:00.583
First, we'll call it a fmbucket, right.

51
00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:04.074
Why would I say fmbucket,
does anyone know what fm might mean?

52
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.439
Frontend Masters [LAUGH] we want to
not just create a generalized bucket.

53
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.229
Why do we not want to do that?

54
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.161
Because if we have to
create another one later,

55
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.105
then we have to discern
between the two of them.

56
00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:24.730
You always need to understand that even
though this might seem like a perfect

57
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.458
solution.

58
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.248
Something might come up, right?

59
00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.758
So in what I try and
do with naming conventions is I try and

60
00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:34.059
focus on what's the problem I'm solving,
right?

61
00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:38.661
I wanna create a standardized front-end
master's bucket that the rest of

62
00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:39.984
the company can use.

63
00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:43.695
If they need a bucket, they use
our bucket with our parameters and

64
00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:46.139
things like that available to us, right?

65
00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.740
So we're gonna say we need a fmbucket, and

66
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.234
then it's gonna complain about a couple
of things that we need to import.

67
00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:55.106
So let's go and
do that really quickly as well.

68
00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:59.668
So we're gonna go to the top,

69
00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:05.143
we're gonna say import Pulumi from

70
00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:10.628
Pulumi and I think that might be it.

71
00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:12.417
I don't want my editors freaking out.

72
00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:15.526
Okay, there we go, cool.

73
00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:19.962
All right, so we've imported Pulumi and
we've created our very simple bucket.

74
00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:24.304
Now, again, if you've ever worked with
automation before, you're probably used to

75
00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:28.427
looking up documents and copying things
from documents and basically doing that.

76
00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:29.324
We're gonna do that.

77
00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:32.946
[LAUGH] It's not that different still,
even with what we're saying, except for

78
00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.193
we're going to give opinions around it,
right?

79
00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:37.520
So we said that our class is fm-bucket.

80
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.025
So let's go ahead and

81
00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:43.796
make sure that our component name
as well is an fm-bucket, right?

82
00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:47.133
And then let's find bucket automation,
right?

83
00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:51.082
So we're just gonna say Pulumi AWS bucket.

84
00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:58.275
And sure enough, Google, or
DuckDuckGo I should say, gives us

85
00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:03.322
the answer we're looking for, which
is we want to find a AWS bucket here.

86
00:05:03.322 --> 00:05:07.452
Now before I go any further, there's
a couple things to note about Pulumi, and

87
00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:10.056
I'm gonna just kinda give
this as a forewarning.

88
00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:15.301
When Pulumi started adopting to
basically becoming a product,

89
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:19.380
there wasn't a lot of support for
providers and so

90
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.102
what Pulumi decided to do was essentially
bridge Terraform providers to Pulumi.

91
00:05:26.102 --> 00:05:30.830
So a lot of the resources,
customization, options, and

92
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.751
things like that are in some
cases literally one-to-one to

93
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:41.445
Terraform because its generating
from the same essential provider,

94
00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:45.127
and it's creating
a Pulumi variant of that.

95
00:05:45.127 --> 00:05:49.806
And so, if you ever find
yourself in a scenario where,

96
00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:56.028
you can actually go to the Terraform
documentation [LAUGH] and find that.

97
00:05:56.028 --> 00:06:01.117
However, there are some things that
Pulumi just kinda realized that, and

98
00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:06.070
so they're now doing what they call
their classic and native approach.

99
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.552
Classic really just means Terraform or
used to be Terraform.

100
00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:14.266
Native means now we're gonna write
it in Pulumi source code and

101
00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:16.869
it's actually fully supported by Pulumi.

102
00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.595
There's no translation or
anything like that involved.

103
00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:25.321
The native packages are nice,
they're not feature complete.

104
00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:29.298
So you might find yourself in a scenario
where you get really far with one of

105
00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.533
the two, but then there's a random
attachment resource that isn't there and

106
00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:36.186
you gotta go use classic or
something like that.

107
00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:40.608
So I recommend using the classic ones for
now until you know for

108
00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.829
sure that you can move to them.

109
00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.781
Now because we did a Pulumi AWS thing,
right.

110
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.752
If we look at our package.json, we'll
actually see it's already here, right,

111
00:06:50.752 --> 00:06:51.670
it's right here.

112
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.635
So we don't have to worry
about it because we

113
00:06:56.635 --> 00:07:00.672
did the Pulumi new AWS type script.

114
00:07:00.672 --> 00:07:01.356
It set it up for

115
00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:05.118
us, it added all the stuff for us and
everything like that.and they do that for

116
00:07:05.118 --> 00:07:08.720
a few things, I believe there's
an Azure Typescript as well, and stuff.

117
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.358
So just so you know, it took care of it
for us but you might have to install this

118
00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:17.867
package if you're starting from
complete scratch or something like that
