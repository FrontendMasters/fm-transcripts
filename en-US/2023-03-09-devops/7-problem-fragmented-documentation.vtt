1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.463
I do want to do a couple of things.

2
00:00:02.463 --> 00:00:06.150
I wanna do a couple of
experiments with you, guys.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.292
Because I wanna make sure that you
guys really feel confident in making

4
00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:11.704
a technical document.

5
00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:16.871
As we kind of just said, it's a lot
of what you're gonna do in DevOps.

6
00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:20.171
It's gonna be the thing that
you start with the most.

7
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.685
So what I'd like to do is I'd actually
kind of like to do an interactive TDD,

8
00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.872
where we'll actually create
a technical document.

9
00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:34.009
We'll break it down, and we'll try and
find a solution for it, so let's do that.

10
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.866
So I'm gonna quickly hop
over to Notion here.

11
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.554
Okay, so
I don't necessarily have a problem,

12
00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:44.619
because I want to get
a problem from you guys, okay?

13
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:49.279
Now it can come from chat, it can
come from here, I don't really care,

14
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:51.621
but we just need a problem to solve.

15
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.460
And I think we all have problems to solve.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.722
[LAUGH] So I think we could find one,

17
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.313
but we really wanna try a very
simple problem to solve.

18
00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.608
This could be logging,
this could be containerization.

19
00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:05.249
It could be deployment,
could be automation.

20
00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:09.367
It could be something you deal with
at your company right now, right?

21
00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:13.614
&gt;&gt; Fragmented documentation,
perpetuating tribal knowledge.

22
00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.193
&gt;&gt; Whoo, that's okay.

23
00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:21.447
So you're saying fragmented
documentation with what?

24
00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:25.256
&gt;&gt; Perpetuating tribal knowledge.

25
00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:26.593
&gt;&gt; If I can spell that right.

26
00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:27.208
&gt;&gt; That's right.

27
00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:34.243
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I was just given a prompt.

28
00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:35.740
I'm a DevOps engineer.

29
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.736
We have fragmented documentation
with perpetuating tribal knowledge.

30
00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.854
Okay, so let's take a look at that.

31
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:48.942
First, we're gonna say, oops,
what problem are we trying to solve?

32
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:56.307
So can you give that to me in a sentence
of what the problem is, basically?

33
00:01:56.307 --> 00:02:01.325
&gt;&gt; Engineering teams are frustrated
because they don't know where

34
00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:05.988
to find answers to their problems
with their day to day work.

35
00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:15.425
&gt;&gt; Okay, so engineering teams
are frustrated because they

36
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:20.692
are unable to find information regarding,
what were you saying?

37
00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:21.727
&gt;&gt; Their day to day work.

38
00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:24.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, their day to day work.

39
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.089
Okay, engineering teams are frustrated
because they are unable to find

40
00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.157
information regarding
their day to day work.

41
00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:32.039
This is actually a very common problem.

42
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.452
I deal with it all the time, right?

43
00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:39.430
In this case,
I think it's good to start with,

44
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.422
how do we share information, right?

45
00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:45.909
So how do you share information right now?

46
00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.606
If you don't mind me
asking in this scenario.

47
00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:55.488
&gt;&gt; We've got wikis, we've got blogs,
we do email blasts,

48
00:02:55.488 --> 00:03:02.094
we've got communication
tools like Microsoft Teams.

49
00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:07.419
&gt;&gt; So okay, so like a messaging software.

50
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.207
Okay, all right, so
let's break this down a bit.

51
00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:15.737
You said that we've got wikis, blogs,
email blasts and messaging software.

52
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.989
First thing that kind of stands out
to me is what do they do, right?

53
00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.936
So in the circumstance of wikis,
what would you say the wiki does?

54
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.426
&gt;&gt; I would say generally,
our wikis contain

55
00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:38.347
our best practices for
using shared solutions.

56
00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:43.256
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, so basically,
it's focused on cross team

57
00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:47.566
knowledge and
how you guys solve those problems.

58
00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.697
Okay, cool, and what about the blog?

59
00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:54.981
&gt;&gt; Blogs are usually used
to communicate releases or

60
00:03:54.981 --> 00:04:00.904
new features being introduced
into shared solutions.

61
00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.172
&gt;&gt; Okay, and here's a question,

62
00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:10.644
with regarding to the blog,
who does the blog serve?

63
00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:14.742
&gt;&gt; Generally,
engineering teams, generally,

64
00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:18.949
individuals with a software
engineering role.

65
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.181
&gt;&gt; So this is internal.

66
00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:20.724
&gt;&gt; Yes.

67
00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:24.726
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, okay, email blasts?

68
00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:29.414
&gt;&gt; These are usually an announcement
slash call to action,

69
00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:35.177
some action is expected of teams or
it's more important that they're

70
00:04:35.177 --> 00:04:40.366
aware of some infrastructure
change that we're rolling out.

71
00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:51.086
&gt;&gt; Okay, oops,
[INAUDIBLE] that will impact, okay.

72
00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.395
And then messaging software.

73
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:59.717
&gt;&gt; These are gonna be
the individual troubleshooting

74
00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:04.295
threads that are very
difficult to parse and

75
00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:08.019
look for patterns across threads.

76
00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:16.642
&gt;&gt; Trust me, [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; We would definitely want to identify

77
00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:22.360
those patterns, tease them out so that we
can better empower teams to self service.

78
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.725
And if there are common issues,

79
00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:30.834
then we need the insight
to those common issues so

80
00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:34.710
that we can solve them for everyone.

81
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.925
Instead of continuing to just solve
one off issues for this team and

82
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:43.526
then the same kind of issue for another
team and then a third and a fourth.

83
00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:47.613
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, so would you say that a lot
of what's happening in the messaging

84
00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:51.839
software is kind of like, one-off
solutions that never get documented?

85
00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.806
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good summary.

86
00:05:52.806 --> 00:05:54.245
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, so.

87
00:06:04.258 --> 00:06:08.692
Cool, so looking at this, that's a lot of

88
00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:14.124
different places to get information from,
right?

89
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:19.486
That would be something that I
kind of immediately see already.

90
00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:24.126
I think what's really interesting is
the next thing to ask ourselves is,

91
00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.909
Which of these benefits is the most,
right?

92
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.471
So sure, we have a wiki, we have a blog,
we have email blasts and

93
00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:42.088
messaging software.

94
00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:45.514
Which one are we seeing actually
help the company the most?

95
00:06:45.514 --> 00:06:49.882
Which one are we seeing developers
actually using the most would be my next

96
00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:50.591
question.

97
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:51.568
&gt;&gt; Heaven knows.

98
00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:55.012
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's fair, okay, so.

99
00:06:55.012 --> 00:07:01.554
&gt;&gt; I think what we're frankly lacking is
a lot of metrics, like usage metrics.

100
00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:06.321
We don't know, are people consulting
the blog where we also have a lot of

101
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.458
information that overlaps
with wiki content?

102
00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:14.469
Are they just reaching out on
our messaging software and

103
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:20.237
asking teams directly instead of going and
reading the manual?

104
00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:25.606
&gt;&gt; Yeah, awesome, okay, so basically,
it seems in some ways what we're

105
00:07:25.606 --> 00:07:30.801
kind of already starting to recognize is,
we do share information but

106
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:37.069
we're not really sure if it's the most
effective way of sharing that information.

107
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:44.176
Yeah, so yeah, I think that if we
stopped here for a second, right,

108
00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:49.829
this happened actually at
my company which is ironic.

109
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:51.016
We were in the same problem.

110
00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:54.150
Again, I think this is a fantastic prompt.

111
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.998
Do you know what our first decision was
to do before we even wrote a technical

112
00:07:57.998 --> 00:07:58.619
document?

113
00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:01.476
Create a discourse because why not?

114
00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:04.385
[LAUGH] That'll solve our problem.

115
00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:05.890
And that's what we did.

116
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.330
We initially just didn't think about it.

117
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.750
And we just said, whatever,
we'll put a discourse out there.

118
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.440
Do you know what happened
to the discourse?

119
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.727
Nobody used it, never got a single
article created in it and

120
00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.720
it's probably just still sitting there
as an empty container at the moment.

121
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.506
[LAUGH] And the reason why I bring
that up is because of this right here.

122
00:08:24.506 --> 00:08:26.670
Yeah, hands down, right?

123
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:32.916
If you ask this question and
you have no idea what is even helping you,

124
00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:39.690
how do you know where to put the best
solution for the problem, right?

125
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.573
And like you said that there's no real
tracking around what's being used, right?

126
00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:50.130
You don't know if information is being
shared in multiple places, right?
