1
00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:04.587
Okay, so, what we've talked about is so

2
00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.768
far how we share information, right?

3
00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:13.408
Which of these benefits us the most,
and then basically what we prefer.

4
00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:18.070
So there's a couple things that
are still not really fully solved

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.110
here that we can talk about.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.192
Does anyone know what one
of those things might be?

7
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:26.065
Maybe what is that one unsolved
thing that's still sitting here?

8
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:28.684
I'll give you a hint,
my cursor's on it [LAUGH].

9
00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.224
&gt;&gt; Can't track what people use, I guess.

10
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:37.947
And if you're talking about a centralized
documentation platform, we've tried and

11
00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:39.226
we've used stuff like that.

12
00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.634
We don't really talk a lot about
the cons of it in this document either.

13
00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:47.037
And that once you separate the
documentation away from where the problem

14
00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:49.859
is, it becomes way less
likely to be managed.

15
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.783
And you can talk about idealistic culture,
and

16
00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:54.487
then there's also the reality of
what people use on a daily basis.

17
00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.215
&gt;&gt; Right.

18
00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:59.899
&gt;&gt; And I think that could be reflected
in this document as well, too.

19
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.733
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree.

20
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:04.063
Okay, so, let's talk about it then.

21
00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.436
We've talked about the pros.

22
00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:13.823
What are the pain-points we've dealt with,
yep?

23
00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.393
&gt;&gt; Someone in chat said
that some developers may or

24
00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.255
may not like writing documentation.

25
00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:21.358
And generally,

26
00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:26.163
it's taking away from the time that
they have to do their deliverables,

27
00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:31.622
unless there's actually time accounted for
and it's treated as a deliverable.

28
00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:32.984
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:34.135
Yeah, that's a good one.

30
00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:38.656
I can talk about that cuz it's
very similar to what she's

31
00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:40.549
talking about as well.

32
00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.463
Most of what we've said so
far is culture, right?

33
00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:48.777
[LAUGH] It really is.

34
00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:52.805
I would argue that no
company is too big for

35
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.958
two things, testing and documentation.

36
00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.093
If you're not testing,
you're doing it wrong.

37
00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:03.659
If you're not writing documentation,
you're doing it wrong.

38
00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.823
There's that whole argument of
doing test-driven development.

39
00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:09.233
Yeah, TDD, thank you.

40
00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:17.448
[LAUGH] Yeah, how many companies shoot
that down because of the time, right?

41
00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:22.768
Well, you can also argue that that time
invested can save you a lot of time,

42
00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:24.723
[LAUGH] you know what I mean.

43
00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:28.965
Having well structured tests
around them and things like that.

44
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:33.200
So, it's a fair pain-point.

45
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.026
But I would also say that
I don't if it's one that

46
00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.922
you would want to just not think about.

47
00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:46.557
The reality of this is engineering is
about knowledge sharing as much it

48
00:02:46.557 --> 00:02:48.346
is about building things.

49
00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:53.731
And I think what culturally you're
not realizing is you're not doing

50
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:58.667
justice to the team when you're
not sharing that information.

51
00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:02.751
And that's something I had to learn
in DevOps, because I went out and

52
00:03:02.751 --> 00:03:06.989
changed our whole CI platform one day,
and nobody knew what happened.

53
00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.958
[LAUGH] And then I had to spend the next
three months explaining everything,

54
00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.554
writing it down into technical
documentation and stuff like that.

55
00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:16.793
I do wanna get into some
more of these pain-points.

56
00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:19.922
I would love to know more of what your
thoughts are on those pain-points,

57
00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:22.803
cuz it seems like you've definitely
gone through them, so hit me.

58
00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:23.523
What do you got?

59
00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:26.525
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.

60
00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:30.353
This is just a general complaint
about people that they

61
00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:34.190
really hate duplication to
a point that it's flawed.

62
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.899
And that instead of just having that
information pointed at it in multiple

63
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.864
places, or like, okay,
you could have that blog but

64
00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:41.805
we also reference it in the Slack channel,
and it'll also be this email blast.

65
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:42.655
&gt;&gt; Right.

66
00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.436
&gt;&gt; That's a better way to centralize it
because you've got people who check your

67
00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.868
email, you got people who check Slack,

68
00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:49.589
you've got people who have their wiki
bookmarked and just always use that.

69
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.779
So instead of trying to force
everyone into one solution,

70
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:59.007
you could just let people trail in
their own way, whatever you wanna do.

71
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:03.023
And whenever I've used a centralized
documentation platform

72
00:04:03.023 --> 00:04:07.264
like Atlassian Confluence or
Notion, it becomes this outdated,

73
00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:11.522
disorganized mess really fast,
and nobody wants to deal with it.

74
00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:14.033
And it's just like, okay, well,

75
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.230
this is about this project that
should be near the project.

76
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.800
And if you try to make a note
documents because it was like,

77
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.249
we have this new note document and
we got to use their note documents thing.

78
00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.879
And then you don't do it in the right
places in the right circumstances,

79
00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.513
people just go, well,
I didn't really like that.

80
00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:36.136
A lot of them have terrible searching,

81
00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:38.407
so you can't actually find
what you're looking for.

82
00:04:38.407 --> 00:04:43.548
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel like you're just
talking about Confluence [LAUGH].

83
00:04:43.548 --> 00:04:44.753
&gt;&gt; I've had the same problem with Notion.

84
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:47.051
I've used both and I hated both of them.

85
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.315
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

86
00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:50.924
&gt;&gt; I don't do any of that.

87
00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.427
I search everything through Slack, and
everything that we do is through Slack.

88
00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.465
Because everything could be found
in Slack, I can search it in Slack.

89
00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:02.498
I know somebody talked about it in Slack,
it's got live problem solving.

90
00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:06.065
And the way that some people who like
more documentation than others deal

91
00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:08.996
with it is they like daily
notes about what they're doing.

92
00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:12.098
They have got their own repos where they
take notes and they upload it every day.

93
00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:15.992
And you can track their work through
entirety, and that works for them.

94
00:05:15.992 --> 00:05:17.980
And that way you're not spending time.

95
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.285
I think the complaint about developers
not writing documentation is,

96
00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:26.230
people have this idea that it has
to be this massively organized,

97
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.344
perfectly written source of thought that
is presentable to the board or something.

98
00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:32.962
That's not the point of it.

99
00:05:32.962 --> 00:05:35.889
I think if a basic person can follow it,
you're doing what you need to be doing.

100
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.129
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

101
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.965
&gt;&gt; Also if your company is not letting
you do documentation at the basic level,

102
00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:47.810
maybe stop pointing as much,
I hate points also.

103
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.164
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].

104
00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:50.148
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

105
00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:55.816
&gt;&gt; No, hey listen, I actually have not
said this live publicly yet, but I will.

106
00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:58.818
And now that everybody's watching me,

107
00:05:58.818 --> 00:06:03.595
I actually believe that pointing
ruins software development.

108
00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:08.492
I hate to say it but
it's such a random number that

109
00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:12.683
developers don't actually care about.

110
00:06:12.683 --> 00:06:16.722
I've never point at something and
then been like, yeah, I'm gonna get this.

111
00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:20.718
I don't really care,
I'm only doing it because you want me to,

112
00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.423
[LAUGH] you know what I mean.

113
00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:24.982
Super fair, yeah, super fair.

114
00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:29.441
So let's talk about these a little bit,
right?

115
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:35.527
In your mind,
why do you think we have duplication?

116
00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.844
&gt;&gt; I think a lot of
duplication serves a purpose.

117
00:06:37.844 --> 00:06:40.711
I don't hate duplication,
I think other people hate duplication.

118
00:06:40.711 --> 00:06:42.237
&gt;&gt; So why do you like duplication?

119
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:50.213
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm trying to rephrase
this in the right way.

120
00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:53.690
Instead of trying to force everything
into one little box that makes

121
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.557
sense in this one central area,
you can have things that

122
00:06:56.557 --> 00:06:59.793
are only related to the thoughts
that are relevant at the time.

123
00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:02.833
Or you could just reference that other
document, for more of that stuff,

124
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:03.630
look it over here.

125
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.440
We cover some of it, but this one is
really about how to start up the app.

126
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.100
&gt;&gt; Is that duplication?

127
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.771
&gt;&gt; A little bit,
you can cover the same topics.

128
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:14.848
I think s lot of people were like,
well, that's about this service, so

129
00:07:14.848 --> 00:07:15.813
it should all be here.

130
00:07:15.813 --> 00:07:18.375
And you're like, well, this blog was for

131
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.659
our support engineers to figure out
how to answer customer questions.

132
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:23.204
&gt;&gt; I see.

133
00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:25.909
&gt;&gt; And this blog is all about this
really just for the engineers to say,

134
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.094
this is what's gonna change
about your development,

135
00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:29.819
that doesn't need to be in the same place.

136
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:30.323
&gt;&gt; Sure.

137
00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:34.193
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the same release,
but different information for

138
00:07:34.193 --> 00:07:35.440
different people.

139
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.814
And you can reference them both and
be like, hey,

140
00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:38.372
if you're more interested in this part,
go over here.

141
00:07:38.372 --> 00:07:40.158
&gt;&gt; Go over here, yeah.

142
00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:45.151
So then would you say that really
what we hate is duplication of

143
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:48.524
documentation that says the same thing?

144
00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:49.049
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

145
00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:53.766
&gt;&gt; And we prefer to have what we'll call

146
00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:58.484
links to contextual thoughts around

147
00:07:58.484 --> 00:08:03.669
maybe problems or something like that.

148
00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:07.122
I guess what I'm trying
to get at here is just,

149
00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:12.720
we need to understand what duplication
is and how we're gonna utilize it.

150
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.219
And as I said before,
we can use any of these things.

151
00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:22.389
But we can't go into the discussion of
just saying, it works for us, right?

152
00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:26.020
We have to understand why it works for
us, right?

153
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.586
So, I guess in this mind set,
preferring to have links would be maybe,

154
00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:34.467
like as you said,
maybe there's a DevOps section, right,

155
00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:38.805
that focuses only on infrastructure
changes, right, and stuff,

156
00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:42.786
I can't spell, structure,
changes, and stuff like that.

157
00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:47.488
Maybe there's the frontend section,
right, and

158
00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:52.082
that's focused on logical
changes pertaining to

159
00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:56.579
the developers, right,
and things like that.

160
00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:03.688
So I guess one follow-up question to that
is, would we still want these to exist?

161
00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:06.772
Cuz I could still see this
in a centralized place,

162
00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:08.839
just with better organization.

163
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:14.492
Would we in this scenario,
how do we care about linking, right?

164
00:09:14.492 --> 00:09:18.814
Do we care about everything being in a
Slack thread versus, you know what I mean,

165
00:09:18.814 --> 00:09:19.840
things like that?

166
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.525
&gt;&gt; I don't care as long, as it's close
to where you're trying to use it.

167
00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.002
&gt;&gt; It's close to where,
can you define what that means?

168
00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:31.334
&gt;&gt; I am trying to run the code, but you'll
change something running locally, right?

169
00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:34.131
I don't wanna have to go to
a different app, look for

170
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:36.369
the instructions on the latest release.

171
00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:39.453
It should be near the code
that it's relevant to.

172
00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:44.244
&gt;&gt; Got you, so we're basically keeping
information as close to implementation.

173
00:09:44.244 --> 00:09:47.783
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you put it in
a totally separate area, it just.

174
00:09:47.783 --> 00:09:51.372
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I feel,
at least by that conversation,

175
00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:55.831
we have a better understanding of
what duplication is now, right?

176
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.676
And so, I would agree with you.

177
00:09:57.676 --> 00:10:01.506
I would actually say, okay,
you know what, this is a possibility of

178
00:10:01.506 --> 00:10:06.277
saying duplication is actually good, as
long as we follow these standards, right?

179
00:10:06.277 --> 00:10:10.086
Because I think one of the things
that's very easy about duplication is,

180
00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:13.231
copy paste, copy paste,
copy paste, copy paste, right?

181
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:17.237
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the caveat to that statement is,
if you're putting the exact same thing in

182
00:10:17.237 --> 00:10:21.360
two places, then it only updates in one
place when somebody updates something, and

183
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.705
then you've got different things,
not that.

184
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:27.496
I just mean, I don't hate making
the same announcement in a channel and

185
00:10:27.496 --> 00:10:28.389
an email blast.

186
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:29.767
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, absolutely.

187
00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:33.218
You got to get it to the people's eyes,
and I fully agree with that, yeah.

188
00:10:33.218 --> 00:10:40.076
I think my focus was what you said, the
other part of, cuz that is a big problem.

189
00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:45.961
Do not keep the same information
in multiple places, right?

190
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:49.696
That's really my big
frustration with it is, okay,

191
00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:52.771
I'm looking at this, okay, I feel great.

192
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:57.483
And then I read the readme, which is right
next to the document and I started it and

193
00:10:57.483 --> 00:10:59.398
it died, [LAUGH] right away.

194
00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:03.025
Yeah, that one developer didn't
realize that the readme is actually in

195
00:11:03.025 --> 00:11:03.921
the repository.

196
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:07.913
So they put it in Confluence,
sorry about that.

197
00:11:07.913 --> 00:11:13.710
That's the culture I think that we're
trying to focus on here and avoid.

198
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.403
Okay, so, really quickly,
centralized documentation,

199
00:11:18.403 --> 00:11:23.471
we'll say it can be a mess, sorry,
it can be a mess, and is lost.

200
00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:26.082
Why can documentation be a mess?

201
00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:30.400
[LAUGH] Can anyone put
that in a simple sense?

202
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.829
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No plan and disorganization,

203
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:36.208
just no maintenance.

204
00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:41.022
&gt;&gt; No planning, no standards,
no maintenance, right?

205
00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:45.034
I think that this is something
that's also massively overlooked.

206
00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:49.735
Is, you can't have a warehouse and
then not clean it and

207
00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:53.244
take care of it from time to time, right?

208
00:11:53.244 --> 00:11:58.877
And even if we have it in multiple places,
and this is a pro and

209
00:11:58.877 --> 00:12:03.080
a con, it's something you can think about.

210
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.427
If we have everything in one place,
it's easier to update these things, right,

211
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.202
because we can easily just
find it in that one place.

212
00:12:10.202 --> 00:12:13.400
If it's in different places, that's fine,
but we need planning around that,

213
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.009
we need standards around that, right?

214
00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:19.407
We need to be able to say, okay, well,
it's on the blog, we got to update this

215
00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:23.223
and then it's over here,
we need to update this, we got to do this.

216
00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:26.399
We have to have a structure around it.

217
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:33.258
And I'm sorry to say this, but honestly,
this one here is just negligence.

218
00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:34.197
That's all it is.

219
00:12:34.197 --> 00:12:35.580
It's just negligence.

220
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.320
It's the company not realizing that
their main depot of information is

221
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.825
their most valuable.

222
00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:46.525
And it's being kept in what you mentioned,

223
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:53.522
all the way at the top,
perpetuating tribal knowledge, right?

224
00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:56.531
We haven't even really talked
about tribal knowledge, but

225
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:58.950
it's mostly because we don't want to,
right?

226
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.462
We wanna talk about, to get rid of that
because tribal knowledge is not good.

227
00:13:03.462 --> 00:13:07.192
I know it seems like it might be, but
tribal knowledge is really not good.

228
00:13:07.192 --> 00:13:10.138
If a person leaves the company
at any time, you're screwed,

229
00:13:10.138 --> 00:13:11.453
[LAUGH] you know what I mean.

230
00:13:11.453 --> 00:13:15.139
&gt;&gt; There's a fine line between tribal
knowledge and domain knowledge, and

231
00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:16.094
specialization.

232
00:13:16.094 --> 00:13:17.968
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, exactly, exactly.

233
00:13:17.968 --> 00:13:21.570
Tribal knowledge is, yeah, man,
he was here five years ago and

234
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.585
the database just works like this.

235
00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:24.605
I don't know, ask him.

236
00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:27.123
That's tribal knowledge, right?

237
00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:31.523
Not the domain specific knowledge of,
we use Postgres because it indexes our

238
00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:35.602
queries for us the right way, and
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, right?

239
00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:38.387
So we want to avoid that, right?

240
00:13:38.387 --> 00:13:40.467
And we've already kind of
handled that a bit, right?

241
00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:42.623
We've said that with messaging software,

242
00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:46.710
we're gonna avoid tribal knowledge by just
creating an issue or a ticket, right?

243
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.126
Putting it somewhere where
things are being written.

244
00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:52.310
And whether it be centralized or
not, right,

245
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.748
we can just say documentation platform,
right?

246
00:13:55.748 --> 00:13:57.086
Same thing there.

247
00:13:57.086 --> 00:14:02.070
Encouraging your co-workers to, anytime
you find yourself in a scenario where

248
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.965
somebody is like, that,
be like, cool, write it down.

249
00:14:05.965 --> 00:14:11.409
[LAUGH] You know what I mean, because
when they do that, they won't forget it.

250
00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:15.506
Here's a good example of that.

251
00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:20.331
At my company, we've had this thing
where QA creates a lot of their

252
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:23.448
own AWS credentials, which we deal with.

253
00:14:23.448 --> 00:14:30.852
[LAUGH] And so we have automation around
those policies and stuff, though.

254
00:14:30.852 --> 00:14:36.153
However, it's a manual connection of
attaching the policy to the role.

255
00:14:36.153 --> 00:14:40.367
And that gets kicked out for some reason,
we haven't discovered why but

256
00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:42.591
the role just randomly gets removed.

257
00:14:42.591 --> 00:14:46.836
So, for about a year, [LAUGH] every
three months without us realizing,

258
00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:51.098
QA would come up to us and be like,
hey, our credentials have expired.

259
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:53.352
We had no idea what was going on.

260
00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:56.855
Finally find out that the role
got kicked off of it, right?

261
00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:00.924
Well, somebody forgot to write
documentation on it, for

262
00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:03.256
the next time, we dealt with it.

263
00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:07.936
And so I saw a Slack thread coming in
few months later, same problem, and

264
00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:12.175
I literally just went,
is this the same thing we just dealt with?

265
00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:15.766
And then, again,
somebody on my team went, write it down.

266
00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:20.401
[LAUGH] And literally,
what did we do going forward?

267
00:15:20.401 --> 00:15:24.467
We didn't solve the problem,
I can say that holistically, we didn't.

268
00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:28.043
But we gave a path that we can move
forward with the next time this

269
00:15:28.043 --> 00:15:29.132
happens, right?

270
00:15:29.132 --> 00:15:34.229
It has become tribal knowledge that this
is what happens, however, I'm impacting

271
00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:38.767
somebody that doesn't know that tribal
knowledge, you know what I mean.

272
00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:42.241
So it makes sense for
us to write it down, basically.

273
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.152
&gt;&gt; I mean that, and if you think
you're gonna remember something in

274
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.032
three months, you're not.

275
00:15:45.032 --> 00:15:46.897
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll do three days.

276
00:15:46.897 --> 00:15:50.514
[LAUGH] Yeah, I agree.

277
00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:55.420
Having the assumption that your brain
is as good at storing variables as

278
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.311
a computer is wrong [LAUGH].

279
00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.660
That's why ChatGPT is being created.
