00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
So I'm gonna go ahead and
just get a little bit more of just showing

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.325
you guys the power of
this while you guys add.

3
00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.037
And for chat as well,

4
00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:14.033
if you guys can get your AWS credentials
added to your shell environments,

5
00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:19.571
just to make sure that we can start
creating resources in AWS as well.

6
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.268
And while you guys are doing that, so

7
00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:27.238
I want to showcase a little bit more
of even what you can do with this.

8
00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:31.601
Because again, I know I'm showing you just
like very simple programming things, but

9
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:35.744
when you look at it from solving problems
as DevOps, it's very, very powerful.

10
00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:42.209
So let's think about quickly
DevOps at scale, right?

11
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.890
I need hundreds of buckets, right?

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.251
And am I just gonna have developers
copy and paste this over and over,

13
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:54.176
even just like I just showed you,
is that what we really want?

14
00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:54.771
Probably not.

15
00:00:54.771 --> 00:01:00.321
[LAUGH] And the reality of this is, what
we can do, again, because we're leaning

16
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:05.641
on code, is we can just simply say,
you know what, buckets = this, right?

17
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:11.001
And then just create a simple for loop.

18
00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:19.283
I think I did that right,
is it, where's it again?

19
00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:27.892
Yeah, and so now,
We just paste this in, right, bucket.

20
00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:32.503
And if we wanted to, we could even say,
okay, you know what,

21
00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:35.713
buckets is typed as well, so BucketList.

22
00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:41.245
And in this, let's say it's an array,

23
00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:44.022
and it has the name.

24
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:47.057
Actually, I'm a dummy,
we don't even need to do this.

25
00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:51.223
We could just simply say FmBucket, right?

26
00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.668
Because we wanna be able
to reuse the definition or

27
00:01:54.668 --> 00:01:57.299
the DSL that we've already created.

28
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.653
So what we can do is,
is we could say, all right, well,

29
00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:06.752
to create all of my buckets,
I'm going to make a, and actually,

30
00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:11.426
this is supposed to be a const,
sorry, const bucketList.

31
00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:15.820
I have been working in go too much.

32
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.079
There we go, there.

33
00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.401
So now, I have a list that
I can easily pass to this.

34
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.097
And so if I do bucketList, right?

35
00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:34.409
And here's the fun part, this is like this
doesn't even need to be in the same file.

36
00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.279
You could have a file, I don't know
what just happened to my editor,

37
00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.658
but you could have a whole
file of just variables and

38
00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:46.529
then export that variable and
then reuse it over and over.

39
00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.915
So let's try it one more time for

40
00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:57.748
bucket of bucketList,
right, in, sorry, in.

41
00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:05.293
Go up here, cut this,
paste this like this, and then bucket.

42
00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:13.137
Yeah, so we'll do this, FmBucket.

43
00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:16.737
[LAUGH] go, yeah, of course.

44
00:03:16.737 --> 00:03:24.359
Cool, so now if I wanted to, I could say,
all right, well, I need a bucket for,

45
00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.555
Let's say, example-1.

46
00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:37.636
And there's interesting things
that we could do with this, right?

47
00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:40.506
We could say, you know what,
we do want the product here, right,

48
00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.008
maybe we do want the product here.

49
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:45.918
And so we could do that, or we could
simply say, this is all gonna be a part of

50
00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:49.599
the same product, so we'll logically
scope this like this, right?

51
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.572
And then we'll just say example-1,

52
00:03:54.572 --> 00:03:57.592
example-2, right?

53
00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:59.092
And then just go here and say,

54
00:03:59.092 --> 00:04:02.333
you know what, it's always gonna
be the same product, right?

55
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:09.691
So for now, I can, Just do this and

56
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:14.363
simply just change the name.

57
00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:18.714
Oops, I'm not gonna do all that,
but you get the idea.

58
00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:22.433
And so now, if we go here,
and then we do up.

59
00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:28.747
And what's interesting is outside of
the broken words because I didn't give it

60
00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:32.135
the right variable,
you'll notice that it's isolated, right?

61
00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:36.894
devops-course-1 has its own component
with its own resources in it, and

62
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:41.968
devops-course-0 has its own component
with its own resources in it, right?

63
00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:46.885
And again, when you're talking about say,
for example, how do I manage all of my

64
00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:51.375
buckets in my infrastructure and make
sure that if I wanna add a new bucket,

65
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:54.896
I can just add it to a repository and
let it run automation?

66
00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.780
Just showing you how to do that.

67
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.368
And this is literally what we
use at my company as well.

68
00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:02.551
We have actually a repository full
of buckets and stuff like that.

69
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.767
And if we need a new bucket,
we can easily add it there.
