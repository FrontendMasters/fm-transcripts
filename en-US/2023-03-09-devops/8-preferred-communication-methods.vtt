1
00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:05.172
So first and
foremost is after we look at this,

2
00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:11.581
I would say, What do we prefer, right?

3
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:19.043
So a lot of what I do, for example,
right now is messaging software, right?

4
00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:22.893
Because I'm very similar,
I am constantly contacting people,

5
00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:25.140
talking to people, helping people.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.243
And so does messaging software
suit what we do, right?

7
00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:33.065
Does the wiki, does the blog?

8
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:40.476
So my question to all of you
would be out of these four.

9
00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:44.735
And I think what we should do first is
we should, actually here, let's do this,

10
00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.004
we should focus on
a couple of things here.

11
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.076
Messaging software is not the same
as email blasts, blogs, and wikis,

12
00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.958
they solve different problems.

13
00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.639
I think we can all kind of agree on that.

14
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.320
So I think, for sure, we're gonna
have messaging software in our stack,

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.896
no matter what, right?

16
00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.245
We're always gonna have a Slack or
something like that.

17
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:08.491
However, besides messaging software,
if I was to say, you know what,

18
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:14.167
let's try and actually make this easier,
let's get rid of the email blasts,

19
00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:19.246
let's get rid of the blogs,
let's even get rid of the wikis, right?

20
00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.054
Do you have a question?

21
00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.531
&gt;&gt; No, I'm waving goodbye to them.

22
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:23.979
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, yeah, yes, goodbye,
yes, let's get rid of them.

23
00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:24.891
Let's start from scratch.

24
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.396
Now, we know we want messaging software,
right, we know that.

25
00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:35.706
So that is gonna be where our
real-time communication is,

26
00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:42.027
where are we gonna put our
offline communication, right?

27
00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:46.794
Because there's a valid argument
in saying that this kind of

28
00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:50.540
makes all of this null and
void in some regards.

29
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.273
I would say the one that's probably
the most helpful right now is email

30
00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:53.975
blasts, right?

31
00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:58.330
Because that's like a red flag,
that's something that they at least know,

32
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.749
if I get this,
I gotta pay attention to it.

33
00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.818
So email blasts may still be
a good thing to keep, right?

34
00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:10.542
But this, blogs and wikis and
articles and posts and stuff like that,

35
00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:15.017
yeah, those will be convoluted
very easily, right?

36
00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:19.982
So if we go back to what do we prefer,
the question we have

37
00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:25.055
to ask ourselves is how do we
want our developers to access

38
00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:29.512
information besides within messaging,
right?

39
00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:35.369
In this case, you could say, you know
what, we like the formatting of the wiki,

40
00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.158
because it already has a lot
of our best practices and

41
00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:43.834
things like that in it, so
maybe we move everything to the Wiki.

42
00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:49.346
Another thing I would wave
the question here is,

43
00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:52.443
why did we create the blog?

44
00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:53.397
And you don't have to answer that.

45
00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:59.220
But the main thing, again, is that I think
it's very common for us in engineering to

46
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.318
be like, okay, it's gotta go here and
here, [SOUND] you know what I mean?

47
00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:07.958
But if we can take a look at how we're
doing things and kinda say, okay,

48
00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.232
let's take a step back,

49
00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:13.014
there's actually opportunity to
just remove things entirely, right?

50
00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:16.669
So what I would say is,
is if we preferred anything,

51
00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.668
we prefer messaging software for
real-time communication to solve.

52
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:27.093
And this is where we're gonna
kinda start saying, well,

53
00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:32.628
what does messaging software do for
us, right, to solve,

54
00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:38.180
let's say, new issues, right,
or untracked problems.

55
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.691
Whoa, something else just came up.

56
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:45.485
Wait a minute, untracked problems.

57
00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:47.578
Okay, wait a minute.

58
00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:54.340
So we're gonna use messaging software, but
we're not gonna track our problems, right?

59
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.648
Why I'm showing this is this is a problem.

60
00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:02.584
[LAUGH] This is another problem of
basically saying, well, that's great that

61
00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:07.593
we have messaging software, but we may
have another issue with inside of that,

62
00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:12.711
which is we're losing what you said
before, those threads, that Papertrail.

63
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.235
So how can we solve that?

64
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:19.274
Well, we just say, when a new problem

65
00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:24.470
is raised, we create a ticket for it and

66
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.050
include Slack threads, simple.

67
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.910
If we just create an issue,
create a simple Papertrail that can start,

68
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.369
right, messaging software becomes
way more valuable, right?

69
00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:42.764
Because now, we can grab the problem
quickly, we can open up an incident for

70
00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:44.769
it and we can keep moving, right?

71
00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:50.794
And we can also say all critical

72
00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:57.515
information must be in the issue or

73
00:04:57.515 --> 00:05:03.791
ticket, not in Slack, right?

74
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:09.644
So this is culture,
That's culture right there.

75
00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:13.480
You have to be able to make
sure that your developers or

76
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.820
anyone else is gonna
follow these standards.

77
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.579
[LAUGH] Because if they don't, then
nobody's gonna actually do this, right?

78
00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:26.774
But now if we look at messaging software,
we can say, okay, we're gonna take care of

79
00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:30.705
real-time communication, basically,
to solve issues and stuff like that.

80
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:34.289
But whenever we have something,
we're going to put it into a ticket,

81
00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.313
make it trackable, things like that.

82
00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:39.403
Hopefully that'll solve one
of the problems, right?

83
00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:44.153
The second problem is when new

84
00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:49.473
information is shared, right,

85
00:05:49.473 --> 00:05:55.748
we need a article or document for that.

86
00:05:55.748 --> 00:05:58.771
This is also culture.

87
00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:00.082
What does that mean?

88
00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:05.266
In this scenario, developers must prompt

89
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:09.736
each other to write documentation.

90
00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:13.791
Don't let it stay in Slack,
[LAUGH] don't let it stay in Slack.

91
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:18.735
If somebody's bringing something up and
you're like, this is important, right,

92
00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:23.075
then we should probably make sure
that it's in documentation somewhere.

93
00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:26.028
So this is a standard
that we're gonna set.

94
00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:30.883
If you don't do that, you're not doing
your job the way you need to be for

95
00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:32.404
the company, right?

96
00:06:32.404 --> 00:06:35.748
So again, if we look at
messaging software in this case,

97
00:06:35.748 --> 00:06:38.324
right, we now have
defined it a lot better,

98
00:06:38.324 --> 00:06:42.943
we now know that messaging software is
really focused on real-time, right?

99
00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:47.395
It's focused on whenever a problem is
brought up, us catching that problem,

100
00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:51.992
creating a trackable ticket for it, and
being able to move through that ticket.

101
00:06:51.992 --> 00:06:56.225
And then whenever new information
is shared, we need an article or

102
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:58.121
a document for that, right?

103
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.769
So with that being said,
do we feel like we need

104
00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:10.891
more than one solution here for
the next part?

105
00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:17.829
If we look at it this simply and
we just say like, okay, well,

106
00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:21.062
we know messaging software is gonna
take care of our real-time stuff and

107
00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:22.658
trackability and stuff like that.

108
00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:28.258
And we now know that developers must
prompt each other to write documentation,

109
00:07:28.258 --> 00:07:33.870
does it make sense for us to still have
this separation between wikis and blogs?

110
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.353
Or does it make more sense
to just have one and say,

111
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:44.707
this is a centralized
documentation platform or

112
00:07:44.707 --> 00:07:48.766
whatever you wanna call it, right?

113
00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.593
The reason why I think this
is a good decision is for

114
00:07:54.593 --> 00:07:57.956
a couple of reasons, simplicity.

115
00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:05.323
It's really hard when something's coming
out to know what to refer to, right?

116
00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:07.432
Check this, check that.

117
00:08:07.432 --> 00:08:11.145
This removes checking anywhere else,

118
00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:15.991
we all know it's in the centralized docs,
right?

119
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:16.671
Now, where is it?

120
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.170
That's a different problem,
we'll work on that in a second.

121
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.545
But it's simplicity here.

122
00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:25.080
Now, does that mean that you still don't
necessarily need the blogs or whatever?

123
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.473
I mean maybe, right, but
you've got to validate that, right?

124
00:08:29.473 --> 00:08:32.540
Communicating releases or new features,

125
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.799
I would argue that this could
just be a really good article,

126
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.154
that this could be in the wiki
as a release section upcoming.

127
00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:45.858
And if anything,
maybe the email blast just point

128
00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:49.671
directly to that wiki article, right?

129
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:53.095
Generally serving engineering teams, well,

130
00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.527
this does that too,
[LAUGH] you know what I mean?

131
00:08:56.527 --> 00:09:01.980
So unless we have a really valid reason as
to why we're separating these two, right,

132
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.285
I would almost propose that we just want
one centralized documentation platform,

133
00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:08.821
simplicity around it.

134
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:15.207
So maybe what that simplicity means
is that we also have simplicity

135
00:09:15.207 --> 00:09:20.350
around organization in the documentation,
right?

136
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:25.741
And that can be saying, each team gets

137
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.794
their own section or area, right,

138
00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:36.358
that can be managed on its own, right?

139
00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:39.581
And we actually do this where I work,
there's a DevOps section, and

140
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:42.874
that DevOps section is like,
I can do whatever I want in that section.

141
00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:45.111
If I wanna put GIFs in there and
make people laugh, I can do that.

142
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.575
If I wanna actually put real documentation
in there, I can do that too.

143
00:09:48.575 --> 00:09:52.580
But it's my job as a DevOps
engineer in my part of

144
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.400
the company to look at that and
manage that area, right?

145
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.792
And I think here's kind of the bigger one,

146
00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:07.409
which is just remove the need
of managing more things.

147
00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:10.590
If we just say we're gonna
use a messaging software and

148
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.575
then a centralized documentation platform,
there's a serious chance that we could

149
00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:18.845
just get rid of the blog entirely,
you know what I mean?

150
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:22.898
That's less, oops,
that's less infrastructure for

151
00:10:22.898 --> 00:10:28.341
us to manage on top of literally solving
people's other problems of time.

152
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:33.329
And I would bet that if you went
into a meeting and you said, yeah,

153
00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:37.230
I wanna save you time,
they're gonna buy into it,

154
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:43.071
because you're showing them the value
they're gonna get out of it as well.
