1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So I wanna introduce something else with
defining DevOps, and this is where we're

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.108
gonna kind of start working with some
more of theory and things like that.

3
00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:13.819
How many of you here have heard
the three W's of strategy?

4
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.410
Okay, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.027
[LAUGH] No, it's okay,
to be honest with you,

6
00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:19.024
I didn't know it either until
about a year and a half ago.

7
00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:22.664
And so it's actually a really, really,

8
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:28.176
really powerful tool that DevOps
uses more than programming.

9
00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:33.124
And it's mostly used to really
figure out if we even want

10
00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:35.978
to solve this problem, right?

11
00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:40.901
I'm sure we've all been in discussions or
meetings where somebody has said,

12
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.329
hey, let's do this.

13
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.127
And you're like, cool, why?

14
00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.288
[LAUGH] Who's this helping, why?

15
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:50.766
This solves that problem, or
it can solve that problem for you.

16
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:54.585
And the three W's of strategy
are basically why, what, and who?

17
00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:58.217
Why, reasons and
motivations behind the strategy, right?

18
00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:01.967
What, goals and objectives that
the strategy is intended to achieve.

19
00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.432
And then who, basically the people
who are benefiting from this.

20
00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:10.290
And so if you start thinking about some of
these even to things that you have at your

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.034
company, you might be able to start to
see what is a little bit more important,

22
00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:17.415
potentially, and what is,
potentially, a little less important.

23
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:21.232
But together, these three Ws basically
help you to provide a clear understanding

24
00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.290
of strategy and
what it aims to accomplish.

25
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.804
And as a matter of fact,
you can even use these three W's of

26
00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:32.338
strategy to throw out whole
projects [LAUGH] if you want to.

27
00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:36.478
Not the first time I've done it, I've
definitely had to basically look somebody

28
00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:39.599
in the eyes and say,
this is really cool, who does this help?

29
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:44.190
And then they've said, nobody, and
then I said, okay, we'll visit it later.

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.436
[LAUGH] And again, that's also another
very serious part about DevOps,

31
00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:53.134
is focusing on not spending
the company's money or

32
00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:56.756
resources on something
that doesn't need to be.

33
00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:59.941
You're at that level in DevOps where

34
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.572
people are looking to you
to solving these problems.

35
00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:08.455
And so the three W's of strategy
is actually a really good,

36
00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:12.039
helpful tool that can help
you with that confidently.

37
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.083
So if we take the why,
the what, and the who, and

38
00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:19.265
then we apply that to DevOps, right?

39
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.299
And what we're actually gonna do is,
we're gonna try applying it to, say,

40
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.338
our own company, right?

41
00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:25.387
So we'll do a little bit of
a thought experiment here.

42
00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:31.264
So, why does our company need DevOps,
right?

43
00:02:31.264 --> 00:02:34.719
To give a few examples,
say you don't have DevOps at all.

44
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.262
[LAUGH] That's a good place to start.

45
00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:43.718
Or, say, you have very outdated deployment
strategies, maybe you don't even have

46
00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:49.195
CI/CD, maybe you don't have a lot of these
things that we've talked about before.

47
00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:54.054
That's a good reason to use to
utilize DevOps, is just the simple,

48
00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:57.564
we don't have it, or
it's not being done well.

49
00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.183
The next thing,
what do we accomplish with it?

50
00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:05.289
Well, if we've said we don't have
a lot of automation around things or

51
00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:10.054
a lot of things in place that
are helping us be agile at our company,

52
00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.544
then we accomplish that, right?

53
00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:16.756
We accomplish being able to be more
agile by creating automation or

54
00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:19.773
doing other things that'll
help us get there.

55
00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:23.223
And then the final one is,
who do we help with DevOps?

56
00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:27.729
Well, in this regard,
it would probably be most of the company.

57
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.630
If you've never had a CI/CD platform
before, or it's ever been implemented,

58
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.183
then that's something that's never
saved you guys time before, right?

59
00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.861
That's something that a company's
never been able to, or

60
00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:42.497
that company has potentially
never been able to utilize.

61
00:03:42.497 --> 00:03:48.559
So good, again, just as a very simple why,
what and who thought experiment there.

62
00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.085
Hopefully, that can at least
kinda give you an idea.

63
00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:55.760
And just to do one more, say,

64
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.062
why do we need Kubernetes?

65
00:04:00.062 --> 00:04:02.597
Good old,
why do we need Kubernetes, right?

66
00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:05.594
Sure, well,
what do we accomplish with Kubernetes?

67
00:04:05.594 --> 00:04:06.605
I'm not gonna answer that.

68
00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.806
[LAUGH] I'll let you answer that.

69
00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:11.207
But what do we accomplish with Kubernetes?

70
00:04:11.207 --> 00:04:15.595
And then who does Kubernetes help, right?

71
00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.036
Taking those three things and

72
00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:20.561
taking them to a company might get
you into some interesting arguments.

73
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.744
But it can definitely help you with,
do we care about using Kubernetes, really?

74
00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:29.554
I can guarantee you most companies
have not even thought about this, and

75
00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.803
they're already painstakingly dealing
with Kubernetes and things like that,

76
00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:35.879
just simply because they didn't ask.

77
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.729
Well, do we actually need it?

78
00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.811
And again, I basically just kinda went
through what are in the slides here,

79
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.422
again, to hopefully help
with that rapid and

80
00:04:47.422 --> 00:04:52.098
reliable build of software and
deployment of it, right?

81
00:04:52.098 --> 00:04:54.743
And it's not even that,
it's also monitoring it as well.

82
00:04:54.743 --> 00:04:58.968
So, if you don't have monitoring
at your company, cool,

83
00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:03.625
that's probably something that
you could utilize DevOps with.

84
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.825
Again, what do we accomplish with it?

85
00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:09.018
We are able to implement and
automate these processes, so

86
00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:12.405
that we have the ability of
empowering our teams to release and

87
00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:15.353
iterate on their products quickly and
effectively.

88
00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:20.020
A big one on this which is
something that probably a lot of

89
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.709
people might not think
of is empowering QA.

90
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:29.201
QA, unfortunately, gets thought about
not as much as it really should be.

91
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.606
And when you think about what
we can accomplish with it,

92
00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:37.108
there's a lot of really cool things
that's just helping out the QA team.

93
00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:42.248
I implemented a feature the other day,
where it just allows the QA

94
00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:47.497
team to go into a channel and
ask what the deployment statuses are.

95
00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:49.708
That's it, something very simple, but

96
00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:52.561
we realized that they were
constantly hitting us up.

97
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:57.196
So it was either we constantly
let them continue to do that, or

98
00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:59.882
we try and solve a problem for that.

99
00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:03.023
And again, that's with the same
example where QA can be helpful,

100
00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:04.829
that's who we're helping, right?

101
00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:08.541
We're helping a specific part of
the organization or something like that,

102
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.388
to essentially solve a problem
within the organization.
