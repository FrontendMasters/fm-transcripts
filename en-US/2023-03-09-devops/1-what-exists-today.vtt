1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.689
My goal is for the first half of this
course to really be just, again as I said,

2
00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.147
breaking down DevOps.

3
00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:11.001
We're gonna go through a lot of different
thought experiments, we're gonna

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:16.088
look at how again the philosophy of DevOps
is really kind of lined out or outlined.

5
00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:18.552
And then the second half we're
just gonna be programming.

6
00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:23.975
So [LAUGH] it's gonna be fun but
the first part is definitely gonna

7
00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:29.517
be a little bit of theory and
philosophy before we get into craft.

8
00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:32.867
So let's talk about what exists today.

9
00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.008
There's a lot of things, as I said,

10
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.540
that currently exist in DevOps
that are not really helpful.

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.757
And I'm hoping that these things
that I exemplify are things that

12
00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.063
you probably have even seen
at your own companies.

13
00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:49.528
And these are purely experiences
I've gone through myself as well.

14
00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.747
So this is stuff I've experienced.

15
00:00:52.747 --> 00:00:57.091
First off, as I said, and
kind of as we've started our course,

16
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:00.642
DevOps is poorly defined
right now in the industry.

17
00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:04.814
Because DevOps is a broad and somewhat
abstract concept, it is difficult for

18
00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:08.554
companies to find and implement it
in a concrete and consistent way.

19
00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:12.566
Everybody's got an opinion on it in most
regards, and depending on who you talk to,

20
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:16.195
what company you're looking at or
you're talking to and things like that.

21
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:19.543
The way that they handle DevOps
is sometimes entirely different.

22
00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:23.311
And there are definitely people who
have left one company thinking,

23
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.259
I know how this works, I can go somewhere
else and then gone somewhere else and

24
00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.631
realized that actually the way
they did it was incredibly niche.

25
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.745
There's no real generalization
to what they did, and

26
00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:37.950
it's actually didn't probably help
you much in your learning process.

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.514
And I do really think a lot of that is
just because it is really poorly defined

28
00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:43.244
right now.

29
00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:50.212
It really is more of what do you
think DevOps is rather than what

30
00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:56.123
we're trying to define it as a ecosphere,
I guess.

31
00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:57.658
Culture challenges, right?

32
00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.368
So because DevOps is poorly defined, and

33
00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:05.396
essentially because that impacts culture,

34
00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:12.922
there are culture shifts that can happen
within an organization because of DevOps,

35
00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:16.962
and nine times out of ten,
those go nowhere.

36
00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:20.775
It can be very challenging for
companies to integrate and

37
00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:23.483
adopt new things into their practices.

38
00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:28.223
And the reality of it is is nine
times out of ten, most don't want to.

39
00:02:28.223 --> 00:02:33.297
And it's not in the sense that it's
not something we'd love to see but

40
00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:38.543
it's more so you have to deal with
business, you have to deal with trying

41
00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:44.306
to make sure that the rest of the company
is on board with you and culture is hard.

42
00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:47.913
Culture is very hard to change, especially
if we're talking about a company that's

43
00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:50.027
been doing something one way for
a very long time.

44
00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:55.422
Again, can kind of start showing you how
these start becoming compounding issues.

45
00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:58.396
Where because DevOps is poorly defined,
and

46
00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:03.012
because we are, again as I said before,
having culture challenges,

47
00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:06.859
we now start dealing with
communication issues, right?

48
00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.023
Basically a lack of
clear communication and

49
00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:12.014
collaboration between these
teams that can lead to errors.

50
00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:16.438
And I guarantee you each
of us here have seen this.

51
00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:20.475
A release goes out, somebody
didn't communicate something about

52
00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:24.671
some common practice that we do,
a feature flag didn't get flipped.

53
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.444
Got to roll back.

54
00:03:27.444 --> 00:03:32.044
As I said, technically,
you can solve a problem one way, but

55
00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.356
there's always human error.

56
00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:38.079
There's always gonna be human error, and
that's what DevOps is focused on solving,

57
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.769
the human error, the human side of it.

58
00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.916
And so
if you have this missing communication and

59
00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:48.072
another common cases
like documentation even.

60
00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:52.563
How many of us have dealt with not being
able to find documentation on something

61
00:03:52.563 --> 00:03:55.832
because specific software
are really hard to navigate or

62
00:03:55.832 --> 00:04:00.755
there wasn't a good organization around
those documentation and things like that.

63
00:04:00.755 --> 00:04:02.636
That's DevOps.

64
00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:06.755
That is a circumstance where DevOps
can see that and say like, okay,

65
00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:07.899
how do we fix this?

66
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:12.348
And because of that, right, again,
because of the proper definition,

67
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:17.016
because of the culture challenges,
because of the missing communication,

68
00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:19.409
we get suboptimal solutions, right?

69
00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.594
And again, because developers and IT
professionals may not be working together

70
00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:27.288
as efficiently and as effectively,
we basically result in suboptimal

71
00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:30.878
solutions that do not meet the needs
of the business or the end users.

72
00:04:30.878 --> 00:04:34.446
And this is also very,
very common in DevOps.

73
00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:40.895
I would imagine most of us can say we've
seen some part of subinfrastructure or

74
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:45.598
something we've just kind of looked at and
went, what?

75
00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:50.360
And it's true,
it's probably some type of suboptimal

76
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.130
solution that was half baked or
not fully put together.

77
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.798
And because of that,
now we're dealing with some type

78
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.685
of weird technical debt that we don't
really want to have to deal with, right?

79
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:05.648
So where do we begin?

80
00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:10.326
And I'm gonna say I think Moss from
the IT Crowd does a pretty good job of

81
00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:12.954
describing what DevOps can feel like.

82
00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:16.361
So you'll see a few of his gifts in here.

83
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:20.009
But yeah, I wanted to show you guys first
and foremost what exists today because

84
00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.781
once you start thinking about what exists
today, that's probably how you feel.

85
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:29.279
[LAUGH] Just like okay, well,
there's fire around me, where do we begin?

86
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.839
Well, we're gonna start from scratch.

87
00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.402
As I said, I want you to forget
what you've seen about DevOps,

88
00:05:34.402 --> 00:05:37.630
I want you to forget what
you've heard about DevOps, and

89
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.536
I want you to forget what
you've done with DevOps.

90
00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:45.335
I want you to completely just blank
your mind of any knowledge that

91
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:47.610
you have preconceiving to it.

92
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.743
And I'm gonna be honest as well,
this is something I had to do before I

93
00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:53.725
could start understanding how to
become a good DevOps engineer.

94
00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:58.546
Because I was constantly taking things
that I've said,okay, well what about this?

95
00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.115
Or okay, what about that or
things like that and

96
00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:03.436
jumping way too far
ahead than I needed to.

97
00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:08.575
So starting from scratch is probably
gonna be the best case scenario here.
