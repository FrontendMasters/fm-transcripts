1
00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:01.578
Cool, okay.

2
00:00:01.578 --> 00:00:05.235
So now, we've got this, right?

3
00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.275
I kinda wanna show you at least what it's
gonna look like if we use it, right?

4
00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:16.025
So we're gonna say,
export, I think that's it.

5
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:17.866
I just feel like I just
blanked on TypeScript.

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.803
Yeah, I believe that's what we need,
export.

7
00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:25.882
And then what we're gonna do is,
we're actually going to go to index.ts and

8
00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:27.596
we're gonna use it now, okay?

9
00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:32.424
So what we wanna do is, we just

10
00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.447
wanna say FmBucket like this,

11
00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.741
and then import it.

12
00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:47.997
There it is.

13
00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.285
And then what do we do?

14
00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.737
Yes, I did, okay, cool.

15
00:00:56.737 --> 00:00:59.908
And again, because this is a class and

16
00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:05.966
we're not working with a functional
language [LAUGH] and I have to do new.

17
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:11.911
Okay, so we're gonna say new FmBucket, and

18
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:18.797
then if we do this,
look at that Name:example, and

19
00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:24.439
then Product:devops-course, right?

20
00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.680
Now, it's saying that it's
expecting two options, and

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.468
that's because we forgot
to make this optional.

22
00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:31.708
So we're just gonna make that optional,
and then there we go.

23
00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:34.538
So now, what have we done?

24
00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:36.315
We've created a bucket, [LAUGH], yeah.

25
00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:43.373
However, we've created a bucket, but
now I can do these two as much as I want.

26
00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:47.512
And as long as I simply change the name,
right,

27
00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:54.357
then I will always get the same type of
bucket that I expect every time, right?

28
00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:59.481
So let's do that,
let's say devops-course, right?

29
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:02.873
Get rid of this, get rid of this.

30
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.855
Let's go back to bucket.

31
00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.552
I don't know why, that's right, I see,

32
00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:13.071
because it wants to do
import the star thing.

33
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:17.525
So here's what we're gonna do instead,
we're gonna say s3.

34
00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:21.846
Pulumi kind of exports their
package a little weird.

35
00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:24.963
So they like to do the star export,

36
00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:30.023
where you just deconstruct
whatever you need off of it.

37
00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:36.732
So I'm just gonna do that basically,
so I don't deal with import issues.

38
00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:42.314
Okay, like that, there we go.

39
00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:45.351
Pulumi, and then we'll go here, and
we'll just do the same thing here as well,

40
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:46.211
let's cut these out.

41
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:50.148
And we'll say that this is
a ComponentResource, and

42
00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:53.310
this is a CustomResourceOptions, cool?

43
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.944
Cool, okay.

44
00:02:54.944 --> 00:03:02.126
So now, what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna say secrets-- pulumi up.

45
00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:03.803
And hope that it doesn't break.

46
00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.562
Yay, I didn't break it.

47
00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:06.785
So what do we got?

48
00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:11.050
Well, we got a stack just like we did
before cuz we haven't created our

49
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.784
stack yet.

50
00:03:11.784 --> 00:03:18.244
We now have a, look at that, right
underneath it, our own FmBucket resource.

51
00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:21.695
And look at the naming convention,
devops-course-example.

52
00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:27.137
So that means that this component
is now named devops-course-example.

53
00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:29.936
And inside of that,
we have an aws:s3:Bucket,

54
00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:31.964
which we're just using as example.

55
00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:34.958
Again, you can kinda see why I don't do
the duplication there because you'll just

56
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.230
see devops-course-example,
devops-course-example,

57
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.474
devops-course-example, over and
over, and over again.

58
00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:45.849
But the only thing we really care
about is just the Name:example, right?

59
00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.068
There's a problem here, though.

60
00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:53.809
There's a problem here and
it's around how Pulumi group resources.

61
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:58.821
Right now, if you pay attention to
this spot here, you're gonna notice

62
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:04.018
that it basically says, okay,
pulumi:Stack owns all of these, right?

63
00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:06.461
But we technically want our bucket and

64
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.983
our PublicAccessBlock to be here,
underneath this.

65
00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:15.208
The reason for that is because if
another bucket is created with

66
00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:20.346
the exact same name, it will collide,
we won't allow it to.

67
00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:22.234
But we wanna have that high
level of composability.

68
00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:25.919
Well, if we wanna maybe give a name
the same bucket, but maybe for

69
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.671
a different environment, right,
that's where that product and

70
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:34.230
thing comes into play, where we have more
flexibility around how we name stuff.

71
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.233
So what we wanna do,

72
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:39.316
is we really wanna wrap all of our custom
resources in our own components, right?

73
00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:42.992
So to do that,
we're gonna go back to our bucket, and

74
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:48.660
we're gonna add something to that ops
thing that I told you about before, right?

75
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.687
And as I said, Pulumi adds options
to the end of every resource, right?

76
00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:58.283
So here, we're gonna create a new object,
just like that.

77
00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:01.516
And in here, we're gonna say p,
and you'll see parent.

78
00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:06.885
Parent tells Pulumi which
resource this component lives in,

79
00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:12.679
which component this resource lives in,
yeah, one of those two.

80
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:18.278
But basically, what it'll do is it'll
parent the resource to the component, so

81
00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:23.324
that when you go to create it,
it'll always be inside of that component.

82
00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:27.266
So all we have to do is just save this,
and that's the beauty of JavaScript,

83
00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:28.694
it's scoping it, right?

84
00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:33.749
Now, here's a trick, which is if
you don't remember to always do it,

85
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.206
you will see something like this.

86
00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:42.533
Cool, so our bucket is where it needs to
be, but our PublicAccessBlock is not.

87
00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:46.110
This is again something you
wanna make sure you look for

88
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.677
essentially because if you create it,

89
00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:53.920
you have to then deal with state to remove
it and readding it or things like that.

90
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.942
Again, ideally what we want is we want
all of these resources to be under

91
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:04.647
the same main component so that they're
very easily move aroundable and stuff.

92
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:10.592
So we're just gonna go back here and
we're just gonna fix that too, oops.

93
00:06:10.592 --> 00:06:12.477
And we're gonna say, parent this.

94
00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:19.980
There we go.

95
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.853
And so now, if we go back, You guys

96
00:06:24.853 --> 00:06:28.233
should be able to do Pulumi up
actually without needing credentials.

97
00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:32.887
Yeah, that's it, I don't think it
actually fails until you try applying.

98
00:06:32.887 --> 00:06:37.337
So you should be able to do all these
commands I'm doing with me, and

99
00:06:37.337 --> 00:06:38.207
there we go.

100
00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:43.297
Now, we've got much nicer isolation
of our resources where we

101
00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:49.841
have an FmBucket which is creating
a s3:Bucket and s3:PublicAccessBlock.

102
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:55.909
And on top of that, we now have the naming
conventions and everything that we want.
