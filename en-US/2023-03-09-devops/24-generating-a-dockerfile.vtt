1
00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:05.508
So let's talk about the next thing,
we'll start with the Dockerfile, right?

2
00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:10.600
So we said that we want our CLI tool to
be able to take the build.json, right?

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.962
And then be able to have a service
name and a service type so

4
00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:16.913
that it can generate
a Docker file from it, okay?

5
00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:21.430
So what we should probably do is we
should probably create a directory.

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.405
And in this directory, we will create
a folder called template, or templates,

7
00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:29.520
one of the two, whatever you care about.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.264
And in here, we're gonna create
a file called a Dockerfile, right?

9
00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:41.671
And we'll just do some basic stuff,
we'll say FROM alpine latest, right?

10
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:47.668
And then maybe for right now, just to
make it simple, we'll give it an ENV,

11
00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:52.559
and it will say service name equals or
service name like this.

12
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.923
But what we're gonna do, and here's
where the magic starts to happen here,

13
00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.420
we're gonna say SERVICE_NAME like this.

14
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.281
And we're gonna do this.

15
00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.791
Can anyone tell me what that is?

16
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.040
So think about it like this,

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.410
say you deploy tons of
services to the cloud, right?

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.693
And you want a way of being able to
know from a logging perspective,

19
00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:22.450
what the service name is, what version
it is, all those kind of things, right?

20
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.409
This is a step towards that direction,
where now that we have generation and

21
00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.690
flexibility around creating these files,
we can use this literally anywhere.

22
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.340
And so for example, we can say
ENV SERVICE NAME, ENV SERVICE TYPE.

23
00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:44.393
Service type, and then we do service type.

24
00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:50.171
So let's do this as well, we'll say
service name like this and service type.

25
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:52.723
Now we're even following
that same convention.

26
00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:59.635
And then, we could say like run,
Anything really at this point,

27
00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:03.371
doesn't really matter slash bin bash,
right, really doesn't matter.

28
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:09.665
Cool, so this is, again,
really all I wanna show you, but

29
00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:13.329
I'm gonna show you one other
thing as well which is,

30
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:19.496
Say this isn't enough.

31
00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:25.374
A lot of times, there are circumstances
where you'll find yourself needing

32
00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:31.896
to add a copy command, right, or add a run
command, or something like that, right?

33
00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:36.816
And what I've discovered is super helpful,
is instead of trying to

34
00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:41.756
add it to this file, we simply add
it to the configuration, right?

35
00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:45.047
So let's go back to our build.json for
a second.

36
00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.357
Let's say we wanna make it so

37
00:02:47.357 --> 00:02:52.184
that we can override more lines
in the Dockerfile, right?

38
00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:57.561
What we can do is we can simply, again,
a developer comes up to us and says, hey,

39
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:02.724
I've gotta add a .gitignore, and
it's not in your thing, how do I do this?

40
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.894
Well, we can literally do this.

41
00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:07.768
Right?

42
00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:28.724
This makes it so
that developers don't touch Dockerfiles.

43
00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:34.286
[LAUGH] I have blown so many developers'
minds with them finding out that they can

44
00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:40.197
just add it to our configuration, and they
never have to write a single line of code.

45
00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:44.744
This is the kind of power that
this tool represents, right?

46
00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:48.849
Service directory gave us the ability
of automating our services,

47
00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.746
having good standards around them, making
it easy for our developers to copy and

48
00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:56.570
paste the infrastructure they need, right?

49
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.230
But that's not it.

50
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.007
Developers also have build
configuration files,

51
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.142
they have other things that they need.

52
00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.233
And guess what,
I don't wanna do that either.

53
00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:07.085
[LAUGH] And so in that circumstance,

54
00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.923
we can do things like what you
see here where we can say,

55
00:04:09.923 --> 00:04:13.403
we could even do the same thing to
the circle CI file if we wanted to.

56
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:19.874
We could say CircleCI, TestCommand.

57
00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:24.496
Maybe your specific service
does yarn test, whatever,

58
00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:29.612
instead of our normal
standard yarn command, right?

59
00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:32.882
So this is a prime
example of what we can do

60
00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:38.370
with really just domain-specific
languages in general.

61
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.498
When we tell developers how they talk or
how they work with our stuff,

62
00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:45.416
right, they've always got those blockers,
or

63
00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:49.060
they've always got those
bumpers that they're gonna hit.

64
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.129
So I'm gonna delete the CircleCI one for
now, but

65
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.650
I am gonna do the pre-install commands one
because I think this is a good example.

66
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.710
Let's show it how it's wired up, right?

67
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.503
So, I'm gonna go back to our index.js,
and I'm gonna say Dockerfile.

68
00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:08.479
Now I'm gonna actually go back,

69
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:16.006
because I wanna type this too,
for say BuildJsonDockerfile.

70
00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:24.703
And so now, we'll say,
BuildJsonDockerfile,

71
00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:30.233
and look how easy it is to add to the DSL.

72
00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:45.609
Bam, now I have whatever they need
from their configuration, and

73
00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.786
I can easily use it in
templates if I need to.

74
00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:54.649
So this is something else that's really
powerful about building this type of tool,

75
00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:56.064
is you can add to it.

76
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.697
And you can keep adding to it.

77
00:05:57.697 --> 00:06:01.665
There should be nothing [LAUGH] that
a developer needs that you can't put into

78
00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:05.386
a domain-specific language like this,
and simply tell them, okay,

79
00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:08.920
you need to be able to run a command
before the pre-install, cool,

80
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.471
here's the configuration for
you, don't touch the Dockerfile.

81
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:12.971
[LAUGH]
