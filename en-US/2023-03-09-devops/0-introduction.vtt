1
00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:03.097
I'm gonna be teaching you guys
today DevOps for Developers.

2
00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:08.843
And this is something that I'm incredibly
passionate about, I am a content creator,

3
00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:13.976
and this is something I deal with and
create content around every single day.

4
00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.831
I also do it professionally, so

5
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:20.094
I'm very excited to share this with
you mostly because of the main title,

6
00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:25.001
An introduction to DevOps for developers
and its purpose in software development.

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.641
The main goal that I really want people
to be able to take away from this

8
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.966
is to be able to confidently go
into DevOps at any organization.

9
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:38.020
And simply be able to start applying
some of the fundamentals and

10
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.934
the practices that I'm gonna be
sharing with you guys today.

11
00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:42.690
So let's get started.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.533
So as an introduction,
my name is Erik Reinert.

13
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.151
I'm also known as Blackglasses
on the interwebs.

14
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:53.243
I'm a senior software engineer, I
currently work at a company called Hippo,

15
00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:56.531
but I've worked at a few other
companies in the past like that.

16
00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:01.625
As I said, I'm a content creator,
we're TheAltF4Stream on Twitch &amp; YouTube,

17
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.851
and I'm basically obsessed
with problem solving.

18
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.063
One of the things that I
started realizing very quickly,

19
00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:13.537
especially about what I do is
where my passions lie with it and

20
00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:16.363
kind of how that plays a role in my job.

21
00:01:16.363 --> 00:01:19.891
And so, yeah,
one of the things that is really,

22
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.572
really big to me is problem solving.

23
00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:28.275
To give a further background, I've kind
of done a lot of different things.

24
00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:33.198
I started out my career in frontend,
and I did that for about 2 years,

25
00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:36.466
and I really got off
actually a CS4 with that.

26
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.533
So I was taking phone calls,

27
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:43.456
and I had an opportunity where I
started building stuff on the CS4.

28
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.229
They started recognizing that,
and they were like, hey,

29
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.731
we might have an engineer here.

30
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:50.518
And so they actually took me
out of customer support, and

31
00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:52.682
it's a frontend where I started my career.

32
00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:56.454
And that first 2 years was really
focused on building frontends for

33
00:01:56.454 --> 00:02:00.822
enterprise companies, I worked at
a company at the time called Media Temple,

34
00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:02.497
you guys may have heard of it.

35
00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.748
It's a web-hosting company, and

36
00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:08.279
my job was really focused on
making buttons clickable.

37
00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:13.211
[LAUGH] And that was definitely a part
of my life for quite some time,

38
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:15.323
and as much fun I had with it,

39
00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:21.249
I started realizing that frontend might
not be exactly my true passion in life.

40
00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.435
After that, I decided I was just
gonna start following my curiosity.

41
00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:29.245
I didn't really know how to get to
the job I wanted or my dream job, but

42
00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:33.075
I knew that if I followed my curiosity,
I could hopefully get there.

43
00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:36.995
And so from there, I took 2 years into
backend, I actually just jumped to

44
00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:40.934
a completely different company,
I said, I feel like doing backend now.

45
00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:45.660
And so I took that and I ran with that,
I started building backends for

46
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.893
a iOS mobile app.

47
00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:51.817
And another thing too is I jumped
into it with very little knowledge.

48
00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:57.195
A lot of what I have focused on is really
been around my curiosity around things and

49
00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:00.056
using that as something to kinda guide me.

50
00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:03.222
As you do when you start dealing
with backend and stuff like that,

51
00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:07.081
I think it's very common for a lot people
to start getting fascinated with other

52
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:10.328
parts of the stack or the whole
entire stack, you know what I mean?

53
00:03:10.328 --> 00:03:14.569
You conquer frontend in some regard, and
then you get to backend and you're like,

54
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.730
okay, I can do it all.

55
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.301
And I thought I could too.

56
00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.188
And so
I actually took another job after that for

57
00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.592
about 2 years,
where I started working in fullstack.

58
00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:27.787
And this is really, I think,
where I started experiencing,

59
00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:30.543
as an engineer, what DevOps felt like.

60
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.071
Because in that scenario with fullstack,

61
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.574
you're getting closer to owning much
more of the actual bottom up all of it.

62
00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:41.879
And that really started opening up new
opportunities for me in the sense of where

63
00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.201
I was troubleshooting the stack in a
different way that I'd never done before.

64
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:48.528
I was looking at the stack
in a different way,

65
00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.051
I wasn't compartmentalized
to just one thing.

66
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:54.670
I wasn't just focused on frontend,
I wasn't just focused on backend,

67
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.927
I was started to do both.

68
00:03:55.927 --> 00:04:00.790
However, I again followed my curiosity and
started realizing

69
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.941
that one of the things I loved about
this was just problem solving.

70
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:09.313
I love being able to look at
the entire stack and say like, okay,

71
00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:12.745
here's where I can be super helpful or
here's where we can try and

72
00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:14.942
solve this problem and things like that.

73
00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:21.320
And again, I started out my career moving
to Los Angeles as a writer and director,

74
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.786
and then somehow ended up in engineering
[LAUGH] and doing what I do now.

75
00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:31.596
So none of this was planned, none of this
was something I expected to even do.

76
00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:37.657
And again, I followed my curiosity
of problem solving with that.

77
00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:41.921
And so I had a friend, actually who
works in DevOps, and he was like, hey,

78
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:45.445
you might be interested in looking
at problems from a much more

79
00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:50.030
higher organizational level than just
a specific product or things like that.

80
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.726
And so I did it again,
I moved to a different company, and

81
00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:59.048
when I moved to my different company, I
had an opportunity to readdress my title.

82
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.696
And so I was like, you know what,
I've already done frontend,

83
00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:07.645
I've already done backend, and I've done
fullstack now, why don't we try DevOps?

84
00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:12.496
And yeah, it was incredible, I never
thought that I would, especially so

85
00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:17.658
early in my career, be so passionate
about something that I really love doing.

86
00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:21.696
And there's reason to why I'm sharing
this too, there's a couple of reasons.

87
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:26.086
The first off is that DevOps
is definitely a collection of

88
00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:28.653
knowledge over a period of time.

89
00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:31.473
It is not in some regard
something that is just,

90
00:05:31.473 --> 00:05:34.371
you pick up a book and
you start reading about it.

91
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:39.208
Even this course is, as much as I'm
gonna try and get you guys understanding

92
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:43.150
what DevOps is, a lot of it is
still just gonna be experience.

93
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.123
So when we talk about getting into DevOps,

94
00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:51.243
I'm not saying you need to have eight
plus years before you go into it, but

95
00:05:51.243 --> 00:05:56.964
what I am saying is that, just showing
from my own path, my own course, it helps.

96
00:05:56.964 --> 00:05:58.424
[LAUGH] It helps a lot,

97
00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:03.060
especially when you've got crazy
circumstances that you're in.

98
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.390
&gt;&gt; If you have an interest in DevOps,
would you recommend it for

99
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.521
somebody who's entering into the field or
entering into tech in general?

100
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.667
&gt;&gt; I don't think that it's not
possible for you to go in DevOps,

101
00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:16.342
especially if you're just
entering the industry.

102
00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.811
I think the thing that you have to be open
minded is is just you're not gonna know

103
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:20.452
everything.

104
00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:24.423
There are people who even if they're not
in DevOps are going to be able to walk

105
00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:28.474
up to a problem and simply solve it
quicker because they've been through it.

106
00:06:28.474 --> 00:06:32.797
So, I definitely think it's possible,
I think, again, it's gonna be more of

107
00:06:32.797 --> 00:06:36.425
a learning experience before you
start getting comfortable with,

108
00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:41.093
maybe the company you're at, the stack
you're dealing with, and things like that.

109
00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:44.108
We're gonna dive into DevOps, but we're
really gonna start from scratch with it.

110
00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:48.993
And again, the big point here is that
I want to basically make you unlearn

111
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:51.409
everything you know about DevOps.

112
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.829
There's a really great quote that I know
from a musician that I'm not gonna say so

113
00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:59.339
I don't get judged about it, but
the quote is good, which is for

114
00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:03.180
you to understand me, you first have
to unlearn everything about me.

115
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.121
And that's just the common scenario of,
we're so used to tabloids and

116
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:08.506
other things like that.

117
00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:11.578
It's hard to understand maybe somebody,
your idol, or

118
00:07:11.578 --> 00:07:15.484
something like that because you're
not just getting the real picture.

119
00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:19.013
And I realized that that's
kind of DevOps right now.

120
00:07:19.013 --> 00:07:24.773
[LAUGH] There's a lot of things out
there that are kind of misleading,

121
00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:28.261
and so I really wanna start from scratch.

122
00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:34.093
Okay, so I'm gonna give you first starters
the more watered-down version of it,

123
00:07:34.093 --> 00:07:37.527
but it is pretty
straightforward version of it.

124
00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:40.176
To enter a career in DevOps,
it is helpful to

125
00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:44.345
have an experience in both software
development and IT operations.

126
00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:47.517
This may include experience with coding
and scripting languages, as well as

127
00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:50.665
experience with systems administration and
infrastructure management.

128
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:55.810
Again, I'm not saying that this is
a requirement, it's helpful, right?

129
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.088
Having a strong understanding of
collaboration and communication tools,

130
00:08:00.088 --> 00:08:04.246
methodologies, such as agile and
lean principles, can be beneficial.

131
00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:06.510
Again, not required but beneficial.

132
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.612
It is also important to have a passion for
continuous learning and staying

133
00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:12.875
up-to-date with the latest technologies
and best practices in the field.

134
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:17.475
So, as I just said, right before we
even got to this introduction by kind of

135
00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:22.001
shaping my career path and my interests,
you might be able to start seeing

136
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.375
why I'm so interested in DevOps and
things like that.

137
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:29.687
You can definitely take
the knowledge that you have and

138
00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:33.730
apply it to problem solving
at a much higher level.

139
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.478
And again, it's not a circumstance
where you need to know everything about

140
00:08:38.478 --> 00:08:42.202
a specific language,
we're not talking about that here.

141
00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:46.974
What we're talking about is that we just
need to know that if a service is down and

142
00:08:46.974 --> 00:08:51.839
it's written in Go or JavaScript or
whatever, hopefully, you can debug that.

143
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:56.111
[LAUGH] That's kind of the job
that we need to be able to do.

144
00:08:56.111 --> 00:09:01.685
And again,
I think the last part is really important.

145
00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:06.473
It's important to have passion for
continuous learning.

146
00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:09.740
We live in an industry right
now that is so fast and

147
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.642
updating constantly that if you're not
staying up-to-date with either practices,

148
00:09:15.642 --> 00:09:20.347
principles, strategies,
things like that, you might realize that

149
00:09:20.347 --> 00:09:25.557
you're doing old things that have
been improved upon 10, 15 years ago.

150
00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:29.688
And you're just still doing them because
that's the practice you're used to.

151
00:09:29.688 --> 00:09:34.715
So this, again,
is a very simple but hopefully more

152
00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:40.445
well defined version of kind of
what DevOps means as a term.

153
00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:45.868
Basically, the best way of
looking at it is DevOps

154
00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:50.916
is understanding first and
its tools second.

155
00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:54.928
DevOps is a philosophy,
it is not a technology.

156
00:09:54.928 --> 00:10:01.383
And so I do wanna note that if your first
step into DevOps is to look at a tool,

157
00:10:01.383 --> 00:10:05.800
then you might not be
looking at DevOps correctly.

158
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.197
And to be fair,
a lot of companies do that.

159
00:10:10.197 --> 00:10:14.095
It's about understanding the problem
first and then saying, okay,

160
00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:17.213
what are the tools that we can
use to solve this problem?

161
00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:19.829
Not saying,
I just heard about a really cool tool,

162
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:21.510
maybe that'll solve our problem.

163
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.444
That's not really the case here.

164
00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:28.808
And I actually, I'm gonna exemplify
this in our course today.
