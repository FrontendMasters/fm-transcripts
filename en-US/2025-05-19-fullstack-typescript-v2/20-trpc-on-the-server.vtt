00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.655
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's set it up on the server first.

2
00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:09.351
And the best part about this, you're like,
well, I already have a REST API.

3
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:10.067
So do I.

4
00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:10.784
I have it right here.

5
00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.524
We've been working on it all day.

6
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:13.822
Guess what I'm gonna do?

7
00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.142
I'm gonna keep it.

8
00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:20.016
I'm just going to add to it with
a different kinda service as well.

9
00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:20.549
So you can.

10
00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:23.504
Again, anything where it's well,

11
00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.801
I took this workshop,
we gotta rewrite everything.

12
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.522
No one's gonna be your friend then.

13
00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:33.420
The nice part is for some of these things,
you can opt in where you need it.

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.289
You don't have to use it for everything.

15
00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.664
You can start small.

16
00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:38.192
You should start small.

17
00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:42.295
Let's look at a very
kind of a simple example.

18
00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:47.897
So I am going to go into my server again.

19
00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.056
What am I getting yelled at for?

20
00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:51.814
That thing I'm not using anymore, great.

21
00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.148
What am I getting yelled at for now?

22
00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.188
One thing I was using.

23
00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.519
I don't want this anymore.

24
00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.043
All right, great.

25
00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.321
Let's hide some of the terminal action.

26
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.652
Let's even hide the sidebar.

27
00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:11.475
Okay, so, we can actually keep all
of our existing REST endpoints and

28
00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:16.228
just add to them, and
kinda see some of this in practice.

29
00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:21.409
So we'll pull in cuz what it will do,
and obviously we're

30
00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.665
doing the parts of Hokan to EXPRESS,
this is not EXPRESS-specific.

31
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:31.608
There are many, many different,
you can use it with most web servers.

32
00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.692
Obviously, you can use it
with what's built into Next,

33
00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:39.073
I don't know if it has a name, but you can
use it in all sorts of different places.

34
00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:45.366
But we are going to pull in
this initTRPC from TRPC server.

35
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:49.778
We've got all our various
schemas from before,

36
00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:53.980
and we need to go create
a few more things here.

37
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.918
Leave that for a second.

38
00:01:55.918 --> 00:02:00.606
I could do this in the same file, but this
file is getting big, so I'm not going to.

39
00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.700
Let's make a new file.

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.294
I'll make a folder this time.

41
00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:09.574
Well, I'll do it a little different than
I did last time, assuming we're good.

42
00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:17.738
I will call it trpc-context.ts.

43
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:23.474
And there's a little bit of
boilerplate that we will set up here,

44
00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:25.888
but let's do it together.

45
00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:28.043
So we will import.

46
00:02:33.963 --> 00:02:37.886
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Little helper here,
you can kinda guess what it does.

47
00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.403
If you look, I have this got
this little database thing.

48
00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:44.346
I might make myself a little bit
of an abstraction in a second.

49
00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:49.526
So let's also import this getDatabase
that we have over in here,

50
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:55.646
and that, basically, it's getting
the instance of the SQLite database and

51
00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:59.898
setting up the table, and
a bunch of stuff like that.

52
00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:04.155
Cool, and then we gotta figure out
some types, if you're on databases,

53
00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:04.989
a little bit.

54
00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.119
Luckily, that's what the next section is.

55
00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.679
So we will handle that then.

56
00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.636
But let's make our point for now.

57
00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:16.275
So here we can export basically a context.

58
00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:20.872
Now, you ever use React or Svelte,

59
00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:24.097
or View, or any of them?

60
00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:26.285
You know what the context API is?

61
00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.173
Great, you're good.

62
00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:32.816
It's basically the same basic
idea which is some amount of

63
00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:36.045
stuff passed into everything, right?

64
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:39.361
So if those words look familiar to you,
great.

65
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:44.237
And so all we're doing here
is we're saying one of

66
00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:48.996
the things that is going to
be passed in to all of my

67
00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:54.120
TRPC procedures is access to the database,
right?

68
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.580
It could also be like an OpenAI client, or
Anthropic, or whatever, or the Twilio API.

69
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.079
Whatever you want to have available,
right,

70
00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.028
to all of your different procedures,
you pass in to the context.

71
00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:12.037
And then we've got this
fun little thing up here,

72
00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:17.005
which we are going to,
this is I think just a type, actually.

73
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.271
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
it doesn't really matter, but

74
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:27.687
I would hassle people in a code
review if they didn't do it, right?

75
00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:30.585
And all this does is take
the createContext and

76
00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:33.420
figure out what the type ought to be,
right?

77
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.860
And so you can see, hey, the Context is
they have access to a database, right?

78
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.685
So now you get that strong type.

79
00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:47.254
This could be third-party API clients,
SDKs, so on and so forth.

80
00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:48.454
You can do it all.

81
00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.101
This case we're just gonna
have access to the database.

82
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.035
In that chart we showed earlier,
it's gonna be good.

83
00:04:54.035 --> 00:05:02.742
Let's also give it this trpc-adapter,
right?

84
00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:04.762
There is, like I said,
just a little bit of boilerplate.

85
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:10.147
All we're trying to do here is create some
middleware for Express, that's it, right?

86
00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:13.098
This, we've got the context.

87
00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:14.658
We're gonna have the client,

88
00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:18.624
but we need Express to know that this is
a route that it should be able to handle.

89
00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:22.651
And again, we're not gonna lose any
of our previous REST endpoints.

90
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.213
We're just adding to it with
some additional functionality.

91
00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:31.786
So it's great because again, you can
either paper over an existing API, or you

92
00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:37.982
can choose to just do a various piecemeal
in small places where you need it.

93
00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:41.784
You don't have to buy in completely.

94
00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:48.279
So again, the only part that is kind
of somewhat unique to Express here,

95
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.862
which is createExpressMiddleware,
and we will.

96
00:06:01.674 --> 00:06:05.658
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I import
the router type from Express.

97
00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:11.111
That is the thing that does the get post
whatever for figuring out the routes.

98
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:13.391
Pull in that createContext.

99
00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:18.565
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Did I
not export it in there?

100
00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:20.215
I did, yeah.

101
00:06:20.215 --> 00:06:26.454
It's just that createContext is so
used all over the place.

102
00:06:26.454 --> 00:06:30.486
There are lots of different options, cool.

103
00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:35.942
And we have not done the router yet.

104
00:06:35.942 --> 00:06:40.833
We'll do that in a second, cool.

105
00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.448
So again, some of this is boilerplate
that you should probably copy and

106
00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:45.685
paste off the internet when
you're first getting started.

107
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:48.559
But that felt like
something I shouldn't do,

108
00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:53.802
even though I'm staring at notes where
I've clearly written down what I'm doing.

109
00:06:57.198 --> 00:07:01.065
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
we'll take the router.

110
00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:04.688
Actually, we needed this
to be a real thing.

111
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.011
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll create a new router in this case.

112
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.724
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not a duplicate one.

113
00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:24.610
So we'll say router.use,
and this is again,

114
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.245
we saw app.use before, an app is
effectively an abstraction over router.

115
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:30.946
We're just creating a piece of middleware.

116
00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:32.869
We'll say, /trpc.

117
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.448
You could do API/trpc.

118
00:07:34.448 --> 00:07:40.335
Whatever you want it to be,
this is up to you as we go through.

119
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.348
We're gonna do the other part in a second.

120
00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:47.846
I'm gonna yell that for a moment,
but we'll leave that there.

121
00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:52.314
CreateContext, cool, cool, cool.

122
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:54.732
Do I have enough closing braces?

123
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.165
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's just
probably not long enough.

124
00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:07.042
All right, I do need the app router,

125
00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:11.431
which we'll set up momentarily as well.

126
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:14.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You wanna
rename the other file to be-

127
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.206
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Context instead

128
00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:18.286
a content, probably.

129
00:08:24.049 --> 00:08:24.846
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
we'll call that context and

130
00:08:24.846 --> 00:08:25.518
we've got the adapter in a second.

131
00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:33.075
The other thing we need is to actually
define the actual API contract, right?

132
00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:37.918
And then we'll wire it all together.

133
00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:41.463
But like other than annoying boilerplate,

134
00:08:41.463 --> 00:08:45.308
we will see some of
the cool parts momentarily.

135
00:08:45.308 --> 00:08:47.537
Cool and so.

136
00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:56.826
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll take that initTRPC,
which is where I meant to write it.

137
00:08:56.826 --> 00:09:01.141
TRPC uses a fun library called zod to
do our schema validations to make sure

138
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:03.798
everything is the way we think it is,
right?

139
00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:09.393
Cool, and we'll probably end up pulling
in some of the schemas in a second.

140
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.613
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Context,
instead of being called content.

141
00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:24.414
And now we get to the point we initiate
the actual TRPC service itself,

142
00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:31.576
it will then again have access to the
database and we will be able to use it.

143
00:09:40.364 --> 00:09:43.119
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll export this.

144
00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:49.818
We have our app router, and this idea of
a publicly exposed procedure as well.

145
00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:51.517
You can also have private ones.

146
00:09:51.517 --> 00:09:54.271
And then you would have
a different router for

147
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:58.202
the various different nouns in
your application or the models.

148
00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:01.736
But what you can do is we'll
call this one just task router,

149
00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:05.985
since that seems to be the thing that
we were mostly doing at this point.

150
00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:11.348
Again, you could also, I won't make you do
it, because also tightness boilerplate,

151
00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:14.971
but exercise for the reader in
your copy as free time later,

152
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:18.755
is try it on the tiny little user
service that we made earlier.

153
00:10:18.755 --> 00:10:23.029
Cuz, yes we've got a full database and
all that kinda stuff, but

154
00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:27.007
you can do it absolutely anywhere
with the smallest things.
