00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.817
What we need to do, so as I said,
when you click the clear button,

2
00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:04.424
at this point nothing is happening.

3
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:09.413
So if we go into our index.js,
we're going to start by

4
00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:13.976
getting that clear button component or
element.

5
00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:17.254
So if we write clearButton,

6
00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:22.720
we're gonna get document.getElementById,

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.686
and it has an ID of clear-button.

8
00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:30.999
So this is our button to be
able to clear the canvas.

9
00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.100
And we're gonna add
an onclick event listener.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.347
So if we do clearButton.onclick,

11
00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:42.740
we are gonna have an arrow function.

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.086
And what we're going to do in there is,

13
00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:51.167
if you go back to the top of the file and

14
00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:58.039
import our resetCanvas function
from the utils file, okay?

15
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.196
So here we have the first function so
we're going to reset the canvas.

16
00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:11.174
And just to kind of prepare us for
the future state of our app, we're also

17
00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:17.740
going to clear the prediction that will
be displayed at the end of the exercise.

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.593
So under resetCanvas here,

19
00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:24.389
we're going to get the prediction
HTML element, so that's like a p tag.

20
00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:29.866
So if we do const and
then predictionParagraph or

21
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:35.752
yes, yeah,
predictionParagraph should be good.

22
00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:40.163
And we're getting the p tag that
has the class of prediction.

23
00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:44.830
So document.getElements, oops.

24
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.632
Okay, getElementsByClassName,
and then we're getting,

25
00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:53.709
the class name is prediction,
and we only have one.

26
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.708
So I could have used Id, just used class.

27
00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.845
So feel free to change
that later if you want.

28
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:02.030
But this element is actually going to,

29
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.673
once we have our model trained,
and we'll use it in the browser,

30
00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:09.931
this element will be used to kind of
display the prediction inside in the UI.

31
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:14.745
So this particular code right now,
is not going to, it's not really

32
00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:19.974
going to clear anything because we're
not yet ready to display predict but

33
00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:24.630
I'm just reading it now so
that then it'll be done already for us.

34
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.698
So we're gonna reset this
the textContent to zero so

35
00:02:27.698 --> 00:02:32.089
that later on when we draw our new shape,
and it will display a prediction,

36
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.803
when we clear, it clears both
the drawing and the prediction.

37
00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:40.381
And then I had another function here of

38
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:45.537
clearRect that comes from the utils file.

39
00:02:45.537 --> 00:02:49.678
So if you call it and you import it
from the utils and you call it here,

40
00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:54.548
what should happen now is that everything
should be figured when we are clicking

41
00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:55.582
on that button.

42
00:02:55.582 --> 00:03:01.682
So to make sure that it works, what we
can do is if you go back to the page and

43
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:06.882
you draw a shape like a square,
for example, and you clear and

44
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:12.791
it did not work, so I must have forgot and
something, sorry, my bad.

45
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.838
Here in the way that already
it should be just .js.

46
00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:21.901
If I remember correctly,
yes, sorry, so here, boom,

47
00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:26.341
and well, that's a bad square,
but yes, okay.

48
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:30.522
So if you clear the button,
it should actually be clearing the canvas.

49
00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.566
So again, just to recap,
we're importing resetCanvas and

50
00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:37.510
clear a rectangle from the utils function.

51
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.461
Maybe if you decide to then rewrite
everything, even the utils from

52
00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:46.197
scratch you might call your functions
differently or put everything together.

53
00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:49.656
But the next thing is that we're
getting our clearButton element, and

54
00:03:49.656 --> 00:03:52.595
when we're clicking on it,
we're resetting everything,

55
00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.607
including our future prediction
label that will be displayed
