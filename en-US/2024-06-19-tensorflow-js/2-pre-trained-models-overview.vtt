00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.980
As I said, the first thing that we're
gonna look into is pre-trained models.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.721
So if you've never heard
what a pre-trained model is,

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.470
it's a model that's already trained and
tested and it's ready to be used.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.079
So whoever built that model had
gathered the data and processed it and

5
00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.702
labeled it and then trained the model,

6
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:22.212
picked the structure of the model
that they wanted to use.

7
00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:25.988
And they tested it for good accuracy and
they're basically open sourcing it, or

8
00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:29.542
if you're doing it inside a company,
they're just making it available for

9
00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:30.552
people to use.

10
00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:34.740
So as a user, all you need to do is
to give it a new input of data and

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.812
it will give you a prediction.

12
00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:42.539
So it can be image recognition models,
it could be text classification models.

13
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.976
At the moment with the discussion
of large language models,

14
00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:51.893
that's that, it's models trained
with a lot of text data.

15
00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:53.544
And then when you ask it a question,

16
00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:57.963
it's able to make a correlation between
everything that it's been trained with.

17
00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:01.183
And you have also, yes,
sentiment analysis models,

18
00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:05.736
where it's been given a lot of data with
maybe labels of joy and happy and sad.

19
00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:07.746
So that would be more supervised learning.

20
00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:12.609
And when you're writing something,
it's able to kinda make a correlation and

21
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.906
give you a label of what you wrote was
happy or sad and things like that.

22
00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:19.279
So when you want to work
with pre-trained models,

23
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.183
there's different places
where you can find them.

24
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:27.677
One of them is Kaggle, and you can filter
out to only use Tensorflow GIS models,

25
00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.875
but there's a lot of
other models available,

26
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:35.067
and some of them are available
to work with more like Python.

27
00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:38.505
And some models would probably be
available with maybe a custom other

28
00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:43.447
library, but you can filter out to only
get the TensorFlow.js ones, if you want.

29
00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:47.762
And then, if I open the link, there is
actually, on GitHub, there is a specific

30
00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:51.607
repositories for all the models that
you can use with TensorFlow.js.

31
00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.615
And here, for example, pose detection,
which is one that I use,

32
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.135
but we can talk about that later.

33
00:01:56.135 --> 00:02:00.464
You can have face detection that we're
going to use in one of the projects.

34
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:05.494
And you can have a look here and have
a bit of fun and try different models.

35
00:02:05.494 --> 00:02:07.550
And then there's also hugging face,

36
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.234
which is a popular platform where
models are uploaded as well.

37
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.582
So you can have a look at what's there.

38
00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:15.323
Some of them will be
Tensorflow.js compatible and

39
00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:19.413
some of them you'll have to use another
tool, maybe you write some Python.

40
00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:23.240
Once you feel a bit more comfortable
with machine learning in general,

41
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.724
then you can play around
with different libraries.

42
00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:30.306
And in terms of choosing the right
model for you for what you wanna build,

43
00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:33.214
there's a few questions
that I usually ask myself.

44
00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:36.944
And the first one is,
what am I actually building?

45
00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:40.559
If I build something that uses images,
then obviously,

46
00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:45.399
I'm going to use a model that was trained
with images and not pieces of text.

47
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:49.801
But also, you have to think about
the quality of the training data.

48
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.431
And when I talk about quality as well,
it's if you want to build an application

49
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:59.202
where what you're recognizing is animals,
then you maybe don't want to look at

50
00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:03.852
a machine learning model that was trained
with images of cars, for example.

51
00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:08.571
Because it's not gonna be able to actually
predict an animal if it doesn't know what

52
00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:09.832
an animal is.

53
00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:12.692
And there's also the quantity
of the training data.

54
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.405
So the more data you have,
usually it's better, but

55
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:17.712
again, it's a mix of quantity and quality.

56
00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:20.926
If you have a lot of data but it's either
poorly labeled or it's not at all what

57
00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:24.257
you're actually trying to predict,
then it's not going to be helpful to you.

58
00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:29.422
And then what I sometimes like to see is I
can have access to the list of classes and

59
00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.517
labels that it was trained with.

60
00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:34.247
So for some models that
are open sourced by Google,

61
00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:38.987
you can have access to the list of classes
so you can see what it was trained with.

62
00:03:38.987 --> 00:03:43.267
And then you can see if what you're trying
to predict is in this class as well.

63
00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:46.986
And sometimes it's not available, so
sometimes you have to do extra research

64
00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:50.422
and see if you have access to maybe
the research paper that was written and

65
00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:52.527
then the open source,
the code out of that.

66
00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:55.957
But sometimes they don't give you the link
to the classes that it was trained with.

67
00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:58.692
So if you have access to that, it's great.

68
00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:01.687
Otherwise, give it a try and
see what happens.
