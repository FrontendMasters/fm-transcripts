00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.191
With that,
there's a couple of things that I built,

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:06.823
where I don't know if you remember,
that was early 2020.

3
00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:12.184
There was an Apple conference,
actually, WWDC 2020.

4
00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:16.295
And on the Apple Watch, they released
the thing where you could wash your hands.

5
00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:19.610
So I was watching the conference and
I was like, I think I can do that.

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.708
And I spent just a couple of hours
doing in JavaScript because I knew that

7
00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.631
this audio model was available.

8
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:27.652
So there's no sound hopefully.

9
00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.596
But you can see here, there's water.

10
00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:35.328
And then you have a countdown of,
yeah, 20 seconds,

11
00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:38.460
because I assumed, I wasn't sure.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.217
I did some research, I think they didn't
really explain how they built it, but

13
00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:48.052
I thought, well, the sound of water is
quite something that you can recognize.

14
00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:49.463
So you could train a model.

15
00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:54.295
And I don't know how much data
Apple actually used to train,

16
00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:59.331
but I only used my tap for,
I don't know, maybe 20 samples.

17
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:02.428
Obviously, it's a prototype,
it runs in the browser.

18
00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.398
But it means that, hey,

19
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.273
I didn't wanna have to buy an Apple
watch just to have this feature.

20
00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:09.541
So now because it's a website,
it also runs on a phone, so

21
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.168
I could have a phone
next to me in 20 seconds.

22
00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:17.758
And I just thought that it was nice that
if you know a bit of machine learning and

23
00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:23.786
JavaScript, you can rebuild things with no
team and no money, just me on my couch.

24
00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:28.737
So I just thought that it was
interesting to see that kind of idea,

25
00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.628
and kind of be able to bring it to life.

26
00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:34.511
And I think some people did
the same with coughing,

27
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.734
dictating that maybe someone is sick.

28
00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.622
And you can, I don't know, have an alert
that maybe someone has COVID ir something.

29
00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:44.477
So you can do the same, because you
can train a model about coughing.

30
00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:49.199
And another thing that I did is I was
reading a paper about what's called

31
00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.494
acoustic activity recognition.

32
00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:52.381
And that was super cool.

33
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:55.916
Again, the paper was not
implemented in JavaScript, but

34
00:01:55.916 --> 00:02:00.607
the point of it is to build potentially
better IoT home systems by being able to

35
00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:04.411
detect the activities that
you're doing around your house.

36
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.674
So for example, if you are watching
a recipe on the iPad and you're cooking at

37
00:02:08.674 --> 00:02:13.351
the same time, you don't want to go and
pause and you continue and then you pause.

38
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.672
So instead, you could use the sound
of the environment as an input.

39
00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:18.416
So if I'm chopping something,

40
00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:22.622
then you can even imagine the sound of
a knife on a cutting board, like [SOUND].

41
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:26.265
So that is kind of a different sound,
or the sound of a blender, or

42
00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:29.777
the sound of the door,
like opening the door of your fridge, or

43
00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:32.322
the microwave when it's done,
like [SOUND].

44
00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:36.894
It's like, you can recognize these
sounds and you can train a machine

45
00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:41.093
learning model to kind of end up
creating more smarter devices.

46
00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:45.188
So instead of buying a smart fridge and
a smart coffee machine and a smart

47
00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:49.984
dishwasher or whatever, you could have
almost like a unique system that listens.

48
00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:53.842
And it will be able to alert you about
things without you having to spend a lot

49
00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:57.211
of money on ton of different IoT
devices that work differently and

50
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.311
then your data is sold to a lot of people.
