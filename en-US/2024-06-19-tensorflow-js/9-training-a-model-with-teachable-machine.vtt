1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.097
We're gonna get started on the actual
project two that's gonna cover how

2
00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:08.180
to do transfer learning in TensorFlow.js.

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.898
So as I've said before,
we're gonna start with the maybe easier

4
00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.807
way to get started with
this relatively quickly and

5
00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:20.139
then we're going to try to actually
implement it kind of almost from scratch.

6
00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:25.989
So if you start by going to
teachablemachine.withgoogle.com,

7
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.649
you should arrive on this homepage here.

8
00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.072
And then if you click on the Get Started,
you have the option between the three

9
00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:39.359
different types of model
that you want to retrain.

10
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.329
We're gonna use the image project but
I can talk a bit later.

11
00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.699
I've also used the audio project, before.

12
00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.179
I haven't used post project but
that could be, cool as well.

13
00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.232
But for
our specific project number two here,

14
00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:54.969
we're going to click on image project.

15
00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.726
And don't really worry like we're
gonna pick the standard image model

16
00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:00.724
because we're using browser.

17
00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:03.846
If you were working with macro
controllers such as like an Arduino,

18
00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:08.334
you probably would want the embedded image
model because they are a lot smaller.

19
00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.944
So they can run on
something like an Arduino.

20
00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:15.344
And I can talk about that
a little bit after as well.

21
00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:17.608
But here because we're in the browser,

22
00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:20.694
we're going to run
the standard image mode.

23
00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:25.258
And you should be on this page here that
will allow us to create a custom model and

24
00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:27.044
then export it.

25
00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:29.091
So in terms of classes, to get started,

26
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.394
we're just gonna train
two different labels.

27
00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:37.824
So I'm gonna do the same thing that I did
before with like tilting right and left.

28
00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:40.594
You can do whatever you want
if you want to do that I

29
00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:43.364
don't know right hand
left hand like whatever,

30
00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:47.166
as long as you remember later maybe
what labels you actually used.

31
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:52.326
But if I just use the label right here,
so here what you're editing

32
00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:56.934
is the name of your label that
what you're gonna get later as

33
00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:02.656
a prediction from your model, and
I'm going to enable the webcam.

34
00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.476
You should be seeing your camera feed.

35
00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:08.596
And here you have some settings,
I rarely change them.

36
00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:11.336
They're just the frame per seconds.

37
00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:14.656
Here you have just a UI thing that
you want to hold it to record.

38
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:17.816
And I think if you don't,
it will just always record.

39
00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.700
But I don't know, I just keep it simple.

40
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.370
And there's a delay of two seconds.

41
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.100
It's like every two seconds,
it just snaps a picture.

42
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.110
And a duration six seconds,

43
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.160
I think you can maybe record
the maximum of six seconds.

44
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.650
I'm not sure because here it's like,
seemed to kind of be disabled.

45
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.994
I think it actually is faster cuz
when I was showing you before,

46
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:42.489
if you hold the button, it just like text
snapshots way more often than two seconds.

47
00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.845
So I think that if you, it looks like
they don't let you edit that anymore, but

48
00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:48.957
at the time you could, if you wanted.

49
00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:50.791
&gt;&gt; Disable the hold to record.

50
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.139
&gt;&gt; Okay, and that will be, okay, right.

51
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.059
So that then, okay.

52
00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:57.339
So maybe you hold and then it records too,
and then it breaks and then you can, yeah.

53
00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.119
So we don't need to do that right now.

54
00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:00.608
You can play with that later on.

55
00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:05.618
For what we're recording, just holding and
tilting, that should be enough.

56
00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:08.588
So I'm just gonna leave it, leave it on.

57
00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.758
So I'm just wanted to
show you the settings.

58
00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:14.078
Okay, so personally,
I'm gonna do, right, left.

59
00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:17.580
So I'm gonna hold and I'm gonna remove
my hand just to have my face on it.

60
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.394
And it's like, hold, and
let's just do 30 samples.

61
00:03:22.394 --> 00:03:23.234
I mean, 30 is fine for me.

62
00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:24.934
If you have more, don't worry about it.

63
00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:28.303
If it's like 28 or 32 or 53, it's okay.

64
00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:31.208
Usually the more samples
you have the better, but

65
00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.320
it's something that you can
also play with as you go,

66
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.955
because it also depends on what's in
the behind in the background in the image,

67
00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:42.511
like here, I'm taking most of
the space in the webcam feed.

68
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.701
So it should be it should be okay.

69
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:48.446
But if there's more elements that are
being snapshotted sometimes you might need

70
00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:52.351
more samples for the model to be
able to find patterns in the images.

71
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:57.610
So for the first sample,
I have it here 30 image samples

72
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.331
right as the label, and
we can record another one.

73
00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:06.201
I'm gonna call it left, and
I'm gonna do the same thing.

74
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.691
So again, enable the camera.

75
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:11.001
I'm gonna tilt my head left,
I'm gonna record.

76
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:14.411
We'll have 29, 29 is fine as well.

77
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.291
Again, as I was saying, you don't
necessarily need the exact same number.

78
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:22.783
But if one of them ends up being 100 and
the other one is 20, it means that you're

79
00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:26.137
gonna feed more data about like
left to the model than right, so

80
00:04:26.137 --> 00:04:30.931
it's going to impact the your prediction
that you're gonna get or the accuracy.

81
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:35.001
Because again, you could think of it as
when you learn something new, totally new,

82
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:38.288
not a metronome audio like your
brain you'll learn something new.

83
00:04:38.288 --> 00:04:41.456
If I'm repeating something only
once to you versus ten times,

84
00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:44.801
you may be more likely to remember
the thing that I told you ten times

85
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.187
then the thing that you only learned once.

86
00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.797
So it's kind of you can think
of it the same way as well.

87
00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:53.937
So if you're roughly around the same
number, it should be okay as well.

88
00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:57.297
And later on, if you play more with this,

89
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:02.097
you'll also realize that it's
easier to predict things if

90
00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:06.911
you have two labels or
two images that are quite different.

91
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.229
So for example, if I have my hand
just in front of my Facebook one and

92
00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.186
then it's just slightly to the right,

93
00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:15.971
it's not going to be as accurate as
if I really do right and then left.

94
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:19.810
So if the changes between your images
are subtle, you'll probably want to record

95
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.437
more images so that you can really find
the pattern of your movement in there.

96
00:05:24.597 --> 00:05:29.767
But for now, hopefully you've had
the time to record two different samples.

97
00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:33.879
And the next thing that we need to do
is only to click the train button and

98
00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.245
just do not close your tab so
that it's going to go live in the browser.

99
00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:42.235
Training the model, and
it should turn on right away.

100
00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:45.415
So you can see here, okay,
it's not too confused.

101
00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:47.415
If I do that it's like 100% to the right.

102
00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:51.607
If I do that 100% to the left, if I'm in
the middle, you can see that it's like,

103
00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:55.175
I don't know, and he thinks it'd be
more to the right then to the left.

104
00:05:55.175 --> 00:06:01.401
So if I do this, sometimes so again,
there's only 30 images that we trained.

105
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:03.961
And there, we could do a lot more.

106
00:06:03.961 --> 00:06:08.424
But it means that if I want to build a
website that is controlled by the gesture

107
00:06:08.424 --> 00:06:13.233
of my head, I'll know for example, if we
wanted, I'm not gonna do that now, but

108
00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:17.554
we could add a class where my head is
just in the center, so that then we will

109
00:06:17.554 --> 00:06:22.227
really have, let's say the full extent
of the movements that I could have, but

110
00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:26.083
we're just gonna keep it like two for
now, okay.

111
00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.870
So if it is working well for you,

112
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.033
we have a nice little button here
that it's called export model.

113
00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:36.538
And what we're going to do, we're not
going to upload it you have two options so

114
00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:40.826
you can upload it to the cloud on some
Google Drive or you can download it.

115
00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:44.346
So what we're gonna do,
we're gonna download it so

116
00:06:44.346 --> 00:06:47.676
that we can have it, on our laptop.

117
00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:51.441
Sometimes if you just, want to be
able to access it from anywhere or

118
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.946
anything like that, or if you want to go
to production and you don't want to have

119
00:06:55.946 --> 00:07:00.516
a heavy model in your folders or anything
if you want to, if the model is a big one,

120
00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:04.774
and you don't want to upload it to GitHub,
you can just share it in a link.

121
00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:08.027
But for our purposes,
we're going to select download,

122
00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:10.344
and we're going to download our model.

123
00:07:11.624 --> 00:07:17.863
It should be downloaded as
a zip file that you can.

124
00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:21.748
I'll just double click,
and if I go into my repo,

125
00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:25.123
I'm gonna switch or in my terminal.

126
00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:28.113
I'm gonna get out of project 1.

127
00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:30.533
Go into project 2.

128
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.653
Open the folder, and
I'm just going to drag it in.

129
00:07:35.813 --> 00:07:40.178
So what you should have at this point in
project 2 is some of the files that we're

130
00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:42.027
going to add content to.

131
00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:45.167
And here,
we now have the folder with our model.

132
00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:48.757
I'm just going to rename it to my model.

133
00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:53.079
And that will just be important, just
because when we then import the model into

134
00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:56.147
our code, you just have to
give the path to the folder.

135
00:07:56.147 --> 00:07:59.210
So you don't have to call it my model,
you can leave it like this and

136
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.320
just update the code later or
call it just model.

137
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.300
But at this point, we have downloaded
our model from Teachable Machine.

138
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.910
So I'm just gonna close the tab,
we don't need it anymore.

139
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.583
And now we can move on to actually
start writing our project to code.
