00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:06.667
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This course is gonna be
picking up where I left off with the last

2
00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.230
course, as far as GraphQL goes.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.310
I was talking about things like fragments
and all this crazy stuff that I didn't

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.900
really get to, we're gonna start
talking about some of that stuff today.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.090
So yeah, there is an expectation that you
should know a little bit about GraphQL,

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.110
but if you don't, don't worry.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.940
This first section is gonna
be dedicated just for you and

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.490
we're gonna go through building some
simple things just to get you going.

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.900
Other than that, yeah,

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.270
we're gonna lead all the way
down to just applicable things.

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.160
The stuff that I'm gonna be teaching
in this course is stuff that you can

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.060
apply today.

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.210
It's not gonna be like theoretical,
here's how you could do this.

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.170
Like no, you can apply this stuff and

15
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.740
actually a lot of the code
that I'm gonna be using and

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.160
that you'll be seeing in the curriculum
is straight from the repo at my company.

17
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.240
So it's literally applicable code,
things that we use in production

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.990
every single day, and
that's kind of how I like to teach.

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.460
Let's jump into it,
everybody should have the repo,

20
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.630
it's gonna be broken down into,
I think there's five lessons on there.

21
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.880
And the first one we're gonna be
covering is basically just getting warm

22
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880
with GraphQL, getting back up to speed.

23
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.590
Just going over the things that
we all have a nice foundation and

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.180
we're all on the same page and then
we'll hit the ground running from there.

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.270
So I decided not to do slides for this
because again, a lot of this is advanced,

26
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.800
they're really, the best way to show you
is just to get in and dive or dive in and

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.040
get going.

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.130
So there's this website
called howtographql.com,

29
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.920
we're not gonna go over it right now but
this is a really good resource.

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.690
That if you're like, new to GraphQL,
you're just starting to learn or you've

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.400
got some holes in your logic because
you've maybe used GraphQL on a client but

32
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.850
you've never actually experienced
building a server with GraphQL,

33
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.230
this is the place to go check it out.

34
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.760
So, yeah I would definitely go
check it out, but basically,

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.900
we're just gonna run
through this right now, or

36
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.960
I'm gonna run through a lot of
this stuff right now with my code.

37
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.345
And we're just gonna build a baseline and
I'm gonna set you off free and

38
00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:03.302
you're gonna do a hello world example.

39
00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:06.880
So again, this course is only
gonna be focused on GraphQL APIs,

40
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.350
we're not gonna be talking
about any GraphQL clients.

41
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.390
So there's no front end component here,
there's no Apollo on the front end.

42
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.990
There' no JavaScript frameworks,
this is purely just APIs.

43
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.610
Towards the end,

44
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.600
if anybody wants to talk about like
how does this work on a frontend and

45
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.320
different strategies for that,
I'm more than happy to talk about it.

46
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.230
Maybe that's another course but
this course is only for the APIs.
