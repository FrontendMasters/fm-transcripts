&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So this one is pretty cool.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.020
It's basically GraphQL folks.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.580
Basically pivoting over to
this really great team, but

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.060
basically what they're doing is, given
a GraphQL schema definition language,

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.440
so a schema, basically what they'll do
is create a GraphQL database for you.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.860
So what does that actually mean?

7
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.020
So right now I think it only works
with SQL and SQL based databases,

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.490
they're working on many databases.

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.300
But you know where we had to write
the queries to interact with our database?

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.470
What they would do instead is, the ORM

11
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.700
that you interact with the database is
GraphQL, it's type, check, GraphQL.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.200
So it's aware of the shape of your data.

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.335
So it's basically just converting.

14
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.536
You give it a GraphQL schemer,
and it gives you a GraphQL API.

15
00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.160
And that's how you interact
with the database.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.120
There's no other code in between.

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.280
It's really cool.

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.630
And it's open source, I think they
working on some hosted solutions soon.

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.520
Really soon actually.

20
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.142
And yeah,
I highly recommend checking it out.

21
00:01:02.142 --> 00:01:03.150
Pretty cool stuff.
