00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.438
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
if you run the Yarn dev command,

2
00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:03.470
you're probably gonna get an error.

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.678
It's asking you to put some type of token.

4
00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:09.680
That's because we're gonna be using
the GitHub API in this course.

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.127
So you need to supply
the repo with a GitHub token.

6
00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:16.822
If you look at the .env-sample file.

7
00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:19.915
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You'll see this right here,
it says GITHUB_TOKEN,

8
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.090
add-your-github-token-here.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.687
So you can just copy this.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.934
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
add this to another file called .env.

11
00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.910
I'm not gonna click on it
because my token is in there.

12
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.928
Make another file called .env and paste
the contents of .env-sample in there.

13
00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:40.310
That's the first step.

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.717
The second step is to actually
go to GitHub, go into settings,

15
00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:46.306
Developer settings.

16
00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:50.354
Create a new token with public repo
access and paste that token in there, and

17
00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:51.940
then that's it.

18
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.935
So I'm just gonna walk through
GitHub how you would do that.

19
00:00:53.935 --> 00:01:01.416
So if you go to GitHub,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You

20
00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.120
click on your Profile here.

21
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.082
You click on Settings.

22
00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:10.178
You click on Developer Settings, and
you click on Personal Access Tokens,

23
00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:14.080
and then you just click
on Generate New Token.

24
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.005
Once you click on that, give it a name,
you can call it whatever you want.

25
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:22.580
[COUGH] And the only one you need
to check is public_repo, that's it.

26
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.952
You don't need to check anything else.

27
00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:28.650
In fact, I wouldn't check anything else,
it's not safe.

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.992
And again, add that to your .env file,

29
00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:40.466
with the same syntax here,
GITHUB_TOKEN equals that token.

30
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.737
And don't worry,
that .env file is not checked in the Git,

31
00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:47.220
which is why you probably don't have one,
so you gotta make it.
