00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Scott: But again,
to make sure everybody's on the same page.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.433
There's an exercise that I want everyone
to do where it's basically gonna be

3
00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:07.903
creating a hello world server.

4
00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:12.774
So if you go to the repo and you check out

5
00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:18.453
lesson-1,
&gt;&gt; Scott: I thought I had it,

6
00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:19.310
let me open it.

7
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.694
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go, okay,
yeah, you check out lesson-1,

8
00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:33.180
there is a lot of stuff here.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.520
Feel free to go look at some of the stuff,
but don't mess with, just look at it.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.279
But basically, what you're gonna
be doing is, there's a folder in

11
00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:50.790
source/api/project, and
in that folder, there's some files.

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.278
What you're gonna be doing is,
inside that project.graphql file and

13
00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:59.635
the project.resolver file,
you're just gonna do what I just did.

14
00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:03.400
You're gonna make whatever query you want,
whatever mutation you want.

15
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.460
You just need to get something working,
everything's already hooked up.

16
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.760
You don't have to connect
anything to the server,

17
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.480
you don't have to figure out
how all that stuff works.

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.108
You just need to fill up these two files,

19
00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:21.678
the project.graphql file and
the project.resolver file.

20
00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:24.195
That's all you gotta do,
you can put whatever you want there,

21
00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:25.380
just get familiar with it.

22
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.720
Make some resolvers,
make some mutations, make some queries.

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.230
Once you get that,
the command you're gonna run,

24
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.168
if you look in the package.json.

25
00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:38.286
It's gonna be, if they're using yarn,
it'll be yarndev, if you're using mpm,

26
00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:39.420
it'll be mpmrundev.

27
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.520
That'll start you off in dev mode in
nodemon, so it's constantly reloading,

28
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.610
so you don't have to save.

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.348
And then you can just go to
localhost:5000/docs to open up

30
00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:52.958
your graphical instance,
and you can see that.

31
00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.113
So I'm just gonna check out my lesson
branch so we can see what it will look

32
00:01:56.113 --> 00:02:01.289
like
&gt;&gt; Scott: I

33
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.961
guess I gotta check out, there we go.

34
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.526
So if I were to run the demo,

35
00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:16.126
go to 5000,
&gt;&gt; Scott: /docs,

36
00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:20.283
all right, so I'm just gonna
show you my hello world query.

37
00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:25.270
Which is basically just hello world,
and we can look at the schema.

38
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.530
Returns a type called hello world
as a message that's a string.

39
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.993
And I can just type in message here,
run the query, and then I get hello world.

40
00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:38.828
So yeah, do something similar to this,
do a mutation, do a couple of mutations or

41
00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:39.968
a couple queries.

42
00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:43.870
You don't even need a database,
you can do it all in memory, and

43
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.543
just get familiar with it.

44
00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:50.210
So it is 10:10 now let's take
30 minutes to do this, and

45
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.480
then we'll come back and we'll get going.
