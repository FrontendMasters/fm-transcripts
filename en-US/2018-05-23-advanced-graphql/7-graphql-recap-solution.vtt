00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.990
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so welcome back.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.600
Hopefully we have enough time to people to
get lost in GraphQL and do some things.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.995
Did anybody get to the part where
they were making subscriptions?

4
00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:15.120
[LAUGH] Anybody make subscriptions?

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.588
Okay, cool, cuz I didn't ask you to
make subscriptions, and if you did,

6
00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:19.480
that's awesome.

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.449
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
I've done that before.

8
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.081
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Yeah, cuz we're not
gonna be doing subscriptions here, but

9
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:29.492
that's awesome if you did, cuz GraphQL
will support subscriptions out the box.

10
00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.721
Okay, cool, so
I'm just gonna walk through, again,

11
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.210
just some helloWorld stuff.

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.450
Walk through kinda like what I did and
just get started with this, and then,

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.870
we'll move on to the next lesson.

14
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.380
So, as far as kinda like what I did here,
I had this helloWorld thing.

15
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.840
Actually, let's go look
at this right here.

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.690
So, I just have a basic query.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.420
This is simple, but
there's some small nuances in here, right?

18
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.820
Like, for instance, let me ask you this,
if I were to say helloWorld took

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.900
an argument, and let's say it took
a message, and it's typed with String.

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.250
Right, let's say I did that.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.079
Then if I go back into the playground,
actually, okay,

22
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.960
let me go back to the playground.

23
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.100
And if I don't pass the argument here,
do you expect GraphQL to freak out?

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.080
No, yes?

25
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.470
Who says no?

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.920
GraphiQL's not gonna freak out,
because I don't pass the argument.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.449
Who says yes?

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.820
Okay, you can't not be no or yes.

29
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.090
It's either yes or no.

30
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was the query
definition, I missed it.

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.986
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The query definition-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is bangless, right?

32
00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:44.188
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's just
just message: String.

33
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't
think it'll freak out.

34
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.300
I think it'll let it work.

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.410
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Why do you think that?

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because String
is not required.

37
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.561
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, exactly,
I didn't make it required, so

38
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.472
is there a period there?

39
00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.146
What is that?

40
00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.140
No, is that just me?

41
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.055
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, I see it.

42
00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:04.793
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

43
00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:06.820
I'm like, what is that?

44
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.960
That's the tab link, okay, yeah,

45
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.890
so you can see it's running just fine,
because there's no bang.

46
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.320
But if I do add that thing, and
I try to run this, let me refresh.

47
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.510
And I try to run this,
okay, did it not refresh?

48
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.531
Let me restart this.

49
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

50
00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:34.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There we go.
And

51
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.840
you can see it's already like erroring out
here, like, you need to add a thing here.

52
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.710
So that's just like a small nuance,
so those non node characters can make

53
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540
a big difference in how people can
consume your data, so use them carefully.

54
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.590
And we'll see more examples of that.

55
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.890
So that's for query, and then for
mutation, it's pretty much the same here.

56
00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:05.919
Make a mutation, we can call it newAnimal,

57
00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.890
take some args, call it input,
we'll make some

58
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.149
inputs here,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: NewAnimal.

59
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.452
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Inputs, and do a name.

60
00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:25.170
Cool.

61
00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:29.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And now, you can do this.

62
00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:32.310
Okay, so here's the question now,
so knowing what we just find out,

63
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.340
now that this newAnimal mutation,
it also does not have a bang, but

64
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.510
it's input has a field
called name that has a bang.

65
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.500
So will GraphQL freak out
if I don't supply an input?

66
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.250
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No.

67
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why is that?

68
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.680
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The input's not required,

69
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.480
if you provide an input,
then you have to provide the name.

70
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's right,
yeah, that's exactly right.

71
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.160
Yeah, just wanted to make
sure you all are following.

72
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.190
So yeah, that's exactly right.

73
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.540
The input itself is not required, cuz
there's no exclamation here, so therefore,

74
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.290
I don't need to pass it.

75
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.940
But it's a mutation, so if you don't
pass an input, then what are you doing?

76
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.230
So you kind of have to pass
an input on a mutation,

77
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.771
otherwise you don't know
where you're mutating.

78
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.980
Cool, any questions on like just getting
started with this and how this works?

79
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.320
If you took a tour of the repo, and

80
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.300
you're just looking at it
like what is going on here?

81
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.180
I'm also open to answer
some of those questions.

82
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.620
If you have them, but let's just
get started with this next session.

83
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.510
And then, when I give you a walk through
of what you're gonna be doing next,

84
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.880
which is gonna be actually
utilizing this repo and

85
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.450
taking advantage of it, Aand not so
much this helloWorld stuff.

86
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.290
I can kinda walk through what
these different files and

87
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.130
different things are doing.

88
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.440
So you can save them for that part.
