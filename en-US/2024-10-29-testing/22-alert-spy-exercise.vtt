1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll
start with this one.

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.354
This is it's technically react,
but it doesn't matter, umm.

3
00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:14.120
Which is we want to just spy on
our good friend alert, right?

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.347
And so this one,
I'll kind of get us started with it, and

5
00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:21.469
then we'll take it for a spin from there,
umm, should render an alert.

6
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:22.899
Button should trigger an alert.

7
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.811
The only thing that you will need,
umm, be honest is just,

8
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:33.159
the ability to type into a field, right?

9
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.268
And so if we look at this function,

10
00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:43.088
we've got a input labeled message, right?

11
00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:47.781
And so just to review, we're going to say.

12
00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:54.928
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Const input equals, umm,
we got to render this component too.

13
00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:05.783
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we're gonna render the alert button.

14
00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:07.953
The input, I will start you out with.

15
00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:11.403
I'm going to do everything but
the mocking for you at this point.

16
00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:18.223
The input is, a, screen get by label.

17
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:25.885
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Get my message.

18
00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:31.373
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's
do that act in this.

19
00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:32.135
This'll probably work.

20
00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:34.175
Let's be good people.

21
00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:41.799
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Act.

22
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so this is also a sync.

23
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
here we'll take the input.

24
00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:10.764
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so
now we can type in that field and

25
00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:17.832
then we also need that
button that we saw earlier.

26
00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:20.612
So let's go take a look at what that is.

27
00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:22.112
It is called trigger alert.

28
00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:37.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [INAUDIBLE]
button

29
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.543
with the name.

30
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'm gonna put
a dot only on this one real quick.

31
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.773
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's the only
one we care about right now.

32
00:02:57.773 --> 00:02:58.550
And make sure I'm in there.

33
00:03:04.513 --> 00:03:07.473
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: User vata,
type into the input field.

34
00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:13.623
Okay, so at this point, it's not doing,
it's not triggering the button.

35
00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:17.591
What we wanna do is we got some of
the Dom testing stuff in place, which is,

36
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.608
we're getting the input field,
we are typing into it.

37
00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.832
And we know that works,
cuz if it couldn't find the field, or

38
00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:27.431
it couldn't find the button,
the test would have blown up, right?

39
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.211
And we know that it's typing
into the input field, right?

40
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:36.183
I mean, after that, we also wanna click
on the button, but we wanna do a spy on

41
00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:41.108
alert, and did it get called with
the thing we were expecting, right?

42
00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:45.217
And that's gonna be our kind of, so
we need to, if we think about what we did

43
00:03:45.217 --> 00:03:50.348
with like spying on log, right, we need
to spy on log, or in this point, alert.

44
00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:55.098
And we just wanna verify that when we
click the button, alert got called, right?

45
00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:00.501
So, things that I will once again show
you to prime your brain correctly, umm,

46
00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:05.055
which is, if we went back to that scratch
pad, actually I'll just put it up here.

47
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.019
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is
what we wrote earlier.

48
00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.880
All right,
if you wanna mock out the implementation,

49
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.265
you can do mock implementation as well.

50
00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.252
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: With
whatever you want it to do.

51
00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:22.742
I don't know if we really care, but that's
effectively for spying on a built in.

52
00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:26.758
Cuz again, we couldn't really test
whether not alert was called anyway,

53
00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:28.282
we'll spy on it.

54
00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:32.509
And we wanna do is be able to one
figure out how to click that button,

55
00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.493
which we know how to do, and then we wanna
assert that alert was actually called

56
00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:41.522
with the message that it should
have been called with, right?

57
00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.884
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Click on the button and
look and

58
00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.582
see if alert was called with the message.

59
00:04:49.092 --> 00:04:49.592
Cool.

60
00:04:55.032 --> 00:04:56.913
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so let's,
let's play around with this one.

61
00:04:56.913 --> 00:05:00.207
Then we'll look at a few
more kind of ideas and

62
00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:04.283
a few other kind of fun
things along the way.

63
00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:11.323
All right, so we wanted to make sure that
alert was in fact called in this case.

64
00:05:11.323 --> 00:05:15.062
So we do know that we will need
to go ahead and hit the button.

65
00:05:23.843 --> 00:05:27.683
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, but
we haven't actually spied on and

66
00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:31.741
subbed out what alert
does in this case either.

67
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:36.881
To be clear in JSDOM,
I don't know if calling

68
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:42.577
alert does anything like,
because there's no.

69
00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.504
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean,
not like not in a fake DOM though.

70
00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:49.274
I don't really don't know what happens.

71
00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:51.831
Let me tell you how often I use
alert on a day-to-day basis,

72
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.955
but we logged on console log and
I was like, what's the only other thing?

73
00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:57.286
Cool.

74
00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:03.083
So in this case,
what we'll do is we'll say,

75
00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:08.148
like, alert spy, and we'll say.

76
00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:17.477
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: VI spy on the only like,
that point alerts on window.

77
00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:24.885
And I don't know if it needs
a mock implementation.

78
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:29.113
Let's find out if it blows up on us.

79
00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:29.708
Cool.

80
00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:31.875
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And.

81
00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:36.253
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
now what we should be able to.

82
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:40.325
Do is expect alerts by.

83
00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:47.024
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: To have been called.

84
00:06:47.024 --> 00:06:49.633
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And you could argue
that this could be one one expectation.

85
00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:52.602
But just to make a point, alerts by--.

86
00:06:57.807 --> 00:07:01.787
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's just alert,
spy, it's just a large spy.

87
00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:05.619
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's

88
00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:12.867
interesting.

89
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:16.447
Like I called with alert,
exclamation point.

90
00:07:16.447 --> 00:07:18.302
Hello.

91
00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:23.485
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Because it starts
out with a message in there,

92
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.871
super interesting.

93
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:26.421
Nice to know.

94
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:31.121
I like this because we're going to play
around with this for a few reasons.

95
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:36.861
So I could like, you know what I can do?

96
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:37.771
Here's a bonus.

97
00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:40.743
User event, fun thing.

98
00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:46.473
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Take that input and
clear it out.

99
00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:51.233
Like you can interact with the DOM

100
00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:55.484
any way a user would, right?

101
00:07:55.484 --> 00:08:00.061
We'll go ahead and clear it out.

102
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:03.943
And now we got called, correctly, which
again was my test technically helping me

103
00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:07.316
by showing me that there was
an inflammation to think that I, you know,

104
00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:11.581
it's like we joke about how future you
forgets what current you is doing.

105
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:17.911
See also right now, so like, show of
hands, like who feels good about this?

106
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:19.003
Like who feels.

107
00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:20.968
I love this lifestyle for myself.

108
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:24.623
&gt;&gt; Student 1: [LAUGH] This one
specifically, or just testing in general?

109
00:08:24.623 --> 00:08:27.321
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Testing, no,
this, like, the idea that we're,

110
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.733
trying to take third party stuff and
control it and hope for the best.

111
00:08:32.173 --> 00:08:33.063
Probably not, right?

112
00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:37.463
And this is where that those injection
pieces can kind of become interesting.

113
00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:41.890
Because here I'm like,
hoping that I can grab on window alert.

114
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.960
Then like calling and
all those kinds of things.

115
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.880
And it's just like,
with all of that, again,

116
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.240
the more of the outside world we try
to simulate, the harder it gets.

117
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.630
I would rather pass in
functionality that I need.

118
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.066
And you can have a default
to stuff very easily.

119
00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:02.458
So like,
maybe it is like one of those like,

120
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:06.961
umm, this is really a form so
we'll do on submit, right?

121
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:11.774
Wouldn't it be nicer if we could
pass in on submit that maybe

122
00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:17.083
defaults to alerting, but
we could pass in some functionality.

123
00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:19.940
And we could say like, message.

124
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, instead of
that default alert in there, right?

125
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.220
And take all the stuff that
you can't really control.

126
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.440
If you pass that stuff in, and this works
for React components, as well as it works

127
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.130
for object-oriented programming,
as well as it works for anything.

128
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.830
We could just pass in a function to
generate a random number to that

129
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.142
character that maybe if you
pass in nothing, it is maybe.

130
00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:43.912
It's math.random, but
you could pass in something else as well.

131
00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:47.539
And then giving that control to
the person using it instead of like, hey,

132
00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:50.012
we do all this stuff that
you can't really get at.

133
00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:55.152
And if you can do all these weird tricks,
and then maybe one day you can use it.

134
00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:57.805
So we can say like const handle submit.

135
00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.764
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll pass that in.

136
00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:11.301
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now we've got a
function where we're gonna pass in all of

137
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.466
that kind of other stuff.

138
00:10:14.216 --> 00:10:17.556
Maybe we'll make this.

139
00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.937
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Default, message.

140
00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.343
Cool, cool, cool.

141
00:10:23.343 --> 00:10:29.337
Now this will fail cuz we don't
even have an alert spy anymore.

142
00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:34.287
So the other one, like we talked about,
test driven development, right?

143
00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:37.058
Where you write the test and
then make it pass,

144
00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:39.913
that also works for
refactorings too, right?

145
00:10:39.913 --> 00:10:43.336
Or bug-like cases where cool,
there is a bug,

146
00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:49.813
write a test about the way you wish the
world worked and then manifest it, right?

147
00:10:49.813 --> 00:10:52.417
So in this case, we can say that,

148
00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:56.603
that handle submit to have been called and
then--.

149
00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:03.958
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Handle submit to
have been called with Hello, right?

150
00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:09.161
This will fail because, like, right now,
this component has no idea about

151
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:14.878
taking props, right, which, you know,
it never got called, so on and so forth.

152
00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:15.848
It is trying to call alert.

153
00:11:15.848 --> 00:11:18.883
It's pretty angry about that as well.

154
00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:25.889
So in this place, we can just

155
00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:31.491
go ahead and just say--.

156
00:11:47.668 --> 00:11:51.253
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
now we're gonna actually say handle--.

157
00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:54.581
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's unsubmit, right.

158
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:06.764
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And my test pass again
cuz now instead of trying to grab built-in

159
00:12:06.764 --> 00:12:11.082
objects, I'm just passing in
the functions that I should call, right?

160
00:12:11.082 --> 00:12:14.433
So a lot of times you find yourself doing
the things of like mocking and something

161
00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:18.327
that stress you out and make you confused,
you know what the right answer is?

162
00:12:18.327 --> 00:12:19.430
Don't do it [LAUGH].

163
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.847
Right, because if it's like not simple,
you know who's gonna be confused?

164
00:12:23.847 --> 00:12:25.597
You a few months after you write it,right?

165
00:12:25.597 --> 00:12:28.144
If you want to be able to like,
hey, call the function,

166
00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:30.097
make it something you can pass in.

167
00:12:30.097 --> 00:12:33.017
If it's supposed to use a random number,
have that be a function.

168
00:12:33.017 --> 00:12:34.272
It can default to alert.

169
00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:39.135
It can default to console log,
it can default to math.random, but

170
00:12:39.135 --> 00:12:43.595
if you pass in values and
you have more control.
