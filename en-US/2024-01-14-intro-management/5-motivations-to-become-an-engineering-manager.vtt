00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.704
Becoming an engineering manager,
let's talk about the common motivation for

2
00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.130
people.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.040
They show up in control,
people think they're more in control.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.524
They think there's more money,
they're prestige,

5
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:18.230
bigger impacts, yeah, maybe or maybe not.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.260
Growth, and the challenge of doing it.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.570
A common motivation of people who come
into engineering manager, control.

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.320
I'll be in charge,
I'll be the shot caller for the team.

9
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.080
The truth is,
you have less control than you did before.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.215
Because here's the truth about dealing
with people, and something that if you

11
00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:45.820
haven't thought about it until now,
this is gonna blow your mind.

12
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.426
You can't make anybody do anything,
and you're,

13
00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:57.550
yeah, I can bribe somebody and
they'll do something.

14
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.237
I'm, you still can't make them do
anything, they're still making a choice.

15
00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:06.157
I can twist their arm and
yeah, you can say injure them,

16
00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:11.007
I don't recommend doing that, but
you can or you can threaten them.

17
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.528
But you still can't make them do anything
they're still making a choice there,

18
00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:18.930
sometimes it's a non choice, but
you still can't make anybody do anything.

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.080
And this is the truth of dealing with
people, is you have to convince them.

20
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.393
You have to figure out
what's their motivation and

21
00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.530
try to get them to see your perspective,
and many other strategies.

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.960
But you can't make anybody do anything.

23
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.050
You're, well I can fire them,
and I can threaten their job.

24
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
I'm, you can, but
you still can't make them do it.

25
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.120
They're gonna be, okay, see you, I'm gonna
work across the street at your competitor.

26
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.750
&gt;&gt; And then do you wanna do that?

27
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.810
Then it makes it harder to
convince them in the future.

28
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.460
&gt;&gt; It's the nuclear option.

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

30
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're right.

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.300
And the truth is you still
can't make them do it.

32
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.023
They could be, [LAUGH] all right,
see you, give you the middle finger,

33
00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:08.294
walk out the door.

34
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:13.143
And this is something you really have to
understand, is you're not in control,

35
00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:16.439
you're shepherding people,
you're guiding them.

36
00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.363
But at the end of the day,

37
00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:20.313
people are making their independent
people with their own backgrounds, their

38
00:02:20.313 --> 00:02:23.450
own way of thinking and seeing the world
and they're making decisions without you.

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.010
And that's something you
really have to recognize.

40
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.076
Probably, I mean, well, how how many
of you have ever had a bad manager or

41
00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:34.392
a bad boss doesn't matter in fact tech?

42
00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:39.800
Yeah, almost everybody.

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.090
And probably one of the worst
things they can do.

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.740
And there's many ways of being a bad
manager or a bad leader as we'll get into.

45
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.238
But this one's probably one of the worst
ones, is people that become a leader, be,

46
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm in charge,
I'm gonna boss people around.

47
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.960
And you can for a time, like we said,
but they're gonna leave.

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.300
They're gonna underperform, they're
gonna talk about you behind your back.

49
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.060
And generally, your performance
gonna get worse over time.

50
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.870
And it drives people who are motivated
by control, it drives them bonkers.

51
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.210
I'm yelling at the team every day [LAUGH]
and they're still not working any harder,

52
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.269
why isn't this working?

53
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.688
And I've had plenty of experience
with managers like that,

54
00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:19.850
just I wanna be in control.

55
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.423
And the truth is, to be a good leader,
you have to give up control and

56
00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:25.130
you have to accept that.

57
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.313
And once you do, it changes your
perspective on getting people to do things

58
00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:29.930
or showing them what they should do.

59
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.970
And the truth is,
when it comes to software engineering,

60
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.250
the software engineers have
way more control than you do.

61
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.130
You're not writing code generally,
they are.

62
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.070
So when you talk about control,
who's actually doing the work here?

63
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.752
It's other people, so being in
charge is not a good motivation for

64
00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:51.470
being a software engineer.

65
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.291
And you are in charge to some degree,
you do have to call shots, but

66
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:58.990
if you're doing it for the control,
you're not gonna do well.

67
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.784
It may not show up immediately,
but it will show up eventually.

68
00:04:04.952 --> 00:04:07.685
Money, people think managers and

69
00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:12.027
people managers get paid more,
that is not the truth.

70
00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:15.763
I won't say how much money I make, but I'm
not the highest paid person on my team,

71
00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:18.271
and that's fun,
I have.no problem with that at all.

72
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:21.595
It's about value you provide the company,
I have a team of really,

73
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.927
really smart engineers,
and they do a lot, and

74
00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:26.930
the business say they
provide more value than I do.

75
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.610
That's okay, I'm totally fine with that.

76
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.680
But there's this myth that once you become
a manager, you're gonna make more money.

77
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.210
Not true, it is not true at all.

78
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.169
I'm fortunate to be able to set
compensation and see market data for

79
00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.260
how much different roles get paid.

80
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.889
And yes, software engineers are majors or
somewhere in the middle there.

81
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.102
The truth is, though, as you go up,
the salary bands are higher for

82
00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:52.960
becoming a VP or CTO, things like that.

83
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.290
But again, the rarity of those roles
is such that, what's it called?

84
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.870
What's the math term, the expected value?

85
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.400
Your expected value is actually
better as a software engineer.

86
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.981
If you're saying, in the long term,
I wanna make more money,

87
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:05.830
that's my motivation, which is fine.

88
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.745
We don't work for free, we've got bills
to pay, we've got Ferraris to polish.

89
00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:12.344
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're better off being a software

90
00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:14.750
engineer if you're just in it for
the money.

91
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.001
And then again, all that expected value,
there's just less roles,

92
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.300
we talked about that earlier.

93
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.175
And there's less job security,

94
00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:27.880
who in the latest rounds of the tech
downturn that we've all been dealing with?

95
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.740
Who are some of the first people to get
laid off, is it software engineers?

96
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.980
It's managers, and then they
consolidate teams under other managers.

97
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.780
And that's the truth, the further up
you go, the less job security you have.

98
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.661
Every time there's a reorganization,
or there's a new CTO in charge,

99
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.530
a new VP of engineering.

100
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.708
A lot of times what happens is they swap
out all the people that report to them for

101
00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:54.870
other people that they know who
match their leadership style.

102
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.818
And that's a risk you have,
and when that happens,

103
00:05:57.818 --> 00:06:00.170
you have less roles available to you.

104
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.952
So the motivation of money, it's not
a strong one, everybody has their own, but

105
00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:06.460
it's just not true.

106
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.842
And again, today comes as a shock,
I'm just trying to share what I know and

107
00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:12.317
the truth about things.

108
00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:18.780
Prestige, the title, engineering manager.

109
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.690
Sounds good, looks good on LinkedIn.

110
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.040
And people think what's perceived comes
respects, and that's not true at all.

111
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.760
Maybe externally, maybe there's things
the world values other people's value.

112
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.584
But the truth is, the title means nothing,

113
00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:41.250
to your team it just means that now
you're the one setting competition.

114
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.480
There's a lot of responsibilities
that come with the role, but

115
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.730
doesn't mean they respect to you.

116
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.190
You have to earn that, and
it doesn't come with a title.

117
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.107
And this is true for
anywhere you go in your career,

118
00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:52.620
you have to earn people's respect,
it doesn't come by default.

119
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.922
And the truth is when you're making this
transition to engineering management,

120
00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:58.530
you start at zero.

121
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.581
You are now the worst person on your team,

122
00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:04.460
where you are a senior software engineer
or whatever role software engineer.

123
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.982
You actually produced something you had
skills that were valuable to the company,

124
00:07:07.982 --> 00:07:11.250
the mini become an engineering manager for
the first time.

125
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.041
You're the lowest on the team,
you know the least,

126
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:18.362
about the role you should be doing, and
it's important to be humble about that.

127
00:07:18.362 --> 00:07:23.322
It's something I didn't
really think of in my

128
00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:27.402
transition was, I'm at zero again.

129
00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:30.338
And again, management is a role change,
it is not better,

130
00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:33.714
it's not worse, it's a different
role in software engineering.

131
00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:38.630
So prestige,
if your parents are proud, whatever.

132
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.210
I think externally people look at,
you're a manager, you must be up here.

133
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.139
But the reality is you're just
another person on the team, and

134
00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:48.972
that's why I tell my team all the time.

135
00:07:48.972 --> 00:07:52.250
My job is to make your life easier,
to remove reduced friction,

136
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.752
to give you guidance to
set long term direction.

137
00:07:54.752 --> 00:07:58.640
And to be the umbrella that keeps you
all shielded from the business side and

138
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.309
all the things you shouldn't
have to worry about.

139
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:03.370
But is there prestige there?

140
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.875
I don't think so, I don't think a leader
should think of themselves that way.

141
00:08:09.048 --> 00:08:11.620
Impact, I can make a difference.

142
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.700
This is true,
I think this is fine motivation.

143
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.350
It was actually one of my
motivations to become a manager.

144
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.700
You can make an impact,
you will make an impact.

145
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.140
And everybody's,
a positive impact, I'm, yeah.

146
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.220
Or a negative impact, so
you don't think of that other side of.

147
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.140
The more impact you can have, the bigger
the blast radius if you're wrong.

148
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.450
It's something else to think about,
you will make mistakes,

149
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.140
I've made plenty of mistakes.

150
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.530
And those mistakes are way more
costly as an engineering manager.

151
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.358
So, if you're, I wanna make
more of a change, you can, but

152
00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:51.130
think about the risk that comes with that,
of being wrong.

153
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.490
And the truth is the impacts that you
will make, it's way less tangible.

154
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.010
You know what I miss about
software engineering?

155
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.823
Is the binary nature of it's
either it works or it doesn't.

156
00:09:02.823 --> 00:09:04.823
Sometimes I don't know why it works,

157
00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:08.396
sometimes I don't know why it
doesn't work, somewhere between.

158
00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:12.704
And there's such a purity and beauty in
that, in solving these hard problems,

159
00:09:12.704 --> 00:09:17.430
closing a ticket, pushing code, and
you see it reflecting in production.

160
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.940
You don't get any of that
as an engineering manager.

161
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.976
Your successes are based on the team,
the failures are yours and

162
00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:27.679
that's just how it works as a good leader.

163
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.410
So any impact you have
is way less tangible.

164
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.635
Even now as doing this for
coming up on three years,

165
00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:38.535
it takes a lot of looking back to
see where we started as a team,

166
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:42.370
when I first became a manager and
where we are today.

167
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.550
To be, yeah, I did do that.

168
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.350
But it's only looking back, when you're
in the middle of it, you don't see it,

169
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.049
you won't feel it.

170
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.610
Sometimes you get lucky and you have
a good team meeting with teams fighting.

171
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.690
You're, okay, this feels good,
but those are very short lives.

172
00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.318
In general,

173
00:09:58.318 --> 00:10:01.980
all the impact you have is less tangible,
and you can't actually prove it.

174
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.617
You ever ship the big piece of software,
and you're really proud of it, and

175
00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:09.747
maybe hopefully your manager is,
great job team?

176
00:10:09.747 --> 00:10:13.041
That manager there is questioning,
did they actually do anything,

177
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:14.643
cuz they didn't write any code?

178
00:10:14.643 --> 00:10:17.838
That's something you have to accept as a
manager, is your impact is less tangible,

179
00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:20.950
and you have to just believe that you're
doing something, cuz you won't see it.

180
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.481
There's no metrics saying,
you did something, and

181
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:28.610
that impact takes a long time to see.

182
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:33.110
Like I said, quarters and
years it takes to see that impact.

183
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.002
Most, and
this is why the general recommendation for

184
00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:41.260
becoming a software engineering manager is
you have to do it for at least two years.

185
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.380
If you do it for a year, you're gonna be,
I'm not really doing anything,

186
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.300
this doesn't feel good,
cuz you won't see it.

187
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.049
It takes about two years to kind of
understand what you're doing finally and

188
00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:54.530
see, yeah, we are shipping things better.

189
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.514
The team is talking better,
our partners are happier,

190
00:10:57.514 --> 00:11:00.061
we're moving the business
metrics we need to.

191
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.266
But that takes a very long time to see,
and

192
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:05.615
that's probably one of the hardest
parts of this transition.

193
00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:09.487
If you're used to shipping code,
solving things,

194
00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:13.710
really binary,
easy to see impacting decisions.

195
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.380
That's gone as an engineer manager.

196
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.590
And truth is, the bigger the impact,
the more scrutiny you have on your role.

197
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.830
If your team is arguing,
they don't show prepared for meetings,

198
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.520
people aren't happy with them.

199
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.520
Even individuals in your team,
that's your problem now.

200
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.490
They're not gonna be but so and so.

201
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.119
I know they have personal problems and
they're arguing with their partner a lot,

202
00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:40.350
they're not sleeping well.

203
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.190
And that's why they're showing up poorly
in meetings and not delivering things.

204
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.004
Nobody says that about the person,

205
00:11:47.004 --> 00:11:50.230
they look to you cuz your
team is your responsibility.

206
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.418
So you have a lot more scrutiny,
but you also have more impact, so

207
00:11:54.418 --> 00:11:55.721
it is a trade-off.

208
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:57.946
Just things to think about when you
think about what are your motivations.

209
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.882
Mentoring growing people,
I love growing people.

210
00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:09.440
There's very little as satisfying as
seeing someone struggling with something,

211
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.925
you're coaching and mentoring.

212
00:12:10.925 --> 00:12:15.330
And then few months, maybe a couple of
years later, they're much better at it.

213
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.003
A common one is public speaking,
people usually shy away,

214
00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:21.240
especially software engineers,
from public speaking.

215
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.040
And then that moment when they
get up there and present, and

216
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.330
you're, is this the same person?

217
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.490
It's so rewarding, but that takes so much
time to see, people don't change in a day.

218
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.368
If you have a bad habit now,
how long does it take to drop a bad habit?

219
00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:42.162
Could take years,
that's the truth about growing people,

220
00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:46.760
is that will take years and
you don't control it.

221
00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.380
You can't, let's go back to the beginning,
you can't make anybody do anything.

222
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.308
You're, hey, Jane, you're really
argumentative in meetings, and

223
00:12:56.308 --> 00:13:00.749
you have great ideas, but
people don't wanna listen to you, and

224
00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:02.953
they're, yeah, I hear that.

225
00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:08.080
And then a week or two later, same thing,
a couple months later, same thing.

226
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.200
And you're coaching and
mentoring them, but it's not changing.

227
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.630
And that can be really frustrating,
cuz you're, it's such an obvious problem,

228
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.010
if you fix it, you'd be up here.

229
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.680
But you can't control that.

230
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.816
And that's the truth about growing and
mentoring people, is it's rewarding, but

231
00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:22.800
it's also challenging.

232
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.153
But to me it is one of the most satisfying
aspects of the position you can have as

233
00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:29.629
an engineering manager.

234
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:35.797
And if your motivation is a challenge,
that's a good motivation,

235
00:13:35.797 --> 00:13:37.800
[LAUGH] it's a challenge.

236
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.288
You will always be learning something new,
always, cuz people,

237
00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:46.070
they're all different,
people don't fit into a box.

238
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.155
So if you're in it for the challenge
it'll be a challenge [LAUGH].

239
00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:54.850
And if you're not being challenged,
you're probably not doing it right.

240
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.353
You should be challenging yourself and
challenging your team and

241
00:13:57.353 --> 00:13:58.500
challenging your partners.
