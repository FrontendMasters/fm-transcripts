1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.392
Which responsibilities do EMs
share with the product manager?

2
00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:07.862
&gt;&gt; Good question.

3
00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:11.205
The overall delivery is shared.

4
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:12.487
Product manager is an interesting one.

5
00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:13.777
I don't know if we have a course on.

6
00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.822
I think we actually do have a course
on product management from Brian Holt.

7
00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:21.990
But that's another one where you don't
directly do anything as a product manager,

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.673
except you corral people.

9
00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:27.256
But you're both responsible for
the successful delivery of your projects.

10
00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:30.332
So I'd say those are responsibilities.

11
00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:33.325
Yours are generally gonna be status
updates, keeping the project manager

12
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:36.137
informed so that they can make
decisions and see the overall picture.

13
00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:38.380
&gt;&gt; What's a effective meeting size?

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.209
Is it five to six people, or
is there no such limit, but

15
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.312
just all interested parties should go.

16
00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:44.679
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

17
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.736
It depends on the purpose of the meeting.

18
00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.721
A brain summary meeting with 100
people is not gonna be effective,

19
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.299
it doesn't matter how you slice it.

20
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.180
There's a certain size where
everybody weighing in just isn't

21
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.071
gonna get you anywhere,
you're never gonna reach consensus.

22
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:00.848
I don't have a good number in my head,
but I think you know it.

23
00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:04.222
[LAUGH] When you see it, if you see
20 people in a room versus 5 people.

24
00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:07.002
The less people there are the easier,
it will be to reach a decision.

25
00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:14.167
&gt;&gt; How do you avoid micromanaging when
individuals are underperforming, and

26
00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.583
you can't figure out why?

27
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:21.441
For example, items are estimated
at an excessive amount of time,

28
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:28.249
and they take even longer, and then
shouldn't take that long to begin with.

29
00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.997
One, I'll lean on what Ryan said is,
be curious,

30
00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:34.796
find out what's going on and dive in.

31
00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:38.618
Is that a personal issue,
is it's a skill gap they're missing?

32
00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:42.548
Project estimation is a skill that
you have to build up over time.

33
00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:45.752
Maybe there, there's something
you can do their training or

34
00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.852
just sometimes you'd be more hands on.

35
00:01:47.852 --> 00:01:52.082
But I'd say the other side of that is
being curious and finding what's going on

36
00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:55.045
is set expectations and
make sure that you agree on it.

37
00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:58.310
It's an agreement between the two
of you say, hey, you know,

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.659
you've been missing all of your deadlines.

39
00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.883
You say something's gonna take two
weeks and it's taking a month.

40
00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:06.720
It's slowing a lot of other people down.

41
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.392
How about we have some expectations on,
you can pad out things,

42
00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:15.152
just say it'll take three weeks instead,
but I expect you to deliver that on time,

43
00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:16.791
and we have this agreement.

44
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:21.778
And if they don't meet that, then you have
to escalate that into like, hey, here's

45
00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:26.587
what we talked about, and you agreed to
it, I agreed to it, we agreed it's fair.

46
00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:31.501
It isn't working out, so now we need to
have a unique way to deliver this and

47
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.759
be more specific.

48
00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.870
We didn't go that deep into it because
that's more deeper into management,

49
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.745
but there's a time when you have to
be firm and have clear expectations.

50
00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:44.831
Yeah, the question first.

51
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:49.479
&gt;&gt; How often do you do one-on-ones
with the people that you're managing?

52
00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.019
&gt;&gt; I give my team the choice.

53
00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.859
Max you wanna go is two weeks,
so most people are bi-weekly.

54
00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.030
So it's every two weeks,
I have a 30-minute one-on-one with them.

55
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.894
My team meetings are an hour, once a week.

56
00:03:00.894 --> 00:03:04.826
But there are people on my team who
prefer longer or more frequent.

57
00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:05.914
I meet with them weekly.

58
00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:10.269
It's totally up to them, and kind of
how much they're getting out of it.

59
00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.188
Sometimes you find out you have a regular
one-on-one, and you're like, you know,

60
00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:16.829
we're just talking about movies or
something like that.

61
00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.810
As much as I love doing that,
let's give each other the time back.

62
00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:28.335
&gt;&gt; I was just gonna echo, like you said,
that planning and estimating is a skill.

63
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.942
One of the teams that I work with that
actually, John managed previously,

64
00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:37.687
we've had a lot of success
doing planning poker.

65
00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:41.773
So whoever asked that
question about estimating,

66
00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:47.569
planning poker seems to drive a lot
of healthy discussion where you say,

67
00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.762
it's a 13 but
everyone around you says it was a 2.

68
00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:55.488
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about why those estimates

69
00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:59.590
are so out of whack and
just have an open conversation.

70
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.498
And if it happens week after week or
sprint after sprint then

71
00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:09.405
maybe in a one-on-one you can
follow up with them and say,

72
00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:13.640
you're always well higher
than your colleagues.

73
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.692
Is it then you can dig into some of those
underlying issues, as you mentioned?

74
00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:22.675
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've heard of planning poker,
never done it, but

75
00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:25.535
I like your approach with curiosity too.

76
00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:29.716
If someone's off, I found taking in
if someone's estimations are way off,

77
00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:33.122
it turns out they're like,
we keep shipping a lot of bugs, and

78
00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:36.271
I like to add in that extra time
to write tests and bugs, and

79
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.207
the rest of the team is not writing tests,
actually.

80
00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:44.354
Or it takes so long, and it's so painful
to write tests, but they're necessary,

81
00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:48.556
and you're like, it actually
turns out we need a QA engineer.

82
00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:51.017
Because a lot of my team is
spending time writing tests, and

83
00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:53.047
that's why our estimations
are always way off.

84
00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:55.752
But that you only get that when you
dig in and be curious rather than,

85
00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:57.237
why aren't you delivering on time?

86
00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:58.028
You said you're gonna do this.

87
00:04:58.028 --> 00:04:59.101
You didn't do that.

88
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:02.660
It's just not a healthy approach.

89
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.113
&gt;&gt; So today's a Thursday.

90
00:05:04.113 --> 00:05:07.813
Did you interact with your team
today while you're out, or

91
00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:09.737
how did you take the day off or?

92
00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:10.879
&gt;&gt; I'm out of office.

93
00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.442
I try to set a good example.

94
00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:16.749
People slack me, I just ignore them,
because I said in there,

95
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.144
I'm out of office.

96
00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:19.780
You wanna set a good example?

97
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.599
I don't like to say I'm out, and
I'm still responding to emails later in

98
00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.185
the day because whether I like it or
not, I have to be better about it.

99
00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:30.935
And I don't want my team to feel like,
hey, I'm on vacation in Hawaii,

100
00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.410
but Jim just messaged me, so

101
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.237
I need to respond immediately,
because I'm setting a tone for the team.

102
00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:40.967
So I try not to respond when I'm out
of office unless it's an emergency.

103
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:44.728
I don't send emails late at night, right?

104
00:05:44.728 --> 00:05:47.254
Again it sets a bad tone.

105
00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:49.664
I try not to put comments and
documents late at night.

106
00:05:49.664 --> 00:05:51.640
Even if I am in there,
I'll just save them for

107
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.448
the next day because I don't wanna
set a bad example for my team.

108
00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:57.974
Yeah, if I choose to work late,
that's fine, but

109
00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:00.929
I don't need visibility into doing that.

110
00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:01.505
Yeah.

111
00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:03.915
So at the end of this course,
we've now reached the end.

112
00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:05.913
Let's talk about the course takeaways.

113
00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:07.730
One, what do we learn?

114
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.408
Software engineering is more than code.

115
00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:13.030
Remember that giant list of people that
contribute to your product you may or

116
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.671
may not have thought of until now,

117
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:17.743
there's a lot more to software
engineering than just the code.

118
00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.473
In software engineering is the management,
is a role change.

119
00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:21.512
It doesn't mean more control.

120
00:06:21.512 --> 00:06:23.285
It doesn't mean more money.

121
00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:26.662
You do have greater impacts, but
it's just a different role on your team.

122
00:06:26.662 --> 00:06:29.716
Not more, not less.

123
00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:33.332
There's a lot of ways to get into
management, some are easier than others.

124
00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:36.935
We found out the accidental path is
probably one of the more common ones, but

125
00:06:36.935 --> 00:06:39.934
that doesn't mean it changes
how you think about management.

126
00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:42.456
At the end of the day,
responsibilities are the same.

127
00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:45.941
But you have to have the right motivations
if you're gonna stay a manager.

128
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.479
It's really important because again,
management is very lonely.

129
00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.408
And you have to dig deep internally and
figure out what's important,

130
00:06:52.408 --> 00:06:54.202
because there's no one there to help you.

131
00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:56.508
They just can't at the end of the day.

132
00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:58.845
And we live in an engineering management,
it's difficult.

133
00:06:58.845 --> 00:07:01.445
There's a lot of things you're
juggling all the time, and

134
00:07:01.445 --> 00:07:03.274
no one can tell you which ball is heavier.

135
00:07:03.274 --> 00:07:07.367
Sometimes they come down, and they're a
little bit heavier, when did that happen?

136
00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:10.008
I need to put this one down, or
I need to pick these up, and

137
00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:11.786
actually do need to do a lot right now.

138
00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:14.636
It's a really tricky job
balancing all these things and

139
00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.620
the people who change every
single day every single week.

140
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.772
You need a lot of skills
to be a good leader.

141
00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:27.104
But more importantly, you will not be
good at all of them, and that's okay.

142
00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:31.382
Don't beat yourself up about it, but at
least try to do something, try to fix it,

143
00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:34.981
try to learn to paper over some of
the things you're not as strong at.

144
00:07:34.981 --> 00:07:38.618
And build up your skills in advance
if you're not a manager yet.

145
00:07:38.618 --> 00:07:40.524
It will make the transition easier.

146
00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:43.536
We talked about a lot of
the deficiencies around communication,

147
00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:47.275
those are things you can work on today
actively, and you'll just be better out.

148
00:07:47.275 --> 00:07:51.652
It'd be more comfortable where that
chart of conscious of competency,

149
00:07:51.652 --> 00:07:55.098
going from unconsciously
incompetent to consciously,

150
00:07:55.098 --> 00:07:58.557
unconsciously competent,
that's where you wanna be.

151
00:07:58.557 --> 00:08:02.973
But the only way to do that is exercise,
you have to try and

152
00:08:02.973 --> 00:08:05.003
keep working towards it.

153
00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:08.858
And take advantage of opportunities
when it comes to transitioning from

154
00:08:08.858 --> 00:08:09.750
manager to not.

155
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.249
If something pops up, and it's perfect for
you, go after it, go after it then.

156
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:17.028
If you wait until, well, I'm not
quite ready, you'll never be ready.

157
00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:21.993
Sometimes, you just got to go for
it because the fact is, you don't know.

158
00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:23.696
You won't know until you do it.

159
00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:28.247
If you wait until I'm ready,
it'll never happen.

160
00:08:28.247 --> 00:08:30.374
And then the interview is
a measure of potential.

161
00:08:30.374 --> 00:08:31.785
Treat it that way.

162
00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:33.172
But come in as you are a manager, but

163
00:08:33.172 --> 00:08:35.770
understand you're probably gonna
be wrong about a lot of things.

164
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.223
Your perspective's gonna be incorrect,
and that's okay.

165
00:08:38.223 --> 00:08:40.658
Don't try to have the perfect answer.

166
00:08:40.658 --> 00:08:43.764
Just share your philosophies.

167
00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:51.901
And in the end, management is when you're
good at something, it is very difficult.

168
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:54.156
And when you do it, it's so powerful.

169
00:08:54.156 --> 00:08:57.249
It's so fulfilling, and
it's really hard to talk about.

170
00:08:57.249 --> 00:09:01.929
It's hard to describe until you do it,
but think about the last thing,

171
00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:06.531
think about something right now that
you found a lot of pride in doing,

172
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:08.493
that you've accomplished.

173
00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:09.390
Take a second.

174
00:09:13.193 --> 00:09:17.880
And whatever that thing is,
was it easy to do?

175
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.600
No.

176
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.076
Sometimes, the harder something is,
the more satisfaction we get from it.

177
00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:26.714
And that's like a weird, perverse
relationship we have as humans, if we

178
00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:30.958
don't enjoy the easy stuff because it's
too easy, and that's a lot of management.

179
00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.411
It is difficult, but when you get it
right and the team's functioning,

180
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:38.329
you're delivering, people are happy and
growing, it is a very satisfying job.

181
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:40.558
And obviously, besides being a parent,

182
00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:44.773
it's the most satisfying thing I've ever
done, and I get a lot of joy from it.

183
00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:47.410
You do get a lot of joy, but
you have to look for it.

184
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.900
It doesn't come to you,
and it doesn't come easy.

185
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.230
It's not cheap.

186
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.974
But it's there, and you talk to
someone who's been a manager for

187
00:09:54.974 --> 00:09:59.646
a long time, asking why they do it,
and you'll get happiness.

188
00:09:59.646 --> 00:10:02.985
At the end of the day, when you see
people grow, and you build them up,

189
00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:06.731
the question at the end of the day is
you're like, did I actually do anything?

190
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.299
They're all good people, and
did I actually impact that?

191
00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:10.984
And you'll always ask yourself that.

192
00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:13.978
And you can only look back and
see like, I did do something.

193
00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:15.599
I did impact the team for better.

194
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:16.439
They are better.

195
00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:21.151
I'm not that bad manager,
they see people talk about, hopefully not.

196
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:24.917
But it is such a great and rewarding job.

197
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:28.629
If you can master these skills, if you
accept that things are gonna change,

198
00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:29.969
you're gonna learn a lot.

199
00:10:32.254 --> 00:10:37.167
It's the end of the course,
it's a long day, but thank you so much.

200
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:40.258
If I didn't dissuade you from management.

201
00:10:40.258 --> 00:10:42.870
I didn't do my job right, I'm kidding.

202
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.870
But if nothing else, hopefully if you say,
you know what, management's not for me,

203
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.771
totally fine.

204
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:52.418
But hopefully, now you understand
the perspective that your manager has, and

205
00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:56.229
you can become a better software engineer,
and better at the business, and you can

206
00:10:56.229 --> 00:10:59.515
move up the other side of the ladder
as well by knowing all these things.

207
00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:00.848
Thank you.

208
00:11:00.848 --> 00:11:05.174
