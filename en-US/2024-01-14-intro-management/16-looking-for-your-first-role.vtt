1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.347
So when you are looking for
this first role,

2
00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:04.543
whether it's internally or externally,

3
00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:09.100
things to look at to make your life
a little bit easier during the transition.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.600
A similar domain, similar language or
technology will make things a lot easier.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.762
If I was to, say, lead an Android team,
I don't know much about Android,

6
00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.430
I'd have to ramp myself up.

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.832
That's another hurdle to have to cross to
become a successful manager for a team.

8
00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:27.036
So it's a lot easier to pick
the same language, same domains,

9
00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:29.395
same business area, same technology stack,

10
00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.310
will just help make that
transition a little bit easier.

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.660
You wanna help the team size,

12
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.520
Ryan mentioned before he's
managed up to 18 people.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.147
I don't recommend that as a junior
manager, your first time,

14
00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:45.020
that's a lot of people,
that's a lot of personalities.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.585
That's a lot of Interpersonal things that
you have no knowledge of that you're gonna

16
00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.080
have to figure out really quickly.

17
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.712
And then you also have to lead the team,

18
00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:54.570
you also have to lead
the business side of things too.

19
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.227
So you really want a smaller
team if possible, and

20
00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:01.090
it'll make your life a lot
easier than taking on too much.

21
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.934
And that's something I've seen,
I've seen people take on early roles and

22
00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:04.830
they have 20 people.

23
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.610
And I was, man, I feel for you, that's
hard, that's a really hard first step.

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.170
You want a healthy organization and
a healthy company culture?

25
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.490
And how do you know, just generally,
how do you know if a company is healthy?

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.740
You don't, say you don't know anything
about the company, how would you find out?

27
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.510
&gt;&gt; I asked you about turnover.

28
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.280
&gt;&gt; Great, yeah, great question,
asked about turnover.

29
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.997
How long have you worked here,
why are you still here?

30
00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:38.283
These are very illuminating questions
during the interview, what else?

31
00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:42.964
&gt;&gt; There's also no guarantee whether
you will get the answer right.

32
00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:44.806
Because when people are hiring,

33
00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:48.238
oftentimes they will put a spin
on it that's better for them.

34
00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:51.333
So just grain of salt, I guess.

35
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.285
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to be good at
asking the right questions and

36
00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:56.280
reading between the lines.

37
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.509
Ultimately generally people are gonna
see positive things about their company.

38
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.720
But you can see cracks sometimes,
and you have to really dig in there.

39
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.429
Way I like to ask is, what about growth,

40
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.348
how have you grown,
does your company have a growth plan?

41
00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:17.354
That's kinda an indicative culture, if
they are or are not investing in people,

42
00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:18.408
that tells you a lot.

43
00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:21.960
&gt;&gt; I think asking specific questions, when
is the last time you promoted someone?

44
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.570
When is the last time someone left, when
is the last time someone took vacation?

45
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.500
When is the last time you guys
worked over 40 hours in a week?

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Asking questions like that, it's harder
for people to lie about stuff like that.

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.686
Certainly they can,
you don't know for sure, but

48
00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:38.433
if you're asking a specific question,
I think you get a better sense of

49
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.765
that sort of stuff,
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic,

50
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.300
those are very black and white questions.

51
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.880
Yeah, great advice there.

52
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.990
I like the weekend one, when's the last
time you worked on the weekend?

53
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.640
If it's a lot, that tells you something.

54
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.646
Maybe you don't wanna be there, maybe
you do, maybe that's where you wanna be.

55
00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:01.970
Do you wanna find a manager
willing to invest in you?

56
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.640
Again, you don't know anything when
you're making this transition.

57
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.080
You know something, but
you don't have the experience.

58
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.058
You need a manager who's willing to
put in the time to coach you and

59
00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:11.860
mentor you, and point out the things.

60
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.087
There is no checklist for accomplishments,
but a manager can help you point out

61
00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:20.940
things that are, hey, maybe you
should be focusing on this right now.

62
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.880
Maybe you should get your team objectives
for the quarter in order today.

63
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.320
It's really helpful, but
you've gotta have that manager.

64
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.280
A manager is, come in day one,
hit the ground running.

65
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.341
We expect you to perform,
it's gonna put a lot of stress on you, and

66
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:36.410
that can be difficult.

67
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.682
Some keywords to avoid when you're looking
for a role, they show up different ways,

68
00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:43.230
but seasoned.

69
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.620
I see that one a lot in roles.

70
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.324
I want a well-seasoned manager,
probably not for you,

71
00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:49.520
you don't want that sort of role.

72
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.679
An experience,

73
00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:55.907
you probably don't wanna role that's
like you need experience manager.

74
00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:59.920
And Ryan can definitely speak a lot to
this, but if you take on something that

75
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.633
says, we need an experience leader and
they hire you as a new manager.

76
00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.028
You're gonna struggle, cuz there's
a reason why they're looking for

77
00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:07.550
an experienced manager.

78
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.090
Maybe the team dynamics are off,

79
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.290
maybe it's unclear what position
in the business they need to play.

80
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.260
It's something but
you need to figure that out.

81
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.427
Same with the senior manager,
if they're asked for senior manager,

82
00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:20.070
don't apply for the role.

83
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.239
You probably won't do well, or
if you do it, you're gonna struggle a lot,

84
00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.210
just save yourself some pain here.

85
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.805
Brian, anything to add on looking for
a role?

86
00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:35.212
&gt;&gt; I think one thing that you
didn't really touch on too as maybe

87
00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:37.640
a tactic is networking, right?

88
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.416
Is talking to other companies or people,
understand if you are having to look

89
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:46.309
through those external places to
find roles I talk to people and

90
00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.660
like maybe there are available roles for
some like brand new manager.

91
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.623
But absolutely internally, I know Gem,
you said you talk to other managers,

92
00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:57.500
even talk about their
transition to management.

93
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.920
But yeah, talk to them about, hey,
I wanna be a manager at some point,

94
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.570
I'd love to hear some advice on that.

95
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.946
Now you're keeping top of mind that yeah,

96
00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:10.380
that person might be a good person
to go talk to later, right?

97
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.200
You're putting your intent out
there it can it can go a long way.

98
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I didn't even put network in there.

99
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.360
Networking, It's the easiest
way to find a job.

100
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.380
It's so you hear your whole career
they tell you in college, etc.

101
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.388
But the easiest way to find a job, one,
is to not apply for one, or to apply but

102
00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:30.360
they already know you,
they're gonna hire you.

103
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.130
That doesn't happen a lot,
but it's the easiest way.

104
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.442
Same with internal, talking to directors,
senior managers, other managers,

105
00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:38.908
and if they have a role pop up,

106
00:05:38.908 --> 00:05:42.590
and you tell them your intent of,
I wanna be a manager someday.

107
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.760
It's good, they don't wanna go
hire people, it's a lot more work.

108
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.760
And if you're, I wanna be a manager,
you actually fit well in this role.

109
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.430
You can make it really easy, but you have
to talk to a lot of people to do that.

110
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.756
So networking is really, really important.
