1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.787
Hopefully now you have a better
perspective on things you're good at and

2
00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:08.060
things maybe you're not so good at and
ways you can build those up.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.862
Let's talk about the actual interview.

4
00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:14.558
If you've made it this far, and you're
like, Jim, despite your best efforts,

5
00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:17.978
you have not convinced me to
not be an engineering manager.

6
00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:20.488
It's all a waste, all right, fine.

7
00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:24.330
If you're committed to the path, let's
talk about what that interview looks like.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.081
And I like this section because
as a software engineer,

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:31.410
it's very unlikely you'll sit on
an interview for an engineering manager.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.210
Maybe you will, and
if you can, try to do that.

11
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.370
And always try to do that whenever
you can, sit on interviews.

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.883
But it's unlikely you'll ever
know what they talk about.

13
00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:44.167
They're not talking about code most
of the time, sometimes they do.

14
00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:47.460
But, yeah,
what does an interview look like?

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.846
So let's talk a bit more about that.

16
00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:52.575
First, how do you find a role?

17
00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:57.040
This is a real problem I had
when I was like, I'm committed,

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.033
I wanna become an engineering manager.

19
00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.038
Where I look and
you two options pretty binary.

20
00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:05.292
You can look internally within
the company you're at, or

21
00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:07.280
you can look externally
at a different companies.

22
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120
And there's pros and cons to both.

23
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.670
If you're looking for an internal role,
the pro is the culture is familiar.

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.095
You at least know how people communicate,
generally.

25
00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.660
And you know the domain, generally.

26
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.992
And there's asterisks by these because
you can be different parts of the company

27
00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:25.568
depending on the size of the company.

28
00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.196
We'll have different cultures entirely.

29
00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:29.052
That's true, where I work it's true.

30
00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:33.232
Almost every company I've ever been of
size of the cultures are different from

31
00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:34.001
area to area.

32
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.454
So it may be a familiar culture and
it may not be, you're not guaranteed that.

33
00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:43.196
But there's gonna be some familiarities
with technology and process hopefully,

34
00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:46.999
that will make being internal
a little bit easier for transition.

35
00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.020
Domain might be entirely different too.

36
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.370
You can't guarantee that when
you're looking for roles.

37
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.286
For instance, I'm pretty good at
JavaScript, but if I moved to be a Java,

38
00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:00.278
manage a Java team,
I'd have to learn that pretty quickly.

39
00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:03.520
And you can argue that's
a different domain of technology.

40
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.916
So something to think about, internal does
not mean it's gonna be easier, but there

41
00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:10.090
are a lot of familiarities that should
make the transition a little bit easier.

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.387
With an internal role, you can work
towards it over time, hopefully.

43
00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.231
Hopefully, there's a learning path for

44
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.503
you at your company on how
to make that transition.

45
00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:22.380
But the downside of internal roles,
the availability is going to be low.

46
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.342
That's just a numbers thing.

47
00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:27.456
There's always gonna be more roles
outside of your small company, or

48
00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:29.480
even if it's a large company, than within.

49
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.140
And that's a problem, especially if
you have a company of high performers,

50
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.940
where lots of people
want to become a manager.

51
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.500
What do you do in that situation?

52
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380
Sometimes you have to leave.

53
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.829
So I'd say internal is a little
bit easier of a path if you can.

54
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.054
But it's probably one of the more
difficult ones for a few reasons.

55
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:53.744
For the external role,
coming from software engineer to manager,

56
00:02:53.744 --> 00:02:57.070
here's something you
probably don't think about.

57
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.917
You don't know anything.

58
00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:03.013
[LAUGH] As a software engineer,
you don't know what management looks like.

59
00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:07.166
Yeah, maybe if you're taking this course,
you have some idea, but until you do it,

60
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.685
you just don't really know and
the companies don't know you either, so

61
00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:12.890
you have to sell yourself a lot harder.

62
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.958
Of like, I can become an engineer manager
because I've been a team lead for

63
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.947
three years or I've been a staff engineer.

64
00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:23.639
I've led these number
of impactful projects.

65
00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.330
I give feedback.

66
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.036
I receive feedback well.

67
00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:30.094
I'm a good communicator, you have to sell
the skills that hopefully add up and

68
00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:32.570
they see you have potential
to be a good leader.

69
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.510
But the fact is they don't know you,
and they're taking a bet on you.

70
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.050
When I first was looking for roles,
there wasn't a lot internally at Netflix,

71
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.890
a lot of ambitious people, and
Netflix a really high performing culture.

72
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.732
The roles are very few and
far between when they open up,

73
00:03:49.732 --> 00:03:52.250
that are good for a junior manager.

74
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.936
So I remember talking to companies, and I
talked to the big ones like Meta, AWS, and

75
00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.660
they were all like, Jim,
your resume is good on paper.

76
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.180
You have a lot of the strong
leadership potential.

77
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.500
However, nobody's gonna
take a risk on you.

78
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.921
Cuz if they're wrong about
you being a poor leader,

79
00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:11.470
the blast radius is really high.

80
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.975
And I remember a recruiter said
that to me directly, they're like,

81
00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:16.998
you have the qualifications, but nobody's
gonna hire you without the experience

82
00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.480
because .we don't know you, and
we're not gonna take that risk.

83
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.806
We don't need to,
we're big enough company.

84
00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:26.470
And that's not, but that's the reality
of it, and they're not wrong.

85
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.403
They don't know how I'm gonna perform,
and if it takes time to figure out if

86
00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.475
someone's a good manager or
bad manager, and if I'm bad,

87
00:04:33.475 --> 00:04:37.794
I'm gonna pull everybody down, not just
the team, but the entire organization.

88
00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:41.455
So, it's something to consider with an
external role that's gonna be a little bit

89
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:44.297
more challenging, or you ought to
put in a little bit more work.

90
00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:48.046
And you also have to tailor your resume
for the role, and I've seen a number of

91
00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:51.872
software engineers that comes to me
like Jim, tell me about your transition.

92
00:04:51.872 --> 00:04:54.760
Tell me about how you became
your paths enhancement.

93
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.230
And I share that with them.

94
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.455
And I'm like,
I'm happy to look at your resume.

95
00:04:58.455 --> 00:05:01.162
Take me five minutes to look it over.

96
00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:02.847
And they didn't change it at all.

97
00:05:02.847 --> 00:05:04.770
It was all software engineer oriented.

98
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.714
I'm like what role are you applying for?

99
00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:08.968
They're like, manager.

100
00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:10.340
It's like, but
this doesn't look like a manager.

101
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.285
You're talking about your technology
that you use and things like that.

102
00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:16.806
So you do have to rethink your resume and
tailor it towards leadership,

103
00:05:16.806 --> 00:05:20.622
things you've done, metrics you've moved,
the ways you've mentored and

104
00:05:20.622 --> 00:05:24.109
coached people, the ways you've
shown up on their soft skills side.

105
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.740
Something consider on external roles.

106
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.810
And another one for external roles,
you may have to move to a smaller company.

107
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.479
Like I said, I was talking to the other
big companies going like I work at

108
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.320
a big company.

109
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.980
I wanna go work in another big company,
I'm familiar with enterprise,

110
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.680
but they wouldn't take a chance on me.

111
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.647
Whereas a smaller company probably would
like a startup can take more of that risk

112
00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:49.110
cuz startups are risky
inherent in their nature.

113
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.895
So something to think about an external
role is you may have to step down from

114
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:56.880
whatever size company to an even smaller
company, but that's an option too.

115
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.939
Those of you who've made the transition or
have looked for roles,

116
00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.053
does this resonate or any questions
thinking internally versus externally?

117
00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:18.634
&gt;&gt; Not a question but I can share
experience, I had a weird situation where

118
00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:24.497
I had consulted where I work today for
four years as a full stack engineer.

119
00:06:24.497 --> 00:06:29.870
And had other opportunities elsewhere for
a year or so.

120
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.434
And so it was an external role but
also I knew everyone there and

121
00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:41.212
yeah I think looking into those
kind of situations can be hard and

122
00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:46.669
I agree with the thought that you
do have to kind of change your

123
00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.915
resume to be more about leadership and
accomplishments.

124
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:57.534
And working through others rather
than what technology you used or

125
00:06:57.534 --> 00:07:01.561
what familiarity you
have with certain codes.

126
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:05.006
&gt;&gt; I like what you said
there about lucky interval.

127
00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:09.393
I have a course on interviewing for
front-end engineers,

128
00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:13.531
but that advice applies to
anything you interview for.

129
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:20.604
Half its luck, so if you don't get
the role, maybe it's not on you.

130
00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:22.426
Sometimes it's just you're
not saying the right things,

131
00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:23.637
you don't have the right background.

132
00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:25.757
Sometimes the person just woke up
on the wrong side of the bed and

133
00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:27.350
they don't like you.

134
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.410
It happens.

135
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.050
I'm just being real, it happens.

136
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.110
So don't get yourself down
if you can't find the role.

137
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.570
The transition is one of
the more difficult ones.

138
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.847
If you haven't accidentally lucked into
a role, or been pushed into a role,

139
00:07:41.847 --> 00:07:47.301
doing it deliberately is probably one of
the more difficult things you will do.

140
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.580
There just aren't that
many roles out there.
