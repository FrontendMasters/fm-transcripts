00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.719
And on the people side, let's talk
about some of the roles that you have

2
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:06.955
to play as an engineering manager.

3
00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:09.368
And these are all roles that I've played,
and there's more, and

4
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.320
I definitely want to hear if
you all can think of more.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.431
Sometimes you're the coach,
sometimes I'm coaching people,

6
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:16.817
calling players on the side.

7
00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:20.940
And I really like the coach metaphor,
because I'm not playing the game.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.056
I'm an expert at the game.

9
00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:25.371
I know the plays, I know what it looks
like, I know different scenarios, but

10
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.130
I'm not actually playing the game.

11
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.914
And it doesn't matter which sport
you're thinking of in your head.

12
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:31.649
The coach is on the side.

13
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.460
Sometimes, they gotta be
tough with the people.

14
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.584
Sometimes they gotta be like,
you did really well there.

15
00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.129
And that's a lot of what what you
do as an engineering manager.

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.128
Sometimes you're just a cheerleader.

17
00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:44.400
The team is functioning.

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.908
They don't need you.

19
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:45.939
They don't need to listen to you.

20
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.679
In fact, if I was saying anything,

21
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.280
it would actually pull them away
from what they are doing well.

22
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.420
If, again, pick any sport,

23
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.386
if the team's doing well, I don't need
to be on the like, do this, do that,

24
00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:58.743
because they're already functioning well,
and sometimes I'm just a cheerleader.

25
00:00:58.743 --> 00:01:00.032
Good job.

26
00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:01.142
Way to go, team.

27
00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.841
Keep going,
I just wanna keep them going, but

28
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.208
t I don't actually need to do anything.

29
00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.727
Sometimes, I'm a therapist.

30
00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:09.999
You get to know your team,
you talk about personal problems,

31
00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.790
you talk about things they
don't share with other people.

32
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.283
Sometimes your job is to listen and
provide sometimes life advice.

33
00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:18.750
Sometimes I mentor.

34
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.863
Now, what should I do in the situation?

35
00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:25.210
Okay, here's what I would do or here's,
here's some approaches I would take.

36
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.725
I won't go through all these, but

37
00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.768
there's a lot of roles that you will
play as an engineering manager.

38
00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:36.630
And what role that is,
I'll tell you a secret.

39
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.353
No one tells you what you need to do.

40
00:01:38.353 --> 00:01:39.510
You have to figure that out.

41
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.320
You have to figure out what you
need to be in that situation.

42
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.572
Is this the time to be a peacemaker if
people are arguing about something?

43
00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:49.804
You need to step in with a firm hand and
say, hey, I bet you,

44
00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:53.130
you let's come together and
figure this out.

45
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.883
Or sometimes you need to say,
you know what,

46
00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:56.418
we spent three months arguing on this.

47
00:01:56.418 --> 00:01:58.812
Here's what we're going to do,
and that's that.

48
00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:02.175
And let's move forward.

49
00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.060
Speaker of the House, I like this one.

50
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.050
The Speaker of the House is the, for
those of you familiar with politics,

51
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.558
you're the tiebreaker sometimes.

52
00:02:11.558 --> 00:02:13.518
And that's sometimes what you have to do.

53
00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:18.321
But also you represent your team,
your organization to directors, and

54
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.170
VPs, and even the executives sometimes.

55
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.099
You speak for an entire group of people.

56
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.464
That's something you'll do in your
role as an engineering manager.

57
00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:32.621
Can you all think of any other roles
that an engineering manager might play?

58
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:36.996
&gt;&gt; I felt like sometimes similar to
a salesperson or speaker is like lawyer,

59
00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:41.530
you're like arguing a defense for
a certain architecture or path forward.

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.171
&gt;&gt; Well, I like that, yeah.

61
00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:52.368
&gt;&gt; I think the engineering manager
that had the biggest impact on me,

62
00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:57.656
he would just listen to everyone with
a non-judgmental perspective and

63
00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:02.529
then from there make decisions,
some of these roles and what not.

64
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.337
He always felt like he was
playing an impartial role until

65
00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:13.917
the decision needed to be made and
that left a drastic impact on me.

66
00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:18.805
It was the best place to work cuz you
always seemed to know what the next

67
00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:23.370
step was or whatever, or
how to resolve something or whatever.

68
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.951
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good one.

69
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.839
That's one of the hardest things you'll
do, one of the hardest roles you'll play,

70
00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:30.660
is to do nothing.

71
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.349
It's to sit back and do nothing,

72
00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.003
because the temptation is always to
interject yourself, or say something.

73
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:40.670
And sitting back and say, okay,
tell me more, and not responding.

74
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.016
Or just asking the right questions, is one
of the most difficult things you'll do.

75
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.481
And it doesn't sound like it's hard,
but It is something I still work on.

76
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:51.900
I like to talk, I like to say,
here's what you should do.

77
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.170
And I have a bias to action,

78
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.333
which is good sometimes, but
a lot of times you just have to listen.

79
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.767
So it's a good one, Mark.

80
00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:00.788
Ryan, [INAUDIBLE] something.

81
00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:03.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think also another role
you play as a partner, right?

82
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.305
Like you're working very closely with
other teams and bridging the gap,

83
00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:08.256
connecting dots.

84
00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:11.840
So that's another thing is you're
a partner with other teams.

85
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.465
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great one.

86
00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:18.330
There's very few of one software
engineering team at a company.

87
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.476
There's always probably another team, and

88
00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:23.919
you have to be that bridge between
teams to share their perspective, but

89
00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.487
to understand what they're doing and
translate that to your team as well.

90
00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:29.800
Partner is a great one, yeah.

91
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.471
There's probably more.

92
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.230
I think if we thought about longer and

93
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.147
the people that have impacted you both
positively and negatively in your career,

94
00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:41.290
you'll probably see what role
were they playing in that moment.

95
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.689
And the truth is what makes
engineering management difficult or

96
00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.224
challenging is like you will not
be good at all these things.

97
00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:51.980
You can't be good at all these things.

98
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.284
No one is good at all these things,
it's impossible.

99
00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:57.481
You have a personality,

100
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.901
you have a bias towards certain
styles of interaction communication,

101
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.330
you have a different background,
you can't be good all these things.

102
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.115
And I say this now, and
I'm telling my past self and

103
00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:10.772
my future self to be okay with that.

104
00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:15.413
Understand what you're good at, but don't
don't bias too much towards doing that,

105
00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:16.948
like I have a bias to action.

106
00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:19.330
That doesn't mean we should
always be doing something.

107
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.774
It doesn't mean we should always be like,
yeah, great idea, let's do it.

108
00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:25.008
Sometimes you got to stop and think.

109
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:29.008
Some things I'm really good at, and
there's others that are definitely not as

110
00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:32.726
strong and it's good to recognize both and
know when to play these parts.

111
00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:36.586
But I tell you this now, if you make this
transition to engineering management,

112
00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.254
you will not be good at every role.

113
00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.970
And just, you accept it and you try to
fix it, you work it as best you can, but

114
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.500
no one's good at everything.
