1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.597
One of the big takeaways, right?

2
00:00:01.597 --> 00:00:04.973
If you tune out right now and you're like,
this is cool, maybe not for me.

3
00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:05.795
That's all right, right?

4
00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.121
I'm not offended, but

5
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:10.974
I want you to take away that engineering
management is a role change.

6
00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:15.691
Everybody says like,
congratulations on your promotion, and

7
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.848
I'm like no, it's not a promotion.

8
00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:20.987
I've not been promoted to doing anything.

9
00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:25.722
In fact, I'm doing more and doing less
at the same time in a very weird way.

10
00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.580
Engineering management is a role change.

11
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.544
This is what we say in my company.

12
00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:32.685
We don't say it's a promotion,
we say they shifted roles.

13
00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.995
On a team of software engineers I play
a role that helps them deliver code,

14
00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:41.184
it helps the product get built, and
deliver results for the business.

15
00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:45.246
But I don't say, I'm better than my team,
I'm in charge of my team,

16
00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:48.796
I just have a role on my team,
to guide them to the right outcomes.

17
00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:50.995
And that's the way to think
of engineering management.

18
00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:55.228
It's the best approach, it is a different
role amongst all these other roles,

19
00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:57.452
it is a role that helps deliver products.

20
00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.718
Let's do a quick,
this is a group exercise,

21
00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:04.354
I'm gonna need your help for this one.

22
00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:08.890
I want you to think like a manager,
because now, thinking like a manager,

23
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.133
there's the people side of things.

24
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.793
You have a team of people to manage.

25
00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:16.596
There's a business side of things, too,
the business side that we just talked

26
00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:20.313
about in the past couple slides, but
maybe you hadn't thought of it before.

27
00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.325
So let's think about,
like, what does that mean?

28
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:27.408
Let's start with compensation,
I'll do this first one.

29
00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:31.959
Compensation shows up on the people's
side and you gotta pay your team,

30
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.373
people don't work for free,
even if they did, they still gotta eat.

31
00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.561
And if you manage to get
people to work for free,

32
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.820
we need to talk cuz that's
probably unethical.

33
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.629
I don't know what's going on there,
but let's have a talk about that.

34
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.159
But with compensation,
you have to pay people.

35
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.195
On the business side, what does that mean?

36
00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.741
What is setting compensation for
your team?

37
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:52.486
Or even having salaries?

38
00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:53.304
&gt;&gt; Budgeting?

39
00:01:53.304 --> 00:01:54.795
&gt;&gt; Budgeting, yeah.

40
00:01:57.053 --> 00:02:01.270
&gt;&gt; Probably market rate analysis to
see like, am I paying people fairly,

41
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.447
will they leave and
go get more money somewhere else?

42
00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:07.734
&gt;&gt; Yeah, equitable compensation,
making sure people are happy.

43
00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.939
&gt;&gt; Maybe what that compensation is,
more than just money, maybe benefits,

44
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.016
things like that.

45
00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:19.432
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great answer, more than
just benefits, more than just money.

46
00:02:19.432 --> 00:02:23.917
There's a reason why it doesn't matter
how much your management loves you,

47
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:26.955
you're probably not making
$10 million a year.

48
00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:31.440
Maybe they would pay you if they can, but
they can't, because this is a business,

49
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.628
if we paid everybody that, we wouldn't
have any money to keep the lights on.

50
00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:37.792
We wouldn't have any money
to pay anybody else.

51
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:41.760
So it's something you think about as
a manager when it comes to people, or

52
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.163
when it comes to compensation,
is what is that right balance?

53
00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:47.609
And there is a balance there,
and you have to figure that out.

54
00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.402
Is someone gonna leave?

55
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:49.177
Do they make more money?

56
00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:51.372
Can I pay them enough?

57
00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:54.891
We're gonna cover that more in 102
because it's a deeper dive, but

58
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.951
a different perspective when it comes to
getting a raise as your bonus every year.

59
00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:03.040
All the factors that are in play that
maybe you hadn't considered before.

60
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.865
We're all hiring, when it comes to hiring,
what do you think that shows up in people?

61
00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.892
&gt;&gt; What will they add to the team?

62
00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:18.392
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what will they add to the team?

63
00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:21.522
&gt;&gt; Culture fit,
personalities within the team?

64
00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:26.172
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great answer, culture fit,
you can't just hire anybody,

65
00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.038
being able to code is
just an aspect of it.

66
00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:32.166
And we're gonna cover a really
deep dive into hiring,

67
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.917
as it's one of the most important
things you'll do as a manager.

68
00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:39.804
On the business side,
hiring shows up in a variety ways, but

69
00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:43.245
it's what products do we
have to build in the future?

70
00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:46.040
Does my team have the skill sets for
that today?

71
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.653
If not, you need to hire for that.

72
00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:53.027
What sort of growth path do we need
to fill these roles that we're

73
00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:54.809
gonna need in the future?

74
00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.242
Are we gonna need an architect next year?

75
00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:57.809
Do we have that?

76
00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:58.984
Is that building in my team?

77
00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:00.966
If not, I need to hire for that.

78
00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.063
So even hiring,
which seems like a very people problem,

79
00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:06.007
is also a business problem as well.

80
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:09.662
When it comes to expenses,
now, this is a fun one.

81
00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.886
Expenses, so, Jem, I need a new laptop.

82
00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:17.247
How does that show up on the people side?

83
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.012
&gt;&gt; They're more productive?

84
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.787
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

85
00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:26.476
&gt;&gt; Or less productive and that one, yeah.

86
00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:29.292
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have to make that call.

87
00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.142
You have to say,
do you need the latest iPhone?

88
00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:35.948
Do you need the latest M3 laptop?

89
00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.714
Is that gonna make you more productive?

90
00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:39.494
I don't know, maybe, maybe not but

91
00:04:39.494 --> 00:04:42.827
that's a judgment call you have to
make on the people side of things,

92
00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:45.419
is how important is it to
this person within the team?

93
00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.030
On the business side, money,
do you need to spend this money?

94
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.920
&gt;&gt; If you spend this money here,
is it coming from your off-site budget,

95
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.325
is it coming from somewhere else?

96
00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:57.441
It's coming from somewhere, and
that's a business decision as well.

97
00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:02.373
Does your team need this new equipment,
will it move, any sort of metrics, or

98
00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:04.634
does it move the important things?

99
00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:08.900
Project prioritization,
how does that show up on the people side?

100
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.270
&gt;&gt; Do you have the skill set for
the project?

101
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.898
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

102
00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:19.180
&gt;&gt; How many people per project
are on this project versus another?

103
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.477
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many people, skill sets.

104
00:05:23.477 --> 00:05:25.191
&gt;&gt; Does your team wanna
work on this project?

105
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:29.234
[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; We're laughing, but that's true, what's

106
00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:33.507
the interest of the people on your team,
is this something they're excited about?

107
00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:36.774
Is this something you've talked
about in a growth conversation?

108
00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:40.211
Saying like, hey, I'm gonna put you on
this project, and you're gonna learn this,

109
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.924
and it's something we've talked about.

110
00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.697
I don't know,
I wanna learn NoSQL databases and

111
00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:47.008
this is a good project to get up to speed.

112
00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:49.991
There's a lot that goes into
project prioritization,

113
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.597
and it's not just how
many people necessarily.

114
00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:54.321
It's where your team is spending the time.

115
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.730
What are they interested in?

116
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.714
Do they have the technical
competency to be good at it, or

117
00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:03.128
is there gonna be a learning curve, which
is gonna impact other projects as well, so

118
00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:04.331
that's people side.

119
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.943
On the business side it's,

120
00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:09.446
is this the most important thing
we need to be doing right now?

121
00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:11.558
What should we be focused
on as the business?

122
00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:15.889
If we have six months of runway,
is this the feature

123
00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.846
that's gonna sell enough
software to keep us in our jobs?

124
00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:25.807
Is this gonna make the stock market
happy when we launch this feature?

125
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:27.621
That's the business side.

126
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.721
So the whole point of this exercise,
and we can keep going all day.

127
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:33.180
There's a lot to think about for

128
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.588
all these little decisions that you'll
make as engineering manager, and

129
00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:39.796
you're gonna make, in a week you're
making hundreds of decisions.

130
00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:43.856
And you're always thinking about people,
business, technology,

131
00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:45.931
there's a lot to keep in your head.

132
00:06:45.931 --> 00:06:49.220
So hopefully by now, if you've never
thought of any of these things before,

133
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.468
you maybe have a little bit more
appreciation for engineering management.

134
00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:55.727
And kind of what you have to think about
when it comes to just the execution of

135
00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:57.819
building products and
software engineering.

136
00:07:01.778 --> 00:07:03.982
So the takeaways from this section.

137
00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:06.434
We learned software
engineering is more than code.

138
00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:08.202
Code is important.

139
00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:13.383
You can argue, code is an artifact
of the people, of the business.

140
00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:14.644
But it's definitely more than code.

141
00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:17.095
Code is important, but
there's a lot more to it than that.

142
00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:19.715
That's a really important thing
to realize as software engineers,

143
00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:20.762
especially as you move up.

144
00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:25.460
We learned engineering
management is a role change.

145
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.510
There's a lot of roles in any business,
whether you're a non-profit,

146
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.428
an enterprise company, a startup,
everybody has a different role.

147
00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:35.183
At a smaller company, you might wear
multiple roles or have multiple roles,

148
00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:38.474
but engineering management is just
a role change, it's not more,

149
00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:41.964
it's not less, it's just a different
part of software engineering.
