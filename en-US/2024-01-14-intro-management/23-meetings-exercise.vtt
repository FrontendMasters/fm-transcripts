1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.748
I have an exercise.

2
00:00:00.748 --> 00:00:03.468
It won't take a full 15 minutes,
but I want you to think

3
00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:07.040
critically about the meetings you're in,
cuz I promise you're in some,

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.520
probably not as many as me, but
you're probably in more than you think.

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.135
And the purpose of the exercise is
to figure out what should you be

6
00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.309
focused on when it comes
to these meetings.

7
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.698
It's something I hadn't given a lot
of thought until I became a manager.

8
00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:24.137
So we'll jump right over here.

9
00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:32.223
Where does your time go?

10
00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:33.896
I ask that all the time.

11
00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:37.941
I close my laptop, and what did I do?

12
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.239
I looked back on my weekend,
what did I do?

13
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.455
My calendar was full,
where do I spend my time?

14
00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.319
And this is something
you have to be good at.

15
00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:46.988
If you're becoming an engineering manager,

16
00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:48.535
you have to be good at
balancing your time.

17
00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:49.181
You can't spend all of
your time in one-on-ones.

18
00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.895
You can't spend all your time
doing one thing or the other.

19
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.148
You have to balance it, and
what that ratio looks like totally varies.

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.393
So, we'll say take two minutes right now,
five minutes.

21
00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:08.773
What are your responsibilities for
your role?

22
00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:12.497
I know as software engineers you're
gonna say delivering code, but

23
00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:14.303
try to be a little more specific.

24
00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:19.977
A good place to look is career framework,
if your job has one.

25
00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.632
The company's job page is really helpful.

26
00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.989
If you've hired recently, look at what
the job description says and be like,

27
00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.838
do I do these things that
the job description says?

28
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:32.835
Your team charter is a good place
to be like, what should I be doing?

29
00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:34.625
The roadmap is another place.

30
00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.382
So take five minutes now,
fill up your responsibilities, and

31
00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.254
then, This one's a little bit easier.

32
00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:45.142
Look at where you spend
your time in a week.

33
00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:47.142
Is it, like me, a lot of meetings?

34
00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:48.059
Is it Slack?

35
00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:49.525
Is it reviewing pull requests?

36
00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:51.717
I'm curious to see where
you spend your time.

37
00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.472
So for
those of you who filled out the table for

38
00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:04.377
task responsibilities and
where you should be spending your time.

39
00:02:04.377 --> 00:02:05.622
Any insights there?

40
00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:06.861
Anything surprising?

41
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:11.532
Anything shared on where you
should be spending your time?

42
00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:12.842
Is it writing code?

43
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.578
Anybody have that down?

44
00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:18.486
What percent of times are you
supposed to spend writing code?

45
00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:20.543
&gt;&gt; What am I supposed to spend?

46
00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:23.317
I have no idea what I
should suppose to spend.

47
00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:26.870
I spent 65,
probably 70% of my time writing code, or

48
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.031
I guess in code related activity, so code
review too, I guess I would throw in that.

49
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:34.225
So that's writing and reading.

50
00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:35.952
That's a lot.

51
00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:39.152
&gt;&gt; What did you put for
the rest of your time?

52
00:02:39.152 --> 00:02:45.815
&gt;&gt; Design discussions and
then working with other engineers,

53
00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:51.180
charting architecture,
those kind of things.

54
00:02:53.012 --> 00:02:57.295
&gt;&gt; So I was one of those kinda accidental
managers where the opportunity happened.

55
00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:01.006
And so I've kind of had
this mental image of like,

56
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.326
I should be coding 50% of the time,
roughly.

57
00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:07.601
It kind of added up, and I was like,
okay, meetings 50ish percent.

58
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.323
Management, I'm worth 15.

59
00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:13.812
Coding, I put down what I had left,
but I also had Slack which is 15%, so

60
00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:14.828
just left 20.

61
00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:18.055
And I'm like, what I mentally thought-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

62
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.139
&gt;&gt; Versus reality, so far off.

63
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.487
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm [LAUGH].

64
00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:28.324
&gt;&gt; So definitely some things
to think about [LAUGH].

65
00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:32.619
&gt;&gt; When I ran this exercise too,
it's always surprising about, in my mind,

66
00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.608
what I should be spending my time.

67
00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:36.593
Even where I think I spend my time and

68
00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:40.178
where I actually spend my time
are always two different things.

69
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:44.286
And trying to reconcile them is,
it's challenging.

70
00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:48.024
So what about you'll, in reality,
where you should spend your time

71
00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:52.550
versus where you do spend your time, where
do you end up spending most of your time?

72
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.995
Is it actually coding?

73
00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:56.558
Is it projects?

74
00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:05.266
&gt;&gt; For me, it's a lot of meetings [LAUGH].

75
00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:13.305
&gt;&gt; For me,
because I can pull up Google Calendar, and

76
00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:18.214
Google Calendar breaks down meetings
if you tag them appropriately.

77
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:23.320
And maybe in between a break I'll show you
all how to do that, it's very helpful,

78
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.628
but I average, I don't know,
16 to 20 hours of meetings a week.

79
00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:30.187
But you're like, Jem,
you work a 40-hour workweek, right?

80
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:36.225
But that doesn't count for Slack and
things where I'm responding to people.

81
00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.652
It doesn't count for reading docs.

82
00:04:38.652 --> 00:04:42.746
It doesn't count for just generally
communicating with people or

83
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:43.850
being informed.

84
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.617
So I'm like,
where does the time always go?

85
00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.029
I have 40 hours to get stuff done.

86
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.786
I usually don't get
everything I wanna get done.

87
00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:51.539
And sometimes it's very frustrating.

88
00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.030
So it's good to take a look at this
list on where I'm spending my time and

89
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.069
figure out, okay,
maybe I don't need to be in Slack as much.

90
00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.657
You know what, maybe these fires will put
themselves out or other people can do it.

91
00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:03.993
It's not critical for

92
00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:08.217
me to be informed in every single
decision that is being made right now.

93
00:05:08.217 --> 00:05:14.010
So, a good tip, something I didn't
realize becoming a manager,

94
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.262
block off time on your calendar for
lunch [LAUGH].

95
00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:21.331
People will schedule noon to 1 or
whenever your lunch is.

96
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:24.811
People will schedule right over that, so
you have to block off time to eat lunch.

97
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.106
That's something I learned very early on.

98
00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:29.074
I was very hungry in my
early weeks of management.

99
00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:32.383
Another one is don't schedule back
to back meetings where you can.

100
00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:36.167
Schedule a break in there to get water,
a snack, use the restroom.

101
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.988
If you don't, your calendar will
fill up very, very quickly.

102
00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.778
Another lesson I learned as a manager
is people, they don't care how many

103
00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:44.344
other meetings you have cuz they're
not looking at your calendar.

104
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.916
They're just like,
here's a slot right there.

105
00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:50.956
So you gotta look after yourself and you
have to align about where you should be

106
00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:54.084
spending your time, and
where you are spending your time.

107
00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:56.864
And it's gonna vary
a lot from week to week.

108
00:05:56.864 --> 00:05:59.004
But overall,
you should have strong themes.

109
00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:02.514
Otherwise, what happens
is you get frustrated.

110
00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:03.632
And you get burnt out.

111
00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:06.975
Cuz you're like, the things I wanna do and
the things I should be doing

112
00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:09.369
are not lining up the things
that I am doing today.

113
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.349
So something's wrong there.

114
00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.566
An important takeaway
from this exercise is,

115
00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:18.539
what can you do to make space for
yourself?

116
00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.249
Like I said, I like creative time.

117
00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.752
Software engineering is
a creative business.

118
00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:25.682
You don't get through as
much of it as manager.

119
00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:28.365
How can I make time to do that for myself?

120
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:31.112
Maybe it's writing,
maybe it's designing a new team logo.

121
00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:32.752
Just being creative in general.

122
00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.432
Planning a interesting off site.

123
00:06:34.432 --> 00:06:37.014
I don't know.

124
00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:40.408
But you have to make space for
yourself, that's really important.

125
00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:43.231
And more importantly, what do you need to
be involved in, what can your team do?

126
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:45.653
Are you in a bunch of project meetings?

127
00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.986
Do you need to be in
those project meetings?

128
00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:52.762
Are you adding anything or
can someone from your team take that on?

129
00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:53.852
That's really important.

130
00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:56.013
And we talked about scaling yourself and
delegating.

131
00:06:56.013 --> 00:06:57.068
This is a skill.

132
00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:01.406
And if you don't do it, you're gonna
spend all of your time project meetings,

133
00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:03.632
one-on-one, status updates, etc.

134
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:07.119
That really don't require your presence,
but you're doing it anyways.

135
00:07:10.068 --> 00:07:11.233
Yeah.

136
00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:15.374
&gt;&gt; And Jake in the chat mentions that
I oftentimes block off periods of time

137
00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:18.205
throughout the day to work
on technical items and

138
00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:20.219
items that are blocking the team.

139
00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.633
&gt;&gt; I'm blocking the team.

140
00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.257
Then, that's time you can't account for.

141
00:07:23.257 --> 00:07:27.182
If you've over programmed your week,
something comes up.

142
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:29.189
There's, on-call, production's out.

143
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:30.858
You need to jump in on something.

144
00:07:30.858 --> 00:07:32.991
You don't have time to do that, and
you gotta rearrange your calendar.

145
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:35.864
So I really don't encourage people
to fill up their calendars.

146
00:07:35.864 --> 00:07:39.421
No one's judging you, [LAUGH] no
one's gonna think you're like, wow,

147
00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:40.481
look at this person.

148
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.205
They're in 30 hours of meetings a week.

149
00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:45.618
When I see that, I see someone who
doesn't know how to manage their time.

150
00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:50.288
Sometimes it's required, but
you don't wanna get there.

151
00:07:50.288 --> 00:07:51.819
You're not effective at certain point.
