1
00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.214
So I talked a lot about the motivations,
the different paths.

2
00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:06.618
But let's get a little more
tactical on what does it

3
00:00:06.618 --> 00:00:10.666
look like to move into management,
the actual transition.

4
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.914
So we had an interview earlier
with Ryan Burgess, and

5
00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:18.185
he talked about his path to management,
and his was more accidental.

6
00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.507
And really,
there's two ways to do things in life.

7
00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:25.829
There's accidentally doing something and
deliberately doing something.

8
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.320
Maybe one's easier than the other,
but they are both valid.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.268
I'd say a lot of cases in people
I talk to, the accidental case,

10
00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.853
the accidental manager
is more likely story.

11
00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:41.147
A lot of people don't set out to
become managers, I certainly didn't.

12
00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:43.707
In my software engineering career,
I got my CS degree,

13
00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:45.346
ready to go into the world and code.

14
00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:50.660
I was not like,
I'm gonna be a great manager someday,

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.011
far back as you can think.

16
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.881
So a lot of people's paths are accidental.

17
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:58.696
Mine was a little bit more planned,
more deliberate, but

18
00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:01.234
it was never my long-term
goal to become a manager.

19
00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:07.003
The accidental case happens all the time,
a rapidly growing company, which is great.

20
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.350
You're at a startup,
it's growing, it's growing,

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.927
it's growing, you're a manager, why?

22
00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.608
Cuz you've been at the company for
six months and

23
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.667
that's six months longer than
everybody else on the team.

24
00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.445
You're now a manager,
that happens all the time.

25
00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:24.606
Or you're the best software
engineer on the team,

26
00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:28.876
the team needs a manager,
you're now the manager.

27
00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:29.956
Let me stress this again,

28
00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.157
being a good software engineer does not
translate into being a good manager.

29
00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:37.165
In fact, consider it the opposite,
if you're a really good software engineer,

30
00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:41.369
that means you're good at shipping and
specing things, delivering things on time.

31
00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.111
And you're gonna pull something
of your core competency and

32
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:46.110
move them into an entirely different role.

33
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.672
That doesn't make any sense,
but that's usually the case.

34
00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:54.171
Sometimes the manager is just the best
software engineer on the team,

35
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:57.382
which is kind of weird to me,
but it happens a lot.

36
00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:02.705
In other cases the engineering
management team leaves and

37
00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:08.253
they're like, eeny meeny miny you,
you're now manager.

38
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:12.776
We chuckled, but it happens, this is
how a lot of people become managers.

39
00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:14.963
And you're like, crap,
and you sink or swim.

40
00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:19.498
And the problem is if you sink,
you pull everybody down with you.

41
00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:23.054
If you swim, it's gonna be a hard swim,
the boat's really far away,

42
00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:23.972
land is far away.

43
00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:30.804
Another accidental path is the team
lead to engineering manager.

44
00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:34.083
So a team lead, this varies from
company-to-company, but generally,

45
00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:37.008
you're a technical person,
you're still doing day-to-day.

46
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:40.523
But you're also responsible for
project management,

47
00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:43.672
the OKRs, the roadmap planning,
the strategy.

48
00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:47.368
A lot of times that's the team lead,
and they kind of accidentally

49
00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:51.137
become the manager, even though
that was not really their intent.

50
00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.125
In my mind, team lead does
something a little bit different,

51
00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.971
they're more the technical leader.

52
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.288
I have team leads, they're not officially
that but I do lean on them for

53
00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:00.742
technical side and planning.

54
00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:04.466
But I still do all the overall
strategy and things like that.

55
00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.902
But oftentimes the team lead
becomes the engineering manager and

56
00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:07.837
you don't even know it.

57
00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.827
A lot of times you're a manager and
you don't even know it, just people start

58
00:03:10.827 --> 00:03:13.827
thinking of you that way, cuz you're
the person who's the face of the team.

59
00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:18.299
You're the one sending out emails,
you're the one running slack,

60
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.929
that's pretty common.

61
00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:24.891
And then there's the deliberate path,
that's where you actively apply for roles.

62
00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:30.196
I'm a software engineer, I wanna
become a manager, this is what I did.

63
00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:33.564
And we'll talk about the challenges there.

64
00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:36.251
And sometimes it's deliberate,
if your company is well-structured,

65
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.604
they'll have a growth plan for you.

66
00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:42.316
From moving from software engineer all the
way to manager, if you're lucky, right?

67
00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:46.211
A lot of companies don't have that,
but some do.

68
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.688
And then sometimes you have a role
transition over time, where it's agreed by

69
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.809
your manager, it's a small enough team,
the blast radius is small.

70
00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.417
And you slowly grow your impact over time,
and eventually they make it official.

71
00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:58.461
Okay, you're a manager,
you've been doing it for a while,

72
00:03:58.461 --> 00:03:59.848
we're just gonna make it more official.

73
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.421
So of these two paths,

74
00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:07.281
what do you all think the majority
of your managers have fallen into?

75
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.973
Or if you are a manager,
which path did you fall?

76
00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:11.602
Were you the accidental manager?

77
00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:13.198
Or are you the deliberate manager?

78
00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:22.501
&gt;&gt; I was [COUGH] definitely accidental.

79
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:26.313
[COUGH] I was at Microsoft and we had
a bunch of different companies that got

80
00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:28.762
bought, and
we ended up making a new product.

81
00:04:28.762 --> 00:04:32.444
I didn't like the manager I had,
so I kinda went above and

82
00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:36.756
let them know I wasn't happy, and
then I ended up with my own team.

83
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:41.394
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The lesson there is
don't complain about things,

84
00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:44.301
right, you end up being a manager.

85
00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:47.901
&gt;&gt; My previous company,
it was more accidental,

86
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:52.763
we went through an acquisition and
we re-orged as part of that.

87
00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:57.688
And I ended up with some direct reports,
which I would have been fine with

88
00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:02.318
except I didn't really want to work for
the acquisitor, so I left.

89
00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:07.607
And in my current organization
my moves through that org have

90
00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:14.568
been more deliberate and more following
a company structured growth plan and.

91
00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:18.546
&gt;&gt; So of the two, since you've had both,
which path are you happier with?

92
00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:26.462
&gt;&gt; As you mentioned,
I think they're both valid.

93
00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:33.537
I think I appreciate the more
deliberate and intentional approach.

94
00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:39.420
It's certainly more appropriate for
the role that I'm in currently and

95
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.796
how I've arrived there and all the other
[LAUGH] context and factors around it.

96
00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:50.788
Smaller orgs,
accidental can totally work and

97
00:05:50.788 --> 00:05:54.670
probably make a lot more sense even.

98
00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:04.537
&gt;&gt; Online we have someone who
said they earned the trust and

99
00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:08.318
respect of their team and
just ended up there.

100
00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:10.875
And then a few other
people said accidental.

101
00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:14.159
Someone said 90% accidental.

102
00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:20.573
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's kind of wild, right?

103
00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:23.163
Most people have a manager or
someone they report to,

104
00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:26.170
actually everybody has someone
they report to, generally.

105
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.492
And it's such a critical, vital role,
and with a really big impact, but

106
00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:33.786
we don't put a lot of thought
into how people got there.

107
00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:38.640
It doesn't make any sense, and
we're all intelligent people in tech.

108
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.643
I shouldn't say we're
all intelligent people.

109
00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:44.793
We work in a, what do we call it?

110
00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:45.842
What is it, a knowledge field?

111
00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:46.433
&gt;&gt; Knowledge work.

112
00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:47.718
&gt;&gt; Yeah, knowledge work, thank you.

113
00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:51.247
Yeah, which is, seen by the world as like,
you think more,

114
00:06:51.247 --> 00:06:53.252
you don't do things with your hand.

115
00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:57.174
I don't necessarily agree that's better,
but that's kind of some perceptions.

116
00:06:57.174 --> 00:07:00.849
So, but we think about things,
we do knowledge work, but

117
00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.499
yet we don't think about how people
end up in the positions of authority,

118
00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:07.755
which doesn't make a lot of sense.

119
00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.319
So if you're a director or
VP watching this,

120
00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:14.101
look how people under you who
are reporting to you became leaders.

121
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:18.002
Really think about that, that means a lot
of people never have formal training.

122
00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:20.458
They've never had any
sort of hiring training.

123
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.578
They've never had any inclusion training.

124
00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:27.370
They're just now a leader and they're
responsible for all these things, but

125
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.300
nobody told them.

126
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.457
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in my case,
I really liked writing code,

127
00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:35.462
I liked it day-to-day a lot more,
I thought it was more fun.

128
00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:40.390
But when I came down to it,
seeing a product that I thought needed to

129
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.233
exist in the world, I had to learn
a different way to approach it.

130
00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:50.484
Cuz you writing code every day wasn't
gonna get this product into the world.

131
00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:54.393
I had to think about what
are the systems at play and

132
00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:59.420
then how can I get a lot of people
working on those various parts of

133
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:05.117
the system in order to see the thing
I wanted in the world actually exist.

134
00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:11.504
And so it's more fulfilling today, but
it was more fun then, if that makes sense.

135
00:08:11.504 --> 00:08:17.564
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like what you said, Mark,
that's exactly how I translate it.

136
00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:21.265
Engineering management is lots of fun,
but it's more fulfilling, and

137
00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:25.585
until you've done it, it's really hard
to be like, that doesn't make any sense.

138
00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:30.867
But that's the truth of it,
I don't have too much fun, but

139
00:08:30.867 --> 00:08:37.008
I'm more rewarded by successes,
and I definitely learn a lot more.

140
00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:40.788
I still think it's funny,
the accidental versus deliberate path,

141
00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.947
I think accidental is far more common.

142
00:08:42.947 --> 00:08:44.839
We don't invest in
people becoming leaders,

143
00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:46.350
we just assume they're gonna do it.

144
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.345
And some people do it well,
a lot of people don't.

145
00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:52.632
I don't know, I can't fix the system,

146
00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.270
I can just point out
some incongruities in it.
