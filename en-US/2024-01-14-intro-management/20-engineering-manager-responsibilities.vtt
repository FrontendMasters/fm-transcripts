1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.624
So I can break down the responsibilities
as we did before, management,

2
00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:04.890
engineering and people.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.710
On the management side,
this is a lot of work you don't see.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.240
I won't say paperwork is the nature of it,
but you do do paperwork.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.010
Businesses run on paperwork,
we don't just make decisions.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.210
You were just so in competition you need
update that you have to make sure they're

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.940
getting paid properly.

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.720
When you're hiring that's
that's a lot of paperwork.

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.554
You probably haven't thought
of writing a job description,

10
00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:35.660
which Ryan's going to cover in engineering
management one or two tomorrow.

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.550
That's a lot of work to write
a good job description.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.950
It takes time, that's paperwork.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.757
Letting someone go, you've got to write
down why, you have to talk to HR,

14
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:45.330
you have to fill a lot of paperwork there.

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.320
There's a lot of business side of things
that a manager is responsible for

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.220
that most people never see.

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.490
And I'm just trying to shine
a light on some of that.

18
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.218
When it comes to expenses, someone fills
out expense reports, you buy something

19
00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:02.284
new, unless you're filling out the expense
reports, someone's got to approve that.

20
00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.149
I was gonna take a look.

21
00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.456
One that I ran into recently that I
found not so fun vendor management.

22
00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.100
If we're buying software,
I need to deal with a vendor.

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.892
I got to talk to their sales rep who's
trying to sell me something more trying to

24
00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:19.580
get more into the company.

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.290
Like hey, there's some other people
that can talk to him like now.

26
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.410
Just me, am sorry.

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.260
But you have to keep them happy too cuz
you're buying technology from them.

28
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.233
I have to look over the contract,
I've got to talk to legal,

29
00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:31.890
I have to sign that contract.

30
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.412
All this stuff that goes into, hey,
Jim, can we just buy Adobe Suite or

31
00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.530
something like that or
some piece of software?

32
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.160
Sure, but someone has to put in all
the paperwork and business side of things.

33
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.670
That's the responsibility of the manager,
that's fine.

34
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.070
I don't know anybody that loves this part,
but it is necessary to have this done.

35
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.954
Engineering, you're responsible for
the charter of your team now.

36
00:01:57.954 --> 00:01:59.417
What does your team do?

37
00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:01.196
What don't they do?

38
00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:03.968
You should probably have an answer to
that, someone's got to figure that out and

39
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:04.760
that's your job now.

40
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.060
The communications, and that includes
things that you probably don't think of.

41
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.000
If you use Slack, someone's got to
set up your team's Slack channels.

42
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.990
Someone's got to set up
the other Slack channels.

43
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.130
Someone has to maintain those,
that's usually the manager doing that.

44
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.437
When I joined the team, it was a frequent
question we got was, hey, Jem,

45
00:02:23.437 --> 00:02:26.721
we're working on this project,
we're gonna ship it out.

46
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.870
Who needs to know this I was like,
that's a good question.

47
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.130
I should know that answer.

48
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.026
So I had to aggregate all of our
partners and teams together and

49
00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:36.542
to create a distribution list.

50
00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.886
And then I shared that with team and
I was like, hey, just if you have

51
00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:44.009
any announcements to send it to the steel,
you don't have to worry about anymore.

52
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.920
But that's just the process I introduced,
but someone had to do that.

53
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.100
So I had to set up all this stuff.

54
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.250
When there aren't big changes, too.

55
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.910
It's your job to share it out and share
the joy and like yeah, way to go team.

56
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.090
That's all communications that you have to
do as you're responsible now as manager.

57
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.995
The long term strategy,
we've talked a bit about that.

58
00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:05.272
Where are we headed?

59
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:07.080
Why are we headed there?

60
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.170
Are we making good progress?

61
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.810
Should we reevaluate that
progress halfway through?

62
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.430
That's your job.

63
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.420
Work proposition, what should we be doing?

64
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.160
What should we not be doing?

65
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.790
Something just came in,
should we address this immediately?

66
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.270
Is that a high priority?

67
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.566
A lot of that's your job too,
is it a piece here or

68
00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:27.430
is it something we can wait till another,
another quarter.

69
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.350
Context setting,
my style of leadership is leader.

70
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.210
I like to be a leader who
builds up other leaders.

71
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.630
And that's the way I scale myself,
I scale the team.

72
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.620
It's worked pretty well.

73
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.965
We do a lot, so
we do a lot with not a lot of engineers.

74
00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:45.040
But to do that,
a leader still needs context.

75
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.320
It doesn't matter what
level you're operating at.

76
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.169
Why, why are we doing things?

77
00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.939
How I don't think about as much that's up
to the individual members of the team.

78
00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.200
But the why is really important.

79
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.800
Humans wanna know why they're doing.

80
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.780
Intelligent people wanna know why
you can't just tell them what to do.

81
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.894
So, I do a lot of context settings and
something else you don't think about if

82
00:04:05.894 --> 00:04:11.481
there's any sort of change management,
a reorg, maybe your company got a new CTO,

83
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:15.910
maybe my manager, the director has
let go or something like that.

84
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.680
Maybe they have let someone
else go on a different team.

85
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.012
I have to set a lot of context for
people and say like,

86
00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:22.060
this is why things are happening.

87
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.977
Here's all this background information.

88
00:04:23.977 --> 00:04:27.633
That's your responsibility, cuz manager or
software engineers generally don't know

89
00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.377
all these things that you know,
and the challenging part of that.

90
00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:33.627
If you have to filter it for them, you
can't just give him a firehose of like,

91
00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:34.830
here's the latest trauma.

92
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.000
Let me tell you, they just fired that
person over there and here's why.

93
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.680
Guess what, you can't do that.

94
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.550
That's not helpful.

95
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.520
It's something, but you can't just
share everything with people.

96
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.771
You can't share everything with every
single person that sometimes people aren't

97
00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:51.527
ready to handle that or you have to
change the way you communicate that.

98
00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:55.526
So context setting is
a large part of the role, but

99
00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:58.966
it takes work, it's not a one-to-one.

100
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.444
Managing your partners and
your stakeholders.

101
00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:03.421
Who are people dependent on your team?

102
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:04.997
Who are you dependent on?

103
00:05:04.997 --> 00:05:06.190
Do they know what your team is up to?

104
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.130
Are you going to need their help in
the next quarter, the next year?

105
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.304
Do they know that?

106
00:05:11.304 --> 00:05:13.860
Are you gonna need to help them?

107
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.740
Does your team know that?

108
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.120
You have to manage all
these relationships too.

109
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
So relationship management is really
big part of engineering management.

110
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.068
And then there's project
management as well,

111
00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:26.450
sometimes you had to step in a leader
project, plus it's really large.

112
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.179
You had to become good at leading
technology projects when you're not

113
00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:34.490
the one coding, which is an entirely
different skill set than actually coding.

114
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.636
So, question?
&gt;&gt; This is a little related back to

115
00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:44.551
the bridge between engineers and
engineering management, but isn't it our

116
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:50.659
job as engineering managers to motivate
engineers to care about the business?

117
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I wouldn't say care about the business.

118
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.550
I don't know if I'd use that terminology.

119
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.190
You have to make it relevant to them.

120
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.767
I mean,
you could say care about the business,

121
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:07.633
but if you're a software engineer and
you're getting paid a salary and

122
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.983
the stock goes up,
the CEO comes in a meeting, you're like,

123
00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:14.551
it's really important to get
the stock up to this, blah, blah.

124
00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:17.720
As a software engineer you're
probably not gonna care that much.

125
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.730
So you have to make things relevant
to people in a way that makes sense.

126
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.121
Find out what they care about,
and then change the context so

127
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:28.110
they understand it and make it relevant.

128
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.472
But the carrying of the business,
sometimes you can do it,

129
00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:32.826
sometimes you can't.

130
00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.180
Not everybody works,
I'm privileged to work for

131
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.720
a company where it's pretty well loved,
we have a good product.

132
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.020
But sometimes you're working in,
I don't know, making accounting software.

133
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.260
I don't know, unless you're really
passionate about numbers, I'm probably not

134
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.238
gonna be able to make you passionate
about that particular side of business.

135
00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:53.358
So, it's my job to find
the things that are important and

136
00:06:53.358 --> 00:06:55.380
translate those to the team,yeah.

137
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.612
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't that actually be a red
flag if you're being asked as

138
00:06:59.612 --> 00:07:02.750
an engineering manager to make
this stuff go up [LAUGH] ?,

139
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.490
&gt;&gt; Maybe a too far example,

140
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.291
&gt;&gt; Maybe, yeah.

141
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:09.856
Well, I find sometimes managers
complain to me that they're

142
00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:13.365
being asked to do well
the charter of the team for

143
00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:18.987
example is like a constant struggle
because delineation of responsibility

144
00:07:18.987 --> 00:07:23.494
between teams is sometimes
a struggle between teams [LAUGH].

145
00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:27.421
&gt;&gt; It is an aspect I did
not invest enough, but

146
00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:32.983
now I do look back and
its really important to have a charter,

147
00:07:32.983 --> 00:07:37.564
its one of those things you
are like this is silly,

148
00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:40.836
when is it really reading this, but

149
00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:46.580
I won't [INAUDIBLE] I believe
goona write one tomorrow.

150
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.805
Or in engineering management 102,
cuz they are important.

151
00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:54.360
On the stock price thing,
it's happened to me before.

152
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.232
Maybe not the stock price per se, but
it's more we have a financial target as

153
00:07:58.232 --> 00:08:01.925
a company to hit these gross margins
in order to improve our stock price or

154
00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:03.470
do something.

155
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.450
And then, I have to take that and say,
like, how does that translate to me?

156
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.970
Usually that's for my director and
above who distil that down.

157
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.600
But still, that's context, I get that I
know where we're heading as a company.

158
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.650
Does my team care about that?

159
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.882
They don't, but how does that show up?

160
00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:23.656
There's a variety of ways so
I won't go into all of them, but

161
00:08:23.656 --> 00:08:25.433
yeah, that is a challenge.

162
00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:26.938
Was there another question?

163
00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:34.943
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a little related to maybe
working on something that isn't as fun or

164
00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:39.479
exciting, but a person in the chat
mentioned that when I'm forced

165
00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.190
to work on a project
that I don't agree with.

166
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.220
I frame it as a demo for how our team
can elevate our engineering rigor.

167
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:55.357
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that,
that's a good way of translating things.

168
00:08:55.357 --> 00:08:58.022
It's a balance.

169
00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:01.710
Sometimes you need to be direct with the
team, say like, here's what we got to do.

170
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.900
And sometimes you need to step back and
let the team figure that out.

171
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.457
Say like, what about this and

172
00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:10.086
ask a series of leading questions to
get them to arrive at the answer.

173
00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:10.810
And how you do that?

174
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.770
It really depends.

175
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.892
That's kind of the whole story of
management, it's like, it depends.

176
00:09:16.892 --> 00:09:21.102
So I wish I had concrete,
this is what you do in this scenario, but

177
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.645
it's gonna vary a lot.

178
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:29.701
And the final responsibility
is people recruiting.

179
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:32.023
Something people struggle with,

180
00:09:32.023 --> 00:09:37.156
a lot of new managers struggle with
hiring and recruiting, surprisingly.

181
00:09:37.156 --> 00:09:42.730
For me, it's one of the more
enjoyable aspects, but I'm weird.

182
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.347
But recruiting is something you need
to get good at, talking to strangers,

183
00:09:46.347 --> 00:09:50.019
explaining what your team does and why
this person should work for your team or

184
00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:53.080
not quickly and
concisely takes a lot of skill.

185
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.270
The elevator pitch for your team.

186
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.760
It's trickier than it seems.

187
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.426
You're responsible for Team developments.

188
00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:02.020
Are they growing as a team?

189
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.931
Are they picking up new skills and
technology or they're stagnating,

190
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:06.620
happy where they are.

191
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.690
Sometimes you need develop teams,
sometimes you leave me alone.

192
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.510
You got to figure that out.

193
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.375
Performance coaching we've talked
about during the manager interview.

194
00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:15.620
Sometimes people just need
a nudge in the right direction.

195
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.720
Some people are slipping and
they don't know it.

196
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.930
Some people are doing consciously and
you have to figure out are they doing it?

197
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.310
Is it conscious or unconscious?

198
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.920
And figure out what to do next and
set expectations.

199
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.416
You're responsible for team health.

200
00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:32.659
Like I said, I have a team of introverts,
so I have to work a little bit harder when

201
00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:35.429
it comes to getting them to talk to
each other outside of technology,

202
00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:38.100
talked about the personal lives,
but that's important.

203
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.720
At the end of that you're
working with other people.

204
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.630
So you need to get along with those
people whether you know it or not.

205
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.310
It's really important for
have good team cohesion.

206
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.000
And that's your responsibility now.

207
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:54.346
Any sort of conflict that arises
with partner, intra team that's your

208
00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:59.912
responsibility too, you gotta solve
that there's no so and so's arguing so

209
00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:04.707
and so these jerks I can't believe
they're doing that that's all

210
00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:10.370
you man [LAUGH] that's your
responsibility now, you can avoid it.

211
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.590
Earlier, I think someone said conflict
avoidance is something to work on.

212
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.509
Yeah, you can't avoid conflicts anymore,
you have to run to them, and

213
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:20.965
put them out before they
become much larger.

214
00:11:20.965 --> 00:11:23.986
And that's uncomfortable for
me too, I don't wanna deal with it,

215
00:11:23.986 --> 00:11:25.049
I have my own problems.

216
00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:28.050
And now people on my team
are creating new problems.

217
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.200
Like, why are you doing this to me?

218
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.050
See the gray hair in my beard already?

219
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.606
But it's something you have to do now,
it's your responsibility,

220
00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:37.763
you can't offload that to anybody else.

221
00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:41.845
And then onboarding, that's a one you
probably don't think of very often.

222
00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:44.837
Is you hire someone new,
you're picking them now,

223
00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:48.020
you got to get them up to speed and
get them productive.

224
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.630
How do you do that?

225
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.610
What does that look like?

226
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.054
Does that depend on the role,
the person, the place your team is at?

227
00:11:54.054 --> 00:11:55.440
That's your responsibility now too.

228
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.033
There's probably a lot more
on the people's side, but

229
00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:01.731
hopefully this is a good snapshot of
there's a lot of responsibilities you have

230
00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:03.520
as an engineering manager.

231
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.400
How those play out, it's gonna vary
from person to person, team to team.

232
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.083
But in general these are all
things you have to think about and

233
00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:12.300
it's your job now to care.
