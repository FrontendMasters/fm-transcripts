00:00:00.034 --> 00:00:02.843
When it comes to managing up, are you
familiar with the phrase managing up?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.119
That essentially means you have to manage
your manager, because they have different

3
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.601
expectations, they have different things
they need, they have different priorities

4
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.380
that aren't necessarily focused on you and
your team, that's your job.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.250
So managing up is kind of
the art of doing that.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.304
So when you first meet with your manager,

7
00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.070
things you should find
out pretty early on.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.190
What are their expectations?

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.340
What are they looking from from you?

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.830
Is it to, I don't know, maybe they want
clean objectives or KPIs written down.

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.680
Maybe it's just the team should
just be functioning and be healthy.

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.260
What's important to
your manager right now?

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.180
What's important to them in the future?

14
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.130
Good things to know cuz it's gonna impact
you one way or the other to know that.

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.142
What information do they care about?

16
00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:54.840
Do they care about someone on your team
has a dog and they just had puppies?

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.080
Is that relevant to them?

18
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.140
Maybe, some people like that
information about your team.

19
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.890
But you can't share everything
that's happening because remember,

20
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.680
they have other teams and
other managers reporting to them.

21
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.050
They don't need to know
the nuances of everything, so

22
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.070
find out what information
do they care about?

23
00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:13.530
And what can they help with?

24
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.768
Some managers, some senior managers,
directors, etc.,

25
00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:20.330
are not super technical they're
not well-versed in your domain.

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.930
Some are, and they can actually
help you in some aspects.

27
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.440
But what exactly do you need help with?

28
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.802
You have to hire soon,
you need help with that.

29
00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:32.430
A lot of times what's helpful is
they can tell you who to talk to.

30
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.881
If nothing else, who are your partners?

31
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:35.630
They could probably give
you insight into that.

32
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.861
But it's important to find out what
they can do and what they can't do and

33
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.004
what they will do and what they won't do.

34
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.400
That's probably an important
role to establish.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.513
If your manager feels like they're doing
too much for you, you're probably not

36
00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:51.098
being effective, and you should
figure that out pretty early on.

37
00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:57.970
The way you do that is one
on ones with your manager.

38
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.030
Mine are weekly for an hour.

39
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.933
I meet with my manager every week for
an hour, which is about the right cadence.

40
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.274
Which seems a lot for one on one if I
do that for every member of my team,

41
00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:09.750
that'd be a lot, but for me,
it's really important time every week.

42
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.794
And staff meetings, hearing from
other managers, see what's going on,

43
00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:16.410
their perspective is gonna
be different from yours.

44
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.749
You can learn a lot from just
listening to other people and

45
00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.123
what's going on at the company.

46
00:02:22.363 --> 00:02:24.842
So the takeaway is when you
first become an early manager,

47
00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:26.670
don't try to do too much in the beginning.

48
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.391
Try to do as,
I won't say as [LAUGH] little as possible,

49
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.444
cuz I don't want you to feel like Jim told
me to chill, so that's what I'm doing.

50
00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:36.254
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But by listening it doesn't look

51
00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:38.417
like you're doing anything,
but you are, and

52
00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:41.734
just being curious, it doesn't look
like you're anything, you are.

53
00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:43.840
And don't try to do too much,
don't try to change too much.
