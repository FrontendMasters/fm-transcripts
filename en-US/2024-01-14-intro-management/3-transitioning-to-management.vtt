00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.023
In the last section we learned,
maybe some epiphanies about technology and

2
00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:09.007
the business of IT and
the business of software engineering.

3
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.360
Let's talk about that
transition to management.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.380
One of the more challenging aspects of
moving from ICT to being a manager.

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.589
Everybody's transition is different.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.841
There's so many varieties of scenarios
that you can end up it's it's you make

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.120
the transition from ICT manager.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.860
Sometimes you transition
within your own company.

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.681
Sometimes it's a different company,
sometimes the same company but

10
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.490
a different area of the company,
different domain.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.949
Sometimes it's a different
language entirely.

12
00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.190
There's so many different variables
about what that transition looks like.

13
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.037
So we'll talk broadly about how to make
that a little bit more successful.

14
00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:47.530
So we're gonna start with careers.

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.619
And we're talking about the motivations on
why people become software engineers and

16
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.140
why they're usually wrong, or engineering
managers, and why they're wrong.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.803
And we'll talk about making the move,
like actually doing the thing and

18
00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:04.479
towards the end we're gonna
wrap up with the interview.

19
00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.105
And I'm gonna do a live interview with
Brian just so you get a taste of kind of

20
00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:12.312
what that looks like because again like an
engineering manager interview is something

21
00:01:12.312 --> 00:01:14.930
you'll probably never see
until you actually do it.

22
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.455
So, it won't get all the questions, but
maybe I'll give you some insights there.

23
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.090
So let's talk about
technology career paths.

24
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.910
In the world, there's probably
27 million software engineers.

25
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.462
Give or take,
we don't have a good number on this, but

26
00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:33.973
this is a pretty good estimate.

27
00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:37.200
In the United States, there's about
4.4 million software engineers.

28
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.570
Have you ever think about that?

29
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.060
That's a lot of software engineers.

30
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.780
That's a lot of technology.

31
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.216
But most software engineers don't
even live in the United States,

32
00:01:47.216 --> 00:01:49.877
something we probably don't
think about too much.

33
00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:53.024
Cuz all we see are sites and Internet,
we see the English Internet but

34
00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:55.150
there's an entire other
Internet out there.

35
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.205
Within the United States,
there's probably half a million,

36
00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:02.000
maybe 600,000 software
engineering managers.

37
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.014
The numbers on these are a little bit
murky, because there's different titles.

38
00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:08.212
Not everybody has the title
of engineering manager.

39
00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:11.289
Sometimes it's Team Lead could
actually be the manager,

40
00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.810
sometimes director is actually manager.

41
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.789
So, this is probably our best guess
on how many engineering managers, but

42
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.600
the fact is, there's not that many.

43
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.120
Like, compared to software engineer,
if you wanna I don't know,

44
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.900
career stability, resiliency,
and finding a job,

45
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.890
you're probably better off
being a software engineer.

46
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.500
There's just more roles for
that than there are engineering managers.

47
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.569
Something to think about when
you think about this transition.

48
00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.209
But in software engineering, there's
two career paths you can think of, and

49
00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.320
these aren't perfectly straight ladders.

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.670
They kind of veer off to the side,
think of them more as stairs.

51
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.913
But generally,
there's the technical side, and

52
00:02:48.913 --> 00:02:51.190
that's the side most
people are familiar with.

53
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.860
You start with junior, senior, staff,

54
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.151
principal, distinguished
moving up the ladder.

55
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.730
And these titles will vary
from company to company.

56
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.136
But generally,
you start from knowing nothing,

57
00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:08.581
playing around with JavaScript in your
browser to I architect entire systems.

58
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:13.359
And I move the needle with code that I
write, or code that I instruct to write.

59
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.311
Then there's the other side,
the people side of things, where manager,

60
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.081
maybe senior manager, director,
senior director, vice president,

61
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:25.630
all the way up to CTO, the chief
technology officer of the company.

62
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.341
And these are both important ladders too.

63
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.934
They both do something.

64
00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.560
One is not better than the other
the focus is just different.

65
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.410
But here's the thing,
it doesn't matter which ladder you climb.

66
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.006
There's truths about software
engineering in general as you move up

67
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:43.775
the career ladder.

68
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:50.300
The first truth is the individual
lines of code is less important.

69
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.740
The further up you go,
the less the nuances of so

70
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.440
what's the sorting function I use for
this array?

71
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.415
What framework are we using
as you move up and up and up,

72
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.293
it just becomes less important and

73
00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:06.457
not saying it's not important don't
don't let me take that away from you.

74
00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:10.040
But the truth is if you're
a principal software engineer or

75
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.341
your CTO they don't care about what
stack you're using necessarily,

76
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:17.078
unless there's an actual material impact.

77
00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.215
They don't care about which
database you're using,

78
00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:21.220
unless there's a material
impact to the company.

79
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.045
And it's a very different
perspective on software engineering.

80
00:04:25.045 --> 00:04:28.860
It's one of those things that's
really hard to understand.

81
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.300
And you don't appreciate it until
you start moving up and up and up.

82
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.790
And you say, you know what?

83
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.632
People arguing over which
font to use in VS Code.

84
00:04:37.632 --> 00:04:41.370
I'm so much more productive
in dark mode than light mode.

85
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.160
It's just so unimportant in the grand
scheme of how software gets built.

86
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.420
And I'm not knocking any of you.

87
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.399
If you wanna have those arguments,
that's totally fine.

88
00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:53.639
I'm just saying the truth of what
actually happens when you move up.

89
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.139
Question?

90
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.413
&gt;&gt; Are these distinct ladders or is the
people path a branch of the engineering

91
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:07.870
ladder are realistic that a person could
land a first position in management?

92
00:05:09.673 --> 00:05:13.327
&gt;&gt; Great question, they are.

93
00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:14.580
I wouldn't say they're actually distinct.

94
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.434
This is more of a visual picture.

95
00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:20.020
A lot of people go back and forth.

96
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.778
They go from senior to manager,
I've seen people go from VP

97
00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:28.548
back down to senior engineer A lot
of people jump back and forth,

98
00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:31.388
it's actually probably some of the best
software engineers that I know

99
00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:34.867
were engineering managers at some point,
and they're just phenomenal to work with.

100
00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:38.024
I don't have to pull teeth
on like OKRs and KPIs and

101
00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:41.180
project management,
they just know how to do it,

102
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.479
which is the best way to become
a well-rounded software engineer.

103
00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.360
But really, I think the further up you go,
they come a little more distinct.

104
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.754
But generally, these are just bulk
batches of software engineer,

105
00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.080
this is how things happen.

106
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.092
You couldn't have, again,
we'll go back to Windows,

107
00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:03.260
you couldn't build Windows without
the people side of things managing that.

108
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.380
But you can also couldn't build
it without people writing code.

109
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.220
So they're both equally important,
but you're free to go back and forth.

110
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.870
Again, I said in the beginning of course,

111
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.640
I don't recommend people moving to
management before making senior

112
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.410
software engineer at least three
to five years experience minimum.

113
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.519
The fact is you will have
to talk about technology.

114
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.120
You'll have to learn about it.

115
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.152
If you don't understand what people
are saying, because you don't haven't done

116
00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:31.096
it yourself, you're gonna have a much
harder time than someone who's actually

117
00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:34.020
moved up the ladder on this technical side
and then jumped over the people side.

118
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.802
You can do it differently people do just
fine perspective from making it easier on

119
00:06:39.802 --> 00:06:40.475
yourself.

120
00:06:43.646 --> 00:06:46.419
And then the truth of both of
these letters is business becomes

121
00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.340
more important.

122
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.617
How things are actually functioning,

123
00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:54.385
the roles of everybody else who isn't
writing code becomes a lot more important.

124
00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:58.444
Why we're writing the code, how we're
getting paid, who's double checking that?

125
00:06:58.444 --> 00:07:01.495
Are we reporting to investors?

126
00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:03.804
That becomes a lot more important.

127
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:06.524
You're focused on, hey,
we got to raise the next round of money.

128
00:07:06.524 --> 00:07:07.979
Are we delivering these features?

129
00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.468
Things that as a software engineer,
you probably don't think about as much.

130
00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:14.895
But as you move up, it doesn't matter
if it's people or technical side,

131
00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.850
it becomes a lot more about the business.

132
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.470
Your impact is bigger.

133
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.250
The ladder is a good analogy here.

134
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.920
Because as you move up,
what happens when you move up?

135
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.750
It's not a trick question.

136
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.030
If I'm on a ladder and
I stand up higher, what changes?

137
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.410
&gt;&gt; The risk of falling.

138
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.660
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Let's see more.

139
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.634
&gt;&gt; Yes, the risk of falling is true.

140
00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:44.730
We talked about that with
availability of roles.

141
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.050
If you lose your job as VP,

142
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.416
it's there's not that many VP of
engineering roles in the world.

143
00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:52.281
So the risk of falling is a lot higher and
you fall a lot harder for

144
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:53.810
some junior engineer and I fall.

145
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.950
Go find another job.

146
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.592
I'm a CTO of a company.

147
00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:02.340
How many of those are there in America?

148
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.330
Not that many.

149
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.760
So the risk of falling is true.

150
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.150
But the your perspective changes,
you're up higher.

151
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.763
The things like, the blade of grass that
you may have focused on as a software

152
00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:18.665
engineer and argued over the colors that
a green said it's kind of a blue green and

153
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.274
you know the the nuances.

154
00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:23.759
You just don't anymore because you
can't even see it that low you move

155
00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:27.090
further away from the code and
your perspective changes.

156
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.072
You see a lot higher like this tree
that I thought was the world is

157
00:08:32.072 --> 00:08:36.980
actually part of a forest and
that little speck in the distance.

158
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.061
That's actually a big mountain that
people don't even think about when

159
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:40.877
you're down low.

160
00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:43.502
So your perspective changes.

161
00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:47.030
But with your perspective,
your impact becomes broader as well.

162
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.030
Knowing, hey, you know what?

163
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.341
If we did switch this piece of technology
because this team's using it, but

164
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:57.201
they don't even know that
each team is using it, but

165
00:08:57.201 --> 00:08:59.297
I can see that because I'm up higher.

166
00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:02.188
How about we just create a central
team that figures out how to make this

167
00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.517
more effective for everybody?

168
00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:07.598
We make this a default technology
solution for the entire organization.

169
00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:09.775
And that's a bigger impact you could have,
but

170
00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:12.724
it's one of those you can only
get with the higher perspective.

171
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:19.020
You become more big picture when it
comes to technical understanding.

172
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.513
You will not be as good as code.

173
00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:22.566
The further up you go,

174
00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:26.120
you probably won't be as technical
about the individual piece of the code.

175
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.424
I know I keep hitting this part, but

176
00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:30.930
it's something really important when you
think about transitioning to management.

177
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.667
Even as you move up,
you have to understand how systems work.

178
00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:38.961
It doesn't matter which ladder,
you have to understand more and more and

179
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.940
more how the parts come together.

180
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.193
If you wanna use a car analogy, as
a software engineer, you probably build,

181
00:09:45.193 --> 00:09:47.900
I don't know, a transmission maybe.

182
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.140
Actually now you probably
won't get that far.

183
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.780
You probably own a couple
bolts on the engine.

184
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.349
And as a say, I don't know,
VP of engineering,

185
00:09:56.349 --> 00:09:59.050
you have to understand how cars work.

186
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.210
How engines work,
the chemistry of that, the combustion.

187
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.860
And the same for, say,
a principal engineer.

188
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.920
You have to have that same understanding.

189
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.256
And that's something that it doesn't
matter which ladder you move up.

190
00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:13.124
You have to be able to have this big
picture of technical understandings,

191
00:10:13.124 --> 00:10:13.830
how things work.

192
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.510
And we talked about this.

193
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.120
The further up you go,
the fewer roles there are, and

194
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.780
that's just the God's honest truth.

195
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.502
There just aren't as many engineering
manager roles in the world,

196
00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:31.695
and there's even less for directors,
there's even less for VPs and CTOs.

197
00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:36.249
So again, I'd say senior is
actually a good level to land at.

198
00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:39.833
If you say like, I just wanna make my
career in software engineering and I wanna

199
00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:44.280
just code for the rest of my life, senior
staff is a perfectly good place to be.

200
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.840
Because it's not a promotion.

201
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.695
I keep saying that it doesn't matter what
the world says, software engineering or

202
00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:50.260
engineering management is not a promotion.

203
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.035
It is a different role entirely.

204
00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:57.200
So, don't feel pressured that
you have to move up the ladder.

205
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.159
And I'll say that again,

206
00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.340
do not feel pressured that you
have to move up the ladder.

207
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.241
It is not a sign of your success or
failure if you just stay

208
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:08.484
Senior Software Engineer for
the rest of your life or staff.

209
00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:12.288
Some of the worst engineering managers
I've met and seen and heard have heard of

210
00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:15.694
there are people that have been forced
into the role because they felt,

211
00:11:15.694 --> 00:11:17.716
well, this is the next thing obviously.

212
00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:19.790
I have to move up the ladder.

213
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.183
Otherwise, what does
the world think of me?

214
00:11:22.183 --> 00:11:26.055
I've been this company 10 years and
I'm still a software engineer.

215
00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.990
Ignore that, that's not true at all.

216
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.920
It's a different role.

217
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.434
And if you do it for those motivations,
you will not have a good time.

218
00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:33.906
I like to write code.

219
00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:37.724
Cool, I don't recommend
being a manager then.

220
00:11:37.724 --> 00:11:40.400
Like I said,
this is practical engineering management.

221
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.750
This is just the truth of the situations.

222
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.620
&gt;&gt; Some companies have a team lead
rather than engineering manager.

223
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.000
So that could be a potential as well.

224
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we have a section on I
have a section on building up skills and

225
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.475
some of that is team lead role.

226
00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:59.778
You can get the engineering manager
experience at least some of it

227
00:11:59.778 --> 00:12:02.550
without having to make
the full title switch.

228
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:07.238
The main differences people side and
not a little bit.

229
00:12:07.238 --> 00:12:11.593
But yeah, I just wanna emphasize that you
are not obligated to move up to engineer

230
00:12:11.593 --> 00:12:13.336
management is not a promotion.

231
00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:17.540
It's not something you have to do.

232
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.860
So if you're not comfortable doing it,
that's totally fine.
