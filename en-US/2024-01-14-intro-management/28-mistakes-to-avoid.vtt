1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.120
And as we close out, I wanna be honest and
transparent with you on mistakes to avoid.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.157
Don't be like me, I've probably
made some of these mistakes, and

3
00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.450
sometimes multiple times.

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.660
Mistakes to avoid.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.811
Micromanaging, we talked about why that's
one of the worst things to do, but it's

6
00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:20.863
one of the easiest traps to fall into,
cuz you feel like you're doing something.

7
00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:24.308
But really, you don't trust your team,
you're not delegating effectively, and

8
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:25.680
it's not a good use of your time.

9
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.514
I've definitely done this,
and I've tried to step back.

10
00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:34.374
I've gotten feedback before on how I show
up, I'm not telling people what to do, but

11
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:39.189
some feedback I got early in this year,
we do 360 feedback once a year at Netflix.

12
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:43.048
Some people are familiar with that
process, but just it's time for

13
00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:47.107
all the company to give feedback to
each other, which I enjoy now more,

14
00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:48.200
I didn't used to.

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.406
But feedback I've gotten was,
Jim, you're too technical,

16
00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.959
you're too in the weeds
on technical decisions.

17
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:57.315
And I was like, and I got that from a few
people, and I was like, I thought I was

18
00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:00.621
being a good engineering manager, but
it turns out I was slowing the team down.

19
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:04.331
I was slowing people down by
going in the wrong direction, or

20
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:08.059
just getting hung up on the nuances
that I didn't even know.

21
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:09.569
And that's a form of micromanagement too.

22
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.649
So I've had to step back and
ask broader questions.

23
00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.448
What are the pros and cons?

24
00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:17.055
What are the alternatives?

25
00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:21.859
Those sort of questions,
rather than being in the weeds.

26
00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.263
Overpromising, a mistake I made early on,
too.

27
00:01:25.263 --> 00:01:27.024
Everybody's like, Jim,
can your team do that?

28
00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:29.299
Yeah, totally, no problem.

29
00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:29.902
Jim, can your team do that?

30
00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:30.548
Yeah, totally.

31
00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:34.600
Cuz you wanna show up well and
impress your partners.

32
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.703
But it turns out taking on all these other
requests were slowing down the things that

33
00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:41.090
were in flight for my team, and
I was just slowing them down by promising.

34
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.910
So the better solution is, you don't have
to say no immediately, but saying, okay,

35
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.068
let me bring that to the team and I'll
come back to you on where we can fit this

36
00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:54.173
in, rather than just trying to
please people right off the bat.

37
00:01:54.173 --> 00:01:56.966
Trying to stay too close to the code.

38
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.580
I still see this, I see it a lot.

39
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.953
Managers in pull requests,
commenting on individual lines of code.

40
00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:07.923
Again, depending on your role, the size of
the team where you need to be, maybe, but

41
00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:12.270
generally, if you're at that level, you're
probably too close to what's happening.

42
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.088
You probably don't need to be that close,
or you need to hire and build people up.

43
00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:17.375
Who can do that for you?

44
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.568
Hire a senior engineer who can do that for
you.

45
00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:20.706
That's not the best use of your time.

46
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:26.585
Overthinking decisions and
second-guessing, this is me, 100%.

47
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.613
Second-guessed everything I did.

48
00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:30.870
Is this the right format for
a team meeting?

49
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.940
Is this a good off-site?

50
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.340
I put so much pressure on myself and
I just stress myself to a bad place.

51
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.564
And really, it's just make a decision,
make sure it's well reasoned,

52
00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:43.020
make sure you get a lot of feedback on it,
but just do it.

53
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.630
And understand, you're gonna screw it up,
don't be too hard on yourself.

54
00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:53.907
And not letting go, especially if
you're taking on a team that you wrote

55
00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:58.190
the service or the code and
you're super familiar with the code base.

56
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.941
Trying to shepherd it and trying to baby
it still, cuz you're like, you wrote it,

57
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:03.718
it's my thing, you gotta let that go.

58
00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:07.450
You won't be effective as a leader
if you're too close in the code.

59
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.727
And this is really hard to do,
especially as a software engineer, or

60
00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:14.255
former recovering software engineer.

61
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.624
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And finally,

62
00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:19.302
putting too much pressure on yourself.

63
00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.566
You're like, people are looking at me now.

64
00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:26.050
I don't know if you remember the dark days
of puberty, where you're a teenager and

65
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.072
you feel like everybody's
looking at you all the time.

66
00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:32.312
And it turns out nobody cares about you,
everybody cares about themselves, and

67
00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.517
that's just how humans are.

68
00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:37.658
When you become an engineering manager,
you're like, everybody's looking at me,

69
00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:39.834
everybody's expecting
these things from me.

70
00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:42.735
When really it's not as bad as you think.

71
00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:44.955
But when you first take it on,
you're like, I gotta do this,

72
00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:46.130
the team should be performing.

73
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.829
I gotta have answers to all
these solutions or problems, and

74
00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.470
you really don't.

75
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.199
Take your time, be curious,
be empathetic, and listen,

76
00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.762
but don't put too much pressure on
yourself, that will come over time.

77
00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:02.050
The pressure will come, so
don't do it to yourself.
