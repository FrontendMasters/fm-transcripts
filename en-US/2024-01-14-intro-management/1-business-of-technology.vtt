1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.750
Let's talk about the business technology.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.826
So quick question, anybody in
the audience, what does your company do?

3
00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.570
&gt;&gt; We sell hotels, cars,
lights and experiences,

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.870
like tours and activities and stuff.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, and how do you make money?

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.340
&gt;&gt; We sell it for more than we buy it for.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.480
&gt;&gt; Spoken like an engineering manager,
yeah.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.720
Any software engineers out there?

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.544
What does your company do?

10
00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:31.710
&gt;&gt; Third party logistics.

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.297
&gt;&gt; How do you make money?

12
00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:37.052
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we hook up people who need
to ship goods with people who can do

13
00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:40.735
the shipping and then we cut
a little gravy on that transaction.

14
00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:43.525
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gravy.

15
00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:45.030
Let's start using that,
a little bit of gravy.

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.530
I like that.

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.220
But the truth is a lot
of software engineers,

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.193
and when I say a lot, I mean mostly me.

19
00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:55.929
I had no idea how the company made money,
I didn't care.

20
00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.029
It was all about the code, the code and
perfection and arguing on the Internet

21
00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:05.080
over frameworks and IDEs and all these
things, that was important, right?

22
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.432
Getting PRs done, closing bugs, seeing
how many tickets I can close in a month,

23
00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:13.140
shipping, shipping products,
that was the important part.

24
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.160
And that's how I thought about things for
a very, very long time.

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.790
I code, something happens in the middle,
it doesn't really matter to me.

26
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.443
They make money, they pay me more
next year cuz I did a great job and

27
00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:28.020
the stock goes up, and so on and so forth.

28
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.050
And that's how a lot of software
engineers view the world.

29
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.844
They never think, well,

30
00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:37.334
what happens in that part two,
the biggest part of the equation?

31
00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.650
I was very myopic, I thought everything
was about the code, that's it.

32
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.480
Nothing else.

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.457
That's the most important thing.

34
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:48.560
And it is, like I said, if you're early
in your career, focus on the code.

35
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.530
It is about the code.

36
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.460
It's about your skills and
building that up.

37
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.054
But as you grow and grow and grow, and

38
00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:56.812
it doesn't matter which career ladder you
go on, people in management or technical,

39
00:01:56.812 --> 00:02:01.340
you will have to understand that software
engineering and technology is a business.

40
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.244
And that has such big
impacts on your life and

41
00:02:03.244 --> 00:02:05.290
you probably haven't
even thought about it.

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.410
At least I hadn't for a long time.

43
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.260
So let's talk about products, any
products, probably some sort of software.

44
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.920
What does it take to deliver a product?

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.690
Well, you need someone to sell it to,
right?

46
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.512
We can all come together right now and

47
00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:24.529
say we're gonna build
the Frontend Masters AI app.

48
00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.524
And it's supercharged and it's awesome.

49
00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.856
Who cares?

50
00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:33.164
Who's gonna buy it?

51
00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:34.382
Who are we gonna sell it to?

52
00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:35.104
How are we gonna sell it?

53
00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:37.250
How do we know who to sell it to?

54
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.439
Where's the money coming to pay
us to actually build this app?

55
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.050
When it breaks, who are you gonna call?

56
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.540
Are you gonna be customer support?

57
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.100
We gonna hire more people if we're gonna
build this really awesome application.

58
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.860
We need computers and technology and
networking and VPNs and firewalls.

59
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.410
We need documentation, we need people
to translate into other languages.

60
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.124
We need lawyers to make sure our product
is legally defensible and we own it.

61
00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:03.850
But what else?

62
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.929
I'm probably missing some, what else
does it take to deliver products?

63
00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.702
&gt;&gt; It's a pretty good list, yeah, I think.

64
00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:12.130
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a first.

65
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.020
The point here, there's a lot of
people that it takes to SIP technology

66
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.546
SIP software that you probably never met,
probably never will meet, and

67
00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:27.660
me when I was a software engineer
I never thought of these people.

68
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.611
I was like marketing [SOUND]
they didn't do anything.

69
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.590
What do they do?

70
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.360
They make a good copy and
they make ads, like what?

71
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.050
Code, code, it's all about the code.

72
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.570
Lawyers, think,
what do I need lawyers for?

73
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300
Look at this code, it's beautiful.

74
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.420
I don't need a legal team or contracts.

75
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.350
And that's fine.

76
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.830
If that's your view of the world,
that's cool.

77
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.089
But the truth is, there's a lot of
people in between that code and

78
00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.709
then the money part that's
paying you your salary.

79
00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.463
It is good to think about
it from time to time,

80
00:03:59.463 --> 00:04:01.509
about the whole business
of software engineering.

81
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.165
But even when it comes to,
let's say, building a product, yeah,

82
00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:08.850
you're writing code.

83
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.240
As a front engineer, I was writing code.

84
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.560
But who are all the other people
involved in building a product?

85
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.110
Well, yeah, you need the UI.

86
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.125
People gotta interact with something,
okay, unless you're selling command-line

87
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.219
products, which you can
argue is UI as well.

88
00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.790
You need designers.

89
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.510
There are some people
who are good at design.

90
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.000
I'm not, so I definitely need designers.

91
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.650
You need backend engineers doing the APIs.

92
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.983
You need QA engineers to make
sure your code didn't break.

93
00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:36.580
Of course not, and
you write excellent code.

94
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.670
Yeah, of course.

95
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.110
But just in case,
you need at least one QA engineer.

96
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.503
You need infrastructure engineers
to power all the servers.

97
00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:45.246
You need someone to run the database.

98
00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:49.119
Fun, fun facts, 90% of the code
you write is just reading and

99
00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.320
writing from database
at the end of the day.

100
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.440
That's just the truth of it.

101
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.287
So you need a database engineer.

102
00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:57.980
You need technical program managers.

103
00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.700
If you're building a really big project,

104
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.880
you gotta have someone
herding all these cats.

105
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.907
Are you gonna do it as
a software engineer?

106
00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:06.851
Probably not, you probably don't want to.

107
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:08.840
You need SREs.

108
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.670
Make sure your app stays up.

109
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.790
Make sure your website stays up.

110
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.683
The people that are on call 24/7 365.

111
00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:16.075
You probably haven't thought about,
but there are,

112
00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:19.819
if you're building a big enough product,
there's a whole team of people making sure

113
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.220
that the code you push doesn't take
down the entire website or application.

114
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.123
You need product managers.

115
00:05:26.123 --> 00:05:28.562
Underappreciated role in technology.

116
00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:32.060
You're building code or you're building
software, who told you what to build?

117
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.160
Maybe you came up with it.

118
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.250
How do you know it's the right products?

119
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.370
How do you know who your customers are?

120
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.790
How do you know what all
the features you should build?

121
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.682
What's important, what's not?

122
00:05:41.682 --> 00:05:43.493
You need product managers.

123
00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:46.121
If you're a really big company,
you need prototypers,

124
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:48.980
you gotta be able to iterate
through designs really quickly.

125
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.790
Of course, you need engineering leaders.

126
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.649
For those of you who have been in college
for CS, or have taken any sort of course,

127
00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.240
a group project on software engineering,
what was your experience there?

128
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.981
Say you had five software engineers
in a room trying to build something,

129
00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:06.851
what happened?

130
00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:13.826
&gt;&gt; Product look really bad.

131
00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:15.488
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

132
00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:20.470
&gt;&gt; The product look really bad, yeah.

133
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.218
&gt;&gt; Oftentimes, I've found in group
projects like that folks go off on their

134
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.850
own to do something really cool.

135
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.956
But also not really aligned with
what everyone else was doing,

136
00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:34.765
and that can make bringing it
back together challenging.

137
00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:35.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

138
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:47.394
&gt;&gt; Aman Dimitri, he said, I've seen
many startups fail because the idea

139
00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:53.320
was really good, the product was fine,
but there was no one to buy it.

140
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good observation.

141
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.863
Silicon Valley is littered with
examples of really good engineering,

142
00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:01.864
it's beautiful.

143
00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:05.688
The code is extensible and accessible.

144
00:07:05.688 --> 00:07:09.336
But they ran out of money because they
they couldn't actually agree on like what

145
00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.688
the final version look like
where they shipped it.

146
00:07:11.688 --> 00:07:14.815
And they didn't hire any any
business development people,

147
00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:17.214
any salespeople to
actually sell to anybody.

148
00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:23.226
It doesn't matter how elegant your
backend is if nobody's around to see it.

149
00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:28.971
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I built an entire rental listing
engine, search engine, and all this and

150
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:33.977
then when it came down to selling it
I had to sell to property managers.

151
00:07:33.977 --> 00:07:39.001
And property managers were not the type
of people that I liked to deal with,

152
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:42.773
they only cared about cost-cutting and
saving money.

153
00:07:42.773 --> 00:07:46.884
And so it was like,
I didn't actually like the customer.

154
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:48.936
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

155
00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:50.967
&gt;&gt; So the person I was selling to it

156
00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:52.460
turned out mattered.

157
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.767
So, yeah, my future businesses from there,
that was the first thing and it was like,

158
00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.350
who do I actually sell to?

159
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.380
And do I like them?

160
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.350
So in this case,
I love working with developers.

161
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.705
It's great, but yeah,
learned that mistake.

162
00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a good insight.

163
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.520
And then one that's hard fought.

164
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.520
You had to go through a lot to figure out,
I don't actually like selling to people.

165
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.380
I don't like talking to people
half the time, not me personally.

166
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.820
I love talking to people, but
there's a lot that goes into products.

167
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.550
And there's a lot of other engineers
around you that a lot of times people

168
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.460
hadn't thought of and considered.

169
00:08:28.622 --> 00:08:31.773
Yeah, I know maybe one person,
maybe another team, but

170
00:08:31.773 --> 00:08:34.690
there's a whole bunch of other teams.

171
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.549
My favourite example is Windows, the piece
of software, maybe the most widely

172
00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.548
used piece of software in the world and
one the most people lined.

173
00:08:43.548 --> 00:08:48.319
But think how complex building something
like that is, how many thousands and

174
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:52.726
thousands and thousands of people it
took to ship Windows, or android or

175
00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:57.590
any major piece of technology that we use,
thousands of people went into that.

176
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.731
And it's something, especially in my
early days of software engineering,

177
00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:01.950
I just didn't even think of.

178
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.700
I didn't even consider
anybody else around me.

179
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.600
But there's a lot that
goes into our products.

180
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.460
So, you need engineering leaders.

181
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.971
You need someone to corral the people
together, say like what are we doing?

182
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.700
Who's getting lunch today?

183
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.150
How are you getting paid?

184
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.480
Are you taken care of?

185
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.610
Do you have the right software?

186
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.700
Do you have the right laptop?

187
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.630
So many things that go
into software engineering.

188
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.326
I think the managers and leaders are
probably easily forgotten because we're

189
00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:32.399
not directly writing
code most of the time.

190
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.240
And it's easy to take it for granted.

191
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.080
And it's something I do.

192
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.960
I'm like, yeah, of course,
my manager just exists.

193
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.104
Kind of like my kids just assume that
there's food in the refrigerator

194
00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:41.754
all the time.

195
00:09:41.754 --> 00:09:43.290
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It just magically appears.

196
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.224
They don't even consider, I had to work
for it, go to the store, make sure it's

197
00:09:46.224 --> 00:09:49.060
the right food and all these other
things go into it, it just appears.

198
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.100
And that's the perspective of
a lot of software engineers.

199
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.640
Yeah, managers are just there.

200
00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.420
You always have one, always will, great,
but there's a lot more to it than that
