1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.119
Now let's drop some hard truths
about engineering management.

2
00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:08.213
These are, I guess, common myths, and

3
00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:11.733
we covered some of that in motivations
on what people are driven by.

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.099
But I wanna tell you the really honest
truth about engineering management.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.870
The truth about engineering management
is you will become less technical.

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.801
`so I keep talking about it, but
it's really important as you make this

7
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.348
transition from software engineer
to engineering management,

8
00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:30.650
you become less well-versed
in the goings-ons of things.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.605
You probably don't get into technology
debates anymore because you're further

10
00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.301
away from it.

11
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.078
And it's something you have to accept.

12
00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:41.252
If you try to hold on closely to the code
and try to be as technical and try to be

13
00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:46.320
like, yeah, I'm familiar with this piece
of code, let me show you my perspective.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.866
Or let me try to slip in this PR real
quick cuz I think I know the fix,

15
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.611
it just becomes a worse and worse idea.

16
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.037
And the further on you go into engineering
management, the less technical you become

17
00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:02.230
in terms of the day to day, it's something
you have to accept, it's hard to do.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.658
It was hard for me to do because I built
my entire persona as being a software

19
00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:08.590
engineer, a really good software engineer.

20
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.320
And now all of a sudden,
I'm not, but I am.

21
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.310
I'm still involved, I'm not technical,
I don't know the nuances.

22
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.769
I couldn't tell you the difference
between React 16 and

23
00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:23.299
React 18, which, you're like, Jim,
you write front-end software?

24
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.442
You did front-end and you don't know that?

25
00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:26.340
I'm like, no, I don't.

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.355
I could find out, but mostly I'm
gonna lean on my team to do that,

27
00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.180
I know how to ask the right questions.

28
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.626
But in general, I'd say you
become less technical over time.

29
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:43.260
Another truth is micromanaging is easy,
trust is hard.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.990
If you run a micromanager, Is it fun?

31
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.190
No, it's not fun.

32
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.900
But I'd say micromanagement is the biggest
anti-pattern of being a manager.

33
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.010
Because as a manager,
as we've talked about,

34
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.210
you don't feel like you're doing anything.

35
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.212
It takes a long time to actually see like,
I am doing something,

36
00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:08.873
I'm impacting in this way.

37
00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:13.076
So being a micromanager gives that
feeling of you doing something.

38
00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:17.611
Like I'm doing something, I told you
to close that book, and I told you how

39
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:21.961
to write that code, and If I told you hey,
you should upgrade this library.

40
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:25.633
And become a real micromanager cuz
you wanna hold on to things and

41
00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:28.150
make it feel like you're doing something.

42
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.934
But the reality is micromanagement
is where a lot of people start,

43
00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.454
it's where a lot of people never
get out of, they never let go.

44
00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:38.397
And you're just not effective
being a micromanager.

45
00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:42.384
Cuz if you're focused on the day-to-day,
who's focusing on the week-to-week,

46
00:02:42.384 --> 00:02:44.633
the quarter-to-quarter, that's your job.

47
00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:47.591
But if you're down there in
the weeds with your team,

48
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:51.760
trying to point out things, one,
you don't trust them, it's obvious.

49
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.577
Micromanagement means you don't
trust the people you have,

50
00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:59.070
which maybe that's accurate, maybe they
actually need some performance coaching.

51
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.685
But that's a conversation you should have,
but

52
00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:05.660
a lot of people avoid that by
micromanaging, by doing things for people.

53
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.760
Trusting is hard, but
you have to trust your team.

54
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.055
You have to trust the team
that they're smarter than you,

55
00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:16.889
they're better at coding than you are,
they're more technical,

56
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.140
they know more of the nuances of
the day-to-day, but it's so hard to do.

57
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.920
It's really hard to do, and
I cannot stress how difficult

58
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.677
it is to just step back and let things
happen and not try to interject yourself.

59
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.342
Another truth about
engineering management,

60
00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:38.400
no one tells you how to spend your time,
This is a hard one.

61
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.038
It's a hard one for me even today,

62
00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.160
trying to figure out where
I should spend my time.

63
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.256
I'd say definitely in the first
year one of the biggest,

64
00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:49.750
hardest things to deal with was
what should I be doing right now?

65
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.850
There's a lot of things you can
be doing at any given time.

66
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.300
I could be project planning.

67
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.650
I could be looking at, hey,
what's our plan for next year?

68
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.460
I chould be looking at growth plans for
everybody on the team.

69
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.370
I could be building rapport with my
partners, looking at their roadmaps.

70
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.860
I can be talking to my manager,
figuring out hey, is our priorities right?

71
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.950
I could be thinking about parties,
thinking about swag for the team.

72
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.710
Thinking about team meetings,
how they're run, are they effective?

73
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.054
Thinking about icebreakers,

74
00:04:17.054 --> 00:04:19.520
we talked earlier about
finding the right icebreaker.

75
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.530
Thinking about team dynamics.

76
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.618
I won't go into all the things I
could be doing, but there are dozens,

77
00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:29.239
maybe hundreds of things I could
be doing at any given moment.

78
00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:34.294
And no one's gonna tell you if this is the
right thing to focus on in the moment or

79
00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:37.826
not, and
it's something I struggle with sometimes.

80
00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:40.849
And this is hard, this is really hard,
it doesn't sound like it.

81
00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.054
But at the end of the day,
what most people want in life is for

82
00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:46.040
someone to tell them what to do.

83
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.792
They do it, they check it off, and
they move on to something else,

84
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:51.170
cuz it's satisfying, it's easy.

85
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.680
But that check box doesn't exist
as an engineering manager.

86
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.097
There's no you should do this, do this, do
this, do this, and then your team is good,

87
00:04:59.097 --> 00:05:02.240
because every team is
going to be different.

88
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.020
Maybe they're executing well.

89
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.650
Maybe their social dynamics
need a lot of work.

90
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.300
They're all really smart people,
but they don't talk to each other.

91
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.519
That's something no one else can
tell you other than you, and

92
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.490
no one will tell you here's
the right thing to do that.

93
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.581
So this is the truth of
engineering management,

94
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:17.970
is no one's gonna tell you that.

95
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.591
Cuz you're the only person in the entire
world that cares about your team.

96
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.186
And that's not saying your manager
doesn't care about the team, etc., and

97
00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:27.379
they don't care about each other.

98
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.199
But your job literally is to care for your
team and to pay attention to them, and

99
00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.797
no one else does that better
than you cuz that's your job.

100
00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:38.281
So what does it take to manage
your team and take care of them,

101
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:39.851
make sure they're all functioning?

102
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:44.925
I don't know, you have to figure that out,
and that's really hard.

103
00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:46.823
And that's that's the truth
of engineering management.

104
00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:52.690
And no one will tell you what to do.

105
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.610
Like I said,
there's a lot of things you could do.

106
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.622
And I can I can go to my manager and
say like, I have all these problems,

107
00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:00.809
these people are arguing.

108
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.120
And they might be able to
provide some insight, but

109
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.790
they're not gonna tell me what to do,
and that's a pro and a con.

110
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.110
They don't tell me what to do,
nobody tells you how to spend your time.

111
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.620
And they seem like similar things,
but they are different.

112
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.443
Cuz there's a lot of things to do, there's
a lot of things to spend your time on.

113
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.684
And your allocation of time varies,

114
00:06:18.684 --> 00:06:22.605
there are hard things you're
always going to spend time doing.

115
00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:25.150
One-on-ones, how much time
should you spend on that?

116
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.340
I don't know, depends on your team.

117
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.160
How much time should you
spend project planning?

118
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.240
I don't know, depends on your team.

119
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.237
What should you be doing next?

120
00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:41.227
So for me personally,
I'm thinking about next year's planning,

121
00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:43.470
how much time should I invest in that?

122
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:48.830
No one has that answer other than me.

123
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.600
So it's really why I spend so much time on
the truth of engineering management and

124
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.373
motivations, is you have to
really believe in yourself and

125
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.730
you can't second guess yourself.

126
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.946
Otherwise you will get nowhere, and you're
gonna spin out and you'll get nowhere.

127
00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:05.341
And this is really challenging,
there is no checkbox of what to do.

128
00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:12.020
And all that leads into
leadership is lonely.

129
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.369
You've all heard the phrase heavy
is the head that wears the crown,

130
00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:16.790
familiar with that phrase?

131
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.710
Being in charge is a responsibility.

132
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.241
I've heard it referred to as
the lodestone of leadership,

133
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:28.350
you carry around this weight on your neck,
it's true, it's true.

134
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.450
I'm always thinking of, how's my team
doing, are they functioning well?

135
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.564
Is there anything I can be doing better
to help them overcome some hurdles,

136
00:07:36.564 --> 00:07:37.230
some gaps?

137
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.286
And doing all that is so lonely,
cuz no one else knows other than me.

138
00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:44.150
And I really can't emphasize
how lonely leadership is.

139
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.704
And the higher up you go, the more
it becomes, the lonelier it becomes,

140
00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:50.790
and that's the truth.

141
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.622
So I'm not saying give your manager a hug,

142
00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:57.490
but maybe give them a hug,
empathize with them.

143
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:02.803
I think knowing this has made me
a better manager to my director.

144
00:08:02.803 --> 00:08:05.587
So I'm like, hey, how are you doing today?

145
00:08:05.587 --> 00:08:07.113
Blah, blah, blah,
there's this blah, blah, blah.

146
00:08:07.113 --> 00:08:10.299
I'm like, yeah, but how are you doing?

147
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.765
That means a lot to managers,
cuz no one asks that.

148
00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:18.022
Your team is, again I'll use the parent
analogy, my kids are never like,

149
00:08:18.022 --> 00:08:19.930
how are you doing today, Jim?

150
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.167
I've got a three-year-old and
one-year-old,

151
00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:24.080
they don't care how I'm doing.

152
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.967
They care about is their stuff ready,
is there food, can they watch TV,

153
00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:30.410
are their toys in the right place?

154
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.364
But they don't care about me personally,
and I don't take that personally either,

155
00:08:33.364 --> 00:08:35.070
it's just human nature.

156
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.610
But that's kind of how a lot of software
engineers treat their manager too.

157
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.917
It's like they don't care about them as a
person, they're just a thing, a role, and

158
00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:44.150
that's lonely.

159
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.941
It's a lonely job, but that's part of it,
you just have to accept that.

160
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:51.763
How to make this better is
you have peer managers, and

161
00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:54.914
you talk to them cuz they're
going through the same thing.

162
00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:59.688
And while you may not know the nuances
of their team, cuz every personalities

163
00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:04.405
are different, you can at least like,
yeah, yeah, I know, man, I know.

164
00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:07.253
A lot of what we do in one-on-ones
with other managers is just complain.

165
00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:11.268
[LAUGH] I mean it, cuz there's no one to
complain to about some of these problems,

166
00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:13.167
you don't wanna do it with your team.

167
00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:16.705
But just like you complain as software
engineers, managers complain,

168
00:09:16.705 --> 00:09:18.972
directors complain, everybody complaint.

169
00:09:18.972 --> 00:09:22.040
My personal philosophy is I believe
in the power of venting and

170
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.420
just getting it all out, and
then I feel better about it.

171
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.510
Everybody has their own
way of dealing with it.

172
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.190
But that's a lot of what
managers do in one-on-ones.

173
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.210
It's just like, man,
they changed the scope,

174
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.684
did you hear about this new
thing you're dealing with.

175
00:09:36.684 --> 00:09:39.592
And I won't go into all
the various specifics.

176
00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:41.930
But yeah, it's a lonely job.

177
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.520
Question.

178
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.630
&gt;&gt; Chad says they have a hybrid
engineering management and technical role.

179
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.474
And he's a little scared to
move fully into management and

180
00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:59.040
lose the technical skill that he's
built over the last eight years.

181
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that's just the truth of it, though.

182
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.092
There's an old question I didn't
call out specifically but

183
00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:12.951
I definitely talk about it,
is should managers code?

184
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:17.990
And this is more of a contentious debate,
but I say no.

185
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.449
If I'm coding, I'm not focused on
the people in the bigger picture,

186
00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:24.820
I'm more focused on the nuances and
the specifics.

187
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.040
And some people do code as a manager.

188
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.066
A lot of roles you are expected
to code and that's fine,

189
00:10:31.066 --> 00:10:33.130
I just don't recommend it.

190
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.280
I think there's better ways to spend
your time that are more effective.

191
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.458
But every company is different, especially
at a smaller company where you're expected

192
00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:45.890
to do a lot more and wear a lot more hats
you're probably coding a little bit.

193
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.669
At a bigger company where I
have dozens of customers,

194
00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:53.960
I think my team supports 24, 25 teams,
and I have 5, 6 partners who I work with.

195
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.164
If I'm coding, I can't possibly know
all these other things going on.

196
00:10:58.164 --> 00:11:02.718
So yeah, you will become less technical,
you should if you're doing things right,

197
00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:05.258
and that's just something
you have to accept.

198
00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:09.384
And that to me was hard, as my identity
of software engineer was writing code.

199
00:11:09.384 --> 00:11:14.086
And you just have to let that go, and
that's a hard lesson I had to learn.

200
00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:18.090
&gt;&gt; Jim, one thing I was thinking about
too is that you can always go back to,

201
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.178
we've definitely seen people
move into management and

202
00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:23.100
then go back to being an engineer.

203
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.860
So it's not like it's completely lost,
it is something possible.

204
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.180
And you've also built up some unique
skill sets as being a manager and it can,

205
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.241
to earlier points you've
made in your presentation,

206
00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:37.980
is that you can actually be even
a stronger engineer because of it.

207
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.913
So someone wanting to give up the
technical skills, it's not fully given up,

208
00:11:41.913 --> 00:11:44.260
you're still able to go back.

209
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point, Ryan.

210
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.460
Yeah, you can always go back,
the longer you go, though,

211
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.710
the harder it is to go back.

212
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.643
It is like riding a bike though,
you'll pick it up,

213
00:11:53.643 --> 00:11:56.020
but it's not gonna be as
natural as it is today.

214
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.717
And that said, there are people, rare
people in the world, exceptional people,

215
00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:04.270
who are good at people leadership and
technical side.

216
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.253
I think one example that comes
to mind is Sarah Drasner.

217
00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:11.021
I don't know if you all are familiar
with Sarah, exceptional human being, but

218
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.807
she's very good at coding and
very good at people leadership.

219
00:12:14.807 --> 00:12:17.767
But most people do not
have that capability, so

220
00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:21.104
it's something you just have
to accept a little bit.

221
00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:24.440
But you can go back, it's just it's
gonna be harder and harder over time.

222
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.350
&gt;&gt; No, just who is that,
that sounds very familiar.

223
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.826
&gt;&gt; Sarah Drasner, I believe she's a-
&gt;&gt; Director of engineering at Google,

224
00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:35.880
she's in charge of Angular, and
something else now too I think.

225
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Angular View.

226
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.860
&gt;&gt; Just transition into like web and
Android-

227
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

228
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:48.504
&gt;&gt; She was a teacher on Front-End Masters
teaching about SVG and all sorts of stuff.

229
00:12:48.504 --> 00:12:50.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
[INAUDIBLE]

230
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.552
&gt;&gt; She's someone I learned from just

231
00:12:52.552 --> 00:12:53.410
in passing.

232
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.837
Whenever I talked to her, I learned
something new about people leadership,

233
00:12:56.837 --> 00:12:58.060
which says a lot about her.

234
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.635
But generally, it's really hard to balance
these very different parts of your brain

235
00:13:02.635 --> 00:13:05.758
that takes dealing with people and
tactical leadership.
