00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.140
Talk about these these critical skills
you need to build up over time.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.322
Basically, I'm gonna bucket them
into four categories, communication,

3
00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.430
which I'm doing right now,
written and verbal.

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.970
The people side, that's a big one.

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.672
The business side, the part you probably
don't see a whole lot as software

6
00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.040
engineer, but
you definitely do as a manager.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.164
Then the technical side,
we are engineering managers.

8
00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:24.390
There's a technical piece.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.470
A critical skill,
you have to be able to communicate.

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.110
Someone asked earlier about remote
versus in-person versus hybrid.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.290
My team's hybrid.

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.838
I go in the office about twice a week or
so, and half of my team is in the office.

13
00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:43.459
The other half of my
team is entirely remote.

14
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.260
That has its own challenges.

15
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.090
If your team's all in the office,
that has its own challenges too.

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.601
If your team's entirely remote,

17
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.320
totally different set of
challenges in how you show up.

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.933
But the common thread amongst all these
things, it doesn't matter where you are in

19
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.348
the world and how your team operates,
you have to be good at communication.

20
00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:01.630
If it's in-person, you use probably
a lot more verbal communication.

21
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.062
But what if all of your
team's in-person but

22
00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:07.950
all your partners are remote,
how do you communicate then?

23
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.370
Probably more verbal or probably
more written, but verbal in person.

24
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.279
And I've done all these different
scenarios cuz there's so

25
00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.104
many different things you can plug and

26
00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.920
play and there's no one way to approach
it, but it doesn't matter what it is.

27
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.308
You have to be good at communication.

28
00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:28.903
I won't knock anybody, but
I'm flabbergasted sometimes,

29
00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:32.992
the level of executives and then C-levels,

30
00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:37.953
the CTO and CEO, etc.,
who are poor communicators.

31
00:01:37.953 --> 00:01:39.422
I'm like, how did you get here?

32
00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:43.012
People that can't get up
in front of an audience and

33
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:47.699
explain things very simply or
without passion, it's shocking.

34
00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:50.270
It's a skill missing a lot of people.

35
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.860
But the truth is,
if you're gonna be a good leader,

36
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.010
you have to be good at communication.

37
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.820
I'll be honest, I'm good at verbal.

38
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.377
Hopefully, you all aren't bored yet,
and I'm doing a good job selling,

39
00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.340
doing well in the course.

40
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.530
Written, I'm terrible at it.

41
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.120
I won't say terrible, but
it's not my strong suit.

42
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.940
I tend to overthink what I write down,
versus if I talk,

43
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.830
I feel a lot more comfortable
just saying things off the cuff.

44
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.408
So when I write something down,

45
00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:22.480
it takes me much longer to
be how's this coming across?

46
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.250
Is this the right words?

47
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.017
Is this too complicated?

48
00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:24.875
Is this too short?

49
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.680
And I tend to overthink that a little bit.

50
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.968
It's something I do try to work on over
time, but written shows up in a lot of

51
00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:34.660
places that you probably don't expect,
your Slack messages.

52
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.786
If you're like, I don't know,
someone on my team is like, hey, hey, Jem,

53
00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:41.110
I'm gonna be late today.

54
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.100
I'm gonna miss the team meeting.

55
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.490
And I give them the thumbs up.

56
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.830
What does that mean?

57
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.720
Is that like a passive aggressive or
is that like cool, whatever?

58
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.850
There's a lot of ways
things can be interpreted.

59
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.530
And you have to think about that as
a manager is how you're coming across.

60
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.081
I tend to come in hot on things.

61
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.023
If someone's, I don't know, if someone's
asking my team to do something or

62
00:03:06.023 --> 00:03:08.964
not treating them with respect, I tend
to come in really hot, defend my team,

63
00:03:08.964 --> 00:03:10.410
but I need to back off from doing that.

64
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.917
And I need to take a step back and
see what I'm writing,

65
00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:15.682
how it can be interpreted.

66
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:20.578
And then when you send an email, you ever
think about the audience of an email?

67
00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:22.290
Now we're getting into it.

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.360
Most people don't know
what your team does.

69
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.330
Most people don't care
what your team does.

70
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.690
That's just the truth.

71
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.058
You have to send your emails
with that perspective of,

72
00:03:31.058 --> 00:03:33.370
they don't know anything about you.

73
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.470
What do they need to know?

74
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.533
It doesn't matter who's reading it.

75
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.268
And who's the audience?

76
00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:40.955
If it's a software engineer,
you can probably more tactical.

77
00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:44.190
If it's meant for directors, executives,

78
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.135
you got to be high level to explain
things like basic stuff to people.

79
00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:53.249
That all that comes across,
writing memos, project docs, a lot of

80
00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.884
the written communication, and there's
a lot of it more than you think of.

81
00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:00.923
And verbals, there's a lot of,
there's one on ones,

82
00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:05.334
there's meetings, there's video calls,
there's hallway conversations.

83
00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.740
There's presentations.

84
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.232
So all that says the most important
skill you work on is being an effective

85
00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:14.510
communicator, whatever the medium
you have to use at that time is.

86
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.000
And there's a lot of different channels
you have to use and become good at.

87
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:24.945
On the people side, you have to be good
at mediation, conflict resolution.

88
00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:26.894
You have to be good at growth.

89
00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:30.505
If you never grow your team,
you'll be working harder and harder and

90
00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:34.300
harder and harder and wondering,
why am I working so hard?

91
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.550
Why is my team picking up the slack?

92
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.630
Well, have you asked them
to pick up the slack?

93
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.500
Have you grown them?

94
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.440
Have you trained them?

95
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.450
Have you kind of scaled yourself?

96
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.939
You gotta be good at that,
mentoring, coaching.

97
00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.202
Is the team meshing or are they a bunch of
introverts who never talk to each other?

98
00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:58.274
Hiring, you gotta hire people.

99
00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:01.100
But you don't just go on the street and
hire the right person.

100
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.475
You have to be good at recruiting too.

101
00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:05.519
You have to be good at selling the role.

102
00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.336
There's a lot on the people side too,
a lot of skills you have to get good at.

103
00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:14.471
The business side,
these just some aspects, but

104
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:16.172
you have to be good at budgeting.

105
00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:19.930
There's not a giant pool of money
you just shovel and give to people.

106
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.050
It doesn't work that way.

107
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.210
There's a budget.

108
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.700
You decide what's the priority,
what's not.

109
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.483
Project management, you gotta know when to
step in and be like, I'm gonna lead this

110
00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:31.602
project, when to delegate that out,
what projects are important.

111
00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:35.563
The long-term strategy,
my favorite analogy for

112
00:05:35.563 --> 00:05:42.025
long-term strategy is you're walking down
the road, where are you gonna end up?

113
00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.361
You're gonna end up somewhere.

114
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:44.880
It doesn't matter if you have a plan or
not.

115
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.970
You're gonna end up somewhere.

116
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.880
There's nothing you can do about that,
but you can alter where you end up.

117
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.010
That's how I think about strategy and
vision.

118
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.540
It's like setting that for a team, yeah.

119
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.958
&gt;&gt; Like you said earlier,
you go where you point yourself and

120
00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.700
that applies similarly to business.

121
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.926
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right, and
someone has to do that, someone with the,

122
00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:04.690
what do you say about career ladders?

123
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.570
The perspective of doing that, and that's
hard to do as a software engineer often.

124
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.240
But you know how my strategy
is formed by my team?

125
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.670
I ask them, I talk to them,
and I share my perspective.

126
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.267
And then I aggregate all these
opinions together and say,

127
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:19.809
here's what I think we should do.

128
00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.730
What do you all think?

129
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.064
But someone has to do that.

130
00:06:23.064 --> 00:06:26.018
And that's part of the business and
it has to mesh with the business too.

131
00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:31.098
It's not just, I'm really into
WebSockets and WebAssembly.

132
00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:33.101
Let's figure out a way to do that.

133
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:33.847
I would love to do that.

134
00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:35.458
But that's for the business?

135
00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:36.810
Maybe, maybe not, I don't know.

136
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.623
Actually, I do know [LAUGH] but
that's something you have to figure out.

137
00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:46.579
You have the technical side.

138
00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:48.230
This one is really hard.

139
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.793
Quick show of hands, what percentage, or

140
00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:56.010
actually what percent of time do you spend
reading versus writing code, do you think?

141
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.500
&gt;&gt; Like 20%.

142
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.840
&gt;&gt; On the?

143
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.119
&gt;&gt; On reading versus writing.

144
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.933
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's a pretty high ratio,
actually.

145
00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:06.542
I'm surprised, pretty good.

146
00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:07.889
&gt;&gt; I've got a lot of pull requests.

147
00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:08.956
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's true.

148
00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:13.666
You do maintain a really
popular open source package.

149
00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.712
What percent of time do you spend
reading versus writing code?

150
00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:19.610
&gt;&gt; Outside of pull requests or?

151
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.975
&gt;&gt; In general.
&gt;&gt; In general.

152
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:29.669
Maybe 60% reading, 40% writing.

153
00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.867
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty about right.

154
00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:34.073
The truth is for most people,

155
00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:36.347
you spend more time reading
code than you do writing it.

156
00:07:36.347 --> 00:07:38.420
We don't focus on that,
though, as software engineers.

157
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.519
We focus on our own personal achievements.

158
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.470
But most systems you're
working on are not new.

159
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.650
You're not building things
from the ground up.

160
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.033
You're using other people's code.

161
00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:53.876
So take whatever percentage you
spend reading versus writing code.

162
00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:57.209
Now imagine that's 100% reading code.

163
00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:59.133
And then imagine you're not reading code,

164
00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:01.166
you're just reading
cliff notes of the code.

165
00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:03.482
And that's what you have to
do as an engineering manager.

166
00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.163
It's like you still have
to understand what's going

167
00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:06.910
on without actually writing code.

168
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.746
And that is an entirely different skill
of software engineering that you need

169
00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:11.461
to be good at.

170
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:13.837
You have to understand what
your team is talking about.

171
00:08:13.837 --> 00:08:16.900
You have to be able to make
technical decisions or

172
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.023
at least ask the right questions
without actually writing code.

173
00:08:21.023 --> 00:08:23.750
I don't know, it's like a video
game where you're like next level,

174
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.755
you're a code writer,
you're really good at it.

175
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.674
Next level,
you don't write any code at all, but

176
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.520
you've still gotta get to the end
of the level and that's how it is.

177
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.203
And you have to be able to explain
the nuances often to people

178
00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:39.570
either above you or
partners and things like that.

179
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.141
And again,
without writing the code yourself,

180
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.600
this is a difficult skill to pick up,
but you have to be good at it.

181
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.260
Yeah.

182
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.682
&gt;&gt; Is domain knowledge kinda one that
spans maybe all four of your points here

183
00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:57.674
of it's really important to understand
the goal, the business, and the domain so

184
00:08:57.674 --> 00:09:00.790
your team can execute that technically?

185
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

186
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.051
&gt;&gt; How that plays a role,
is that a big part of the business and

187
00:09:05.051 --> 00:09:07.320
the technical side?

188
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.958
&gt;&gt; I'd love that point, yeah, the domain.

189
00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.137
What does your company do?

190
00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:13.933
What's your role in that?

191
00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:15.385
We have an exercise on
that a little bit later.

192
00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:16.330
So I'm glad you brought it up.

193
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.420
But yeah, you got to understand,
what exactly do you do?

194
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.371
That's a question I never actually
thought to ask myself until really late

195
00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.500
in my career.

196
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.682
And that spans technical in business and

197
00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:33.090
it's applying the domain on the technical
side to achieve business outcomes.

198
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.467
That's if you wanted to sell it down,
great point.

199
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:37.522
Question.

200
00:09:37.522 --> 00:09:40.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a comment from chat.

201
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.315
When I read pull requests,

202
00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:44.330
it's more from the approach of
are my engineers catching things?

203
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.630
Are they writing comments?

204
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.000
Are they providing valuable feedback?

205
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.570
Is this PR process effective?

206
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.320
&gt;&gt; I like that.

207
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.425
That is what your your role ends up
bubbling up is looking at the proceeds of

208
00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.000
the team.

209
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.320
Like me, I don't read pull requests.

210
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.580
Why?

211
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.090
I'm not technical enough to contribute.

212
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.690
My team are all much better engineers.

213
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.375
I say it all the time, I'm the worst
software engineer on the team.

214
00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:13.953
So if you explain things to me,

215
00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:17.677
you explain it in the way that I just
don't know what I'm talking about.

216
00:10:17.677 --> 00:10:21.910
I do to some aspects, but
me being in a pull request is not helpful.

217
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.870
If I'm like, hey, there's a bug here,
why aren't there tests?

218
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.103
That's a sign that we
need better processes,

219
00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:34.210
not that I should be stepping in, cuz
that's just not efficient use of my time.

220
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.640
Yeah, question?

221
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.822
&gt;&gt; Yeah, question, if you're
an engineering manager who just joined

222
00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:43.518
a fully remote company,
what would you do to engage people?

223
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:48.210
Would you follow?

224
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.640
I don't know what, yeah,
what would you do to engage people?

225
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at one,
where's the code located?

226
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.892
Where are the code bases?

227
00:10:54.892 --> 00:10:56.322
Are there multiple repos?

228
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.612
Is it just one?

229
00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:02.528
Following along with pull requests is
good, good use of your time just to read.

230
00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.030
I don't mean interject into them.

231
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.705
Don't make comments.

232
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:09.511
Just okay,
generally here's how people are working.

233
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.760
Some people like really
large pull requests.

234
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.220
Some people like really
atomic pieces of work.

235
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.110
People work differently.

236
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:20.047
It's very surprising about software
engineering is how that shows up and

237
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.620
how they code.

238
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.792
The other one is and this is a secret,
ask everybody on the team the same

239
00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:28.851
questions in your one on
ones cuz they don't know.

240
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:33.095
You don't know what goes on other people's
one on ones, ask them same question.

241
00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:35.322
What's the vision for the team?

242
00:11:35.322 --> 00:11:37.090
What's our long-term strategy?

243
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.800
What are our priorities for
next year, next quarter?

244
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.341
Ask everybody that.

245
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:44.977
If they have different answers, that's
something you should solve pretty quickly,

246
00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:46.090
or at least figure it out.

247
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.390
If they'll have a good answer, step back.

248
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.990
You're lucky, they're flowing,
they're grooving, don't interfere.

249
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.206
But definitely,
getting involved in the technical side,

250
00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:57.450
just understanding the core technologies.

251
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.384
If there's, I don't know,
it's a new library,

252
00:12:00.384 --> 00:12:05.470
new framework, say you're using React and
they're all using Angular.

253
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.820
Maybe take a course in Angular, so you
at least know what you're talking about.

254
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.852
You can contribute some of
those technical decisions.

255
00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:18.693
So we talked to these skills
you have to build up.

256
00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:20.524
There's different ways of doing it, and

257
00:12:20.524 --> 00:12:24.136
being a manager means you're immediately
gonna have to build up your skills, but

258
00:12:24.136 --> 00:12:27.380
you can do it ahead of time and
make your life easier.

259
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.375
So one way of doing that,
talk to your manager about your goals.

260
00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:33.820
And this is true at any level of if
you're a software engineer or manager or

261
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.210
director, whatever.

262
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.520
Talk to your manager about what you want.

263
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.610
Again, it's like we're saying you're
gonna end up somewhere in a direction.

264
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.540
It's better to help tell people,
here's where I'm headed.

265
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.470
Can you help me along the way?

266
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.044
And your manager can help you find work,
ideally,

267
00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:52.760
that kind of builds up the skills and
builds up that work towards your goals.

268
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.410
Talk to other managers, learn from them.

269
00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.095
I learn from Ryan almost every time
he talks about people leadership,

270
00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:04.290
one of the best people
leaders that I've ever met.

271
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.060
I learn from him all the time.

272
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.375
But you got to talk to other managers cuz
they will have either similar experience

273
00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:14.372
or different, but there's something
there that you can just pick up, and

274
00:13:14.372 --> 00:13:17.670
maybe a mistake that
you don't need to make.

275
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.770
Then ask your manager or other
managers on how to move to management.

276
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.280
I did that.

277
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.080
I had a lot of one on ones with people,
with friends I've built up over the years.

278
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.854
Look, hey, how did you move to management?

279
00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:29.594
What are the things you wish you knew?

280
00:13:29.594 --> 00:13:34.101
And you will learn a lot there a lot
faster than trying to just blindly apply,

281
00:13:34.101 --> 00:13:35.870
throw your resume out there.

282
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.730
Books are useful again,
but pick the right ones.

283
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.270
I've read some bad management books or

284
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.283
ones I didn't agree with
my personal philosophy.

285
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:47.510
But I still learned something there,
just people approach problems differently.

286
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.470
This one's controversial.

287
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.700
Everybody's like, Jem,
you got to read The First 90 Days.

288
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.940
Have you read that, heard of that book?

289
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.862
I did not agree with that book.

290
00:13:55.862 --> 00:13:58.385
I don't like the style.

291
00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:00.785
To me, it's too focused on self and

292
00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:05.510
your own personal success rather
than building people up around you.

293
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.750
But that's just my opinion.

294
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.397
So even this course, you may not
agree with everything I'm saying.

295
00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:11.940
That's totally okay too.

296
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.090
But it's good to educate yourself.

297
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.720
Conferences are another good one.

298
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.520
You know that there's conferences for
managers.

299
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.310
Did you know that?

300
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.222
You probably didn't even think about that.

301
00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:22.633
What managers at conferences?

302
00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:23.480
There are.

303
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.979
Those are really helpful places to learn.

304
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.390
Observation is one of the most
powerful tools that you have.

305
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.951
How does your manager behave?

306
00:14:31.951 --> 00:14:33.302
How do they show up?

307
00:14:33.302 --> 00:14:36.470
The managers that you like,
you're always like, yeah, they're cool.

308
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.980
I like the way they show up in meetings,
even if they're not your own team.

309
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.490
What can you learn from them?

310
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.507
You just watch them and see.

311
00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:48.918
How do they deal with those kind of spicy
questions that people like to throw

312
00:14:48.918 --> 00:14:49.488
at them?

313
00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.060
How do they reflect on things?

314
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.130
You can learn a lot by just
watching how someone behaves.

315
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.410
Becoming a mentor or getting
a mentor is a great way of doing it.

316
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.033
Mentoring itself is a great way of
building up these management skills,

317
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:08.506
mentoring junior managers,
mentoring senior managers, or sorry,

318
00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:12.860
not managers, mentoring junior
engineers and senior engineers.

319
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.480
Different skills required,
different things they need.

320
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.082
You will build up a lot of people skills,

321
00:15:18.082 --> 00:15:20.830
learning how to mentor cuz you'll
hear the problems that they have.

322
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.676
And those problems you'll just
see repeated over and over again.

323
00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:28.180
And then the last one is
take on proximate roles.

324
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.650
Team lead is a good way to
start building up the skills.

325
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.567
Even becoming a staff engineer and

326
00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:37.610
thinking about more of the business
is a good way of building up skills.

327
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.234
There's a lot of roles that are,

328
00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:42.837
some aspects of engineering leadership
that you might be able to pick up.

329
00:15:46.174 --> 00:15:51.215
&gt;&gt; How do you ask for or how do you know
when to ask for mentorship yourself?

330
00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:55.320
Cuz you're saying asking managers for
tips but

331
00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.449
then that becomes its own skill,
right, how to especially

332
00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:06.003
dealing with managers that well,
micromanage, for example.

333
00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:10.027
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the reason I say mentor, and

334
00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:15.394
that's different from a manager, is
a mentor is someone who is not directly,

335
00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:20.210
hopefully, in your chain of management,
or even a partner.

336
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.415
You want them to be divorced
from your day-to-day problems.

337
00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:25.408
So you have to explain things
in a way that they don't,

338
00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:29.264
from the perspective of they don't
know what you're talking about.

339
00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:33.068
And they could take things objectively,
versus your manager is gonna be, or

340
00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:34.890
take things subjectively.

341
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.311
Your manager is gonna be very objective.

342
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:39.650
Hey, if you're like, hey,
I'm not happy with my manager,

343
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.330
[LAUGH] tell your manager that.

344
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.440
They're probably gonna
take some offense to that.

345
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.473
It's not helpful but if I want to, say,
mentor at a different company who doesn't

346
00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:51.600
know my manager at all and I can only
describe the ways they're behaving.

347
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.510
One, that forces me to communicate better,
and two,

348
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.131
there's someone who's invested in you and
not the business side.

349
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:02.608
And that's kind of the distinction between
a manager and a mentor in this scenario.

350
00:17:02.608 --> 00:17:07.406
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that being an engineering
manager is quite lonely compared to being

351
00:17:07.406 --> 00:17:09.920
an independent contributor.

352
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.714
Are there any communities or meetups or
Slack groups that you'd recommend?

353
00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:18.917
&gt;&gt; I don't know of any
Slack groups per se.

354
00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.715
Brian, you're nodding your head,
you know a few?

355
00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:22.961
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a couple of good ones.

356
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:24.752
There's engineering management.

357
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.610
I believe there's literally
that's what it's called.

358
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.412
But my favorite one is Rands Leadership.

359
00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:33.501
It's engineering leaders from Slack,
a couple other companies.

360
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.880
He runs a whole Slack group.

361
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.440
It's definitely one to check out.

362
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.920
I think that's a very useful tool.

363
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.880
&gt;&gt; Wasn't there a conference you spoke at,
Jem?

364
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, LeadDev is a great conference for
managers.

365
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.072
It's not just for managers, it's for
managers and team leads and

366
00:17:51.072 --> 00:17:56.670
people who exist in the staff-plus kind
of world, really helpful conference.

367
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.272
Totally different styles of leadership
you see represented there, and

368
00:18:00.272 --> 00:18:01.460
it pushes my thinking.

369
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.743
I'm like, I've been thinking about
how to solve this problem one way and

370
00:18:04.743 --> 00:18:06.920
here's a completely
different solution to it.

371
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.880
So there are a few.

372
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.536
There's not nearly as many as there
are for tech or specific tech,

373
00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:14.060
but they're out there.

374
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:19.146
&gt;&gt; That's managing conflict or
managing brilliant jerks.

375
00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:23.142
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

376
00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:24.880
&gt;&gt; I'll talk a little about it.

377
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.166
Ryan touches on this in
102 on managing conflicts.

378
00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:29.861
He has a few scenarios
he's gonna work there.

379
00:18:29.861 --> 00:18:33.190
And later today, we have an interview
question on that very same.

380
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.460
But the easiest way on brilliant jerks,
don't hire them.

381
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.340
I'm laughing, but it's true.

382
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.490
Just don't involve them.

383
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.989
It's not worth the output you may get
from them, from one person pulling

384
00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:51.560
down an entire team, an entire org,
being toxic to work with.

385
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.600
It's one of those, you just cut it off.

386
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.554
And so if they exist,
you have a conversation with them.

387
00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:00.772
But you have a conversation with others
cuz a lot of people won't see it, but

388
00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:01.585
they're so good.

389
00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:02.880
Their output is so high.

390
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.766
And it's like, well,
there's more things I value,

391
00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:06.540
we value as a company than
just having high output.

392
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.080
So managing conflicts,
I'll definitely let Ryan handle that one.

393
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.670
But in general, be curious.

394
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.860
Don't come in with an opinion in mind.

395
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.962
Don't come in with a solution already
in hand before you've heard what people

396
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:22.484
have to say.

397
00:19:22.484 --> 00:19:25.253
People will respect you a lot more
if you ask a lot of questions and

398
00:19:25.253 --> 00:19:28.482
don't do anything than if you come
in like, here's what we're gonna do,

399
00:19:28.482 --> 00:19:29.838
I'm gonna be a strong leader.

400
00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:31.690
I'm gonna be authoritative here.

401
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:35.275
And I've definitely done that, and it's a
mistake I've made probably too many times

402
00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:38.670
of trying to come in with a solution
rather than being curious.

403
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.260
But yeah, we're definitely gonna
dig in more on the conflict side.
