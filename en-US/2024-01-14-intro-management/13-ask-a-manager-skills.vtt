00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.227
And now for the Ask a Manager portion
with senior manager Ryan Burgess, and

2
00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:06.080
we're talking about skills today.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.141
So Ryan, what skill do you lean
on most in your day-to-day?

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:14.621
&gt;&gt; I think I'll take your nice compliment
that you left me earlier is that I lead

5
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:15.883
with people skills.

6
00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:21.408
I think that that is something that I find
that I lean on a lot is just observing,

7
00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:26.269
asking the right questions,
really trying to truly understand some

8
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.986
of the deeper level things
that you may not think of.

9
00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:33.576
Like even someone tells you something,
even if they're having a problem,

10
00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:36.730
they're not gonna sometimes and
straight up to say that, right?

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.254
They're hinting at it but they may not
wanna throw someone under the bus and so

12
00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:44.662
you're able to read into some
of those situations a bit and

13
00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:46.495
ask follow up questions.

14
00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:49.196
I'm sure there's many things I missed, but

15
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:53.747
I do feel like just paying attention to
those subtle nuance in the way someone

16
00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:58.462
says something is kind of poking at that
and asking questions can go a long way.

17
00:00:58.462 --> 00:00:59.814
&gt;&gt; Observation and asking questions.

18
00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:00.987
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I love that, yeah,

19
00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:03.560
I don't think we covered that,
but that's an important skill.

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.770
What's your favorite way
of learning as a manager?

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.960
&gt;&gt; It's a tough one, I don't know
that I've quite found, actually,

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.500
I'll say the cheap answer
is it's learning by doing.

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.917
It's constantly learning from
my own mistakes and going,

24
00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:21.510
wow, that did not work or that didn't
land, and how would I do it differently?

25
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.737
So it's a learning and reflecting on what
you've done, but I also like to read

26
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:30.091
books, like I do find that there's always
something that you can learn from it,

27
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:34.636
not everything like you said Jem the first
90 days which I think I'm the one who told

28
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.665
you to read that
&gt;&gt; You did [LAUGH].

29
00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:39.327
&gt;&gt; It's like there's some really
good insights in there, yes,

30
00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:41.989
there's some of the things you're
like I would never do that or

31
00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.370
I wouldn't take that approach,
I think it's good.

32
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.666
Another thing is learning
through good leaders, but

33
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:51.820
also learning through bad leaders,
I got to call that one out.

34
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.244
I've had some really good
managers over the years,

35
00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.660
I've had some really bad managers,
and it's funny that you learn a lot,

36
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.400
is like I wouldn't do that,
or this didn't work.

37
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.462
And so I think observing
there is a big thing too,

38
00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:06.749
is just paying attention to
what others are doing and

39
00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.008
just talking with other leaders in
your company can be beneficial or

40
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.640
going on those slack groups and
conferences and things and just similar as

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.747
engineering is like learning about
different techniques and talking about it.

42
00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:26.125
&gt;&gt; I agree with that, I would add my
favorite way of learning is doing it,

43
00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.590
but being a parent has taught
me a lot about being a leader of

44
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.708
people that I can't control directly.

45
00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:37.166
And more about controlling myself and
how I show up, which is,.

46
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:42.378
&gt;&gt; One of my favorite management
books is actually a parenting book,

47
00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:44.989
so I do see the connection there.

48
00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.471
&gt;&gt; Is it a how to talk to your kids or

49
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:49.594
listen to it so it gives,
&gt;&gt; It's actually a great book that people

50
00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:51.750
should absolutely read, it is so helpful.

51
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.459
You don't have to be a manager or
a parent, it's really just how to

52
00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.445
communicate with people, I think is
really an effective book to read.

53
00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.748
&gt;&gt; A lot of overlap there.

54
00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.351
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat the name of that book?

55
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:04.070
&gt;&gt; What was it again?

56
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.923
&gt;&gt; I always screw it up, but
it's like how to listen to your kids or

57
00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:11.410
how to talk to your kids so
your kids will listen.

58
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.574
I always mess up the title, I do actually
in my slides have it as a reference and

59
00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:20.397
so I highly recommend checking it out,
it is a good book.

60
00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:26.050
&gt;&gt; And Ryan, what skills do you
see missing in most new managers?

61
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.235
&gt;&gt; Funny enough,
it's the people skills, I feel like,

62
00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:34.360
well, I mean, we were engineers first,
right, that's where it often starts.

63
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.018
And however you got to management,
that's usually the first

64
00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:40.550
leading part because you still
want those technical skills.

65
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.531
And you might've been at the top
of your game as an engineer, and

66
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.400
there are different skill sets, and so
the people skills often is neglected,

67
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.980
and so that's a big one.

68
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.006
Communication you talked about Jem,
I think that's one that is tough,

69
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:59.880
it's one that as a leader, you're
constantly wanting to get better at.

70
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.245
I always strive for better communication,
whether it be my verbal or

71
00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:04.900
written communication.

72
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.060
People interpret it like you said,
the slack emoji can mean so many things,

73
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.155
I don't even think of that sometimes,
and it can be read differently and so

74
00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:14.986
communication is so important.

75
00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:19.348
And then another one that I would say is
a bit of a failure of as a new manager is

76
00:04:19.348 --> 00:04:20.400
micromanaging.

77
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.838
You feel like you have
to own someone's work or

78
00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:26.970
really help get your hands in there.

79
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.726
It's really hard because you wanna make
sure that you're doing something as

80
00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:34.840
a manager, but that's oftentimes the
mistake that people make is micromanaging.

81
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.695
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, thanks Ryan,
thanks for sharing your experience.

82
00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:40.432
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jem.
