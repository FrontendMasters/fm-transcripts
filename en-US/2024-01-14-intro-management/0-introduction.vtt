1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.030
Welcome to the world of
engineering management.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.350
It is wonderful, or you'll see why
it's wonderful, or hard, or both.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.297
Either way, at the end of this course,

4
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:13.190
you will appreciate a lot
about engineering management.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.300
This course is Engineering Management 101.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.109
It is very, very, very much an intro
course to engineering management.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.200
Tomorrow, we're teaching about
Engineering Management 102.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.740
That'll be taught by my colleague and
good peer, Ryan Burgess.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.790
We'll talk a little bit more about that.

10
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.150
So my name is Jem, as you probably know.

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.760
I am a software engineering manager.

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.527
I currently work at Netflix, and I've been
a manager for about two and a half years,

13
00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:50.044
which is why I was prompted to teach
a course on engineering management 101.

14
00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:53.718
Because I still remember the pain
of transitioning, and I'm not yet

15
00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:57.470
a grizzled and surly from years and
years of engineering management.

16
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.862
Or I'm like, this stuff is easy, because
it's not, it's not easy at all, and

17
00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.094
I still remember that.

18
00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:06.460
So I'm at the right stage where
I wanna teach a course on it.

19
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.543
You can find me on Twitter at @jemyoung.

20
00:01:09.543 --> 00:01:10.240
I don't tweet a lot.

21
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.841
Sorry, X, Twitter.

22
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.459
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Someday one of my

23
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:18.235
kids is gonna call me out on, its X, dad.

24
00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:21.370
I'm on LinkedIn at Jem Young.

25
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.886
Again, I don't post a lot,
I probably should.

26
00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:30.071
Throughout the course, you'll hear
snippets from my colleague and friend and

27
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:32.695
fellow engineering manager,
Ryan Burgess, and

28
00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:36.394
he'll be teaching a course later
on Engineering Management 102.

29
00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:42.038
And both of us, we have a podcast, Front
End Happy Hour, if you've heard of it,

30
00:01:42.038 --> 00:01:42.920
anybody heard of it?

31
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.086
All right, a couple of people.

32
00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:52.655
Yes, the front end masters crew
is waving their hands as well.

33
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:53.797
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's one of

34
00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:56.090
the longest running tech
podcasts that we've done.

35
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.060
Ryan's definitely spearheaded that
whole effort, but it's a good time.

36
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.980
It's just a lighthearted take on tech,

37
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.829
and a picture a bunch of friends at a bar
or a party just talking about technology.

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.730
I have a few other courses.

39
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.310
I have one for interviewing for
front-end engineers.

40
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.070
Back when I was a software engineer,
I worked on front-end.

41
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.610
So I wrote a course on that
because interviewing is hard.

42
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.650
We haven't made it better over the years,
despite my best efforts of this course.

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.471
But hopefully, if more people watch it,
you'll be like, yeah,

44
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.600
we should probably make interviewing for
other people a little bit better.

45
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.758
I have another course, Full Stack for
Front-Ends, and that's where we dive into.

46
00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:39.229
I'm a front-end engineer, but I don't
know anything about what happens beyond

47
00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.620
the wall of APIs and things like that.

48
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.470
And we dive into that
in that course as well.

49
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.174
And probably one of the my
favorite courses to teach.

50
00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:55.100
So in Practical Engineering Management
101, we're gonna cover three basic things.

51
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.710
The path.

52
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.190
How do you become a manager?

53
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.390
What does that look like?

54
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.620
It looks different for
everybody, very surprisingly.

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.540
We're gonna dive into
understanding the actual role.

56
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.516
Something that's really misunderstood
about engineering management and

57
00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.840
being in charge of things.

58
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.062
I'll give you a sneak peek.

59
00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:14.634
You're not in charge of anything.

60
00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:18.859
You're in charge of probably less than
you've ever been in your life, and

61
00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.888
it's a really different feeling.

62
00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.523
And then we're gonna talking about
surviving the first days and

63
00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:26.271
early tips of that transition from
software engineer to manager.

64
00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:33.142
So the goals of this course are I
want people to build the skills and

65
00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:36.600
knowledge to understand
engineering management.

66
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.336
Even if you say, you know what,
maybe engineering management isn't for

67
00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:42.030
me by the end of the course.

68
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.330
That's fine.

69
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.180
If you understand the lessons here, you
will become a better software engineer.

70
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.790
Which always throws people.

71
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.870
What does engineering management have
to do with software engineering?

72
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.370
A quick question.

73
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.850
How many of you out there have
an engineering manager or a manager?

74
00:04:02.804 --> 00:04:06.454
Yeah, most people almost everywhere in
the world has someone they report to.

75
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.134
They may not have the title of
maybe engineering manager But

76
00:04:09.134 --> 00:04:11.200
you're reporting to somebody.

77
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.240
The President reports to the people,
the CEO reports to the shareholders,

78
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.850
everybody reports to somebody.

79
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.811
So as software engineers or
even engineering managers,

80
00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:24.573
if you can understand the role of kind
of what what your manager is doing,

81
00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:25.880
you will become better.

82
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.710
You'll be able to say,
I know what information they want.

83
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.740
I know what things
they're struggling with.

84
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.890
I know how to have a growth
conversation with them.

85
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.151
I know how to navigate
kind of just the ups and

86
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.520
downs of the business, and
that's really my intent.

87
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.456
Even if you don't become an engineering
manager at the end of this course,

88
00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.420
or you're not sold on it
by the end of this course.

89
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.189
And I want to shine a light on the hidden
work of engineering management.

90
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.840
As a software engineer,
I had no idea what my manager did.

91
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.770
I saw them in one-on-ones.

92
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.474
I saw them in team meetings,
stand up project meetings, in the hallway,

93
00:04:57.474 --> 00:04:59.290
maybe at lunch, but that was it.

94
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.017
I had no idea what they did with their
time other than they did something because

95
00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.490
their calendar was always full.

96
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.450
So I wanna shine more light
onto what managers actually do.

97
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.670
Because it's surprising how
little we know about that.

98
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.410
I certainly didn't.

99
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.176
If you do want to become
an engineering manager,

100
00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:21.250
I wanna provide tools to help
you transition those early days.

101
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.630
The transition is difficult.

102
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.403
It's difficult in unexpected ways,
in ways that until you do it,

103
00:05:28.403 --> 00:05:30.450
you just really won't understand.

104
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.030
It's a lot like being a parent.

105
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.831
I don't know if any of you are parents,
but those of you who are know that

106
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:42.232
all the books and all the training and
all the advice and movies and

107
00:05:42.232 --> 00:05:48.310
all that mean nothing when you're actually
holding your baby for the first time.

108
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.630
And that's a lot like
engineering management.

109
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.622
You can read as much as you want,
but until you do it,

110
00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:57.910
you won't fully appreciate and
understand how difficult it is.

111
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.670
So I wanna help you with that.

112
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.730
I wanna give you tools to make
that a little bit easier.

113
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.070
Then I wanna provide some insights
in just common situations.

114
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.952
It's literally impossible to
cover every single scenario and

115
00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:13.440
every single situation
you're gonna encounter.

116
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.720
And that's the joy of
engineering management.

117
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.944
It's always different from company
to company, from person to person,

118
00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:20.932
from team to team, but

119
00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:24.220
there are common overall scenarios
that you're probably gonna run into.

120
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.210
And I wanna give you some tools and
give you insights into,

121
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.810
maybe not how to solve them, but
at least give you some insights into,

122
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.450
here's how I would think about it, here's
how maybe you should think about it.

123
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.380
And odds are we probably have different
ways of solving problems, and that's okay.

124
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.443
That's the challenge and the pros and
cons of engineering management.

125
00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:44.838
There is no one way to do things.

126
00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:50.613
Yes,
&gt;&gt; I'll just read a couple lines

127
00:06:50.613 --> 00:06:51.800
from chat.

128
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.390
The transition can be so brutal.

129
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.890
My transition was very tough.

130
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.700
There's no structure or model to follow.

131
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.955
Adam says, isn't it all about
filling up your calendar?

132
00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:11.092
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

133
00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:14.683
talking about different
stakeholder needs and

134
00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:19.259
that my team needs that results
in a big organization mess and

135
00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:24.570
unraveling it to make sure that
we're all facing the same direction.

136
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.021
And then someone said hurting cats.

137
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:29.981
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a good
way of putting it, and

138
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.730
I have a whole section
dedicated to meetings.

139
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:40.600
And not because I love meetings,
it's more, well, I'll talk about it then.

140
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.523
But yeah, I definitely talk about
meetings, the primary tool for

141
00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:46.040
engineering managers,
kind of how you spend your time.

142
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.530
This course is a little different.

143
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.490
There's no code, obviously.

144
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.533
Or maybe not obviously,
there's no code in this course,

145
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:56.240
there are exercises we're
gonna walk through.

146
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.550
Some we'll do together,
some you'll do on your own.

147
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.070
And that's more just to build
up your competencies and

148
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.850
kind of help you understand yourself when
it comes to these challenging situations.

149
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.117
There are scenarios we're
gonna play out in real-time,

150
00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:12.030
which should be pretty interesting.

151
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.530
Then we have an ask a manager question,
and

152
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.720
that's where I'll be talking
to my colleague, Ryan Burgess.

153
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.190
Ryan is a senior engineering
manager with lots of experience.

154
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.880
So he provides a very different
perspective than I do as more of

155
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.719
an early manager.

156
00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:34.050
So, let's start with the origin
story of how I became a manager.

157
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.740
Before we dive into that,
some prerequisites.

158
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.302
For this course,
I think it's really helpful to have at

159
00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:42.480
least three years' experience
as a software engineer.

160
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.999
I generally recommend a little
bit more if you're thinking about

161
00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:48.310
transitioning into management, and
we'll talk about that why in a bit.

162
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.546
But I think if you're still
early in your career and

163
00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:54.530
you're hearing all about engineering
management, you might get overwhelmed.

164
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.266
I really encourage people early
in their career, focus on coding.

165
00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:00.523
Focus on that beauty, the frustration,

166
00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:02.980
those long nights of
solving hard problems.

167
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.407
Because that sometimes goes away later in
your career as you think differently about

168
00:09:07.407 --> 00:09:08.780
the business.

169
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.160
So enjoy it now.

170
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.972
I don't think you should focus too much
on the management side of things, but

171
00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:14.130
you're welcome to.

172
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.600
It's just my recommendation.

173
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.010
And you have to have a willingness
to learn new things.

174
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.920
These will be different skills,
things that you're like, this is silly.

175
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.960
Why are we talking about this?

176
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.520
This has nothing to do with coding.

177
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.039
But it does, it's all about
coding at the end of the day, but

178
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.860
it's also not about coding at all.

179
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.640
I know, that's some cryptic wisdom there.

180
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.430
Everybody who's an engineering manager is
like, yep, and people who aren't are like,

181
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.780
that doesn't mean anything.

182
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.540
By the end, it'll make for more sense.

183
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.469
And this course is really for
software engineers who, again,

184
00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:48.940
want that insight into
engineering management.

185
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.330
And they wanna say,
what does my manager do besides meetings?

186
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.170
And it's also for engineering managers.

187
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.769
If you want a different perspective
on engineering management,

188
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:59.470
we all are coming from a different place.

189
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.690
We all have different teams,
different cultures, different backgrounds.

190
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.692
So I wanna share some of my perspective,
and

191
00:10:04.692 --> 00:10:07.789
mine is definitely more from
the bigger enterprise side of things.

192
00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:11.275
So yours might be a little bit different,
but maybe you can pick something up and

193
00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:13.681
hopefully I can learn from
you too with the questions.

194
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.422
So I could do the traditional,
what is it, valedictorian speech.

195
00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:26.704
Webster dictionary defines manage as,
but I like this definition.

196
00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:31.672
To be in control or in charge of
a business team or organization,

197
00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:34.530
land, sure, that's about right.

198
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.338
The second one always speaks to me,
to succeed in doing something,

199
00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:42.120
especially something difficult.

200
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.030
I managed to overcome something.

201
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.940
I managed to do this.

202
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.780
I managed to do that.

203
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.730
And that's, to me,
the heart of engineering management.

204
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.900
It is difficult, but
when you succeed, it is so

205
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.170
fulfilling in a way that is impossible to
describe unless you've done it before.

206
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.270
And hopefully I can share some of that.

207
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.174
A lot I'll focus on the realities
of engineering management,

208
00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:04.300
why it's difficult, but don't let
it taken away, I enjoy what I do.

209
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.410
It's a very challenging, fulfilling job.

210
00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:12.449
So, let's talk about how I became
a manager, because the path for

211
00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:17.220
everybody is a little bit different and
mine is, I think an interesting story, but

212
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.176
I'm an interesting person,
if I do say so myself.

213
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:24.911
2016, there I was,
a fresh, young, Jem Young,

214
00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:29.750
engineering manager or software engineer,
wasn't quite a manager yet.

215
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.250
I just got my first role and
it was at Netflix.

216
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.320
So I moved from New York all the way
to the Bay Area in California.

217
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.020
And they're a software engineer
working on the homepage, Netflix.com,

218
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.580
I was working as a,
I started as a front end engineer.

219
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.770
And I thought I knew a lot back then.

220
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.350
I knew very little,
I was very, very excitable.

221
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.910
We're gonna change the world,
you remember your engineering job.

222
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.082
You're like, yeah,
we're gonna be rich, stock options,

223
00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:05.600
my company's only gonna go up,
this line of code I'm writing is critical.

224
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.630
Everything's gonna be different.

225
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.830
Everything's gonna be better.

226
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.689
So fast forward a few years, I've been
working at Netflix for four years at this

227
00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:18.710
point, and I noticed something really,
really weird, really uncomfortable.

228
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.810
So I noticed my GitHub contributions, this
is a graph of my GitHub contributions,

229
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:31.340
they were going down, and down and
down, and I was perplexed.

230
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.030
I said, I'm an engineer,
I'm a software engineer.

231
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.950
What am I doing though?

232
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.950
If I'm not writing code, what am I doing?

233
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.080
And it really threw me for a loop
because I base my entire identity off of

234
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.562
being a software engineer and writing
code and my technical expertise, but

235
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:53.300
I was still doing something for
the company.

236
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.700
They hadn't let me go,
I was doing well by all metrics, but

237
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.020
I wasn't writing code anymore.

238
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.020
This really made me think about, what
is software engineering at this point?

239
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.450
I'm leading meetings now.

240
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.350
I'm running projects.

241
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.650
I'm throwing out ideas.

242
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.280
I'm helping.

243
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.200
I'm delegating work.

244
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.550
I'm helping people write code or
explaining technology to people.

245
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.230
How am I still a software engineer?

246
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.430
I'm not even touching code anymore.

247
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.650
It's going down and down and down.

248
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.999
This really gave me a lot to think about.

249
00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:26.046
So fortunately, I have a really good
support group of friends who are like,

250
00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:28.203
Jem, maybe you should try
engineering management.

251
00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:35.548
I was like, [LAUGH] no thank you,
that doesn't seem very exciting to me.

252
00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.440
They're like, why don't you try it?

253
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.280
You're pretty good with people, so people
tell me, and you know if nothing else.

254
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.492
And this is how I got tricked
into Netflix and interviewing for

255
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:50.691
Netflix was, you know what, if it doesn't
work out, you learned something and

256
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:53.880
you can go back to what
you were doing before.

257
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.800
I was like, yeah, that's true.

258
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.330
Now I know that's not the case.

259
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.050
You shouldn't casually become
an engineering manager.

260
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.462
The blast radius is high if
you're not committed to it, and

261
00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:08.470
you can impact the real lives of people.

262
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.294
But at the time I was like, yeah, I'll try
it, what's the worst that could happen?

263
00:14:12.294 --> 00:14:16.070
So in 2021,
I became an engineering manager.

264
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.660
And we'll talk more about that
transition and why it is difficult.

265
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.940
It is not easy to become
an engineering manager.

266
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.673
There are ways that are a little
bit easier than others, but

267
00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:26.980
making that jump was really,
really difficult.

268
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:35.000
So as an engineering manager, and it was
2021 and I'll be honest, I was struggling.

269
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.520
I was struggling.

270
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.508
No one was telling me what to do.

271
00:14:38.508 --> 00:14:42.996
The culture of the company is very much,
you're smart, we hired you for a role,

272
00:14:42.996 --> 00:14:44.061
you figure it out.

273
00:14:44.061 --> 00:14:47.004
Which I appreciate as a software engineer.

274
00:14:47.004 --> 00:14:49.707
But as engineering manager, I had no idea.

275
00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:51.967
What should I be focusing on?

276
00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.760
There's so many problems and

277
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.213
there's so many ways I could be spending
my time, what should I be doing?

278
00:14:58.213 --> 00:15:01.450
And the challenge of management
is no one can tell you that.

279
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.301
People can give you insights,
they can give you some tips,

280
00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:07.220
maybe their perspective, but
no one can tell you what to do.

281
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.980
And that's kind of the pro and
con of engineering management.

282
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.680
No one tells you what to do.

283
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.450
In my first year, it was bad.

284
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.200
It was really bad.

285
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.930
I was in a really bad place.

286
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.430
And I had to figure out how to
get myself out of the hole.

287
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.354
And fortunately, I had friends I can
count on, give me good advice, but

288
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:28.250
overall, I don't like to quit and
I like the challenge.

289
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.182
And if something's hard that I
especially like when I overcome it.

290
00:15:31.182 --> 00:15:32.830
But I pushed really hard and

291
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.070
I'd say this is something I don't
want anybody to go through though.

292
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.344
And that's kind of the onus for
this course is like,

293
00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:41.960
I don't want you to
struggle the way I did.

294
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.270
And so you look at me,
I'm smiling now, the team is good.

295
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.850
I can look back in 2023 and say,
wow, I really made a difference.

296
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:56.140
I really turned things around from a team
that probably wasn't doing so well.

297
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.036
But I can only see that now, but
when you're in the thick of it,

298
00:15:59.036 --> 00:15:59.920
you can't see it.

299
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.290
All you can see is the problems.

300
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.131
So, that's the origin story
of how I became a manager and

301
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.000
how I'm standing up here now.

302
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.200
And all of that I wanna teach you.

303
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.110
I wanna teach you how to avoid what I did.

304
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.490
I wanna teach you how to become
a manager the right way.

305
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.033
I wanna teach you all these skills and
just lessons I've learned, very,

306
00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:20.758
very hard won lessons as a manager.

307
00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:25.020
Why the practical part?

308
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.370
Why practical?

309
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.824
It's practical because there's so
many books on engineering management,

310
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.060
there's so many books on leadership.

311
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.468
A lot of them are, I remember
reading them, they're philosophical.

312
00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:44.137
I guess you're like, your team and
how do you build trust with your team?

313
00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:46.690
And how do you think about that?

314
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.130
And, what are the different
personalities in your team?

315
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.700
And these are important things to know.

316
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.678
But that's not really my style of
learning.tell me real lessons,

317
00:16:55.678 --> 00:16:58.257
tell me real tips that
I can take away today,

318
00:16:58.257 --> 00:17:03.940
not theoretical things, because there's
just too many scenarios to cover well.

319
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.360
So this is why the course is called
Practical Engineering Management.

320
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.930
We're not gonna go into
thought leadership too much.

321
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.390
This is all gonna be real practical
things that you can take away today.

322
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.121
That will make sense to you whether you're
an engineering manager, software engineer,

323
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:18.150
a director.

324
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.860
And that's the goal of
the practical side of things.

325
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.620
Things you can actually take and
do something with.
