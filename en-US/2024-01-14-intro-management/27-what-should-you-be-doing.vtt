1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.967
So what should you be doing?

2
00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.991
Nothing.

3
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:04.816
I mean that.

4
00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:09.621
Your first 30 days, and this is for
any kind of people leadership role,

5
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:11.027
don't do anything.

6
00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:11.867
You don't know anything.

7
00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:14.435
You don't know the context,
you don't know the history, you don't know

8
00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:17.358
the relationships, you don't the dynamics,
you don't know what's important.

9
00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:20.559
So if you go in there and start pulling
things, saying, why are we doing this,

10
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:21.733
this is completely broken?

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.714
There's probably a reason why we're doing
that, you just don't understand that.

12
00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.625
And you can't if you're too busy moving,
and

13
00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.399
you never will if you're too busy moving.

14
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.150
So you should do nothing and listen,

15
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.097
even if things are glaringly obviously
broken, unless someone's in danger or

16
00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:42.285
just something really toxic is going on,
just listen.

17
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:45.145
Listen to what people are saying,
and really, really listen and

18
00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.141
ask those questions.

19
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:47.118
Be curious.

20
00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:50.076
Ryan mentioned that earlier
about his leadership style,

21
00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.649
his curiosity when it comes to
solving conflicts, things like that.

22
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.367
You should always be curious.

23
00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.466
Earlier, I said in one-on-ones,
your most powerful tool,

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.693
ask everybody on the team
the same question.

25
00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:02.569
How's the team doing?

26
00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:05.303
What's one thing that we can
be improving on right now?

27
00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:08.867
What can I as a manager do for
you right now?

28
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.879
Next week, what's one thing
that could be going better?

29
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.157
What's one thing we're really good at?

30
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.073
And ask everybody that same question,

31
00:01:16.073 --> 00:01:20.036
you will get a really good snapshot of
the team, and you'll know what to do next.

32
00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:24.788
But you can only do it if you listen
instead of trying to fix everything.

33
00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:28.655
And you're responsible for one-on-ones,
for team meetings, for stand-ups,

34
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.759
sometimes project check-ins,
you now represent an entire team,

35
00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.133
sometimes an organization.

36
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.845
That's on you, you gotta run meetings.

37
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:39.359
So we talked about public speaking, you
better get good at it [LAUGH] real fast.

38
00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.506
You can't just sit there quietly and
hope someone will say something,

39
00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:43.774
cuz now that someone is you.

40
00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:46.695
It's happened to me before,
I just stood there, I'm like,

41
00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:48.696
why isn't anybody saying anything?

42
00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:49.831
Wait, that's my job now.

43
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:53.724
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This is different.

44
00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:57.701
You should definitely be meeting your
partners, finding out what's important to

45
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.616
them, what you should be doing,
what they're working on.

46
00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:03.224
And you should be looking at processes.

47
00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:07.429
If you have a process in your team where
it takes three engineers to sign off on

48
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.941
every pull request,
is that a good process?

49
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:11.339
I don't know, maybe.

50
00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.657
But you should be looking at all the
processes that your team has and saying,

51
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:17.426
okay, why do we do this thing?

52
00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:18.181
Be curious about it.

53
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.414
Don't try to change it,
but look critically at it.

54
00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:24.328
And what can you do to make
these processes better?

55
00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:28.016
And chances are, if you became
a new manager, oftentimes they do

56
00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:32.052
that when the team's about to grow,
which you might have to hire soon.

57
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.016
Congratulations, you're a new manager.

58
00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:37.712
You gotta hire, which is one of the most
important and difficult things you're

59
00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:41.906
gonna do, which is why we're gonna cover
it in Engineering Management 102 tomorrow,

60
00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:43.089
a big section on hiring.

61
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.669
But oftentimes, you have to hire
immediately, and it's very scary,

62
00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.169
especially as a new manager.

63
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.657
[LAUGH] You're responsible for
setting competition,

64
00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:52.177
finding the right personality.

65
00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:56.171
But of all these, the most important
thing you can do is just listen, and

66
00:02:56.171 --> 00:03:00.049
write down what's going on, and
then share that with the team later.

67
00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.444
Here's what I observed, here's what's
going well, here's things I can do better.

68
00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:06.884
And listen to your team,
listen to your manager.

69
00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.999
They all wanna help you,
they're all telling you something.

70
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.966
And the most important thing you can
do is try to listen and take that away.

71
00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.745
So I have an exercise here on
understanding your new position.

72
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:21.761
I'll cover it,
we don't have to do it right now.

73
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:27.700
But it's just you're a new manager,
what do you focus on now?

74
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.791
And this is just to get you
in the mind of business.

75
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.110
And we talked about this earlier,

76
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.073
you should understand now
what your company does.

77
00:03:34.073 --> 00:03:37.372
If you didn't before,
you should do that now.

78
00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:38.764
How does your company make money?

79
00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:40.504
What is important to them?

80
00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:43.291
You should know that now.

81
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.429
What role does your team have
in relationship to the business?

82
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.955
The most important question
you really need an answer to.

83
00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:53.528
Cuz if you don't have an answer to that,
you can't set long-term strategy,

84
00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:55.259
you can't set the vision of the team,

85
00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.984
because you don't know what
you're supposed to be doing.

86
00:03:57.984 --> 00:04:00.922
What role do you have in
relationship to the business?

87
00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:03.082
We talked about the roles
of engineering managers,

88
00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:05.300
it's gonna be different
depending on where you sit.

89
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.045
You should understand
what you should be doing.

90
00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.767
Who are the users?

91
00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:14.530
Like I said, I run a platform team, so my
users are other engineers at the company.

92
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.421
Your users might be real
users using your products.

93
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:19.772
They might be other engineers.

94
00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:20.835
They might be other teams.

95
00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:24.183
They might be other engineers
in different companies.

96
00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:28.549
But you should know who the users
are at a high level of your team.

97
00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:29.957
And who are your partners?

98
00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:33.928
Who are the people you count on,
you use their software, or

99
00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:36.322
you work together and ship things?

100
00:04:36.322 --> 00:04:39.886
So in your first 30 days, probably,
hopefully before you take on the role,

101
00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:41.892
you should have answered these questions.

102
00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:46.662
You have to, otherwise you probably
won't be very effective as a leader.

103
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:50.282
So if you get to this stage, come back to
this worksheet, fill it out, hopefully,

104
00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:52.010
it'll provide some insights for you.
