1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.033
When it comes to the interview.

2
00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:06.080
I can't say specifically
how it's gonna ask.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.990
I can talk at a high level about some of
the things we're probably gonna dig into.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.230
And there it's very different from
a software engineering interview.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.134
But the interview itself is gonna be very
custom and bespoke to the company or

6
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:18.401
culture, whatever they're looking for.

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.383
Some example questions have
on the leadership part,

8
00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:23.645
describe your management philosophy.

9
00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.417
You should have one,
even if you're not a manager yet,

10
00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:31.850
you should probably have a philosophy
on how you wanna lead people.

11
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.008
I did, mine is very much the cheerleader,

12
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:41.080
the I wanna advance my team,
I wanna grow them.

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.920
That's really important to me.

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.023
But that's one of my philosophies.

15
00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.299
Everybody has something
a little bit different.

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.727
What does influencing it
without authority mean?

17
00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:56.829
Remember we talked earlier about
you can't make anybody do anything.

18
00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.754
So you have to influence them
to make the right decisions, but

19
00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:03.861
even if you don't have the authority, so
that means your partners, your customers,

20
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:04.778
things like that.

21
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.901
Partnerships, you've
gotta work with somebody.

22
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.887
How do you make sure they're
delivering for you and for your team?

23
00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:14.631
What are strategies you deploy there?

24
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.570
How do you deliver results for
your partners?

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.649
How do you find out what
they need from you?

26
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.620
I'll tell you, the quickest way to get
fired at a company is to not deliver for

27
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.470
your partners and they start
saying bad things to your manager.

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.530
This person's not reliable.

29
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.250
Their team's not delivering.

30
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.290
It happens really quickly.

31
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.120
It can happen suddenly.

32
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.940
You have to make sure
your partners are happy.

33
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.442
And to do that, you have to
understand what is important to them.

34
00:01:41.617 --> 00:01:43.976
On the technical side,
when it comes to project prioritization,

35
00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.580
you're gonna have to do that.

36
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.100
What's your strategy for
figuring that out?

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.410
Who do you talk to?

38
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.908
What's your methodology for
understanding what's important right now?

39
00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.751
And in general,
how do you think about prioritization?

40
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.186
How do you think about what's important
right now, what's important next week, and

41
00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.183
what's not important?

42
00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:08.791
So these are the type of questions that
will come up in a management interview

43
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.660
that if you hadn't thought of them until
now, well, now you have, hopefully.

44
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.350
There isn't necessarily one right answer.

45
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.746
Everybody's gonna have a little bit
different, and sometimes they're your

46
00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:22.100
philosophy, maybe not the right way for
the role, maybe it is.

47
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.529
But again, it's important to have
thought of these ahead of time and

48
00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.550
just think internally about yourself.

49
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.736
So now let's let's cover something
you probably don't see very often,

50
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:36.326
which is,
what does it look like to interview for

51
00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:38.810
a real life with a real life manager for
a role?

52
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.245
And again, we're gonna be talking to Ryan
Burgess, who's done, think hundreds and

53
00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.280
hundreds of interviews in his life.

54
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.590
For interviewing candidates,
I think he said over 800 the other day,

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.800
he's talked to 800 people
in his time as a manager.

56
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.909
But we're gonna do a manager interview and
we're gonna to cover some of the questions

57
00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.930
you'll probably get and we're gonna
learn how he thinks about them.

58
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.145
Solving these conflicts and
answering questions, and

59
00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.530
get some of his wisdom here.

60
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.140
To kick it off, Ryan, in 2016,

61
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.590
you hired me to Netflix as
a senior software engineer.

62
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.010
How are you feeling about
that decision right now?

63
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.140
&gt;&gt; Feeling pretty good, Jem.

64
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.800
I think I made a good choice.

65
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.503
You've been a long-tenured employee
at Netflix and, definitely have been

66
00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:28.570
a high performer as an engineer and
now as an engineering manager.

67
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.230
So, probably a good choice.

68
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.210
I think I did a good job, yeah.

69
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good job, I agree.

70
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.400
&gt;&gt; Good job.
&gt;&gt; Good job, everybody [LAUGH].

71
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.027
But true story, Ryan did hire me
to Netflix all those years ago and

72
00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:43.760
helped inspire me to become a manager.

73
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.650
So how the tables have turned now
that I'm interviewing you for a role.

74
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.150
&gt;&gt; This will be good, Jem.

75
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.825
&gt;&gt; So question one about your style,
Bryan Burgess,

76
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:54.690
describe your leadership philosophy.

77
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a tough question.

78
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.760
And I know I like that you said
prepare for that ahead of time,

79
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.090
I think that's good.

80
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.349
I think the way I would describe
maybe my philosophy on leadership or

81
00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.299
my approach is probably the best way to
describe it is empathetic leadership.

82
00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.290
Which means many things I feel like
I've talked about it earlier in some

83
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.781
of your questions about being able
to lean in on people or read and

84
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:24.456
observe that way but also being
flexible i think is another thing.

85
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:29.650
Being able to adapt and to different
changes and things or styles of

86
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.507
other people and how they work is likely
the best way to describe how I lead.

87
00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:39.971
&gt;&gt; Empathetic leadership, yeah, and how do
you see empathetic leadership playing out

88
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.110
with your team and your partners?

89
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel as with both as team and
partners a big thing to effectively

90
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.740
as a leader or as a partner or
just being in a team Is building trust.

91
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.817
And so
I think on a human connected people level,

92
00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:58.830
I find I'm able to do
that fairly effectively.

93
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.221
I can build trust, just foster
that collaboration really well and

94
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:07.640
also be willing to make mistakes myself.

95
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.880
But also be accepting of other
people's mistakes, not get frustrated.

96
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.660
And it's a good way for us to learn, and
grow as a team or a partnering team.

97
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.090
So I think that's how it really shows
up for my partnerships or with my team.

98
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.390
&gt;&gt; Pretty good, we're gonna move you
on to round two congratulations.

99
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.040
&gt;&gt; Thank goodness.

100
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.560
&gt;&gt; It was close, but.

101
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.000
&gt;&gt; Could have done better but yeah, sure.

102
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.638
&gt;&gt; You've got some credit, so I'll let
you pass questions here around the team.

103
00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:36.480
How do you create the best
team environment?

104
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.360
And what does the best team
environment look like?

105
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.420
&gt;&gt; These are both good questions.

106
00:05:44.342 --> 00:05:47.560
Definitely building trust,
encouraging trust.

107
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.103
I'm going back to that one cuz I
think if you do not trust your team,

108
00:05:51.103 --> 00:05:54.500
they don't trust you,
they don't trust each other.

109
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.846
It's not gonna work, so that's
a really important aspect of it being

110
00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:05.660
able to communicate with one another
share things that aren't going well.

111
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.982
So encouraging that vulnerability
even in yourself to say

112
00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:12.716
hey here's mistakes I've made, or

113
00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:19.180
being able to even celebrate mistakes
within the team I think is so important.

114
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.660
Making sure that people don't feel
that they're scared to make mistake.

115
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.650
Yeah, I don't want people to
be scared to make a mistake.

116
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.909
Yes, if you're making the same
mistake over and over again,

117
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:29.960
that's a different story.

118
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.850
But we want to be able to iterate and
learn.

119
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.380
And so that's something I wanna
foster in that culture of a team.

120
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.980
And yeah, I think that's the best way
you can kind of evolve as a team.

121
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.450
&gt;&gt; And what's your ideal team culture?

122
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.920
What does that look like?

123
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.590
&gt;&gt; The ideal team culture is gotta
throw the word trust in there again.

124
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.075
But it's a trusting collaborative
team that is effective and

125
00:06:56.075 --> 00:07:02.100
works well together as a unit, but
is also effective individuals.

126
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.214
So there's effective individuals
who are high performing, but

127
00:07:05.214 --> 00:07:08.790
they also work very collaboratively
together and with partnering teams.

128
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.830
&gt;&gt; Pretty good answers,
better than round one.

129
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.530
So we're gonna pass you on to
the next round, congratulations.

130
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.410
&gt;&gt; Well done, all right.

131
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.425
&gt;&gt; Let's walk through a scenario here,
common scenario,

132
00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:25.860
two members of the team disagree
about a technology solution.

133
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.875
The disagreement has gotten so heated that
it spilled over the team meetings and

134
00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.230
people are starting to take sides.

135
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.040
Tell me how would you
resolve the situation?

136
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.368
&gt;&gt; This has never happened.

137
00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:38.349
Never seen two engineers disagree on it.

138
00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.327
&gt;&gt; Never.

139
00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:44.947
&gt;&gt; I also like that you called out
spilling out over team I think that

140
00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:47.438
changes maybe the scenario a bit.

141
00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:51.468
But yeah, we all have
disagreements on technologies or

142
00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:57.299
approaches I think in this scenario it
sounds like it's maybe gotten a little bit

143
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:04.000
heated It's likely causing a little bit of
maybe toxicity or tension within the team.

144
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.471
So my first thinking here would be
to pull aside the two engineers with

145
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:13.780
a disagreement, maybe help understand
where each of them are coming from.

146
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.761
How how hard of a disagreement is,
this is it true conflict or

147
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:22.678
is it maybe one where they're just trying
to see it from different sides and

148
00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:25.550
maybe can work it out themselves?

149
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.560
If they can work it out themselves, what
I'm gonna do is probably encourage them to

150
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.270
work together to outline
their perspectives.

151
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.042
Probably put it in
a form of a memo to then

152
00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:39.280
articulate the trade-offs
with the two approaches.

153
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.025
Maybe even they come to a conclusion,
maybe they don't, but

154
00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:48.320
then bring that back to the team to have
a more healthier debate within the team.

155
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.320
So that would be an approach there.

156
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.567
I mean, if it's a super heated
debate between the two of them,

157
00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.460
it might be me having to mediate
between the two of them.

158
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.690
And there's just,
it really depends on the situation.

159
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's complicated,
but good answer.

160
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.664
Scenario two, you've observed over the
past few months that a member of your team

161
00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:10.139
has been missing deadlines and

162
00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:13.750
the projects they have shipped
have a number of issues and bugs.

163
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.299
What's your approach to
this type of situation?

164
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:23.590
So I'm gonna assume that this person,
maybe it's not the norm for them.

165
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.053
So I'm gonna assume that this is something
that has just started happening,

166
00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:28.890
it wasn't happening before.

167
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.060
I might trying to decide is
this a new area for them?

168
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.170
Maybe they're dealing with some new
challenges that in a technical way that

169
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.970
I'm aware of that, hey, they are thrown
in a bit more on the deep end.

170
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:46.540
So I might have some empathy towards that,
but I wanna talk with the person, right?

171
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.020
I wanna really understand what's going on.

172
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.008
So I'm gonna in a one-on-one brings
this into their attention, say hey,

173
00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:55.827
have observed that you've
been missing deadlines.

174
00:09:55.827 --> 00:10:00.522
You're having some issues that are showing
up in your code or what you're shipping,

175
00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:03.140
it's just not the quality
that it normally is.

176
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.520
Do you feel that?

177
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.470
Or I wanna put something back on them
to say how do they feel about it?

178
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.290
Are they recognizing that?

179
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.800
Do they feel that?

180
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.263
Maybe they weren't aware,
but maybe they are aware,

181
00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:21.930
and then understand why,
I can't answer that for them.

182
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:27.387
Maybe there's some external factors,
they have family issues, who knows?

183
00:10:27.387 --> 00:10:29.382
There's many factors
that could be at play or

184
00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:33.150
maybe it's just something that they've
never dealt with in their career.

185
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.744
And so that could change my approach too
is if they're needing just some time off,

186
00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:39.409
maybe they're burnt out, or

187
00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:44.020
maybe they need some extra time to deal
with a family situation, that could be it.

188
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.840
Maybe they don't know that technical.

189
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.761
Or that area of expertise for them,

190
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:52.840
maybe I can pair them up with
someone to help them learn that.

191
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.758
Maybe they just have troubles estimating,
that's another thing.

192
00:10:55.758 --> 00:11:00.542
So it really depends on the situation,
but my approach is really much to try and

193
00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:03.088
understand their perspective of it too.

194
00:11:03.088 --> 00:11:06.556
And also it's probably setting
expectations, we need to address,

195
00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:10.804
this can't continue to happen because
clearly it's causing problems where we're

196
00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:11.898
missing deadlines.

197
00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:16.184
And I wanna work with them on that
as if this is a hard expectation for

198
00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:17.958
their job critical thing.

199
00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.393
They don't make it through this,
if they can't do that job, I mean,

200
00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:23.810
we might have a different conversation.

201
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.721
So I wanna be very clear that
this is an expectation and

202
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:29.059
then start to work through that with them.

203
00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:33.300
&gt;&gt; I like your approach,
be curious, but set expectations.

204
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.170
That's really important.

205
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.470
So overall I'd say these are good answers,
I'm gonna hire you Ryan.

206
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.700
I think I'm gonna take a chance
on you as an engineering manager.

207
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.479
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, man.

208
00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.670
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jem.
