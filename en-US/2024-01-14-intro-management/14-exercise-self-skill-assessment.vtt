1
00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:03.591
And we've talked a lot about skills,
the different skills you'll need.

2
00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:07.536
More importantly, you're probably
thinking, yeah, there's some skills that I

3
00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:11.048
wasn't aware of or I probably didn't
even mention, there's a lot to it.

4
00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:14.371
Earlier when we thought of roles,
all the roles that EMs play.

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.655
Think of all the skills it takes to be
the lawyer, versus the cheerleader,

6
00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:23.558
versus the coach, versus the speaker of
the house, different skill sets entirely.

7
00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:26.022
So now,
we're gonna take a 15 minute exercise and

8
00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:28.160
let's talk about your own personal skills.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.236
I want you to think critically
about what are you good at?

10
00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.996
What are you not so good at?

11
00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:38.660
And be honest with yourself cuz
I'm not seeing what you write, but

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.003
it'll be a helpful exercise just
to put it out there on paper.

13
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:44.550
So let's jump into this exercise.

14
00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.020
Like Ryan said,
his favorite way of learning is by doing.

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.211
Same with me,
I don't like to see other people do it,

16
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.642
I'd rather just jump in and do it.

17
00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:06.055
If that's something I need to fix, I need
to step back and see what I can learn.

18
00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:07.390
Probably read more books.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.052
But that's one of the challenges is
the only way to get good at leadership is

20
00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:13.088
actually do it.

21
00:01:13.088 --> 00:01:17.633
There's different ways you
can get touches of it.

22
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.783
But right now it's good to focus on like,

23
00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.250
what are the skills that
build up to doing that?

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.872
And if you build up these skills,
it'll make the transition so much easier.

25
00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:29.873
For example, the most common one I
talked about was public speaking.

26
00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:31.034
You're gonna have to do it.

27
00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:32.680
The minute you become a manager,
you're gonna have to do it.

28
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.919
But you can build up those skills
over time, so it's not so daunting.

29
00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.430
So it's not just a shock when
you get up in front of people.

30
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.635
All right now I want you to take
15 minutes and fill this out, and

31
00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.786
then we'll talk about some of
your answers after you're done.

32
00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:48.067
So start with a personal assessment.

33
00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:49.867
What are your strengths?

34
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:50.570
Is it public speaking?

35
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.720
Is it communication?

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.780
Are you a great writer?

37
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.230
You just get stuff out really easily.

38
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.166
Are you good at organizing?

39
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.898
Are you an extrovert, your life of
the party bringing people together?

40
00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:02.370
What are the things you're not so good at?

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.701
There's probably probably a lot there,
if you're being honest.

42
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.717
And then talk about how you
translate those strengths and

43
00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:09.280
weaknesses into engineering management.

44
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.039
How do you think they're gonna show up?

45
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.678
What transfer you lean on today,

46
00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:18.786
it doesn't mean you have to focus all your
energy on your thing in your weaknesses.

47
00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.161
Strengths are just as important.

48
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.008
Then what additional skills or
knowledge you think you need,

49
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.253
like what's the most critical things
that you need to fix or build up?

50
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:31.599
And then for those top three
areas that you'd like to improve,

51
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.410
write down a quick blurb.

52
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.194
Why is it important to you?

53
00:02:37.194 --> 00:02:38.981
How are you doing on it today?

54
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:41.730
And how am I measuring if I'm being
successful in growing this skill?

55
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.270
You just have to do it for three.

56
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.996
You can do as many as you want,
but I recommend three.

57
00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:50.510
So take 15 minutes and fill this out, and
then we'll come back in and talk about it.

58
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.099
I definitely wanna hear from
you all on any discoveries or

59
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.178
epiphanies you've had
while filling this out.

60
00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:01.768
How was the exercise?

61
00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:04.139
Anything interesting you
discovered about yourself?

62
00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.757
When I didn't write
the personal assessment,

63
00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:11.834
but I think some of my
strengths are public speaking.

64
00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:13.560
I don't know if I'm good at it, but

65
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.988
it doesn't bother me to
get up in front of people.

66
00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:19.140
I do conference talks, but I'd done
conference talk before I became a manager.

67
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.111
So I'd say that's one of
my strengths is presenting.

68
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.477
Verbal communication I'm pretty good at,
I probably over invest in reading people's

69
00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:30.730
body language and saying like,
am I what is I'm saying landing?

70
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.005
Where are they at?

71
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:32.728
Am I being receptive?

72
00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:37.915
Do I need to adjust my tone,
add more humor, less humor, etc.

73
00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:41.900
Weaknesses, project
management [LAUGH] I'm not.

74
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.866
I create at it, I don't enjoy.

75
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:45.957
It's not from the most enjoyable part,

76
00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:48.980
which means I haven't invested
a whole lot into doing it.

77
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.507
An area where I have tried to build
on that, build that up a little bit.

78
00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:56.913
It's just having a template, for
project kick offs and things like that,

79
00:03:56.913 --> 00:03:58.059
makes me so much easier.

80
00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:02.756
I'm like, what are the milestones,
what are the meanings, all that,

81
00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:07.386
having that in place, lets me kind
of bolster up that weakness of mine.

82
00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:12.083
Another one is, my weakness is verbal
communication, because I consider

83
00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:16.643
it strong, I tend to lean on a lot,
when I really need to stop and listen.

84
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:19.456
And just being silent and
working on doing that,

85
00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:22.830
is definitely something I need
to get better at overtime.

86
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.091
&gt;&gt; I actually, I share that similar
issue with not knowing when to shut up.

87
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:33.234
And when I first became an engineering
manager my manager gave me

88
00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:39.247
great advice to practice counting to
seven in your head without speaking.

89
00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:44.277
Seven is like an uncomfortable enough
amount of time that you get introverts

90
00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:48.767
to speak up or get people to kind of
start sharing more that you know.

91
00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:53.404
Maybe they weren't feeling good
about saying right in a moment or

92
00:04:53.404 --> 00:04:58.377
two but if you get a couple of seconds
you can get people to start opening

93
00:04:58.377 --> 00:05:02.526
up a little bit more and and
find out the really good stuff.

94
00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.280
&gt;&gt; Count to seven, that's a great tip.

95
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.150
I should probably do that.

96
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.078
That's so long though.

97
00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:09.162
Seven seconds of silence.

98
00:05:09.162 --> 00:05:11.730
If I wait, let me try seven
seconds of silence now, okay.

99
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:22.208
All right, that was seven seconds.

100
00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:23.840
That's a while, but that's a good tip.

101
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.092
It's an uncomfortable amount of time.

102
00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:33.626
I'd say my weaknesses outpace my strength,
but I'd say that's probably weaknesses

103
00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:37.552
of mine is something I learned about
myself this year, even into my 30s.

104
00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:39.813
I'm a perfectionist, not in everything.

105
00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:42.290
That doesn't mean I keep my room clean and
all these other things.

106
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.480
It just means I don't like to deliver
something unless it's perfect.

107
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.453
Which turns out as an engineering manager,
that's a weakness.

108
00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:53.222
Cuz it means I second-guess myself,
I triple-check,

109
00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:55.600
I spend more time on things when,
you know what?

110
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.126
Sometimes it's just good enough and
that's fine.

111
00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:02.264
And accepting that is something I'm
still working on today, which is.

112
00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:07.327
Sometimes just send that email you don't
have to triple check it and run it

113
00:06:07.327 --> 00:06:12.811
through AI and all these other things,
just send the email and get it done with.

114
00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:18.227
What about you all what are some of your
strengths and weaknesses you uncover here.

115
00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:23.172
&gt;&gt; I pride myself on being a really strong
critical thinker and having a strong

116
00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:28.840
technical acumen and good understanding of
how the nuts and bolts all work together.

117
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.936
I do think that can manifest
certain weaknesses,

118
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:40.377
especially in how I articulate ideas and
proposals to others.

119
00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:45.666
Because I often leapfrog
a lot of assumptions and

120
00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:51.213
conclusions in my own head,
that my colleagues and

121
00:06:51.213 --> 00:06:57.147
peers may not have arrived
at the same conclusions or,

122
00:06:57.147 --> 00:07:01.026
made some of the same assumptions.

123
00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:05.164
So having to break down those ideas and

124
00:07:05.164 --> 00:07:10.205
pedal backwards,
to help them get caught up to

125
00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:15.264
where my brain is a lot
of times is a challenge.

126
00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:20.330
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting insight,
we do that a lot.

127
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.014
The stronger you are, the harder it is to
go back down and explain things to people.

128
00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:27.364
My favorite one is a for loop.

129
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.988
I don't have to explain how a for
loop to any of you works, but

130
00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:35.771
try explaining a for loop later to your
partner or your non-technical person.

131
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:37.265
They'll be like once,

132
00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:41.460
again it's the one of those insights
you don't think about a lot.

133
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.071
But that's a great example of
understanding your strengths and

134
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.872
weaknesses, right?.

135
00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:49.120
&gt;&gt; What are my strengths?

136
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.882
I think as a leader that I don't think I
would have known going into it as hiring,

137
00:07:54.882 --> 00:07:58.322
very quick and good at hiring for
some reason and

138
00:07:58.322 --> 00:08:01.008
it helped out a lot of others do that.

139
00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:06.361
One of my weaknesses, I struggle to
delegate, I think that is a really

140
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:11.102
hard skill set in many ways of
like letting go of something or.

141
00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:13.871
I definitely trust people to do it or
I can trust that, but

142
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.221
it's like sometimes knowing when's
the right time to delegate it,

143
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:20.880
when I'm like wait, I shouldn't be
doing this, I should delegate this.

144
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.142
Oftentimes I'll just be like,
I'll suffer through it and

145
00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:27.676
I'll just do it when I could have
probably delegated it sooner.

146
00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:29.731
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

147
00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:35.956
That's a hard one to learn too, yeah.

148
00:08:35.956 --> 00:08:40.513
&gt;&gt; As a strength as an engineer, I feel
like I can hold a large mental model of

149
00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:45.101
the product I'm working on, as long
as you kind of build that over time.

150
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:49.535
In a weakness, I'd say it was
prioritizing what needs to be done today,

151
00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:51.801
versus what can wait till tomorrow.

152
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:58.612
I feel like I'm always off on
urgency with some of my other peers.

153
00:08:58.612 --> 00:09:02.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those all these strengths or

154
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.842
all these weaknesses we're mentioning,
those are hard to.

155
00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:13.566
&gt;&gt; Having tough conversations
when it's needed, but

156
00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:18.061
it makes you uncomfortable having
to have that conversation?

157
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:19.579
&gt;&gt; Yeah, man.

158
00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:22.573
You all are nailing these.

159
00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:25.310
It's human nature to avoid conflicts,
it's just easier.

160
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.737
But it's often not the right thing to do.

161
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.797
&gt;&gt; The strength that I may not have
initially thought of going into leadership

162
00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:37.125
as empathy although it seems obvious now.

163
00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:39.587
I think especially going through,

164
00:09:39.587 --> 00:09:44.520
just what we've been through as a world
in the last three or four years.

165
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.999
And then, a weakness I think is like
the business acumen like when you're

166
00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:53.634
sitting in meetings with business
product people and VPs and higher-ups.

167
00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:58.682
It's sometimes hard to like get the the
business speak down and understand what

168
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:04.049
they're talking about and be able to get
your point across, as a technical person.

169
00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:10.644
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a real one for
me too, I'm like why should I care?

170
00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:15.248
You should, but it's only later, much more
experience that I learned, I'm like, yeah,

171
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:16.145
you should care.

172
00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:19.413
But that's a good one too.

173
00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:24.579
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] How not to sound condescending
when you're talking to someone.

174
00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:28.549
That's not technical.

175
00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:32.019
Because sometimes it's, I understand, so

176
00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:36.952
I smile because I understand how
they came to conclusion that's

177
00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:41.990
incorrect because,
sometimes technologies and unintuitive.

178
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.242
And some of smiling cuz I get
exactly how they got there.

179
00:10:45.242 --> 00:10:47.521
But now I've, it seems,

180
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.819
some people have told me it
seems like I'm laughing at them.

181
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.361
&gt;&gt; That's a really good perspective and
insight,

182
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:59.019
kinda similar to what you're saying
on like, you make these leaps and

183
00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:02.743
you're like, yeah, it's obvious,
but not everybody's there.

184
00:11:02.743 --> 00:11:04.952
Yeah, that's a great one, yeah.

185
00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:08.698
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; I guess talking about technical,

186
00:11:08.698 --> 00:11:13.448
anytime I do have to talk about
something technical to somebody that

187
00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:17.048
might not be as technical
might not be an engineer.

188
00:11:17.048 --> 00:11:21.876
Being able to talk in analogies or
be able to talk about.

189
00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:25.865
Whatever that thing is without
totally getting in the weeds of

190
00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:30.708
why like [LAUGH] I think that's one of
my strengths, boy all my weaknesses.

191
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:34.294
Everything project management
thinking about, and

192
00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:37.487
I guess one of the things
it's thinking about.

193
00:11:37.487 --> 00:11:43.003
Things like, thinking binary about things
sometimes, thinking very black and

194
00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:47.141
white about things when there's
probably a middle ground,

195
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:51.860
everything's kind of a, so
it's one thing I kind of struggle with.

196
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.292
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I call it the Star Trek,
really good at using analogies.

197
00:11:57.292 --> 00:12:01.706
The captain, if the engines to
this it will be something which,

198
00:12:01.706 --> 00:12:07.043
you don't realize it but it is something
really powerful to explain things.

199
00:12:07.043 --> 00:12:09.680
I like that you called that out.

200
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.352
So I know there's an episode on Star Trek,

201
00:12:13.352 --> 00:12:19.070
they made this constraint that
only uses an algae to communicate.

202
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.187
Anybody who knows what I'm
talking about will be like, yeah,

203
00:12:21.187 --> 00:12:22.040
I've seen that episode.

204
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.617
Anyway, sorry, I'm just Star Trek
nerding out a little bit.

205
00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:29.669
Next generation,
we'll see we're gonna get out.

206
00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:34.069
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Of Star Trek nerd.

207
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:38.136
So for for those you answered and
not everybody has to answer.

208
00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:39.389
There's a question here.

209
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:44.142
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a couple in the chat here.

210
00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:47.262
Conflict avoidance has been something
that's been a thorn in my side

211
00:12:47.262 --> 00:12:47.867
in the past.

212
00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:51.601
That was just in comment to
a couple of the others there.

213
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:53.690
For me, it's a combination of impatience.

214
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.064
It's faster if I just do it myself,
but I love helping people and

215
00:12:58.064 --> 00:13:01.143
freeing them of work
that they may not enjoy.

216
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.526
A strength for me is being
a strong advocate for my team and

217
00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:12.900
providing support under
difficult circumstances.

218
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:19.914
I've often gotten the feedback
that I've spoken out for

219
00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:24.160
my team when it's been critical.

220
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.722
And a lot of comments back and
forth to each other.

221
00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:32.640
Let your engineers solve their problems.

222
00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:39.868
And, Democ is the name of the episode.

223
00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:42.479
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Democ, thank you.

224
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:46.121
&gt;&gt; And Mark do you have some?

225
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:46.808
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

226
00:13:46.808 --> 00:13:49.564
The only thing rolling through my head is,

227
00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:53.785
there's kind of like a wartime
leader versus peacetime leader.

228
00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:58.059
And I realize that I'm extremely
good at a peacetime leader,

229
00:13:58.059 --> 00:14:02.004
and I've had to learn through
what the world went through

230
00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:06.294
about becoming more of a time
later in that the world changed.

231
00:14:06.294 --> 00:14:11.540
And so now how do we as an organization,
how do we run towards the change and

232
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.501
address it rather than shrinking back and

233
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:17.899
being like well now we
can't record in person.

234
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:21.094
So now we're just hamstrung, so,

235
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:25.360
yeah I had to learn that
how to dig deep and like.

236
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.520
Listen to customers, see what's going
on and really kind of like have us

237
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.608
all go towards that strongly instead
of like shrinking back, I guess.

238
00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:40.606
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I love that wartime versus peacetime.

239
00:14:40.606 --> 00:14:45.400
And I think we were discussing this
yesterday, but remote work and COVID.

240
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.130
Exposed a lot of weaknesses in managers.

241
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.829
We probably didn't know we're there.

242
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:53.771
Fortunately I became a manager during
this time, but if your strength is,

243
00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:56.712
I can sit you down face to face and
have a conversation and

244
00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:58.540
understand what you're saying.

245
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.062
And then all of a sudden that's gone, and

246
00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:04.029
you need to rely on your
written communication.

247
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:06.310
Yeah, you had it tough.

248
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.567
I think a lot of people leaders did.

249
00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:12.429
Hopefully we're all better for
that, but your strengths and

250
00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:14.530
weaknesses are gonna
vary from time to time.

251
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.471
And over time, sometimes what in my case,

252
00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:20.833
verbal communication can
be a weakness as well.

253
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:24.620
Sometimes it's a strength,
it all really depends.

254
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.290
We won't go through the rest of these.

255
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:31.151
These are more personal to you,
but, one thank you all for sharing.

256
00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:34.326
It takes a lot of courage to
share things you're not good at.

257
00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:37.699
I think as a leader an important
skill is just being vulnerable and

258
00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:39.120
being candid with people.

259
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.544
I tell my team that all
the time things I'm like, hey,

260
00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:44.989
I'm really not good at this and
I'm trying to get better, and that's okay.

261
00:15:44.989 --> 00:15:49.724
I think trying to try not cover those up,
just makes it worse.

262
00:15:49.724 --> 00:15:53.450
You're just doing yourself a disservice,
so thanks for sharing.
