00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:03.019
The truth is, it doesn't matter
if you're accidentally a manager,

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:05.193
it doesn't matter if you're
deliberately a manager.

3
00:00:05.193 --> 00:00:07.473
You're gonna have to learn new skills.

4
00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:10.378
It's better to be deliberate cuz
you can build those up over time.

5
00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:16.478
But either way, you're gonna

6
00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:21.642
arrive at the same place.

7
00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:24.652
I'm trying to think for me, what was it?

8
00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:27.334
I tried rock climbing,
the first time the other day.

9
00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:28.497
I was like, how hard can it be?

10
00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:31.704
I work out, I go to the gym,
how hard can it be?

11
00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:34.091
And I'm tall,
I have the extra advantage of doing that.

12
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:38.006
And I got up there, I think I muscled my
way up instead of using technique and

13
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.386
then halfway up, I'm like, I'm so tired.

14
00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:42.356
Like, why are my arms are so tired?

15
00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:44.788
And I like it, though, it was fine.

16
00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:47.075
But that was a new skill for me.

17
00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:49.058
And it's good to push yourself.

18
00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:50.766
Being a manager,
you're gonna learn new skills.

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.586
You're gonna learn things you probably
didn't think you had to know,

20
00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.413
things that are important,
things you thought were important or not.

21
00:00:56.413 --> 00:01:00.166
And that's part of the purpose of this
course, is to show you there's a lot more

22
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.644
stuff out there that you
probably never thought of.

23
00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:07.591
And it's good to maybe
focus on some of those.

24
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.229
And we look at how you learn.

25
00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.392
We start with unconsciously incompetent,
aka, you don't know what you don't know.

26
00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:19.086
And that's a lot of what
I'm trying to convey today,

27
00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:23.600
is I want you to know,
to move you into consciously incompetent,

28
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.235
to know what you don't know,
and that's fine too.

29
00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.449
I don't prefer to wallow in ignorance.

30
00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:31.979
I'd rather know what I don't know.

31
00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.515
But assuming that I know,
there's stuff I know,

32
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:40.067
everything that I don't know,
no, I learn stuff all the time.

33
00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.564
Hopefully, when you get good,
you move into consciously competent,

34
00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.002
knowing the things I'm not as great at,
things I need to focus on, but

35
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:50.176
things I am good at that I can learn,
that I can lean on to help me.

36
00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.573
I can become more conscious about using
those skills or building them up.

37
00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:57.221
And then over time,
you become unconsciously competent.

38
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.417
You're good without knowing it.

39
00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:01.529
Just like coding, if I said,
every one of you, I'd say, hey,

40
00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.354
file for terminal,
create a new create a new program, and

41
00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:07.717
then I want you to execute something
that's prints out Hello World.

42
00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:10.391
You all could do that and
you won't even think about it.

43
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:15.630
That's unconsciously competent,
for us, if I pulled someone random

44
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.408
from the street and said, hey, can you
fire up a shell and do all these things?

45
00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.496
They be like, what's a shell?

46
00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:27.020
It's skills you build up over
time you don't think about.

47
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.078
Again, the analogy to parenting is,
you don't think about walking.

48
00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:34.555
You don't think consciously about every
step you take, left, right, left, right.

49
00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:35.198
You just do it.

50
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:37.557
It's just muscle memory.

51
00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.826
And that's where you really
wanna get in any skill building.

52
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.873
It's just, you don't think
about how difficult it was.

53
00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:46.059
But never remember there's people, all the
way, who don't know what they don't know.

54
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.618
It's always important to remember that.

55
00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:51.021
Question.

56
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:56.870
&gt;&gt; There's a question in chat about,
are there companies

57
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.347
that at least give some type
of management courses or

58
00:03:02.347 --> 00:03:08.956
path to going from independent
to contributor to management.

59
00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:13.181
I don't know if management classes
are a good way to start, but

60
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.948
it seems like it would be.

61
00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:16.868
&gt;&gt; Generally, the bigger the company,

62
00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.992
the more likely they're gonna
have those resources for you.

63
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.468
To be fair,
I'm not knocking smaller companies.

64
00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:26.427
If you're less than, say,
I don't know, a thousand engineers,

65
00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:31.370
maybe even smaller, you probably aren't
gonna have a dedicated training course.

66
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.186
Cuz there's just not that many engineering
management roles that you wanna dedicate

67
00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:35.095
enough time to doing that.

68
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.887
But generally,
larger companies, Google, Meta,

69
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:42.016
Dropbox is a pretty good career framework.

70
00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:45.004
Some companies feel they invest in that,
some companies don't.

71
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:48.192
And I don't have a comprehensive
list of all them.

72
00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:52.802
But it's something to ask about when
you're thinking about this role transition

73
00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:54.556
is, what's available to me?

74
00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:57.516
Or if you wanna switch companies and you
say, remember that previous exercise we

75
00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:00.231
talked about what's your five-year goal,
what's your ten year goal?

76
00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:02.887
When you're switching companies,
ask about that.

77
00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:05.113
What are your career paths?

78
00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.707
How often do people make this transition?

79
00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:10.607
Or, do you only hire people outside
to become engineering managers?

80
00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:12.232
You probably don't think about that,
I didn't.

81
00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.988
I always thought about, like,
how much you pay me, what's the language,

82
00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.352
maybe what's the domain.

83
00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:19.754
You don't think about, like, hey,
five years out, where do I wanna be.

84
00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:26.267
Any questions so far, thoughts?

85
00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:37.114
&gt;&gt; Jim,
how many engineers do you manage and

86
00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:41.435
how many people do you
feel like is unmanageable?

87
00:04:41.435 --> 00:04:44.277
&gt;&gt; Is there a slide on that?

88
00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:49.354
I would slide a little bit further down on
team size, but right now I manage eight.

89
00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:51.550
Which is a good size?

90
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.839
I think, about 6 to 10,
maybe 6 to 12, maybe,

91
00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.774
if you know what you're doing,
is a good size.

92
00:04:57.774 --> 00:05:01.630
If you're at 20,
it's really difficult to manage 20 people.

93
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.770
That's a lot of competing priorities.

94
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.905
You're spending a lot of
your weekend one-on-ones,

95
00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:09.913
most of the time in one-on-ones.

96
00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:11.253
Team meetings just aren't effective.

97
00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:14.165
You ever had a big group of people
try to reach consensus on anything?

98
00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:15.420
It's never gonna happen.

99
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.147
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

100
00:05:16.147 --> 00:05:19.140
&gt;&gt; If we took all of you and said like,
hey, what do we want for lunch?

101
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.249
We might be able to reach
consensus after some debates.

102
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.230
But the larger the team,
the harder it is to pick a firm direction.

103
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.405
Yeah, Ryan.

104
00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.243
&gt;&gt; This came up earlier in the chat,
too, that I think is helpful.

105
00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:38.353
Is, it also depends on the level of
engineers that you're managing, too.

106
00:05:38.353 --> 00:05:41.049
I think the most I've ever
had is 18 at one time.

107
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.208
And it was a lot, but
they were all very senior engineers.

108
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:48.580
And so that does help and you can rely on
them a little bit to do certain things,

109
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.574
maybe lead certain efforts that
you're not having to be involved in.

110
00:05:52.574 --> 00:05:57.722
What I found really difficult was actually
having less direct reports than that,

111
00:05:57.722 --> 00:06:01.393
but multiple teams that do
completely different things.

112
00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:04.691
And so you are in multiple team
meetings and you're thinking and

113
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:08.308
context switching on different
business goals and topics like that.

114
00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:11.905
So I think it really depends
on what you're doing and

115
00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.947
what the level of
engineers are on the team.

116
00:06:14.947 --> 00:06:18.777
&gt;&gt; Yeah, spoken like a senior manager.

117
00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:21.714
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; The answer is, a lot of stuff, it

118
00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:26.346
depends, just like as a senior engineer,
the answer to a lot of questions depends.

119
00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:29.227
For me personally, yeah,
I manage about eight people.

120
00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:30.861
Most of them are very, very senior.

121
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.500
I have one early career man or
software engineer, which is great too.

122
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.231
Totally different perspective, totally
different needs in how I show up for them.

123
00:06:40.231 --> 00:06:46.362
And my team is, it's kind of two teams.

124
00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:48.597
I guess I can do more background.

125
00:06:48.597 --> 00:06:52.049
So, I managed the web platform team for
Netflix.

126
00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:55.222
So netflix.com is actually
a collection of applications.

127
00:06:55.222 --> 00:06:59.029
And my team owns a platform that powers
all those applications that run on top

128
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.573
of those.

129
00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:03.717
Hence, there's a lot of teams that use
our products, other engineers, and

130
00:07:03.717 --> 00:07:05.898
there's a lot of things to keep in mind.

131
00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:09.013
But that's half my team,
half my team, very, very broad.

132
00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:15.373
We cover games, streaming,
signup, registration, etc.

133
00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:19.509
So, challenges there, really, really broad
and really deep on the technology stack.

134
00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.443
And then the other team I manage is
kind of the data abstraction team.

135
00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.371
For growth.

136
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:28.076
Essentially, growth is
kind of a non-member.

137
00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:31.437
If you're not a member of Netflix,
you need to log in, pay, pick a plan,

138
00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:32.587
all these other things.

139
00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:34.849
We manage all the data for
that side as well.

140
00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.340
So, totally different perspective, totally
different platforms we have to support.

141
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.389
And I do both with, not a lot of people.

142
00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.846
And we do that cuz they're very,
very talented.

143
00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:45.399
Very talented.

144
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:50.971
But it does mean I've stretched
a lot tactically and just timewise.

145
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:55.244
But the truth is like Ryan was saying,
every team is gonna be different.

146
00:07:55.244 --> 00:07:57.729
Every team is gonna have
its own challenges.

147
00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:59.318
When I first took on the role,
I complained about it.

148
00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:04.614
I'm like, I have a lot to do, and
I own a lot, but not enough people.

149
00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:06.408
But like,
you will learn that's always the case.

150
00:08:06.408 --> 00:08:09.618
You never have enough people.

151
00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:11.102
And there's nothing you can do about that.

152
00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:14.091
It's a business decision sometimes and
you just have to live with it.

153
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:17.654
And I managed and we've done really
well with the resource we have.

154
00:08:17.654 --> 00:08:21.135
We've excelled, and
I can look back and say that.

155
00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.768
But in the moment, I was just like,
there's so much to do, so much to learn.

156
00:08:24.768 --> 00:08:28.914
We own so many services and
systems and processes, etc.

157
00:08:28.914 --> 00:08:31.021
But I felt it wasn't super helpful.

158
00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:33.071
It wasn't getting us anywhere,
me complaining about it.

159
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:37.649
So I just accepted it and moved on,
and we're doing really well now.

160
00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:40.329
But we still own too much,
[LAUGH] in my opinion.
