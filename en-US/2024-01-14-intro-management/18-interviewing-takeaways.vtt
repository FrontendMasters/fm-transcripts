00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:03.692
So after the interview and
the takeaways from that last section,

2
00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:08.199
the one takeaway is, there's many skills
that are required to be a good leader,

3
00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.082
you won't be good at all of them.

4
00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:13.840
It's better to accept that and then try
to work on things than try to be good at

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.848
everything, it's just not possible.

6
00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.575
I'd say, so number 1, be kind to yourself.

7
00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:23.862
You should build up skills at events,

8
00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.187
it will make the transition
to management a lot easier.

9
00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:29.095
Do when you can, but

10
00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:34.723
I'd say you definitely should
just get advice all around.

11
00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:37.348
Take advantage of opportunities
whether internal,

12
00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:41.957
if there's opportunities to move, whether
it's mentoring opportunities, whether it's

13
00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:46.117
opportunities to talk to other managers,
take every opportunity you can to learn.

14
00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:50.341
And like we said earlier, a lot of stuff
is luck, a lot of life is luck, and

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.787
where you end up is luck.

16
00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:55.567
It's about how you leverage those
opportunities and take advantage of them

17
00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:59.464
is the difference between people that
are successful and people that are not as

18
00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:03.028
successful, just moving quickly and
knowing when to take advantage.

19
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.187
And the interview is
a measure of your potential.

20
00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:11.712
As a software engineer, that first
interview, speak to what you know,

21
00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:17.066
speak to your experience, but understand,
the interviewer understands this too.

22
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:21.624
You've never actually done it, so
you're probably more ambitious and

23
00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:26.110
speak highly about your philosophy and
thinking scenarios are clean,

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.816
there's clean ways of solving problems.

25
00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:30.291
And that's fine.

26
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:33.544
When I interviewed for
my role and reflecting back in,

27
00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:37.019
I joke with my manager now who
interviewed me for the role.

28
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.336
And he's like, yeah, you had no idea
what you were talking about, but

29
00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:43.062
you had good intent and
you had some experience to lean on.

30
00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:46.880
But the truth is, where you are and
what you were talking about then is very

31
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.478
different, my philosophies
are different too.

32
00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:50.340
And that's fine.

33
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.412
Just recognize that going in,
as they're measuring your potential,

34
00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.210
not what you actually know in the moment.
