00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.439
So this is for you personally,
we don't have to do it together,

2
00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:07.276
but what's your role
in all these meetings?

3
00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:08.800
Are you the owner of the stand-up?

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.869
Are you producing information?

5
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.018
Who is the consumer?

6
00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:14.365
Who are you producing
this information for?

7
00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.207
If you're consuming information,
you're getting status updates,

8
00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:18.730
who's producing that information?

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.840
There's one of these things I
promise if you walk through this,

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.370
you will think a lot differently about
your meetings, about what's important.

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.290
Who am I talking to?

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.350
Who am I getting information from?

13
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.094
How should I behave in these meetings?

14
00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:35.350
We talked about showing up with no agenda.

15
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.075
Do you run meetings and
you don't have an agenda?

16
00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:38.761
Or do you just wing it?

17
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.445
Hey, what do you all
wanna talk about today?

18
00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.430
Is that a good use of time?

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.742
Probably not, so if you're the owner and
you don't have an agenda, I don't know,

20
00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:49.162
something to think about.

21
00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:53.343
But I highly encourage everybody to take
some time whenever you can to walk through

22
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:55.231
the roles and purposes of meetings.

23
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.540
And think about your role.

24
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.877
I'll say for a team meeting,
my role is to run the team meeting but

25
00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:06.490
I don't want to be the one
talking all the time.

26
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.070
That happens a lot because I'm on
introverted team and I like to talk.

27
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120
My ideal team meeting is the team
is talking to each other.

28
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.616
I'm just moving people along or
keeping the conversation's time box so

29
00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.000
we can get to all the topics.

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.110
But that doesn't always happen,
I would like it to.

31
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.260
Just something for me to work on myself.

32
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.909
So, to recap the last section,
what do engineering managers do?

33
00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.880
It depends, but people are always at
the center and you can't ever forget that.

34
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.844
Take advantage of every meeting,
cuz you're getting something,

35
00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:43.650
you're delivering data, you're sharing
data, it's used for morale and culture.

36
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.370
But every meeting has a purpose, and
if it doesn't, and you don't feel it,

37
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.180
don't attend.

38
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.976
I tell this to my team all the time, if
you're not getting value out of a meeting,

39
00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.670
you don't think you should be there,
don't attend, let's talk about it.

40
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.289
Don't waste your time,
don't just be a seat or

41
00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.179
head on the screen if you don't need to
be there, I believe strongly in that.

42
00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.489
And you have to manage your time,
there's more problems to solve and

43
00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.844
more things to do than you
have hours in the week.

44
00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:12.517
Otherwise, you end up working 60
hours a week and you're like, shit,

45
00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:14.923
10 more hours to work,
and that's not healthy.

46
00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:20.888
Get it done in 40, and
if you can't, re-prioritize.

47
00:02:20.888 --> 00:02:23.143
And that's the truth of what
engineering managers do.
