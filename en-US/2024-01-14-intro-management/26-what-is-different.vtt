1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.910
So let's talk about surviving
engineering management.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.920
You've made this transition,
you've figured out the career ladder,

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.775
you figure out you wanna be intentional,
or you're accidentally a manager,

4
00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.085
and you're like I'm struggling.

5
00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:15.145
Let's talk about your first 30 days,
we'll talk about mistakes to avoid,

6
00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:19.222
mistakes I've made, and
talk about managing up a little bit.

7
00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:24.290
In your first 30 days of being a manager,
what's different?

8
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.280
Your perspectives is different, it's not
immediate, but it happens really slowly.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.255
You realize, hey,
we're part of a business, my team is one,

10
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.080
team out of many, many teams.

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.683
I'm one manager out of many, many
managers, and my manager has a manager,

12
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:42.010
and they have a manager and
you start looking up.

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.249
I think the different perspective for
me came in terms of the org chart,

14
00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.447
where as a software engineer, I didn't
care about the organization chart,

15
00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:53.470
like where the team sit, who they report
to, which vertical or domain they're in.

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.080
Now, it's really important cuz I need to
know which manager I need to talk to.

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.770
You'll hear names and teams, and
you're like, what do they do?

18
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.075
I need to know that pretty quickly,
so I had the org chart bookmarked so

19
00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.820
I know who people are talking about.

20
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.284
My favorite perspective is staff meetings
where managers talk to other managers or

21
00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:17.483
directors and things like that, and
you're like, what goes on in those?

22
00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:19.347
It's really not that interesting,

23
00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:23.140
[LAUGH] there's no great secrets
you uncover in staff meetings.

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.570
To me it was always a great mystery,
I was like, what do managers talk about?

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.770
And usually it's boring stuff,
things like,

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.576
hey, I'm hiring soon, do you all
know anybody who can fill this role?

27
00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:38.028
My manager would be like, hey,
this deadline is coming up to our open

28
00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:41.777
enrollment, make sure you talk to your
team about make sure they get help,

29
00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:43.046
sign up for healthcare.

30
00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:48.434
It's a lot of boring stuff like that,
it's not usually that spicy or exciting.

31
00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:52.877
I was a little disappointed, honestly,
I thought this is gonna be like,

32
00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:57.410
I'm in the inner circle, but
it's really not that exciting, all right?

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.430
A fun one was, you don't know how much
money everybody makes on your team.

34
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.255
Doesn't really change anything,
you're like, interesting,

35
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:10.870
but it's just an interesting
thing that you can look up now.

36
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.347
Just a different perspective on how
much everybody is getting paid, and

37
00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:17.995
chances are it's gonna be different,
it's probably gonna surprise you.

38
00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:22.565
You don't have to do anything about it,
but just something you know.

39
00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.079
Another one is your calendar is all
meetings now, it starts off slowly,

40
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.419
your manager's probably gonna add
a bunch of calendars, invites,

41
00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.180
your job now is to set up one-on-ones,
your job's to set up team meetings.

42
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.852
Your job is to meet with partners and

43
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:37.490
stakeholders, now the calendar
is slowly filling up.

44
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.270
But your perspective on kind of what your
role is, what everybody on team is doing.

45
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.768
What you should be doing is just totally
different now in your first 30 days,

46
00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:48.800
then the longer you go on,
the more it shifts and shifts and shifts.

47
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.939
Anybody who's made the transition to speak
accurately to your prospective change?

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.288
&gt;&gt; Yes, although, I think we're in
the midst of doing year-end reviews,

49
00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:06.008
and it came to my attention that
some folks don't have access to how

50
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:08.566
much everyone makes which was odd.

51
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.478
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

52
00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:16.835
&gt;&gt; I would add to being in meetings
where you're creating policies,

53
00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:20.384
it's boring but it's fascinating [LAUGH].

54
00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:22.079
&gt;&gt; To add on to that, you're in it,

55
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.785
you're added to a lot of meetings cuz
you're now the leader of the team.

56
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.961
And you have no idea what's going on,

57
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:33.280
cuz you have no idea what they're
talking about, you're just like, yeah.

58
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.473
People might ask stuff of you and you're
like, let me get back to you on that,

59
00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:38.700
there's a lot of stuff you don't know.

60
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.691
Because as a manager things just takes
longer to enact, there's projects in place

61
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:48.325
that were already happening that you
weren't aware of, and now you are, and

62
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.800
it's probably towards the end or
in the middle.

63
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.230
There could be big announcements coming,
like a reorganization or

64
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.780
maybe they're discussing someone,
maybe is on a performance plan,

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.140
that usually doesn't
happen at staff level.

66
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.938
But maybe they're thinking about creating
another team and hiring another manager,

67
00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:10.339
you now know all this stuff and you're
just like, trying to filter out what

68
00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:14.434
you need to know what's important and
what you can probably backburner.

69
00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.571
It's tricky, it's something you
have to adapt really quickly.

70
00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:25.940
At a team level, what's different is your
managers now one level up, generally.

71
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.621
So that means the things they talk
about in the context of shares,

72
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:29.610
it's very different.

73
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.613
When you're just dealing
with your manager,

74
00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:38.702
they have a particular experience or
context they wanna share a perspective.

75
00:04:38.702 --> 00:04:42.134
Now your managers is one level up,
the way they talk about things,

76
00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:44.850
their priorities are very
different at this level.

77
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.181
The way they think about strategy is
very different cuz they have a bunch of

78
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:51.900
other managers and teams reporting to
them, not just individual contributors.

79
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.586
And we talked about meetings, now you're
responsible for these meetings now,

80
00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:59.080
you should set up one
on ones with your team.

81
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.355
You should do that within the first week,
find out what's going on,

82
00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:03.890
find out how they're feeling.

83
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.665
And your team, we call your first team,

84
00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:11.840
those are actually other managers
who report to another manager.

85
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.560
So you need to befriend them and
find out what they're working on.

86
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.435
Sometimes there's things you can't be
friends all the time with your team,

87
00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:23.426
I think you should if you can
figure out how to make that work,

88
00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:24.790
but sometimes you can't.

89
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.507
And that's okay, I don't force it, but you
should make friends, [LAUGH] it's a lonely

90
00:05:29.507 --> 00:05:34.300
job, and it only gets lonely if you don't
have any friends or people to talk to.

91
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.320
So those peer managers
become really important,

92
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.649
probably teams you'd never even cared
about four now you should care about them.

93
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.247
And another thing that's different,
especially if you're taking over

94
00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:48.230
the team of people you knew or
worked with, it's a weird feeling.

95
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.410
It's weird cuz one Friday you're
a software engineer on the team,

96
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.730
it's a regular person,
the next you're now a manager.

97
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.499
And nothing's changed, but kind of
everything's changed at the same time.

98
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.410
And it's a weird feeling, and
it takes time to get over,

99
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.037
especially if you're transitioning for
people who knew you before and

100
00:06:07.037 --> 00:06:11.190
now you're a manager, cuz you're like,
are they expecting more of me?

101
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.635
Should I dress differently,
should I wear button downs now,

102
00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:15.900
should I roll up my sleeves
to show how hard I'm working?

103
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.680
It's a different feeling
in the first 30 days.
