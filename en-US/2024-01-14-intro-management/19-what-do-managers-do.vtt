00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.520
Let's talk about [LAUGH]
what do managers do?

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.967
The most common question, do you have
a good idea what your manager does?

3
00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:12.615
Probably not, maybe you do.

4
00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.797
So maybe you have some inkling,
you might see the output that they do but

5
00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:19.365
you're not in one on ones,
you're not in the staff meetings.

6
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:22.395
You don't actually know what
they're talking about in all these.

7
00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:25.796
So let me shed some light on like
this hidden world of management and

8
00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.205
what actually is going on.

9
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.785
So what do managers do?

10
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.430
The answer is it depends, the good answer.

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.305
As a engineering manager at a startup,
I might spend more of my time coding and

12
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:39.910
hiring.

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.116
I'm trying to build up the team and

14
00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:43.410
I'm coding because I don't have
a lot of partners to talk to you.

15
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.404
At a midsize company, you're probably
not hiring as many senior engineers,

16
00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:54.200
because senior engineers tend
to go maybe bigger salaries.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.220
So maybe as midsize company,
you're trying to grow quickly.

18
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.220
But you still need kind of the junior or
maybe mid-career software engineers.

19
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.840
So you probably spend
a lot of time mentoring.

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.793
And you might be doing a lot of project
management at this stage because

21
00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:11.960
the people on your team aren't quite
senior enough to do that themselves.

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.392
And of course, if you're an engineering
manager at a FAANG company,

23
00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.260
you spend most of your time chilling.

24
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.110
And eating the free
food as I do every day.

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.480
The truth is, your role will change
from day to day, from week to week.

26
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.990
We talked about all these
different roles you play.

27
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.542
A lot of that varies on the company,
the size of the team,

28
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:39.050
the experience of the team,
the relation of the team to the business.

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.936
Are you in a part of the business
that's really important right now,

30
00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:42.897
has a lot of eyes on it?

31
00:01:42.897 --> 00:01:45.867
Or are you in more of a keep
the lights on part of the business,

32
00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.220
just keep things running?

33
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.520
The size of the company
changes what you do.

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.837
An enterprise company, you're gonna be
talking, having a lot more meetings,

35
00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:56.210
talking to a lot more partners.

36
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.891
A smaller company, if you're a company of,
I don't know, 20, 30.

37
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.148
You're probably gonna spend a lot
more time coding cuz you have that

38
00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:03.990
opportunity to do that.

39
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.370
There's not as much pressure to
deliver things as a manager.

40
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.190
And then the role of the team,
are you a product team?

41
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.270
Do you build things directly for
customers to utilize?

42
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.103
Are you like me, I run a platform team,

43
00:02:19.103 --> 00:02:23.350
where my customers are actually other
engineers who work at the company.

44
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.690
And having that perspective on who's
your users, who's your customers,

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.180
is gonna change.

46
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.470
And that can be in the same company,
you can play different roles.

47
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.940
So the answer is what do managers do?

48
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.670
A lot of it depends.

49
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.619
And you have to understand all
these things going into a role, and

50
00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:38.760
take all these factors into account.

51
00:02:41.803 --> 00:02:44.414
So the better question is,
at a high level,

52
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:50.040
because the specifics are gonna vary, what
are engineering managers responsible for?

53
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.770
That's a little bit more generic.

54
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.660
In general, engineering management is one
side engineering, one side management.

55
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.630
In the beginning and
in the middle are people.

56
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.924
It's always about people, but the way that
shows up is going to be on the technical

57
00:03:04.924 --> 00:03:08.520
side, the engineering side, and
on the business and management side.

58
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.620
But everything you do is gonna
be in favor of the business.

59
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.130
This is an uncomfortable truth.

60
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.150
It means sometimes you
can't make people happy.

61
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.270
You can't pay them enough.

62
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.020
Because the business says you can't pay
them enough, you can't pay them more.

63
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.938
They wanna move to a bigger role or
a different title,

64
00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:31.340
and you can't do that cuz there's
no room for them in the business.

65
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.826
There's no room in the budget, or

66
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.300
maybe your manager doesn't
feel that's appropriate.

67
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.854
So that's the challenging part of
engineering management is keeping people

68
00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:42.357
happy and
balancing all these different priorities.

69
00:03:42.357 --> 00:03:46.139
But at the end of the day, the business
pays you to do something and it pays you

70
00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.707
to operate the team efficiently and
that's what you have to remember.

71
00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:54.218
But your team is made of people and
they don't care about the business as much

72
00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:56.981
that's your job and
that's my job right now.

73
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:58.626
They shouldn't have to care.

74
00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:02.600
And if I'm saying like, man, Jem, these
are a lot of contrasting perspectives.

75
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.760
Yeah, [LAUGH] that's what you do, though.

76
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.830
That's the challenge of
engineering management.

77
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.749
But this chart at a high level is
exactly what you're responsible for,

78
00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.130
everything in between.

79
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.731
And the fun thing is,
this doesn't change as you move up,

80
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:20.800
if you become senior manager,
director, VP.

81
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.563
It's always engineering, the technology,
and there's always the business and

82
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:27.370
management side, and
there's always people in the middle.

83
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.426
The amount of people,
your relation to the technology,

84
00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:34.961
your relation to the business change, but
it always looks like this no matter what.

85
00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:40.400
Any thoughts or perspectives on this one?

86
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.643
&gt;&gt; I would say that this is
something that I kind of noticed as

87
00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:46.540
I got into engineering management.

88
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.201
Whereas when I was just an engineer,
it kind of felt very, well,

89
00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:55.625
if management would just do this,
well, [LAUGH] there's a lot more

90
00:04:55.625 --> 00:05:00.220
contrasting concerns and
desires that you maybe weren't aware of.

91
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.799
And therefore, your manager is in a,
yeah, has a lot more competing interests

92
00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.914
that they have to worry about,
that you're not aware of, so.

93
00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:11.130
&gt;&gt; That's a good perspective.

94
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.150
Yeah, I was probably that person, too,
[LAUGH] the pointing out of things.

95
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.800
Why don't we do this,
why don't we do that?

96
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.514
And, for
my sins now I'm an engineering manager and

97
00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.411
I understand there's a lot more competing
priorities that I was aware of.

98
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:26.556
And I didn't have to be aware of.

99
00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:29.356
I had a good manager who
shielded me from that, but

100
00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:32.570
there's no shield when you're
a manager at this level.
