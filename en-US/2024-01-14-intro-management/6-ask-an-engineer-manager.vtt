00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:04.888
So now, we're gonna segment to
an area called Ask a manager.

2
00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:08.116
And we're gonna interview a more
senior manager, Ryan, and

3
00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.040
talk about his path into how did he get
into management or his motivations.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.180
Let's hear from a real experienced manager
who's been doing this for over ten years,

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.925
Ryan Burgess.

6
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:22.464
So, Ryan, how did you get into management?

7
00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:25.349
I feel like, Jem, you talked about
how you got into management.

8
00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.007
I feel like you had a more thoughtful
approach on it, than I did.

9
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.272
I did think about it in my career as,

10
00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:37.090
maybe that's a possibility at some point
in time, but it wasn't super thoughtful.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.759
It was me showing up one day, being
a frontend lead engineer on the team and

12
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:48.794
showing up the one-day going, being told
you are now the leader of this team,

13
00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:51.281
you are now managing everyone.

14
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:56.650
A leader had left the company that day and
now I was the new manager.

15
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.201
So I was thrown right into it.

16
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.424
I didn't know really what
to do at that time and

17
00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:02.592
it was a little bit
different of experience.

18
00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:05.852
I wish I had a little more
thoughtful of approach.

19
00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:09.930
&gt;&gt; It's a common story for
a lot of engineering managers,

20
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.939
the accidental approach.

21
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.543
So I guess since you're kind of
more of a accidentally get into it,

22
00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.938
were there any motivations then?

23
00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:21.427
And what are your motivations now?

24
00:01:21.427 --> 00:01:25.277
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think like even my
motivations then, I'd had a taste for

25
00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:27.312
it as being more of a lead, right?

26
00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:32.778
I was still coding and I was still maybe
thinking more broadly about the deep

27
00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:38.267
technical things, but definitely was
dealing more with people at times.

28
00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:42.494
And I think even in other work that I'd
done prior to being at the startup,

29
00:01:42.494 --> 00:01:46.464
I was working at agencies,
where I was working with a lot of clients.

30
00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:49.722
And I started to get this taste
of how to deal with people more,

31
00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:51.736
and so I started to really enjoy that.

32
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.351
And so my motivation then was, yeah,
it seems like a great challenge.

33
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.498
And I don't think my
motivation today has changed.

34
00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:03.628
Like you said, it's not the money,
it's not all the prestige.

35
00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:05.966
I don't get those types of things.

36
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:10.516
It's more that I enjoy dealing with
some of the people challenges and

37
00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:13.659
thinking more strategic
at that higher level.

38
00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.315
You give up the coding though, which is
always something that I've struggled with

39
00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:22.657
because that's what I started in this
industry for is I love to build things.

40
00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:25.088
And so you're building things
in a little bit different way.

41
00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:27.864
You're playing a different role,
like you said.

42
00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:29.815
&gt;&gt; I like that perspective of
you're still building things.

43
00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.623
You're just not writing
code directly anymore.

44
00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:37.435
How was becoming a manager change
your view of technology in general?

45
00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:40.180
You talked a little bit about that,
but it has it changed at all?

46
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.546
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely has.

47
00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.901
You kind of make me think
back to being an engineer.

48
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:49.323
I cared a lot about, yeah,
maybe it was tabs versus spaces or

49
00:02:49.323 --> 00:02:54.724
cared really about certain frameworks or
tools that made my life easier.

50
00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:59.001
And you'd have those debates and
conversations with other engineers,

51
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.869
and it was really always interesting
to have those discussions.

52
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:06.662
I still enjoy those as a manager,
but less so.

53
00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:11.258
I'm thinking more about, all right,
cool that is a cool new framework, but

54
00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.953
should we invest in that,
what does that get us in the future?

55
00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:16.633
What's the cost to migrate that?

56
00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:20.364
What are the pain points that we're
currently facing that makes us want to

57
00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:21.092
move to that?

58
00:03:21.092 --> 00:03:24.714
It's not just, yeah, that would be really
cool if we moved to that new framework and

59
00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:26.152
every other company is doing it.

60
00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:28.366
It's is it really valuable for us?

61
00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:31.849
My perspective has definitely
changed in my thinking around that.

62
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.126
It's more, yeah,
what's the impact to the business?

63
00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:38.304
What's the impact to our team and
what value are we getting out of it?

64
00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:41.302
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that,
thinking about the impact.

65
00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:42.582
All right, thank you, Ryan.

66
00:03:42.582 --> 00:03:46.840
Thanks for providing your more
senior experience, but yeah.

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jem.
