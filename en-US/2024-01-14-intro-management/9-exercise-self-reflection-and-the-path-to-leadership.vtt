1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
So we're gonna dive into this exercise for
a bit.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.727
We won't take the full time cuz it'll
probably take a full 30 minutes.

3
00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:07.800
But I wanna work through
some of the questions.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.303
And by the end of this exercise,

5
00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:12.660
I want you to have a better understanding
of what are your motivations?

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.410
What do you think will be challenges?

7
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.890
And consider this just
a personal reflection.

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.929
It'll help you down the road, whether or

9
00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.090
not you decide to move to management or
not.

10
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.450
Just good to stop and reflect.

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.120
So I'm gonna dive right in here.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.636
So purpose extras just ask
you open-ended questions, and

13
00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:32.684
you have to answer them yourself.

14
00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:34.418
Obviously, I can't help you here.

15
00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:37.831
But questions that I honestly
probably should have asked

16
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:40.602
myself before I made the jump,
I just did it and

17
00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:45.120
I didn't really think critically
about the path to management.

18
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.730
Because we've talked about
management is a really big change.

19
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.441
If you're a bad manager, and we've all
agreed we've all had bad managers,

20
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.670
they leave an impact on you and
maybe not in a good way.

21
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.702
And a good manager,
sometimes you don't even notice.

22
00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:01.630
You may have had actually a managers,
you've been lucky.

23
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.232
They probably haven't even realized
that cuz what they do is so subtle, but

24
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:08.457
at the end of the day you have a lot
of responsibilities as a manager.

25
00:01:08.457 --> 00:01:11.091
So it's really important
to understand yourself and

26
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.380
why you wanna be in this
particular position.

27
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660
There's some here's some starter
questions just for yourself.

28
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.111
Just, you don't have to answer it.

29
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.220
But just to think about critically.

30
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.080
About what are your career motivations?

31
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.350
What do you see yourself
doing in 5 to 10 years?

32
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.520
Things I hadn't really thought of.

33
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.817
Back when I was a software engineer, it
was just code, more code, code, more code,

34
00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:33.208
that's all that matters.

35
00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.061
But you end up where you point yourself,
and

36
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:41.990
it's good to have a direction of where you
want to take your career and your life.

37
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.980
And does being a manager
align with your career goals?

38
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.451
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but
we talked about it's not a promotion,

39
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:48.400
it's a role change.

40
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.430
You don't have to do it.

41
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.920
There's many paths and many roles in
technology and in software engineering.

42
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.310
And what kind of work do you enjoy
doing if you're a software engineer?

43
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.891
That work may change or maybe the project
leadership, the people leadership side,

44
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.930
it's actually work you enjoy
doing a little bit more.

45
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.330
Just some questions ask yourself.

46
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.720
So the first question
to ask you to answer.

47
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.220
You could write your answers down here.

48
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.079
Why do you want to become
an engineering manager?

49
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.342
This, when you get an interview and
you make this transition to a role,

50
00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:23.510
is the first question, or
one of the questions that will come up.

51
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.900
And people ask it different ways.

52
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.313
You'll probably get it different rounds,
but people wanna know,

53
00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:31.030
why do you wanna become
an engineering manager?

54
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.030
We talked earlier about those motivations
and the good motivations and bad.

55
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.479
Some of you need to work out for
yourself, but

56
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.550
a question you should ask yourself if
you do wanna make a transition, why?

57
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.040
Why do you wanna become
an engineering manager?

58
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.775
Then, when you're an engineering manager,

59
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:49.210
what do you think the biggest
challenge will be?

60
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.040
You're probably gonna be wrong
here [LAUGH] being honest.

61
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.433
The thing you think is hard
might be actually easy, and

62
00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:57.930
the thing you think is easy.

63
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.906
You probably haven't considered will
be one of the most difficult parts.

64
00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:08.825
And then ask yourself what aspects
are you most excited about?

65
00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:12.310
Remember that joy of delivering,
that joy of shipping,

66
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.896
the joy of closing bugs and checking
things off, won't be there as close.

67
00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.277
So in everything you've learned so far,

68
00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:21.938
what aspects are you
actually excited about?

69
00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:23.430
What are you most excited about?

70
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.400
What are you least excited about?

71
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.034
I'll tell you the thing
I'm least excited about.

72
00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:33.520
Party planning, social activities,
I'm an introvert.

73
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.990
I know it doesn't seem it, but I recharge
my battery by being by myself at home,

74
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.730
reading a book, playing a video game.

75
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.307
As a software engineer,
I got a lot of that time cuz I'm not

76
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:48.510
in meetings most of the time,
I'm heads-down coding.

77
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.628
But the social aspect's important,
so I have to put myself out there,

78
00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.580
it's a stretch for me.

79
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.810
And planning parties and planning social
events, happy hours, things like that.

80
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.718
Even to this day, I'm not thrilled about
doing, I do it because it's good for

81
00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:04.350
the team.

82
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.090
And I always enjoyed it in the day but

83
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.632
probably not something I was super
excited about coming to management.

84
00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:17.423
And then during the transition would,
knowing everything you know now about

85
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:21.640
the truth of software engineering,
what challenges do you anticipate?

86
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.735
We talked a lot about letting go code but
is there more to it than that?

87
00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:29.680
Is it you don't know how to write emails?

88
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.130
You gotta do that.

89
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.600
You gotta be able to write?

90
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.770
Is it public speaking?

91
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.476
You gotta run meetings now.

92
00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.807
We'll talk about the meanings
you're gonna run.

93
00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:43.730
But you have to do that, and
there's a lot of different challenges.

94
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.450
Some people, it depends on your strengths
and your things you're not so good at.

95
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.740
But what challenges do you anticipate
transitioning from an engineering manager

96
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.240
to an engineering manager?

97
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.006
And more importantly, during this
transition, who can you turn to for

98
00:04:59.006 --> 00:04:59.540
support?

99
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.235
Like I said, my first year was,
it was rough because I didn't think

100
00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:09.287
of turning to my friends who knew,
who were engineering managers, or

101
00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:13.610
even being honest with my manager
about the state of things.

102
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.432
So when you transition,

103
00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:17.090
it's really important to have a support
network cuz they will help you.

104
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.640
They can't do the work for you.

105
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.250
No one knows.

106
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.690
No one knows better than you.

107
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.459
But there's people you can people
that can empathize with you who

108
00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:24.830
have done this journey before.

109
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.533
So it's good to think of them now cuz
you'll need it later down the road.

110
00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:36.831
So, take some time during the next
break or the next day or two and

111
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:40.379
write down these answer these questions
and if you do become an engineering

112
00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.830
manager come back a year later and
look at these answers.

113
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.220
See how your perspective has changed,
maybe it hasn't.

114
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.850
See what you're right about,
see what you're wrong about.

115
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.077
But either way, if you have all these
answers, maybe by the end of it,

116
00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:54.538
it turns out you're like,
you know what, Jim,

117
00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:57.590
I don't wanna be a software
engineering manager.

118
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.619
I've answered all these
questions honestly, and

119
00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.020
what brings me joy is not the things
that I would get from being a manager.

120
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.360
Good, good, I hope that's the case.

121
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.033
I don't think it's good to
become a people leader or

122
00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.470
a manager if you're not
committed to doing it.

123
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.780
So it's totally fine.

124
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.145
By the end of this exercise,
you should have a good idea about,

125
00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:18.680
is management right for me?
