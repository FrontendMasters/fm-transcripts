00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.238
People are squishy,
people do not fit into a box,

2
00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:06.790
it doesn't matter what your
preconceived notions are.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.599
It doesn't matter what they look like even
you may have the same background as them,

4
00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.610
people are all different.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.589
You're gonna leave this course, you're
gonna walk outside or turn your house,

6
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.290
your apartment wherever you are.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.709
And your perspective is gonna change,
and who you are today,

8
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:27.440
right now, is going to be different
from the person you are tomorrow.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.958
And that's a really weird thing to think
about, is that people are not static,

10
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.060
people are squishy, and
you have to adjust that.

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.669
Even, for example,
in some of my one-on-ones,

12
00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:40.050
people show up differently
depending on their mood.

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.828
Some people are straight complaining,
I shouldn't say complaining,

14
00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:48.100
they have a lot of things to say,
a lot of gripes.

15
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.758
And I listen, I say, okay, they don't
need me to actually interject and

16
00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:54.920
do anything about it,
they just wanna get off their chest.

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.646
They feel better, and that's fine, we talk
about one of the roles is therapists,

18
00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.460
that's totally fine.

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.050
Some days people are just like projects,
they're heads down, they're focused.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.767
I'm just there to check in with them, and
all they wanna do is talk about work and

21
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.860
business, nothing personal.

22
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.660
And the same person can show up very
differently throughout the week too.

23
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.792
Because when they leave and
they step away from the computer,

24
00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:15.860
life happens all around them.

25
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.380
And that's what's tricky about engineering
management and people leadership.

26
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.324
The code doesn't change,
that's what's beautiful about code,

27
00:01:23.324 --> 00:01:24.980
it doesn't change unless you do something.

28
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.052
Humans change by default, and that's
just something you have to recognize,

29
00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:30.730
and you have to adapt yourself.

30
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.233
So when people say, Jim, I wanna become
an engineering manager, I'm always like,

31
00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:36.760
are you sure?

32
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.630
Really?

33
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.320
Even after listening to all this, you
really wanna be an engineering manager?

34
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.300
It is fulfilling, it is rewarding in
a way that is very difficult to describe.

35
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.625
But it's a difficult job, there's
a lot you have to take into account.

36
00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.210
So again, you don't have to become
an engineering manager to advance your

37
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.918
career, there's many ways of doing that.

38
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.230
If you do it and
you come back to software engineering,

39
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.810
you'll be a better software engineer,
that's the truth.

40
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.588
But if you're not prepared,
your motivations aren't there, you don't

41
00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:13.190
understand the realities of software
engineering management, don't do it.

42
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.700
No one wants a miserable software or
manager.

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.750
Do I wanna talk to my boss?

44
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.873
They're like, [SOUND] hey, how's your day?

45
00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:24.249
[SOUND] These people,

46
00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.254
things keep changing or just absent.

47
00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:33.997
Hey, I'm doing this, cool.

48
00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:37.368
You wanna be engaged,
you wanna be there for your team.

49
00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:39.953
So you really make sure,
if you wanna become a manager,

50
00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.280
make sure you're certain.

51
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.935
Make sure you're aware of all of these
things that you have to take into account,

52
00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:45.490
question?

53
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.260
&gt;&gt; Just a comment here in chat.

54
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.058
Shifting your mindset from being an
independent contributor where you find joy

55
00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:55.930
in your own accomplishments.

56
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.320
Versus shifting to finding joy in
others achievements was a big step for

57
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.520
me in transitioning to management.

58
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.964
&gt;&gt; I love that,
whoever said that, I love that,

59
00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:08.990
finding joy in other
people's accomplishments.

60
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.971
Yeah, and that's so different from being a
software engineering where you find joy in

61
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.110
your accomplishments and
take pride in that.

62
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.980
You have to take pride in others.

63
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.280
But there's always that nagging doubt of,
did I actually do anything?

64
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
Were they naturally good?

65
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.580
I'm filling out paperwork while they're
doing their thing, and you'll never know.

66
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.911
And maybe after maybe a year or
two, you can look back and be like,

67
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:37.414
I did do something, but you never know for
certain, that's that's hard to deal with.

68
00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:42.390
So really, it's about technology,

69
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.211
it's about being coming
a software engineering manager.

70
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.890
But if you can't tell
the challenges around people,

71
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.760
there are business challenges for sure.

72
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.378
Project management, technology choices,
things around the business.

73
00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:59.752
But the people leadership part is
is definitely the most challenging.

74
00:03:59.752 --> 00:04:02.681
It's the most rewarding but
it's also the most challenging part.

75
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.772
And it's better to think of it as
people leadership, leading others.

76
00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.098
And the truth about
engineering management and

77
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.122
one of the hardest part
is you have to be better.

78
00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:17.436
You have to show up every single day,
you got to be that person.

79
00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:19.852
If there's low energy,
you got to bring the energy.

80
00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:23.730
There's a lot of energy,
you can't be the low person.

81
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.290
And sometimes the team's just like,
they're in a groove, they're vibing.

82
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.030
You don't have to force them
to sit through a team meeting.

83
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.321
If they're all like,
we're heads down, we're doing well,

84
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.150
you have to be able to make that call and
step back.

85
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.280
You have to know when to listen,
you have to know when to talk.

86
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.850
You need to know what people
need in that exact moment.

87
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.910
Sometimes people are feeling down,
maybe they're gonna leave.

88
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.286
Maybe they just need talking to,
maybe they need a salary increase,

89
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.880
maybe they just need a new computer.

90
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.546
Maybe they just need someone to tell them,
hey, I know this is hard,

91
00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:54.380
and I'm here for you.

92
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.810
But the fact is you have to be better, and
that's hard, cuz that's a personal thing.

93
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.811
We talked a lot about By making your team
do something or getting your team to do

94
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.833
something, convincing partners and
customers and all these other things.

95
00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:09.730
But the truth is to become a good people
leader is you have to become better.

96
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.005
And there's nothing hard in
the world of changing yourself, and

97
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:14.800
that's just the the honest truth.

98
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.060
And that's that's the responsibility that,
there's some days I don't want it.

99
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.841
I'm like, I just wanna sit back and chill,
I would love for somebody to tell me

100
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.410
what to do, I do it and
then I go watch Netflix, or I check out.

101
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.645
But I'd say most Fridays I'm always like,
as much as I wanted done,

102
00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:35.409
did I do anything this week?

103
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.250
And that's, that's hard to deal with.

104
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.624
And the truth is just showing up all
the time, being the person people look to,

105
00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:45.870
is what counts in the long run.

106
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.872
If I'm inconsistent, people don't trust
me, they're not gonna listen to me,

107
00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:51.610
why should you?

108
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.780
And that consistency,
it doesn't matter, I've been sick.

109
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.440
I have gotten two hours of sleep cuz my
son's up all night crying from something.

110
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.847
Maybe I just got some bad
news about the company,

111
00:06:01.847 --> 00:06:04.676
maybe it's a reorg coming and
the team doesn't know it.

112
00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:07.567
But I have to think about
how to deal with that.

113
00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:11.123
There's so many things that go into
it from personal and a business side.

114
00:06:11.123 --> 00:06:13.764
But I need to show up every
single time for my team, and

115
00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:15.954
that's what they're counting on me to do.

116
00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:19.229
And that's hard, that it's hard,
it's hard to do that and

117
00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.125
it's a lot of responsibility, you're like,
that's not fair, that's not fair to me.

118
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.492
I'm a person just like everybody else.

119
00:06:26.492 --> 00:06:31.131
But that's the truth about engineering
management, is you have to be better,

120
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:31.831
question?

121
00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:37.182
&gt;&gt; Folks are asking if you're gonna
address imposter syndrome at all?

122
00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:42.279
&gt;&gt; I can't now, yeah, it doesn't go away.

123
00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.424
It doesn't matter how high you climb,

124
00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:48.130
it doesn't matter what your role,
you will always be an imposter.

125
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.210
I heard an interesting
interview the other day on NPR,

126
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.810
it was about a Nobel Prize winner.

127
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.670
And they're talking, they're like, wow,
you're so smart, you won this Nobel Prize.

128
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.221
And I'm like, yeah, but I built on a lot
of other research, and I don't feel

129
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:08.350
like I'm as smart as people think I am,
and I still don't want a Nobel Prize.

130
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.656
So it doesn't matter how high you go or
what you do in life,

131
00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:14.290
you will always deal
with imposter syndrome.

132
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.800
Do I belong here?

133
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.730
Have I earned this place?

134
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.780
And there's, there's nothing
anybody can do to fix that.

135
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.570
There's no title, there's no money,
it's just a personal belief inside.

136
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.686
And as an engineering manager,
yeah, especially in early one,

137
00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:31.170
you have nothing about impostor syndrome,
cuz you're not doing anything.

138
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.820
You're not shipping code,
what value am I providing to the business?

139
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.734
Why are people paying me?

140
00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:37.759
Why are people listening to me?

141
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.263
You just have to believe internally that,
yeah, I belong here, I'm doing something,

142
00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:43.040
I'm making an impact.

143
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.930
But it doesn't go away,
it gets worse as an engineering manager.

144
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.620
&gt;&gt; Do you have to be available outside
of core work hours as a manager?

145
00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.250
&gt;&gt; Good question, I don't recommend it.

146
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.240
Management is one of these things that,
there are so many things to do.

147
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.961
Even when you close out the year,
you're gonna be like there's so

148
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.200
many things I didn't do.

149
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.949
The list of things you could have done and

150
00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.739
should have done maybe is always
log into things you didn't do.

151
00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:15.670
And if you don't set down deals in
your life, it will just take over.

152
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:21.900
I have never worked harder in my life than
I do as a software engineering manager.

153
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.200
I used to work in a kitchen, I worked in
a kitchen in a restaurant for seven years.

154
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.998
I've got you know, scars,

155
00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:35.011
my arm burns forking in
the kitchen standing 12,

156
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:39.790
13 hours a day in the heat,
yelling at people,

157
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.938
getting yelled at, and
that was not as hard as this.

158
00:08:44.938 --> 00:08:48.399
I was actually a manager in
a theme park in South Georgia,

159
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.521
where it's 90 degrees and
it's super humid and it's sweating.

160
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.911
And dealing with teenagers who
don't wanna be here you there and

161
00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:58.440
customers who are feeling
entitled to things.

162
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.677
I'm working 15 hours a day walking around,
and

163
00:09:00.677 --> 00:09:02.870
that was not as hard as
engineering management.

164
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.128
It's definitely the hardest
hardest job because at the end of

165
00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:11.017
the day I at the Friday
when I close my computer,

166
00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:14.740
I'm not satisfied that I
did as much as I could.

167
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.400
I am a little bit better now,
but initially I wasn't.

168
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.478
And that, I should have done more, could
have done more, just drives you mad, and

169
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:22.720
you have to accept that.

170
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:30.943
So, I forgot which rant I went on,
but yeah, it's, a challenging job.

171
00:09:30.943 --> 00:09:37.151
Grace Hopper, a very, very famous admiral,
has a conference named after her,

172
00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:41.000
a very,
very influential figure in tech, said.

173
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.690
You manage things and you lead people,
you don't manage people.

174
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.502
You do in terms of the role, but people
are not things, they're not static, and

175
00:09:49.502 --> 00:09:51.140
you can't make them do anything.

176
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.948
You have to lead them, sometimes you're
from the front end you got example,

177
00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:57.380
sometimes you do it from behind.

178
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.850
It's like making sure they're everybody's
happy and not falling behind.

179
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.087
And where you need to sit,
it totally varies on the situation,

180
00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:07.848
the day of the week, the team,
so many other things.

181
00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:09.446
But that's the truth about
engineering management.

182
00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:15.781
So the takeaways are, there's many paths
to management, there's different ways to

183
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.640
get there, sometimes accidental,
sometimes deliberate.

184
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.069
You have to have the right motivations,
cuz no one's telling you what to do,

185
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:25.910
no one's telling you
how to spend your time.

186
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.868
So you really need to dig deep and
be better and figure these things out.

187
00:10:29.868 --> 00:10:32.678
Cuz if you don't,
life will figure it out for you, but

188
00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:34.406
it'll be a very painful lesson.

189
00:10:36.526 --> 00:10:40.920
An engineering management
is a difficult job.

190
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.540
There are absolutely days when I'm like,
man, I miss coding.

191
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.126
I miss these really technical sessions
my team looks like all jumps in and

192
00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:51.620
I'm like, this is the fun stuff.

193
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.720
I haven't lost that thrill for
doing that, but I have to step back.

194
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.899
And just like doing that,
watching other people have fun,

195
00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:02.090
it's sometimes difficult too,
and I wanna jump in there.

196
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.684
But I have to take satisfaction when
they come up with an answer and say,

197
00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:11.060
yeah, okay, good job, team,
let's move on, and that's that.
