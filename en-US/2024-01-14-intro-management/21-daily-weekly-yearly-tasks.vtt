00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.767
When you think of the business and
the people side, the day-to-day,

2
00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:08.260
week-to-week, the quarter-to-quarter
are gonna vary a little bit.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.670
The day-to-day doesn't change,
you're always talking to people.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.839
I talk to people every single day,
it was interesting a couple of weeks ago,

5
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.853
my voice went out for two days but
I still had meetings.

6
00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:22.525
So that was interesting experience of
having to type out my responses [LAUGH]

7
00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:26.691
made me think critically about
my written communication skills.

8
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:29.751
But it wasn't bad,
it's actually good exercise and

9
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.547
listening which I need to
get better at anyways.

10
00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:36.780
You want to wake up your there's paperwork
to do there's been this trade of tasks,

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.745
there's documentation to
read documentation to write,

12
00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:43.689
there's emails and slacks and all this
context you need to get up to speed on.

13
00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.770
On the people side, you're really
making sure that teams on blocks.

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.740
You shouldn't be down in the weeds being
like, what's the status of pull requests?

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.880
What's the status project
in the week-to-week?

16
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.546
That's more of a, maybe month-to-month you
should be checking in a little bit more on

17
00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:57.374
those things.

18
00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:02.150
Quarter the cord on the business, the
OKRs, the objective key results, different

19
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.070
ways of measuring performance, different
metrics, butt how are you doing as a team?

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.820
Are you delivering for the business?

21
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.840
Do you know what the business needs?

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.062
That's something you should know and

23
00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:14.980
you should be making sure
you're making progress in that.

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.290
In the quarter-to-quarter,
I look at Team growth.

25
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.223
I have a quarterly growth conversation
with every member of my team because like

26
00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:23.290
I said, it's really important to me.

27
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.253
And I have it quarterly instead of
monthly because it takes time for

28
00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.900
growth to happen.

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.000
So we check quarter to quarter and
see how they're doing.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.151
And I'm always looking at team processes,
I mentioned earlier about the problem

31
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.810
we had early on,
which is how do I email my partners?

32
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.000
Who do I know who that is?

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.618
That's a process that I
can now solve easily.

34
00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:46.610
We have the same thing now,
I actually need to send out

35
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.735
an email where people don't know what
Slack channel is joined, we have,

36
00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.928
I think in Netflix we have like
20,000 Slack channels or something,

37
00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:59.750
because every request on Slack channel for
every reason and they don't return them.

38
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.940
I don't actually know the number but
it's somewhere up there.

39
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.147
So which Slack channels are important?

40
00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:08.738
That's my job to figure that out and
share that out with people.

41
00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:12.503
And the year-to-year,
I'm looking at the long-term strategy and

42
00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:13.790
the vision of the team.

43
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.140
The vision is gonna change over time,
it should.

44
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.774
The strategy is gonna change over
time as you react to the business,

45
00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:20.867
other teams, etc.

46
00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.830
But in the year-to-year, that's something
I'm focused on on the business side.

47
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.881
And the people year-to-year,
probably the hiring side, hopefully,

48
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.760
your team is growing and you're thinking,
what personalities do I need right now?

49
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.560
What skills do I need?

50
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.466
So, really the commonalities, even though
engineering, the technical side, and

51
00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:43.470
the management side sometimes
are very different.

52
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.509
The common thread is always the people,
and

53
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.420
that's where you're always gonna spending
your time because your success is the,

54
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.020
your successes are just from the team.

55
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.234
You never, no one's ever gonna be like,
hi, five Gem,

56
00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.730
that's a hell of an email you sent.

57
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.090
I'm like, yeah, wow,
that was really polished and clean.

58
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.773
I did, I do get, occasionally get
compliments on the newsletter,

59
00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:04.690
which I, I'm like, thank you,
that means so much to me.

60
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.340
I spent a couple hours on the newsletter,
but that usually it's not gonna happen.

61
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.370
No one's gonna be like, good job,
the team's functioning well.

62
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.460
They just expect that.

63
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.686
So you really have to focus on the people,

64
00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:19.641
even though you're always juggling
these two other priorities as well.

65
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.590
And really your role as engineering
manager is to manage the team and

66
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.970
the context of the business.

67
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.490
And I like the juggling analogy,
because that's true.

68
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.060
You can juggle all the balls.

69
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.340
Some people are really good at, they can
do a lot, like I said, people that can be

70
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.960
deep on the technical side and
the people side but very few people can.

71
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.790
So, your job is to figure out
what's important right now.

72
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.310
What balls can I upside down and
I'll pick it up later.

73
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.062
What balls do I just throw away that is
not important anymore and never will be?

74
00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:56.531
And what balls do I actually
need to actively be managing?

75
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.119
And this is why engineering
management is difficult

76
00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.236
because there's always something,
what that something is,

77
00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:05.315
no one can tell you because
they're your boss, the juggler.

78
00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:13.695
Any questions on that last section
on the responsibilities on what

79
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:15.529
engineering managers do?

80
00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:22.022
Or, yeah, what does your manager do?

81
00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:27.126
&gt;&gt; I was in a situation reporting
directly to the CTO and

82
00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:32.934
he wasn't giving me any
direction mentorship or targets.

83
00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:36.522
The issue was something's
required his attention or

84
00:04:36.522 --> 00:04:42.192
empowering me to make particular decision
none of which were happening regularly.

85
00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:47.287
The question is,
should I accept it knowing that

86
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:52.010
I'm not really being
able to be effective and

87
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.630
within the team and the products?

88
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.028
Does that makes sense?

89
00:04:58.028 --> 00:05:00.960
&gt;&gt; Yes, so they're reporting to the CTO.

90
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.988
The CTO doesn't have
time to really invest in

91
00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:08.350
them being good at the role
they're reporting to, yeah.

92
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.760
&gt;&gt; Sounds like they're not
setting a clear target, either.

93
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.390
They're just kinda,
go do important stuff, I trust you.

94
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.340
But you're really lacking the context for
what is the important stuff.

95
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.898
&gt;&gt; The manager hasn't given you context.

96
00:05:20.898 --> 00:05:24.765
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good take.

97
00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:26.645
And I think in that scenario, one,

98
00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:29.350
sometimes there's nothing
you can do about that.

99
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.366
You're not going to be, CTO,
you're doing your job wrong,

100
00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.630
probably not a good career move.

101
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.000
What you can do is ask them, hey,
what's important for me right now?

102
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.340
Here's the things I'm thinking about,
and you make it a really simple,

103
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.820
I don't know if you ever heard of the rule
of threes when it comes to talking to

104
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.510
through someone above you.

105
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.346
So the idea is you give them three ideas
for something but two of them are really

106
00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:56.533
bad and, they're gonna say no,
but you give them one good one,

107
00:05:56.533 --> 00:06:00.665
they know they're gonna say yes to you and
it makes them feel good that they're like

108
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:04.200
I've made a decision here, but
really you led them to that.

109
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.287
I'm not saying that's that's a good
business move, but it's an example of,

110
00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:12.315
hey, I'm focused on these are three
things I'm thinking about focusing on.

111
00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:13.490
These are my priorities.

112
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.664
Which of these do you think is most
important right now should focus on?

113
00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:20.101
And you want to make it really easy
because remember their contexts especially

114
00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:23.276
at that level is so much broader than
yours and they're not focused on you

115
00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:25.950
specifically, and
there's not much you can do about that.

116
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.310
But what you can do is make it really easy
for them to help you as much as you can.

117
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.108
And in that scenario, you're like,
I wanna grow more, but I'm actually being

118
00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:39.568
stifled by having too much freedom and
not being able to focus on one thing.

119
00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:43.062
Take what you can from those situations,
take the leadership examples and

120
00:06:43.062 --> 00:06:46.609
learn what not to do, and then try to
maybe find a new role, but you try to make

121
00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:50.010
the best of it in those kind of
situations, sometimes you can't fix it.

122
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.491
&gt;&gt; Another thing there is have a
conversation around clear expectations of

123
00:06:55.491 --> 00:07:00.125
your role and his role and maybe that's
not the right phrasing, but like, hey,

124
00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:03.930
to do my role, this is what I
need from you, does that work?

125
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.760
Or if it doesn't,
maybe have that conversation.

126
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.180
&gt;&gt; That's a great one.

127
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.500
Yeah, getting expectations.

128
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.507
I have been a scenario where I've asked
that and they're like, you're doing great,

129
00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:16.040
whatever.

130
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.482
Which is, it seems like you're being
nice or I think as a leader and

131
00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:25.876
you say that somebody you think you're
like, they're giving them freedom,

132
00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:29.762
but really, at the end of the day,
people want you to tell them what to do,

133
00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:33.509
so it's really kind of an anti-pattern
when it comes to leadership.

134
00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.800
In those cases, you do what you wanna do,
essentially, but you always check into

135
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.043
like, hey, I'm planning on doing this,
hey, I'm planning on doing that, so

136
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.286
when it goes wrong, and it probably will,
you're going to make a mistake at some

137
00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:46.210
point, you're like, yeah,
we talked about this, remember?

138
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.307
And maybe then they'll be like,
okay, maybe I shouldn't give them so

139
00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:51.470
much latitude.

140
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.787
Maybe I shouldn't let them
focus on this project for

141
00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:56.840
a quarter when it wasn't
really that important.

142
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.210
But yeah, the truth is sometimes,
it's hard.

143
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.740
And you're just in a situation,
you have to make the best of it.

144
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.310
&gt;&gt; It's another one of those things
where you can't control other people, so

145
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.652
if someone's not telling
you clearly what to do,

146
00:08:09.652 --> 00:08:11.904
then all you can do is your
best to figure it out.

147
00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:16.047
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I want to be a good
instructor and give you really good

148
00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:20.814
advice, and be like, here's what you
should do in this situation, but

149
00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:26.600
sometimes life is not fair, and sometimes
things suck, and that's the truth of it.

150
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.492
The best you can do is change
how you respond to it and

151
00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:32.050
try to learn from what you can.

152
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.960
We've all had bad managers,
we all raise their hand for that question.

153
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.795
Even in those situations, we learned
something, we learned what not to do,

154
00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:39.720
how not to treat people.

155
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.383
And that was a bad situation that
you're still here and you're,

156
00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:45.990
I wouldn't say you're better for
it, but you've learned something.

157
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.570
And that, at the end of the day,
is all you can do.
