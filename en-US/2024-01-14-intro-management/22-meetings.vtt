00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.909
So, this is not a trick question, how do
engineering managers spend their time?

2
00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:10.005
&gt;&gt; Depends on the company and the role.

3
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.825
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but
there's a real answer to this one.

4
00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.007
This isn't a trick.

5
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:13.621
Yeah.

6
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.149
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

7
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.795
&gt;&gt; Megan, the chat must have been seen

8
00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:22.655
into the future here,
because they responded a few minutes ago.

9
00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:28.162
As an engineering manager, I spend 10%
of my time each week with one-on-ones,

10
00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.665
65% of my time in meetings,
and the rest in Slack.

11
00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.558
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's really specific.

12
00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:34.505
Props to them.

13
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.052
&gt;&gt; What do you say about that?

14
00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:40.323
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The answer is meetings.

15
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:42.917
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's a real, sorry,

16
00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.249
I wasn't trying to trick you all.

17
00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.241
Yeah, the breakdown of meetings is pretty
important, we're gonna talk about that.

18
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:52.658
Cuz when you look at a manager,
you're like, what do they do all the time?

19
00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:53.536
It's just meetings.

20
00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.260
Their calendar is full.

21
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.045
And one-on ones are meetings too,
there's different type of meeting.

22
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.624
And you're like, that's probably
the thing that turned me off the most

23
00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:02.864
from being an engineering manager.

24
00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:06.529
It's like, I don't wanna sit in meetings,
I'm not being productive there.

25
00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:10.730
So one thing I had to do was change my
mindset around, what am I trying to do in

26
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.763
meetings, what's the purpose of them,
it's not just filling time.

27
00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:18.702
I tell you,
some people think managers like meetings.

28
00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:19.409
We don't.

29
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.069
I'd rather not be in a meeting.

30
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.514
I would rather be writing a doc or
talking to my team, or

31
00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:28.717
focusing on, I wanna be creative too.

32
00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.889
I wanna write, hey, here's a proposal for
doing this, or hey,

33
00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:34.097
maybe I wanna dive into
the code a little bit.

34
00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:36.879
But oftentimes I don't
cuz I'm in meetings.

35
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:41.416
So, I won't say I dislike meetings,
I understand their purpose, but

36
00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:45.286
would I rather not be in meetings
to have a day that's empty?

37
00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:46.815
Yeah, I would.

38
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.904
Just a common misconception there.

39
00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:52.724
[LAUGH] And when you get into meetings,
the fascinating world of engineering

40
00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:55.837
management, there's a lot of
different types of meetings.

41
00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:58.824
You got your one on ones,
so that's person to person.

42
00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:02.375
You got project meetings,
you got planning and strategy meetings.

43
00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:03.771
You got all-hands.

44
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.130
I think they're generally
called all hands, but

45
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.896
if your entire organization comes
together, whether it's company or glide or

46
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.966
domain wide, it's called an all-hands,
it might be called something different.

47
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.000
You have team meetings.

48
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.015
You should be having team meetings.

49
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:19.020
If you don't have team meetings,
you're doing something wrong.

50
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.334
You should be meeting
regularly as a group.

51
00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.435
Social events, that's a meeting too.

52
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:28.764
You probably don't think of it, but it's a
meeting, cuz you're meeting other people.

53
00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:32.375
Team retrospectives, looking back on
what went well, what didn't go well,

54
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.313
that's a meeting.

55
00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:37.751
And staff meetings, talking to the other
peer managers in your organization,

56
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.950
talking to your manager in a big group.

57
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.514
Those are called staff meetings,
generally.

58
00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:43.846
They could be called
something else as well.

59
00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:46.911
Are there other meeting types you
can think of that I didn't include

60
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:47.515
in the list?

61
00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:48.542
There's gotta be one.

62
00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.092
Yeah, right.

63
00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:51.807
&gt;&gt; It could be standups, right?

64
00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:54.126
You might be attending
standups that your team has.

65
00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:59.177
&gt;&gt; Standups, yeah, that's a meeting too.

66
00:02:59.177 --> 00:03:01.480
&gt;&gt; Does team bonding count?

67
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.891
Like, happy hour.

68
00:03:03.891 --> 00:03:05.800
&gt;&gt; Put it under social events,
but, yeah, that counts.

69
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.079
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Interviews.

70
00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.717
&gt;&gt; I also think on that one,
is an interview a meeting?

71
00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:16.159
&gt;&gt; It's on the calendar.

72
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.163
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna count it, yeah.

73
00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.416
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You get the call?

74
00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:21.409
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good call out.

75
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.349
&gt;&gt; Ad hoc, huddles.

76
00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.129
&gt;&gt; Yeah, huddles, that's a meeting.

77
00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:28.272
&gt;&gt; Quick chat.

78
00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.127
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

79
00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:29.883
&gt;&gt; Just a quick chat.

80
00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.826
&gt;&gt; Quick chat, person to person.

81
00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:33.387
&gt;&gt; Leadership meetings.

82
00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:35.533
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

83
00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:41.393
So now the, strategy meetings, what once
was like a blank canvas of meetings,

84
00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:45.603
now we see there's actually
a lot of varieties in there.

85
00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:49.372
And your inputs, outputs, what's expected
changes from meeting to meeting.

86
00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:55.223
So we talked about types of meetings,
but the purpose of meetings and

87
00:03:55.223 --> 00:03:56.714
the types are often different.

88
00:03:56.714 --> 00:03:58.880
Sometimes you're just planning.

89
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.094
You're not actually trying
to make a decision,

90
00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:02.884
you're just trying to get some ideas.

91
00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:05.638
Or you're trying to say, like,
hey, what are the next steps?

92
00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:06.863
Sometimes there's brainstorming.

93
00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:08.844
You have no ideas and you need some.

94
00:04:08.844 --> 00:04:13.345
You gotta start from somewhere, every
project idea has to start from somewhere.

95
00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:15.990
Brainstorming idea meeting is
sometimes just the purpose.

96
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.878
You're not trying to achieve
anything there other than ideation.

97
00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:22.713
Sometimes there's alignments.

98
00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:26.217
That means, a decision must be made and
here's a group of stakeholders to make

99
00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:28.355
a decision,
what technology are you gonna do?

100
00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.639
What's the next step in this project?

101
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.127
Sometimes that's what a meeting's for.

102
00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:36.901
Morale and culture,
those are team events, often.

103
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:41.289
Sometimes they're not, sometimes they're
performance meetings and a one-on-one.

104
00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.653
Sometimes the meeting's just for
sharing information, and

105
00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:48.725
all-hands is a good example of someone
talking to a large group of people,

106
00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.068
you're just sharing information there.

107
00:04:51.068 --> 00:04:53.203
Probably not a lot of back and forth.

108
00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:56.126
Sometimes you're just there
to receive information.

109
00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:58.465
Again, in all-hands,
I'm just there listening.

110
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:03.577
I'm probably not contributing to what the
CEO has to say in this particular moment.

111
00:05:03.577 --> 00:05:07.586
Someday, someday I'll
have my time to shine.

112
00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:11.031
But I like to think of meetings and
breaking them out in types and

113
00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:14.484
purpose because it changes my approach and
what's expected.

114
00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:17.606
Sometimes, if I'm running the meeting,
I need to be prepared.

115
00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:22.099
I can't show up unprepared if it's
a status meeting for the project managers.

116
00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.252
I need to know what
the status of the project is.

117
00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:25.282
Is it on track?
Is it delayed?

118
00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:25.866
What are the reasons?

119
00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:27.175
What are the next steps?

120
00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:29.208
I have to be prepared going in.

121
00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:34.757
Have you ever been in a meeting where
someone's clearly not prepared?

122
00:05:34.757 --> 00:05:39.750
Yeah, it's weird, it's so uncomfortable,
you're like, why are you wasting our time?

123
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.031
You're like, there's literally money
we're spending by being here and

124
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:44.134
not doing other things.

125
00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:46.428
And that's something you
have to think about, is,

126
00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:48.419
are you wasting people's
time in a meeting?

127
00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.715
Is your time being wasted?

128
00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:55.733
There's a famous rule we have at Netflix,
which is, no agenda, no attender.

129
00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.072
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I believe in,

130
00:05:57.072 --> 00:06:01.715
if it's a big group meeting and say,
a lot of other managers are involved,

131
00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:04.000
and there's no agenda, I'm like,

132
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.744
hey, I'll either email the person like,
hey, what are we talking about?

133
00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:11.152
Or I just won't show up,
cuz, why waste my time.

134
00:06:11.152 --> 00:06:14.330
If you couldn't put in the effort
to at least make an agenda for

135
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.222
a meeting, then I don't need
to put in the effort back.

136
00:06:17.222 --> 00:06:20.176
And it sounds cold but
that's just how we operate,

137
00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:23.280
we wanna make sure we're
making the best use of time.

138
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.788
I like meetings with a bunch
of leaders and directors,

139
00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:30.524
cuz if you think of time and
money in salaries and all that,

140
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.897
you translate that,
some meetings are expensive.

141
00:06:33.897 --> 00:06:35.304
Thousands of dollars you're spending.

142
00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:39.386
And if you're not making progress
towards something, what are you doing?

143
00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.631
I don't know,
maybe I'm cynical about meetings.

144
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:44.020
Maybe I take too tight of a lens on them.
