WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
So speaking of meetings, cuz I tell you,
I love meetings, we all have them.

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.208
Let's do the shared exercise together.

3
00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:10.952
And cuz I wanna hear
your opinion on this and

4
00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:14.800
more highlights diversity of of meetings.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.571
So let's do it together,
you could raise your hand or shout it out,

6
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.760
the purpose of every meeting.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.262
So, thinking critically about what
are you trying to get out of things?

8
00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:27.580
So, we'll start with a stand-up meeting.

9
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.794
Would you say it's a planning meeting,
a brainstorming meeting, are you sharing,

10
00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.367
receiving, or is it morale and culture?

11
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.657
Yeah.

12
00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:40.692
&gt;&gt; Stand-ups should be sharing
information, receiving information.

13
00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:45.562
I mean, at least to discover blockers.

14
00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.361
&gt;&gt; I agree with that.

15
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:47.861
Anything else?

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.197
&gt;&gt; We use it as a morale and culture
sometimes to play a game together or

17
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:58.522
just chit chat before everyone shows
up to check in and out before doing.

18
00:00:58.522 --> 00:00:59.561
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.

19
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:03.827
You do any planning or
brainstorming and setups?

20
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:11.030
&gt;&gt; Feel like you shouldn't be
because it should be quick.

21
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.835
Depends on the culture of the company,
I guess.

22
00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fair.

23
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.039
&gt;&gt; That's happened.

24
00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.394
&gt;&gt; I would say I've seen it happen a lot.

25
00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:21.960
And the question is,
should it be happening there?

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.296
Probably not,
maybe they're gonna tell you operate.

27
00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:29.267
&gt;&gt; We have parking lots we call them where
someone says I have a parking lot topic

28
00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:30.516
and so stand up is done.

29
00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:35.324
And then you can go into another topic, so
it's still a part of the stand up meeting,

30
00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.918
but if you're not involved
you can drop off.

31
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:40.038
So, planning and brain surgery,

32
00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:43.042
brainstorming happens in
those kinds of chats.

33
00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:44.015
&gt;&gt; I like that.

34
00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:46.522
Yeah, being intentional.

35
00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:50.590
I have seen standups turn into planning
and brainstorming when they shouldn't.

36
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.580
It should be a quick
status update meeting.

37
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.985
I like we're all in culture,
sometimes you're sharing like, hey,

38
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:57.140
here's what I did this weekend.

39
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.455
That's a good way of
connecting really quickly, but

40
00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:02.705
it shouldn't be not every meeting has
to have like a really heavy purpose.

41
00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.598
Stand-up should be light and
quick, in my opinion.

42
00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:10.500
One-on-ones, planning,
brainstorming, sharing information,

43
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.236
receiving information,
morale, and culture.

44
00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:13.881
What do you think?

45
00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:22.259
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Definitely planning,
probably brainstorming, but

46
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:27.480
even a little space for morale and
culture seems appropriate here.

47
00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:35.614
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

48
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:36.806
Does everybody agree with that?

49
00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.333
I see some differing faces.

50
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.769
&gt;&gt; Chat says morale,
culture, sharing, receiving.

51
00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:43.269
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

52
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.635
&gt;&gt; Does it differ from the side
of the one-on-one you're

53
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.282
on,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

54
00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:50.738
&gt;&gt; If you're the management or

55
00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:54.741
the engineer cuz I think as an engineer,
I think it's for sharing information

56
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.765
of like, I've planned to tell my manager
certain things at my one-on-one.

57
00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:03.378
Whereas maybe on the management side
it is receiving and listening and

58
00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:07.537
understanding them around culture and
then going from there.

59
00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:09.733
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you brought that up.

60
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:14.890
One-on -ones are the most interesting
type of meeting you're gonna be in.

61
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.612
And it seems silly, but what you get
out of a one-on-one can change so much.

62
00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:25.510
It's one of the most important things
you do as an engineering manager.

63
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.803
And as a software engineer,
it's one of the most important meetings

64
00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:32.680
you have as well, and I don't know, for
a long time I didn't treat them as such.

65
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.200
And don't forget, one-on-ones
are the most varied meetings too.

66
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.211
Sometimes my one-on-ones
are with my skip level.

67
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:43.740
My skip level is the head of the entire
organization that I'm in, 160 people.

68
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.614
So that one-on-one changes a lot versus
the one-on-one with my manager, where

69
00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:51.653
they're actually sharing a lot of contacts
with me about, here's what's going on,

70
00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:55.760
here's what the VPs are thinking,
I'm like, okay, interesting.

71
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.790
Here's the movements on hiring or
letting someone go or something like that.

72
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.714
I get all that in a one-on-one
versus the one-on-ones with my team,

73
00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:06.290
I'm sometimes sharing information, but
a lot of times I'm receiving information.

74
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.880
What's going on?

75
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.936
Everything's going,
anything I can help with?

76
00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:14.728
So I'm gonna go and put planning there
too cuz I do that too and one-on-one

77
00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:16.669
&gt;&gt; So people's career growth as well or

78
00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.183
like their goals and things like that and
that's a good thing to touch one-on-one.

79
00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:22.414
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.

80
00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:25.687
Yes
&gt;&gt; I forgot about the one-on-one

81
00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:28.267
the new CTO, she just came on.

82
00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.003
She's gonna have
a one-on-one with everybody.

83
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.665
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
one-on-ones is like a type of meeting, but

84
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:37.340
the category is very broad
in what's gonna happen.

85
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.487
A one-on-one with a partner manager,
we often do a lot of planning.

86
00:04:41.487 --> 00:04:43.494
What's your team's priorities for
next quarter?

87
00:04:43.494 --> 00:04:44.900
Cool, here's mine,
how can we figure this out?

88
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.430
How can we work together?

89
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.143
Yeah, Megan in the chat had kind of
mentioned the career growth too,

90
00:04:51.143 --> 00:04:55.371
the planning and brainstorming aspects
being kind of around career growth and

91
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:58.144
then sharing information and
morale and culture.

92
00:04:58.144 --> 00:04:58.792
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

93
00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:03.264
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just
a venting session and-

94
00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:04.074
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

95
00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:08.337
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] what about all hands?

96
00:05:08.337 --> 00:05:12.240
Planning, brainstorming, sharing,
receiving, morale, culture?

97
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.130
&gt;&gt; Recieving, right?

98
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.555
&gt;&gt; Definitely, receiving.

99
00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:17.785
&gt;&gt; And shared.

100
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:18.285
&gt;&gt; Morale.

101
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:27.429
&gt;&gt; Sharing, I'll put questionable but
I think it's fair to say sharing, yeah.

102
00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:28.400
It depends on which side you're on.

103
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.151
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

104
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:32.038
&gt;&gt; There are folks sharing and
there are folks receiving and

105
00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:36.023
usually it's the same thing for them
each time but different for each person.

106
00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:37.927
&gt;&gt; Good way of putting it.

107
00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:39.691
Someone said morale?

108
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:40.826
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

109
00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.658
&gt;&gt; I guess just as far as,

110
00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:50.839
yeah, I don't know why.

111
00:05:53.426 --> 00:05:56.070
&gt;&gt; It could be like after a good quarter,

112
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.626
the quarterly earnings came in way
to go everyone rah rah go team.

113
00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.177
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you're right, morale and

115
00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:07.838
culture is absolutely time to play for
all hands.

116
00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:12.143
Celebrating successes of teams that you
may not know about is a good thing.

117
00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:14.995
You wanna see your team's name up there
too and you want to really know about it.

118
00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:16.580
It's absolutely for morale and culture.

119
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.032
&gt;&gt; Gives you context.

120
00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:21.462
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; In your in your big company if you're,

121
00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.026
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; For remote work as well,

122
00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:28.924
like one of the things we do in our
all hands is like the administrator,

123
00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:30.999
the person running the team,

124
00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:35.494
will share photos people have
posted from the Travels channel.

125
00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:37.587
This is what other employees are up to.

126
00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:41.463
We're a travel company, so
that's goods for stuff to show.

127
00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:46.391
Or showing a pet's picture just to
give everyone a little boost of,

128
00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:48.559
look at this cute dog or-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

129
00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:49.693
&gt;&gt; Something like that.

130
00:06:49.693 --> 00:06:50.557
&gt;&gt; It's a great idea.

131
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.511
What about team meetings, planning,
brainstorming, sharing, receiving, morale,

132
00:06:57.511 --> 00:07:04.376
and culture?,
&gt;&gt; It's

133
00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:09.162
kind of similar to the one-on-ones that
can serve lots of different purposes

134
00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.855
depending on why does
the team need to meet?

135
00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:16.455
Are there confusions about priorities?

136
00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:18.971
Are we meeting to plan
an outing together and

137
00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:22.439
we need to make a decision on
where we're going out to lunch?

138
00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:29.594
&gt;&gt; So, I'm just gonna check
all of them cuz that is true.

139
00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:32.807
Team meetings are whatever you make them,
it's a chance for you all to come together

140
00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:36.170
in a smaller group, sometimes you're make
decisions, sometimes you're planning.

141
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.764
Not usually a tremendous
amount of planning,

142
00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.232
but sometimes definitely brainstorming.

143
00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:44.382
It's a good time to be like, hey,
I have this speculative topic and

144
00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:46.663
it can come from anybody,
let's talk about it.

145
00:07:46.663 --> 00:07:49.746
And you're definitely, I'm sharing
information, the team sharing information,

146
00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:51.531
and always morale and
culture cuz you're a team.

147
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:53.396
It's good to come together
in a team meeting.

148
00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:56.647
What about a project meeting?

149
00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:04.176
&gt;&gt; Planning.

150
00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:06.520
&gt;&gt; Itss definitely planning.

151
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.785
&gt;&gt; For kickoff,
figuring out who's gonna do what when.

152
00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:10.426
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

153
00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.553
&gt;&gt; I would say brainstorming as well.

154
00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:20.702
If you're solutioning or trying to come up
with ways to move forward on a project.

155
00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:21.549
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

156
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.511
Anything else?

157
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:32.810
&gt;&gt; I've been invited to project status
update meetings where it's mostly sharing

158
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.360
and receiving information for
some kind of project coordinator.

159
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.791
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot of project
meetings are, it's already in flight,

160
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.001
what's going on?

161
00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:48.017
So there's probably other purposes for
meetings, but this is just a narrow list.

162
00:08:48.017 --> 00:08:49.927
Hopefully this provides
some perspective on.

163
00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:52.334
There's different things
that are expected of you,

164
00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:55.233
different things you should be
taking away from every meeting.

165
00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:57.447
And more importantly, as a manager,

166
00:08:57.447 --> 00:09:01.541
what are the meetings you should be
focused on based on this list here?

167
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.198
I could say one-on-one
is absolutely important.

168
00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:05.452
Team meetings, absolutely important.

169
00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:07.887
All hands, probably not as important,

170
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:10.757
I don't think you should
focus as much on this.

171
00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:13.202
Project meeting is also important.

172
00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:14.746
And stand up if you have it.

173
00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:19.453
My team doesn't do stand up, we report
differently, but also important too.

174
00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:24.095
But just a different
perspective on meetings.

175
00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.560
It's a wide world,
the fascinating world of meetings.
