1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.622
Here we go.
So these are like the three things that

2
00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:06.451
I kind of think, are what we looking
are the solution to our problem,

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.240
we need to be able to have
our dot files available.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.030
They need to be updatable and
they need to be OS.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.350
You should be able to have
some OS compatibility, right?

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.316
So if you're on Mac,

7
00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.450
you should be able to switch to like
a Mac flavored dot files, right?

8
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.986
If you're on Ubuntu, you should be able
to switch to, I wanna have these for

9
00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:24.930
my Ubuntu instance.

10
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.411
If there are some that are shared,

11
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.060
you should be able to have
the shared ones in common.

12
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.940
And so these are kinda the big three,
right?

13
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.540
I wanna be able to configure my programs.

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.830
I wanna be able to commit and
track my changes.

15
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.570
And I wanted to be OS independent.

16
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
So those are my big three to be
able to solve the dotfile problem.

17
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.728
And so there's probably a few of you out
there that don't know what dotfiles are,

18
00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:46.050
I don't know the level of
proficiency out there.

19
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.710
I did say for

20
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
this course that some knowledge
of the command line is important.

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
And so I will go over really, really,
really briefly what dotfiles are.

22
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.740
So Here's an example of a dotfile.

23
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.179
So I'm gonna grab this right here,
copy it, and I'm gonna go back here,

24
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.940
I'm gonna re-launch docker.

25
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.810
Now I have Neovim pre-installed in this
docker image, and that's pretty much it.

26
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.588
So when I do nvim, let's actually let's
just go to our root and let's go and

27
00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:11.790
nvim test file..

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.073
Do js, or there we go, when I go in here
and I go function foo and I do this,

29
00:01:18.073 --> 00:01:20.620
notice that A, the color's awful.

30
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.259
Look at the indenting, I think it's a tab.

31
00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.340
In order to do this, you have to tab.

32
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.380
Look at this, it's huge.

33
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.660
It's eight spaces.

34
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.150
It's not the way I want them to be.

35
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.190
So how can I fix this?

36
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.340
Well, I can go to my root directory and
I can add a folder called dot config.

37
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.174
And then of course, in doc config,
I can go to Neovim,

38
00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:45.872
and of course in here I can go and
knit dot vim, and then in here I can paste

39
00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:50.190
in this and this will effectively say hey,
tabs there four characters long.

40
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.310
When I shift it should
be four characters long.

41
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.630
If there is a tab,
let's make sure it's spaces.

42
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.027
And hey, if you're gonna be doing things
I will try to indent as smart as I

43
00:01:58.027 --> 00:01:58.990
can for you.

44
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.230
Awesome.
I'm gonna quit him re-launch it.

45
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.372
Now you'll notice that tab that
was eight characters long,

46
00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:06.100
is now four characters long.

47
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.320
I have configured this program, right?

48
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.255
There we go.
You can still see it's a tab.

49
00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:15.901
When I kill that tab and press tab,
now you'll notice that it's spaces

50
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:20.495
because I told it to expand tab in
vim means convert tab to spaces.

51
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.788
There we go.
I was able to customize then the way I

52
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:24.160
love it, right?

53
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.617
And so that is a dotfile.

54
00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:29.886
It is simply a configuration
set of instructions for

55
00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.090
some program to read and run.

56
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.850
Now, where are they stored is
kind of in variable locations.

57
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.390
Newer versions of tmux take advantage
of this dot config styled storing.

58
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.490
Older versions just have it
right in your home directory.

59
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.210
And so It just depends on how you use
it in a lot of programs even NPM has,

60
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.550
you can have NPM or
C's that are in your home directory.

61
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.320
And that are in your
actual individual repose.

62
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.230
And so you can use both of those.

63
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.945
And so dotfiles they're all over
the place, we can figure so

64
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.300
many different things.

65
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.790
And so,
let's talk about how we're using that.

66
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.129
So hopefully now everybody
kind of understands yeah,

67
00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.640
I've used a dotfile before.

68
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.789
In my JavaScript projects we have,
our ES lint RC,

69
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:14.510
which really defines how ES lint
should operate in that environment.

70
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.090
So hopefully that's familiar enough.

71
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.611
But the problem of course,
is when you are trying to do this for

72
00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:23.990
your personal system,
there's a lot of crappy ways people do it.

73
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.855
Before I kinda of get into what is
available, you know what I used to do?

74
00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:33.110
I used to have a really awesome
script that mostly worked.

75
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.964
But every time I added something new I
need to alter my script and make sure that

76
00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:40.523
my everything works and then I was
like kinda symlinking most the time,

77
00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.610
but cuz I changed how I like to do things
it'll then copy other times, right?

78
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.210
Just legacy throughout the whole thing.

79
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.947
It was awful.

80
00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:52.020
So I finally was like,
all right, I have to stop this.

81
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.757
Every time I get a new system or
every time I make a change to my system,

82
00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:58.143
I experience, wouldn't call real pain but

83
00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:00.930
definitely some emotional trauma there,
right?

84
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.180
I was just like,
why isn't anything working and

85
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.550
20 minutes later it's
because my script sucks.

86
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.810
All right, so there is three popular
solutions I've looked at two of them.

87
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.397
I haven't looked at one of them,
but I can keep hearing about it.

88
00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:15.438
So I'm just gonna put it in there for
curiosity sake,

89
00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:20.327
and the three ones are Yatom as I like to
call it or get another dotfile manager.

90
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.907
There's gonna install and
then there's dotbot.
