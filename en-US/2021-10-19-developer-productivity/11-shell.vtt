1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.510
So, I did wanna also
briefly touch on the shell.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.012
Now, I don't want to go
very deep into this.

3
00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:09.034
Much like window managers,
I don't wanna go deep into this.

4
00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:13.900
Cuz I actually find that your shell is
not as important as where you can spend

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.680
your time.

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.423
A lot of people just use what's
available and that's that.

7
00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:20.890
If you're on macOSX, zsh,
I believe comes already installed.

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.080
You just use zsh, right?

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.720
You may use My Zsh to have
a pretty prompt, right?

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.830
So, if you look at my prompt,
it has like what folder I'm in.

11
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.140
I'm on, I'm in git,
it shows me my branch, right?

12
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.790
It gives me all those kinda nice
pretty things in my prompt.

13
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.730
You can set all those things yourself.

14
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.630
Or you can use plugins,
I just use plugins.

15
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.760
It's just easier for me.

16
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.921
I don't have to think about it.

17
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.220
And I don't really wanna
learn the prompt language.

18
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.980
That's just my lifestyle I live.

19
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.890
Nonetheless, it all starts with the shell,
right?

20
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.672
For those that don't really
know what the shell is.

21
00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:49.900
We'll get into that in a moment.

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.256
I strongly suggest zsh.

23
00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.320
Just pick something, use it honestly.

24
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.650
In my personal opinion,
don't spend a lot of time on it.

25
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.230
Just get something you like, right?

26
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
We've already gone through
the installation process of zsh.

27
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.920
So, I don't need to show you
how I install zsh anymore.

28
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.360
But what is a shell?

29
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.460
Well, there's a guy named,
I call him The Wizard.

30
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.720
His name is Las Smiles.

31
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.734
He's like 70 years old and
he streams on Twitch.

32
00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.180
But he frequently gets banned for
showing movies.

33
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.960
And so, he's currently banned right now,
if I'm not mistaken.

34
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.143
So, I have as a YouTube linked.

35
00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:21.840
But, he experienced computers.

36
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.320
Like it just the rowdiest of days, right?

37
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.255
He has stories about how he had to like
tried to save the server farm when he was

38
00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:28.819
younger.

39
00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.431
But they only had punch cards and
he tripped and fell.

40
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:35.395
And like his whole program,
he actually has those stories, right?

41
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.825
Just super awesome, but he had a really
great explanation for what the shell is.

42
00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.833
Cuz in my head,

43
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:45.497
I always had this kind of specific
thought process of what the shell is.

44
00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:46.475
And I was kind of wrong.

45
00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:50.520
Cuz a lot of people don't really know the
difference between a shell and a terminal.

46
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.920
So, at one point in life,

47
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.827
there was terminals, literal physical
terminals that had keyboards.

48
00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:59.800
And then, there was actual servers
that you time shared on all, right?

49
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.120
So, if you wanted to run your program for
class, for school, for whatever.

50
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.430
You actually have something
remotely that ran at all.

51
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540
And you just kind of were on your
little terminal that sent things.

52
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.968
The terminal just simply gets
key input and displays output.

53
00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:15.441
And it sends all the stuff over
to something to be interpreted,

54
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.030
do the system calls, run your program.

55
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.800
So, that's really what is happening.

56
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.309
And so, this little communication
line existed at one point.

57
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.101
But, in the olden days,
when you say you sent over ls and

58
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.840
you meant to do dash la but
you sent over underscore la.

59
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.930
What would end up happening is go,
wow, that thing doesn't exist.

60
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.958
Your connections dead now,
I don't know who you are, you screwed up,

61
00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:39.827
you can't be here.

62
00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.570
So, then you'd have to re-log in.

63
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.850
Redo all that.

64
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.609
And so, how The Wizard describes, is that,

65
00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.740
the shell is not a shell, around your
computer, it's a shell around you.

66
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.470
It protects you from doing something dumb,
right?

67
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.316
It is a language that you can use and

68
00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:58.809
a way to interact with
your operating system.

69
00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.318
Make system calls,
start processes, do all that.

70
00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:04.350
And if you screw up,
its gonna treat you really nicely.

71
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.935
It's gonna say, hey, you messed up.

72
00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.128
Here's some information
about how you messed up.

73
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:11.570
Don't worry, you're still logged in,
everything is still fantastic.

74
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.780
You're not getting destroyed.

75
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.883
And so, I always really liked this kind
of analogy between the difference,

76
00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:18.045
between a terminal.

77
00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:19.131
Really just a stupid input.

78
00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.705
It just runs a program,
does input, does output.

79
00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.820
And the shell is the thing that
interacts with the operating system.

80
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.449
And so, you can technically start
a terminal and started off and say no JS,

81
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.030
all right?

82
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.358
So, you can actually launch a terminal
in no JS, it launches the program.

83
00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.580
And then you can only interact with no JS.

84
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.180
And the moment you quit no JS, it will
also kinda quit that entire session also.

85
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.630
Your terminal will also quit because
there's nothing left to run.

86
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.400
It's done.

87
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.810
And so, that's kinda the main difference
between a shell and a terminal.

88
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.370
And it's good to know these things.

89
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.410
I didn't really know these things for
a long time.

90
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.867
Is it super important I mean
in our day to day life.

91
00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:55.505
It's not like super important to
know these fine grained differences.

92
00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.417
But you should at least
minimally know that.

93
00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.234
And so, to kinda really drive this home.

94
00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:01.910
Let me show you something kinda neat.

95
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.690
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
relaunch that docker instance.

96
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.533
Let's clear everything,

97
00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:08.700
I'll zoom in on just a little bit more
to make it a little bit easier to read.

98
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.930
And we're gonna go apt install zsh,
one more time.

99
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.700
It's gonna do all that.

100
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.780
Yep, let's install just zsh.

101
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.080
And so now that zsh is running,
I'm gonna do this.

102
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.730
I'm gonna go zsh.

103
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.350
So, when I press that, I want you to see
the difference because the prompt changes.

104
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.028
You'll see that I've logged,
I have now started the zsh process.

105
00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:30.100
And I can go ps, ps is a way for
you to do a lot of process stuff.

106
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.020
I'm gonna go, -o pid and ppid and
look for everything that's running zsh.

107
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.410
And it's gonna say, hey, there's one PID.

108
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.210
It's ideas 98, its parent is 1, right?

109
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.190
That's the shell that was
launched when we launched docker.

110
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.690
So, I'm gonna copy and paste, this just
so, I don't have to do that again.

111
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.340
Actually, let's not do it that way.

112
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.460
Let's go up here.

113
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.800
Let's go back and yank that.

114
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.340
There we go.

115
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.390
All right, so now let's relaunch zsh and
then let's relaunch that.

116
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.290
Look at what happens here.

117
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.590
The PID that we were on is now the parent
to this PID, which is a new zsh, right?

118
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.860
So we can re-zsh it again and
then we can redo that.

119
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.003
And you'll notice once again,
the PID that was the child before.

120
00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:18.640
The one that we just launched,
is now the parent.

121
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.900
And now there's a new one.

122
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.001
So, the shell experience you can just
launch over and over again within itself.

123
00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:24.960
And you're still just launching a program.

124
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.450
And when I type in things,
it's like, hey, this doesn't exist.

125
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.360
I could exit this, but
I haven't exited zsh all the way.

126
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.959
Because now I've moved up from 125 to 121.

127
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.640
Accept that, now I'm likely in 98, right?

128
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.092
I'm in 98.
And my parents want are the standard or

129
00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:42.490
the one that was launched with docker.

130
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.440
Now, if we were to do the exact
same thing, let's paste that in.

131
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.570
You'll see, hey,
there's no zsh running at all right?

132
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.290
So, now we're kinda in the top level
one that we've, that ran with docker.

133
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.520
I can exit that, now I'm out of docker.

134
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.772
So, hopefully that kinda
illuminates a little bit more.

135
00:05:56.772 --> 00:05:59.060
The difference between the shell and
the terminal.

136
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.628
I had one terminal that whole time.

137
00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:03.760
But I opened what, four separate
shells all within each other.

138
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.330
So, they are different and you can
interact with them differently, right?

139
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.320
Shells can be great.

140
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.930
There's a lot of point counterpoint.

141
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.450
People will tell you,
you're absolutely wrong.

142
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.620
You're an idiot.

143
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.283
You're whatever and then if you use the
right one, you're based, you're awesome,

144
00:06:17.283 --> 00:06:19.011
you're blessed,
you got all the right terms, right?

145
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:23.649
So, people are gonna talk wild on
the Internet about all the different

146
00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:24.680
bashes right?

147
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.358
Or all the different shells, so
you got bash, zsh, tsh, bish, fish.

148
00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:31.218
Me personally, I'm like bish please,
I'm gonna use zsh, okay.

149
00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:33.246
I'm not gonna be using bish,
that's ridiculous.

150
00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:35.360
But, it's just because
that's the one I wanna use.

151
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.620
By the way, I made that meme on Twitter.

152
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.160
No one liked it.

153
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.350
I thought it was really good.

154
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.840
Okay, I thought it was really good,
no like that one.

155
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.566
So, I just use zsh and
I, yes, I use OhMyZsh.

156
00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.831
Cuz honestly,
I'm person that I love configuring things,

157
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:49.309
I love making them better.

158
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.485
But I also have limited time and so,

159
00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:54.178
I kinda choose where I
want to spend my time.

160
00:06:54.178 --> 00:06:58.101
Where I think I'm gonna have the most
impact, on just my day to day life.

161
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.530
So, this is one of those items that
I just farm out to somebody else.

162
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.878
So, I just use OhMyZsh,
gives me a pretty prompt,

163
00:07:03.878 --> 00:07:05.880
gives me an easy way to add plugins.

164
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.430
I don't really need to think about it.

165
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.720
Awesome, good to go.

166
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.796
That's kind of, my lifestyle is that,

167
00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:13.739
not everything needs to be
configured to the nth degree.

168
00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:14.605
Even though you can, so you really could.

169
00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:18.280
So, personal opinion,
just choose anything.

170
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.730
Learn about it a little bit.

171
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.513
But honestly, go get good at core utils.

172
00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:23.831
Go get good at other parts
of your operating system.

173
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:27.840
And take advantage of tools that
are already built and are amazing, right?

174
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.670
That's personal opinion about the shell.

175
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.600
I don't think a lot of people
have the same opinion.

176
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.919
I'm sure someone eventually will
make a YouTube video, saying why,

177
00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:36.690
what I said is very dangerous.

178
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.900
Everything is very dangerous when it's
someone else's opinion, so careful.

179
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.940
Careful with what you use on the shells.

180
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.860
Anyways, apply what you learn.

181
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.295
If you have an Ansible script.

182
00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:48.091
Once you just get zsh or
fish or whatever you've decided,

183
00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:50.381
put that as part of your
installation process.

184
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.519
Get a docker container that is
just a basic docker container.

185
00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:56.792
And see if you can create an Ansible
process to install the shell that

186
00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:57.318
you want.

187
00:07:57.318 --> 00:07:58.650
And make sure it works.

188
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.730
Right, it's fun, by the way fun side note.

189
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.232
When I did do this talk, I think I already
said this, I can't remember if I did.

190
00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:05.571
But that zsh auto suggestions.

191
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:08.790
I literally could not figure out why
I wasn't getting auto suggestions.

192
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.700
It took me like 10
minutes to figure it out.

193
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.905
And so,
because I had the new docker container.

194
00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:15.251
It's cuz even though
I've installed it before.

195
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:17.550
It's so
easy to forget all these little things.

196
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.920
I'm like, why is my zsh slightly off?

197
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.560
I don't get it.

198
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.590
It's frustrating, all right.

199
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.980
Anyways, that's all, that's I wanted to
talk about window managers and shells.

200
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.210
I kept it really light because I didn't
wanna spend too much time there.

201
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.286
Like I said, I don't think there's huge.

202
00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:37.257
I don't think there's a lot you get to
gain out of those ones comparatively to

203
00:08:37.257 --> 00:08:38.060
other topics.
