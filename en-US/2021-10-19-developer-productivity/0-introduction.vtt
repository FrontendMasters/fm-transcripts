1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.099
So I did wanna start off this whole
thing with my first big interview.

2
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.282
And what I mean by that is
that I went through college.

3
00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:09.810
I've been fired as a server
once when I was younger.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.796
Right, none of those were
really big interviews, right.

5
00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.397
You just have to be like,
I wanna expand my horizon and boom,

6
00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.131
you got your job being a busboy, right.

7
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:17.132
It's not very hard.

8
00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:21.670
But when I was in college
I did my own startup.

9
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.610
It was really, really good learned a lot,
lost a lot of money.

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.433
Then I joined like a smaller startup
that's like been the startup phase for

11
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.168
eight years.

12
00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:30.199
It was really terrible.

13
00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.443
Then my very first kind of
big interview happened, and

14
00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:36.488
I still remember going in there and
being nervous.

15
00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:38.548
I've never been nervous for an interview.

16
00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:43.174
I was for time back to back Champion
of ACM programming local competitions,

17
00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:47.815
won a regional felt really good,
great on the whiteboard, super excited.

18
00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.560
But this one I was nervous because this
one, they told me my salary up front.

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.780
I was nervous.

20
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.023
I've never made a lot of money,
lived off to $6 a day,

21
00:00:56.023 --> 00:01:00.105
very like, my goodness,
this is gonna be a huge opportunity here.

22
00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.386
So I was very excited, very nervous and

23
00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:06.892
going through the whole thing I felt I
was just nailing the problems, right?

24
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:10.919
Doing it in Java on the board because of
course good college student knows Java at

25
00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:11.950
that point in life.

26
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.130
This is during the mid 2000s.

27
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.885
And then they get to a question
where they asked me this.

28
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:22.914
All right, I want you to kind
of fix a problem we have.

29
00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:26.230
We have a static site with
1000s of files on it.

30
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.936
And some hacker got in there and
decided that they were gonna put a little

31
00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:34.713
advertisement for
their site throughout our code base.

32
00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:37.430
And so now you have to go through and

33
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.665
find this string in 1000s of files and
remove it.

34
00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:44.340
And I was, wow, okay,
I think I could to that and

35
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.690
they're like let's just start
off first with something simple.

36
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.812
Can you first identify all
the files that hang the string.

37
00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:55.340
I'm about to do this problem and
I'm a little nervous.

38
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.087
So I get on Java and I get that buffered
reader out string tokenizer and

39
00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:03.997
I'm tokenizing and I'm walking through
they're standing folders, every directory,

40
00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:06.339
I see I recourse back through and
do it all.

41
00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:08.666
I think I did actually
a breadth first search.

42
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.790
So I just added all the files
to the end of a queue and

43
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.467
then popped off the front of the queue.

44
00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:18.144
But nonetheless, I did all these things
got done with it took like 40 minutes.

45
00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:23.239
It was a beautiful piece of
fine Java done on a Whiteboard.

46
00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:30.199
And the interviewer went, all right yeah,
that is definitely a solution that works.

47
00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.295
Have you heard of grep?

48
00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:37.478
And at that point, I was like, what he's
like grep and I was like crap using grep.

49
00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:40.869
And I was just like, I don't even
know what you're trying to say to me.

50
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.593
And I felt so dang silly.

51
00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:48.082
And that was kind of like this point in my
life where I always thought I was great at

52
00:02:48.082 --> 00:02:48.620
things.

53
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.252
And then just in that
small little statement,

54
00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:53.554
it kinda crumbled a little bit, right?

55
00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:57.623
I didn't realize how much I didn't know,
until that moment.

56
00:02:57.623 --> 00:03:00.858
And then when I saw how
easy it was with grep,

57
00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:04.195
the amount of shame I
felt obviously went up.

58
00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:09.336
I was just like, my goodness, I could
have solved this in 15 characters and

59
00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:12.972
I just spent 45 minutes,
solving something in Java.

60
00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:17.203
This is ridiculous, I should have been
able to do this much, much better.

61
00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:22.040
And from that moment on,
I've always tried to take more time in

62
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.341
learning what is the best
way to do things.

63
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:28.228
And so for the last seven years or
eight years since then,

64
00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:30.347
I've been just really focusing on that.

65
00:03:30.347 --> 00:03:34.173
And this whole talk is gonna be
the summation of all those things.

66
00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:39.313
And really in the last two years,
it's really kinda of been my focus.

67
00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:43.582
And I kinda of came up with a little
phrase that the length of knowledge is

68
00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.303
a measurement of its value.

69
00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:48.403
And what I mean by that is that,
obviously if you know CPR and

70
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:52.185
you get into a situation which you need
CPR you only get to use it once, but

71
00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:53.864
it's super valuable, right?

72
00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:57.207
That one moment is super critical and
super valuable.

73
00:03:57.207 --> 00:04:00.517
You may know it your whole life and
never get an opportunity to use it.

74
00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:04.096
But you get to know it, it does not
necessarily change that much, and

75
00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:07.636
you can use it at any point in your
life over the course of 50 years.

76
00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:11.954
And so the value of it's really high,
even if you can't use it, whereas like,

77
00:04:11.954 --> 00:04:14.156
say React Hooks, you know React Hooks.

78
00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:17.312
Four years ago, you couldn't use React
Hooks because I don't think React Hooks

79
00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:18.439
were even a thing back then.

80
00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.879
And maybe in four years from now, there'll
be something completely different.

81
00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.075
And so, the length of that knowledge
is not necessarily wide, but

82
00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:26.570
it's very applicable today.

83
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.539
And so today, I really wanted to focus on
knowledge that can be used over the course

84
00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.428
of your entire career,
as opposed to just something that will be

85
00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:38.472
applicable in today or
in your specific job role.

86
00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:42.852
I also wanted to make sure that it's more
operating system independent, meaning that

87
00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:46.514
if today you're using subsystem on
Windows tomorrow, you're on Mac.

88
00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:49.641
The next day you're on
Arch Linux by the wing people,

89
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:53.897
you can use anything that I've showed
you today on any of those systems.

90
00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:57.761
And I think that that's really
where the power of this comes from,

91
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.224
is that the value of it will
just be useful forever, right?

92
00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:03.030
It's gonna be the whole career.

93
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.301
And so let's kinda move in.

94
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:09.789
And so I know that there's probably a lot
of you out there that are watching that

95
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.790
this is kinda their standard
operating condition.

96
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.878
You get onto your laptop, you open it up,
you open up the VS code and

97
00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:18.784
that's all you open, right?

98
00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:23.538
Everything you do is within your
editor it's a very Emacs lifestyle.

99
00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:28.175
It becomes your OS, I'm sure there's a web
browser even built into VS code, and

100
00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:30.234
you can just go there and this is it.

101
00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:32.922
And so there's some things that
are kind of really inconvenient,

102
00:05:32.922 --> 00:05:35.994
somethings that are super convenient and
you just kinda deal with the things

103
00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:38.833
that you don't like, or
you don't know that there's better paths.

104
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:44.859
And this is just your experience and this
was my experience for a long, long time.

105
00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:48.193
I didn't have VS code though,
I had NetBeans I don't know if you know

106
00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:50.856
about this greatest
productivity tool ever created.

107
00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:55.214
And then if you do have terminals,
your terminal experience probably looks

108
00:05:55.214 --> 00:05:59.041
a little something like this,
where you just have so many of them.

109
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:02.340
And every time you have to find
that one task that's running,

110
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.539
you just have to do that Ctrl+Tab or
I don't know what it is on Mac, Cmd+Tab.

111
00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.263
All the way through until you can find the
right tab that has the running process and

112
00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:12.580
do something with it.

113
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.112
Very frustrating, I mean, my goodness.

114
00:06:15.112 --> 00:06:21.660
This picture alone, I can feel my cortisol
rising slowly just looking at it.

115
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.966
And then of course Windows, I am positive
a lot of you out there do the Cmd+Tab,

116
00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:30.274
Ctrl+Tab kind of lifestyle where you have
to click through manually all of your

117
00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:30.870
Windows.

118
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.437
Or even worse you probably use
that exploded view and play a game

119
00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:38.830
of Where's Waldo, looking for that one
thing you need open jumping into it.

120
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.962
I mean these things are just
huge time sinks and

121
00:06:41.962 --> 00:06:46.872
ultimately what they really come down
to is you get some sort of fatigue.

122
00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:51.813
Every single day you're performing
these really simple tasks over and

123
00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:56.432
over and over again, and
they do take some level of mental effort.

124
00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:00.533
I remember when I used to kind of Cmd+Tab
through all my tasks or all my windows,

125
00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:04.775
I would actually look and kind of roughly
calculate which direction was shorter.

126
00:07:04.775 --> 00:07:08.938
And either do a Shift+Tab or
a Tab just to get there faster, right?

127
00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:11.916
Or you're using these desktops and they
have these nice transitions to them and

128
00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:13.526
you're searching through each desktop.

129
00:07:13.526 --> 00:07:15.470
It's just so much thought and

130
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.841
going into trying to do the thing
you wanna do and not just doing it.

131
00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:22.931
And so by the way, that's my TEDx talk.

132
00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:26.400
I hope you appreciate my TEDx talk,
Search Fatigue, it's gonna be up there,

133
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.619
it's gonna be right up
there with power stances.

134
00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.787
Anyways, by the way, I don't use VS Code,
just in case anyone is wondering,

135
00:07:31.787 --> 00:07:33.237
I just wanted to get that out there.

136
00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.755
But there is actually another way.

137
00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.470
There is a better way.

138
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.958
There's ways I think,
that could really make your life more

139
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.798
pleasant as a developer awaits for
you to be able to really move all

140
00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:49.587
that clutter out of the way and
just get right to it.

141
00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:53.848
And so you're probably asking, well,
what is developer Productivity besides for

142
00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.319
being oddly capitalized with the P and
not the D?

143
00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.357
That just happens when you're
creating a presentation.

144
00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.255
Things happen, nobody knows why.

145
00:08:00.255 --> 00:08:03.169
I kind of made this really important,

146
00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:08.008
very well thought through diagram so
let's kind of go over it.

147
00:08:08.008 --> 00:08:09.231
So there's soft skills.

148
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:11.103
And if you don't know
what soft skills are,

149
00:08:11.103 --> 00:08:14.153
they're kind of the really hip phrase
right now in the Silicon Valley.

150
00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:15.489
Everyone's all about the soft skills.

151
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:20.147
Soft skills are your ability to
collaborate, to communicate, to elaborate,

152
00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:24.664
everything that kinda ends with ate and
you just got to be really great at it and

153
00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:26.835
it's just like the focus right now.

154
00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:29.102
And obviously the opposite of
soft skills are hard skills.

155
00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:33.876
Because that's the only thing that makes
sense, I always considered hard skills.

156
00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:38.115
Like how good are you technically
at this you really know React.

157
00:08:38.115 --> 00:08:38.869
These are your hard skills.

158
00:08:38.869 --> 00:08:41.127
By the way hard skills I just
made that up a few weeks ago so

159
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:44.077
don't use that anywhere, no one will
know what you're talking about.

160
00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:48.377
And this is this side,
you can be really great at hard skills and

161
00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:51.635
be completely lacking at soft skills,
right?

162
00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:55.051
Unable to communicate or vice versa, you
can be really great at communicating and

163
00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.439
displaying ideas but
not really able to implement them.

164
00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:00.722
But I kinda feel like there's a third set
of skills that we don't talk about and

165
00:09:00.722 --> 00:09:02.016
I didn't necessarily plan for

166
00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:04.472
in this diagram called
developer productivity, right?

167
00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:07.367
It's your ability to transfer
between these two and

168
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.944
really kind of move
everything out of the way.

169
00:09:09.944 --> 00:09:12.953
And so I felt like this diagram was pretty
good because developer productivity

170
00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.740
doesn't make you better developer, right.

171
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.215
It doesn't mean that you're
now gonna be an all star.

172
00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:18.455
You're not a 10x developer.

173
00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:23.893
It's just a new set of skills that
help you in your day to day life.

174
00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:29.137
And so my definition of course, is all
the things that separate you from working,

175
00:09:29.137 --> 00:09:33.173
and not everything I'm gonna talk
about today will be for you.

176
00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:38.354
But the good news is not everything I talk
about today builds on the previous item.

177
00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:43.095
That means, as I talked about one topic,
it can be completely disjointed, though

178
00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:47.722
related to the previous topic, and so
everything will have its own usefulness.

179
00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:50.142
And not all operating systems
will be as good, right.

180
00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:52.606
Windows will not necessarily be as
good for some of the things, but

181
00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:53.933
it'll be better for other things.

182
00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:58.467
So just take each one with a grain of
salt, see how it fits into your lifestyle,

183
00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:00.815
see if it really makes it better for you.

184
00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.975
It's gonna take a little bit
of exploring on your behalf.

185
00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:06.351
And lastly,
if you do a lot of these things,

186
00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:09.961
you are gonna be able to have what I
refer to as the by the way factor.

187
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.259
Now if you don't know what
the by the way factor is,

188
00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:13.819
I've already said it a few times.

189
00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:16.719
A good example is that
I use Vim by the way.

190
00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:20.439
Now immediately I get to just
drop that in a conversation.

191
00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:21.705
People think I'm cooler.

192
00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.985
I use Tmux by the way,
I type on Dvorak, by the way, right?

193
00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.377
You get to just use all those phrases.

194
00:10:26.377 --> 00:10:28.583
Now I can't say I use Arch Linux,
by the way.

195
00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:32.424
I mean that's like the ultimate
by the way, I'm not there yet.

196
00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.895
One day I'll have it when
my kids go to college and

197
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:38.048
I have enough time to finally
customize my operating system.

198
00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:40.791
Then I'll have the full by the way set.

199
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:45.613
So here's kind of like the itinerary
of what we're talking about.

200
00:10:45.613 --> 00:10:48.754
Now this is obviously a very shrewd yet

201
00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:52.294
crude diagram that I
made not too long ago.

202
00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:54.663
The first part I'm calling it the 0 to 60,
right?

203
00:10:54.663 --> 00:10:59.492
This is kind of you and your computer
becoming what you wanted to be.

204
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.520
I find that this section I
thought was the most boring but

205
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.916
every single time I need to do anything on
my computer, it is the best thing ever.

206
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:07.856
I'll get more into that.

207
00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:11.519
Next, it's kind of like
a navigation terminal section,

208
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.706
really just deep diving into that
kinda coming up with some tools,

209
00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:19.462
building things out,
making it into what you want it to be.

210
00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:21.522
And lastly, we're gonna just be
talking about software and tools.

211
00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:23.609
Now there's kinda like
a little surprise at the end.

212
00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:28.727
I'm pretty excited about that last one,
we'll do something pretty awesome with it,

213
00:11:28.727 --> 00:11:32.599
but really just the future and
current tools that are available.

214
00:11:32.599 --> 00:11:34.765
And so let's move on.

215
00:11:34.765 --> 00:11:36.559
And so why do I care?

216
00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:38.193
Why do I care about any of this?

217
00:11:38.193 --> 00:11:40.645
Because this takes a lot of time,
a lot of effort.

218
00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:44.496
Why am I telling you about
these kinda mundane tools?

219
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:49.167
Well, I like to tell the story
about a time in 2016 I believe I

220
00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.727
had this problem with
a Netflix television app.

221
00:11:52.727 --> 00:11:56.815
Now if you don't know anything
about the Netflix television app,

222
00:11:56.815 --> 00:12:00.907
it's a c++ application that has
a cadences for these releases.

223
00:12:00.907 --> 00:12:05.691
And so when I say hey,
I'm using say the app version for 20,

224
00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:08.638
that is gonna be at some point in time.

225
00:12:08.638 --> 00:12:14.259
And if there's a bug, we're gonna have to
open up that version of the c++ code base,

226
00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:19.202
compile it, get it ready, run it out and
go, okay, what's going on here?

227
00:12:19.202 --> 00:12:21.547
And obviously we have some tools
around it to make it really simple.

228
00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:23.961
But nonetheless,
it's actually like hard version,

229
00:12:23.961 --> 00:12:26.329
something that is not very
familiar in the web world.

230
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:31.147
And I went over to one of the lead
developers over there his name is Anders,

231
00:12:31.147 --> 00:12:35.421
and I said hey Anders, like on this
version I am seeing this bug and

232
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.686
I don't know why.

233
00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:39.361
What's going on, and
he turned to his computer.

234
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:43.460
He's in the middle of work press like
three buttons, get menu popped up.

235
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.102
He jumped over to that version, it started
immediately building, he was just bam bam,

236
00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:49.432
bam and I was blown away.

237
00:12:49.432 --> 00:12:52.070
I was like,
how in the world is he doing that?

238
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.134
This is incredible, whatever I've been
doing is evidently wrong because that

239
00:12:57.134 --> 00:13:02.134
would have taken me 10 minutes just to
get set up and he did it in 15 seconds.

240
00:13:02.134 --> 00:13:07.163
The amount of just effort he does
not have to put in to doing mundane,

241
00:13:07.163 --> 00:13:11.057
repetitive tasks is credible,
I learn this skill.

242
00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:13.660
But one thing I noticed right
away is he was using Emacs.

243
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.648
And if you're not familiar with Emacs,
Emacs learning curve is rather difficult

244
00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:20.954
so I decided that I can do
non-differentiable, learning curves.

245
00:13:20.954 --> 00:13:25.635
So I chose a less difficult but
still difficult editor, Vim.

246
00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:29.715
I find that this learning curve just feels
better for me because once I finally

247
00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:32.744
got to that level, it's just hard and
I can deal with it.

248
00:13:32.744 --> 00:13:37.338
And so I went with Vim, I started diving
further and further and at that point,

249
00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:39.787
I was using IntelliJ with the Vim plugin.

250
00:13:39.787 --> 00:13:43.739
It was a long and
difficult road for quite some time.

251
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:48.367
And if you're wondering hashtag,
self promotion here.

252
00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:51.739
I do have a VIM Fundamentals course
here on Frontend Masters, my goodness,

253
00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:53.543
like I plan this little loop right there.

254
00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:55.315
All right, so who am I?

255
00:13:55.315 --> 00:13:57.594
I get to work at Netflix.

256
00:13:57.594 --> 00:13:58.906
I think that that is awesome.

257
00:13:58.906 --> 00:13:59.725
I love Netflix.

258
00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:01.204
It's been a lot of fun.

259
00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:02.791
For the last couple years,

260
00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:06.043
my primary focus has been more
on kind of network stuff.

261
00:14:06.043 --> 00:14:09.742
I've written part of http2,
written a Web Socket protocol.

262
00:14:09.742 --> 00:14:13.836
All the stuff for our television app
to kind of change it in certain ways.

263
00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:15.978
It's been a lot and lot of fun.

264
00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:19.583
Apparently, what I'm best known for,
though, is streaming on Twitch.

265
00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:24.236
I'm the guy that codes and screams and
reads chat at an unusual pace.

266
00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:27.774
It's just I have too much energy and I'm
like I just gotta get it out of me and so

267
00:14:27.774 --> 00:14:29.960
that feels like a great
place to get it out of me.

268
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.320
I also make slightly meaning and
informative videos on YouTube,

269
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.160
mostly meaning, but some of them.

270
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.883
I'm married to a beautiful wife, that
was y best accomplishment, thus far, and

271
00:14:39.883 --> 00:14:41.116
of course four kids,

272
00:14:41.116 --> 00:14:45.505
it's increased by 33% since the last
time I believe I recorded the show.

273
00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:50.239
And so this is great, new kid awesome
by the way, thanks for asking.

274
00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:51.656
I genuinely appreciate that.

275
00:14:51.656 --> 00:14:57.992
And I do wanna kinda stress
this one more time, which is,

276
00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:03.411
everything we do today
can be done in piecemeal.

277
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.546
You don't have to see 500 things to do and
go wow,

278
00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.053
I can't do any of these things right now.

279
00:15:09.053 --> 00:15:10.761
How am I ever gonna do all these things.

280
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.278
I will show you various pieces of
technology that are really cool and

281
00:15:14.278 --> 00:15:16.635
gonna make your life significantly better.

282
00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:19.002
But you can just go,
okay, I remember those,

283
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:23.100
I hear them at some point when I have a
time out, investigate one of many of them.
