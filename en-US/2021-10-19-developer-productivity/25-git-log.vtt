00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
I want to show you one
really awesome thing before

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.107
we're just kind of we're done here.

3
00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:09.710
So let's go to refactoring and have you
ever had a problem where you want to know

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.291
how something's changed in
your system over time, right?

5
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.138
It's not that simple, say you have a class
that is used throughout your system and

6
00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:20.234
you just want to see, hey,
how's it been used throughout time?

7
00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:24.120
So a lot of people don't know too much
about get log, get log's fantastic, right?

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.370
So anyway, so we do get logged, right and
what you can do is you can actually

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.436
provide something called a dash s,
a dash s will search in the commits.

10
00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:35.849
And if the thing you put in
there exists within the diff,

11
00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:37.669
it will capture that commit.

12
00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:41.134
So I'm in a refactoring branch, if you
do not know what we're refactoring it,

13
00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:43.790
it's named after the book by
Martin Fowler, Refactoring.

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.740
106 stands for exact function, so
when I do a 106, I can see every single

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.329
commit that was related that contained
the numbers 106 inside of it.

16
00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.323
So even though there's 153 commits,

17
00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:01.379
I think 157 will now like 158
after the 180, my goodness.

18
00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.863
After that last little test commit I did,
I can actually see them and

19
00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:07.364
I can follow a commit.

20
00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:10.679
Is that one line,
is it one line, there we go,

21
00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.211
I can just see only the commits that
contain a diff that contains that phrase.

22
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:20.651
So, if I wanted to go see a say a class,
I'm curious how this one class

23
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.798
has moved throughout our system,
say in the last five commits.

24
00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:28.138
You could just put that class in there and
see all the commits and

25
00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:29.789
walk through each one of them.

26
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.707
And because I use vim by the way, I can
actually use GC log, and I can do this and

27
00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:36.927
then I get it into a quick fix list.

28
00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:40.146
Which looks even better because then I can
just walk through those commits like that.

29
00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:43.154
Now that is like some serious by the way,
right there, all right,

30
00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.456
that's pretty fantastic.

31
00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.500
So you can actually walk through all
those commits really quickly, so

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.090
I want to kind of give you that
Tic Tock style tip right here.

33
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.184
Because I just find this to be super
useful, this search thing, my goodness,

34
00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:55.703
it's just so great, right?

35
00:01:55.703 --> 00:01:58.201
Because sometimes you just
have a weird behavior and

36
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.790
you just kind of want to see how things
have been used and changed over time.

37
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.021
I love doing that, it also gives me
really good perspective into the system.

38
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:09.294
How it's been used, where it's been
used and why it's being used and

39
00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:13.730
how it's being changed, fun fact
bonus content, all right hand raised

40
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.561
&gt;&gt; That searching the git commit the log

41
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.991
message or the actual commit
&gt;&gt; The actual commit, so look at this one,

42
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:23.497
this one says refactoring testing, right?

43
00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:27.626
So here let's take off one line,
let's see what do we got here,

44
00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:32.307
this one contains nothing to do
with the word 106, right, nothing.

45
00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:36.561
This is when I included JavaScript
into this refactoring project, so

46
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.177
what we can do is we can we can
check some of these things out.

47
00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:45.736
Let's go, let's open up [INAUDIBLE] just
because it's way cooler to us anyways.

48
00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:49.165
Let's see, let's go and
there we go [INAUDIBLE] JavaScript,

49
00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:51.992
notice that okay,
nothing in here, nothing in here.

50
00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:53.581
But if I search 106,

51
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.913
you'll notice that it actually does it
changes a file in the 106 directory.

52
00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:03.697
And so I believe that is what's causing it
is because there is a 106 right in there.

53
00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.921
One of these files are all existing in
some repo named 106 or this right here.

54
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.171
It's one of the two either I've
mentioned it right there or

55
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:11.703
it's a file being changed with 106.

56
00:03:11.703 --> 00:03:16.374
I can't remember if it's one or the other,
but either way it appeared in the diff,

57
00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:18.733
and so therefore, it's being flagged.

58
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:23.410
And so for me, that's super cool,
I'm pretty sure it's actually only

59
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.099
the diff here, we can actually just
check right now, man get log dash s.

60
00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.054
Look at the difference that changed
the number of currencies in the specified

61
00:03:31.054 --> 00:03:31.561
[INAUDIBLE].

62
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.561
Let's see, yeah, okay, the additions and
deletions, there we go,

63
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:37.523
it's useful when you're looking for
an exact block of code, right?

64
00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:41.126
And you want to know the history of
that since it first came into being, so

65
00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:43.268
it's like a really cool kind of fun thing.

66
00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:47.275
I just think it's great, I love those,
I love those kind of little tricks,

67
00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:48.540
they feel super sweet.

68
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.695
And every now and
then they will save your bacon and

69
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.321
you just need to note that one time,
right, it's like CPR.

70
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.680
You only need it when you really need it,
and when you really need it,

71
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.500
you're happy to have it
