1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.860
So I'll be using docker on and
off throughout this presentation.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.520
You don't have to know
anything about docker.

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.009
The only thing you really need to know
about docker is that I didn't wanna

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.688
have to try to go into my system
right now and start sudo apt,

5
00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:14.695
purging all the libraries out.

6
00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:16.529
And then deleting all my RC files and

7
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.930
doing all that to create a clean
environment on my computer.

8
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.473
Instead, I just create a new Ubuntu focal,

9
00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:27.370
which I believe is 2004 docker container
with some basic libraries installed.

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.087
So I can just have,
here's a clean environment, let me

11
00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:36.004
now perform these tasks on it to show
you kind of how things are being done.

12
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.642
And you can see that docker container and
more right here on this link here,

13
00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:40.930
I'll just open it up now.

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.921
It's a pretty straightforward
docker container, I forgot I have.

15
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.190
So nothing's really in it, right,
like I said, it has pretty much nothing.

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.674
Do a little bit of this,
add a couple libraries,

17
00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:54.680
curl git ansible build-essentials.

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.009
Which by the way,
build-essentials, I have yet

19
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.792
to spell this library correct once ever.

20
00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:05.026
Every time, I have screwed it up, and so
it just has to be in a docker container at

21
00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:07.761
this point cuz I'm not gonna
remember how to do it.

22
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:12.123
All right, this is the moment where
hopefully you feel as excited as I do cuz

23
00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:16.019
I'm trying not to scream here,
I'm trying to keep my voice down.

24
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:18.983
So we don't blow out the mic or
anything, but this is very exciting.

25
00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:20.820
At least, I'm very excited.

26
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.351
So let's get started, and
I think the first topic we're gonna cover,

27
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:31.370
I thought was the most boring and
the worst part of this whole presentation.

28
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.754
And then about two months ago, I had
such a magical moment that I was like,

29
00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:38.350
this is the best thing in the universe.

30
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070
Obviously, I'm kinda giving away what
it is right now, it's called ansible.

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.201
Well, we'll kinda get there in a moment,
but

32
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.426
not everything is gonna
feel great right away.

33
00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.664
But when you actually have
it become super useful,

34
00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:56.065
it's gonna be one of those tools that
you're gonna love for a long time.

35
00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:59.355
So I'm gonna try to start off a lot of
these sections with a problem statement.

36
00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:03.501
And so that way you can kinda see
what's going on, why I'm doing it,

37
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.445
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

38
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.628
So let's just pretend we have
this problem right here.

39
00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.758
I have a new computer, it's not
the problem, and I want to install zsh.

40
00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:16.091
For those that aren't familiar with zsh or
z shell, as some people call it,

41
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:20.577
effectively all it is, actually it's
the default shell I believe on Mac OSX.

42
00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:23.878
And it's just a little bit easier,
more friendly,

43
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:28.050
nicer version of just standard
shell that comes on Ubuntu.

44
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.828
So I want to install.

45
00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.535
So I have to go through
a series of things to do.

46
00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:33.340
So let's actually just open up
my docker container right now.

47
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.250
Here we go, here's a nice clean docker
container, I'll zoom it in for you.

48
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.550
If I were to try to run zsh,
it's not even available.

49
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.263
So I have a brand new system and
I need to install it.

50
00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:47.182
So, of course, I'm gonna go,
apt install, what is it?

51
00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:48.860
zsh, there we go.

52
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.580
I now have it installed, this is
fantastic, or looking really, really good.

53
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.810
So I have zsh installed, but of course,
there's a little bit of a problem.

54
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.340
When I close my terminal,
what happens when I reopen it back up?

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.590
Well, it's gonna use the default
shell that's been set.

56
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.969
So I got to also remember to do this
which I never remember what to do.

57
00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.780
I'm gonna have to grab which zsh and
set it to my shell.

58
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.460
Okay, I'm gonna change the shell to use
zsh, so the next time I open the terminal,

59
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.620
everything will be nice,
I'm using the program I want to use.

60
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.223
Well, I don't just use zsh shell though,
I technically use oh-my-zsh now.

61
00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:27.230
This is the part where people who are
really into zsh kinda make fun of people

62
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.780
that use oh-my-zsh.

63
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.800
I consider this a -1 by the weight point.

64
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.125
Please, let's not say anything mean
about the broadcaster right now.

65
00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:41.573
But so I gotta remember, okay, I gotta
go grab this URL, I wanna curl it in and

66
00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:45.957
execute it on the machine cuz remember,
anything that's on the Internet is

67
00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:49.128
perfectly fine to curl and
just pipe directly into sh.

68
00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.272
You can even do it with sudo,
it's fantastic.

69
00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.600
By the way, that's a joke,
please don't actually do that.

70
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.779
Look at things first.

71
00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:55.846
And then I got to remember to do this.

72
00:03:55.846 --> 00:04:00.383
Now this part is a little bit confusing,
I gotta go to my zshrc, and

73
00:04:00.383 --> 00:04:02.014
that's at right here.

74
00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:03.760
What is it?
zshrc, yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.940
And looking for plugins, where are you?

76
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.446
There you are.

77
00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:12.150
Then go here, and I gotta remember to
do zsh-autosuggestions, I believe.

78
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.574
And there we go, we got that [SOUND].

79
00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:16.436
And then we got to go back here and
what else?

80
00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:19.801
Yeah, we need to actually curl
down the repository of it, and

81
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.628
install it into the zsh plugins.

82
00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.553
There we go.

83
00:04:23.553 --> 00:04:26.340
Look at that, I'm done,
I've now set up zsh.

84
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.639
If I've done zsh correctly,
when I type zsh, it should be beautiful.

85
00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.780
My goodness, look at how
beautiful that looks right there.

86
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.839
And now look, if I type in a command,
when I start typing again,

87
00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.800
it starts auto filling it for me.

88
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.918
Look at that, fantastic, I've set up
my shell, I'm ready to start working.

89
00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:46.168
Well, I mean, technically, I only set up
one of many pieces of software that I need

90
00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:48.740
to get set up for
my machine to start working.

91
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.931
I guess I should probably start installing
Node now with NPM, then get my Node

92
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:55.570
manager out and then install the versions
of Node that I actually want to do.

93
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.180
You can kinda see this problem,
we've all done it.

94
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.271
We've all been here where you're
constantly having to install

95
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:07.806
a bunch of things just to get
started using a new machine.

96
00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.120
This happens all the time.
