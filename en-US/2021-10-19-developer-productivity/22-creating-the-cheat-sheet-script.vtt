1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.060
We are creating the greatest scripts
known to man, called the cheat sheet.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.370
By the way, once again, awesomely straight
line freehand, I can't even believe it.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.844
So let's build that right now,
I can feel it,

4
00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.860
we don't need any anything
extra at this point.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.250
We know how to do FCF,
we know how to use cheat sheet.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640
We know how to write scripts,
we know how to interact with Tmux.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.791
We should just be able to
write this thing right away.

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.010
All right, so let's just do this.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.780
Here we go, so we're in, we're ready.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.480
We're excited, it's write it.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.300
So once again, let's do that
little shebang, a bang, right?

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.950
I think the shebang is very important.

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.239
I'm just going to take it out of here and
paste it up here right?

14
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.560
Now let's start with this cheap thing.

15
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.425
So, the first thing we need to do
is we want a list of languages, and

16
00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:48.070
we want a list of coreutils, now, for
now, let's just keep it pretty simple.

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.492
So it's like these languages and
go in here and

18
00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:57.740
let's go like this golang ccpp TypeScript
Russ because everybody loves rust.

19
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.030
And there we go, let me tell you
about our Lord and Savior Cargo.

20
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.054
So there we go so
there is our languages, so

21
00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:09.590
now we can have some core a utils,
utils and let's go like this.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.036
Let's go find Xargs sed,

23
00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:19.510
that's awkward, awk, there we go.

24
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.250
We got a couple right there,
it looks really nice.

25
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.260
So now we're gonna take these, and

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.090
I'm gonna replace the new lines or
the empty spaces with new lines.

27
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.810
Look at that, where we're just
using tr because tr is funding.

28
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.771
There we go we got that thing I'm gonna
read paste it in their go here we paste in

29
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:34.910
their perfect.

30
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.200
We have tr we have the new lines,
everything looks good.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.051
Now here's something I always do forget
which is when we do echo if we go

32
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:42.964
languages.

33
00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:45.910
And then we go core Udall's
what is going to happen?

34
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.500
Awesome, let's find out, let's use that
really cool way to make my program,

35
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.150
executable.

36
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.750
You'll see right here.

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.021
I just need to add the word silence
because it keeps printing what

38
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.050
I've already done we don't
need to do that, all right?

39
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.117
We made it executable, I'll open up
a new window, and we'll go cheat sheet,

40
00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:02.576
look at this, okay.

41
00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:05.110
Man, I've screwed everything up,
haven't I?

42
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.400
I forgot the most important part which
is Echo, go here, press the dot.

43
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.350
Awesome, go back here.

44
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.900
There we go,

45
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
you'll see right away that everything
looks fantastic up until right here.

46
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.920
We need some new lines.

47
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.780
Now sometimes new lines, there we go.

48
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.130
Let's put it in a new line right here,
why not?

49
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.200
There we go, new line is awesome, right?

50
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.530
Look at that nice little new line.

51
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.497
It just makes me feel all warm and
fuzzy on the inside,

52
00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:28.870
seeing that new line right in there.

53
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.370
So let's fix that,
let's make it into a proper new line.

54
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.114
So now someone did tell me just
recently like two days ago,

55
00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:36.510
I can use dashi I don't
know what dashi does.

56
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.319
I should probably look into
the man pages for that, but

57
00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.630
my assumption it means extended.

58
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.793
There we go, it put in the new line for
me, I don't need to use printf,

59
00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.380
printf forget parentheses,
bad things happen.

60
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.180
There we go, so now we have our items,
we can easily search for

61
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.200
an easily fuzzy find over.

62
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.979
Now, obviously I could make
this a really big list, but for

63
00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.230
the point of this, I don't think I
need to make this as big as possible.

64
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.924
It just needs to be obvious how it works.

65
00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:03.730
So there we go, we have these two things.

66
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.120
And now we need to select
the thing we want.

67
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.310
So really we could do fcf right?

68
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.670
Pipe that into fcf perfect,
so let's just try it out.

69
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.890
Here we go see boom, see?

70
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.240
Beautiful, just always makes me feel so
good when things just work.

71
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.170
How you want them to work.

72
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.480
So now of course, selected,
a little one of those.

73
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.640
There we go, everything is great.

74
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.914
Look at that, we're practically
done with our script at this point.

75
00:03:27.914 --> 00:03:30.398
Now I also learned this recently,
fumbling around,

76
00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.970
trying to make this script
a couple of weeks ago.

77
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.439
On twitch when people repetitively told me
that I am a script getting I don't know

78
00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.360
what I'm doing.

79
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.010
Well, let me show you,
me knowing what I'm doing.

80
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.891
We're gonna echo out languages, and
we're gonna pipe it into grep, and

81
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:44.530
we're gonna do qs effectively.

82
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.726
We're making it silent,
we're not returning the results, and

83
00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:50.850
we just want to know did we find it or
did we not find it?

84
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.340
Is selected within the languages, right?

85
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.894
Cuz remember, if we look right here,
when we use languages,

86
00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:01.810
it's like a different way we do it.

87
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.527
It's a space limited item,

88
00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:07.320
when we use a core utils it's
not a space to limited item.

89
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.370
Again, my goodness, so straight.

90
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.740
So here we go, so let's jump into here.

91
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.510
Go right there, let's just prove it right,
let's go like this echo.

92
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.115
I am language, take that f l go here and
then go I am core youdil there we go,

93
00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:30.105
YOUDIL, that's how I say it,
is that normal?

94
00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:33.161
Probably not, all right,
let's cheat sheet, let's try it with sed,

95
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.695
I AM CORE YOUDIL, perfect.

96
00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:36.505
Let's try type script.

97
00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:37.477
I AM LANGUAGE.

98
00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.627
My goodness, this is going so good.

99
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:42.381
Everything's working, by the way,
this is how I developed bash for

100
00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.237
anyone that wants to know whenever
I'm doing bash type things.

101
00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:48.298
I go back and forth like this
a lot because bash is just,

102
00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:49.767
I never get it right.

103
00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:52.327
It's like this is like
such a hard language.

104
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:57.427
I swear it feels so easy, but I get it
wrong every single time we have this.

105
00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:01.320
So now what we need to do is we need
to create that curl command, right?

106
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.060
So let's try this,
let's go like this curl cht, sh.

107
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.010
And then we got our selected, right?

108
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.640
That's the thing we selected.

109
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.706
And since we're under the languages,
all we got to do now is go like this echo.

110
00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:15.774
We need a query don't, we need like
a query So let's make this, read p,

111
00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.670
and that's p stands for prompt.

112
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.538
Give me your query, right, there we go.

113
00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:24.870
And we're gonna make it
go into variable query.

114
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.670
So we're gonna echo query down here.

115
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.810
I'm gonna pipe it into tr, right?

116
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.420
And tr we're gonna wanna replace
every space with plus signs.

117
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.918
Now for whatever reason I've decided
right here, I wanna use single quotes,

118
00:05:36.918 --> 00:05:39.091
which just seems asinine
to use single quotes and

119
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:40.949
one single spot in your entire language.

120
00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.510
There we go, so this should do
exactly what we think it should do.

121
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.119
It should curl a cheat sheet
with our selected language and

122
00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:53.645
then have our,
plus the limited query string down here.

123
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.765
We're gonna wanna do it,
just a touch different.

124
00:05:55.765 --> 00:05:59.011
Instead, we're gonna wanna to do that
little till day and go query, right?

125
00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:02.730
Query, awesome, so
that should do the other part of it.

126
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.980
So if we do find exec, that should work.

127
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.640
So let's find out,
let's go like this, let's quit.

128
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.000
Let's go in here, wrong script,
and let's go, I just quit them.

129
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240
Let's open up them because
it just feels better, right?

130
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.090
There we go, let's go over here.

131
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.680
And let's go to cheat sheet, and
let's use did I add find, I did add find.

132
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.670
So there we go, we got fine,
give me your query.

133
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.780
Let's do exec, all right.

134
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.550
All right, there's everything that
has to do with exec right here.

135
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.100
Awesome, so
like this is really working right?.

136
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.240
I feel like we're really
doing something awesome.

137
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.641
Okay, this is looking good,
but the problem is,

138
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:37.910
is we're not t mix out of our mind yet.

139
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.314
Right now we're still just
kind of lightly t maxing and

140
00:06:40.314 --> 00:06:43.830
I don't want that I want to just, I just
want this to be the greatest thing ever.

141
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.650
So how should we go about this?

142
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.730
So let's think about that,
we have two options.

143
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.762
We could create a new pain when which
I've never done and someone suggested,

144
00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:55.820
and honestly,
it kinda feels like a great challenge.

145
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.360
So let's try a new pain for a second.

146
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.730
If not, I'll just fall back to
the way I already prepared.

147
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.440
But we're going off script now okay,
people are going all in on this one.

148
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.480
I know this has to be the one,
it has to be split.

149
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.120
Create a new pain by splitting
the target pain, okay?

150
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.240
Does a horizontal split v does
a vertical split, awesome.

151
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.481
Okay, so I'm a vertical kinda guy,
by the way, no and

152
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:20.260
most normal programs horizontal.

153
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.750
So if two problems, i3 does it backwards.

154
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.603
Vim does it the correct way,
I would consider the verticality versus

155
00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:34.720
horizontal is the direction of the split,
not the resulting boxes.

156
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.830
So an i3, this would be
considered a horizontal split

157
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.614
because it's splitting
the horizontal space.

158
00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:43.648
But it results in a vertical bar,
I always consider that backwards right,

159
00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:44.860
that's totally backwards.

160
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.324
If you want to split vertically,
you literally do vertical,

161
00:07:48.324 --> 00:07:51.397
notice that my bottom line
got highlighted down here.

162
00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:54.970
And this is a vertical split
now that's a horizontal split.

163
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.150
I don't know who you're kidding.

164
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.742
All right, so I assume tmux is correct and
vertical pain literally

165
00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:06.120
means the lines vertical,
not splitting the window, vertically.

166
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.520
There we go, so let's try this out.

167
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:14.380
So we're go this Tmux split window, and
my guess is it's dash V for vertical.

168
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.895
This is feeling good, we won't provide
a target because I'm gonna assume that

169
00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.390
if there's no target it
does my current window.

170
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.676
Split window, you never know.

171
00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:23.400
Yeah, never mind,
split windows right here.

172
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.290
Shell command, okay.

173
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.600
All right, and
we even have starting directory,

174
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.680
we can do environment we can provide
environment variables really

175
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.490
cool by the way that you can
provide environment variables.

176
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.040
That means you could actually
have certain things in this.

177
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.771
You could like start a dB, environment
which already has all your connections and

178
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:39.630
everything.

179
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.820
A lot of cool things you can do here,
so I think this should probably be okay.

180
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.450
Looks like this split window
vertically and then let's just do this.

181
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.938
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

182
00:08:50.938 --> 00:08:54.990
this should just work first try because
it is the only way in which I work.

183
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.890
So let's go like this,
let's go I just quit them again.

184
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.190
Let's not do that, let's quit this.

185
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.110
We don't need that anymore.

186
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.934
Let's do cheat sheet we're gonna run cheat
sheet and now remember I did it only for

187
00:09:03.934 --> 00:09:06.860
the languages so
let's do this one and let's do enum.

188
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.312
All right, here we go.

189
00:09:11.497 --> 00:09:12.920
All right, so what just happened there?

190
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.100
Does anyone know what happened?

191
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.430
I know what happened but
do you know what happened?

192
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.730
&gt;&gt; The command finished and
it closed the window.

193
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.620
&gt;&gt; Nice, good job.

194
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.590
That's correct, so here's a little fun
thing about TMX when you do new window.

195
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.930
Yes, this was pre-planned.

196
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.445
If I like this, echo hello, S and sleep,

197
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:34.090
one and then go like this bash C.

198
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.230
So that way it doesn't get all screwed up,
right.

199
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.940
Poop, and sleep one.

200
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.550
It's gonna create a new window, hello.

201
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.720
And after it gets done sleeping for
one second.

202
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.400
When that command finishes, and
it's done, well the window's done right?

203
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.870
It's no longer needed, so
therefore it's going to close.

204
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.801
So when I did this little fun thing
right here, we did a split window and

205
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:01.896
we curl cheat sheets, so
it came back with the answer, but

206
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:04.600
it was done at that point, right?

207
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.105
So let's go like this, let's go bash-c.

208
00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:09.645
And let's just pass this into less.

209
00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:12.325
Less a super-duper ultra cool program.

210
00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:15.675
Okay, I'm gonna be let's see, hon,
we got a lot of escaping to do here.

211
00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:21.255
Let's escape with passion and fury,
I don't think I need to escape those ones.

212
00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:23.175
Let's just see,
I don't think I need to escape anything.

213
00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:24.665
Let's just find out, all right.

214
00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:27.344
So let's do this again.

215
00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:29.340
I keep closing my VIM command there for
a second.

216
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.890
So let's do cheat sheet,
let's do TypeScript.

217
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.370
Let's do enum and there we go, yes.

218
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.263
First off Teamwork is backwards,

219
00:10:36.263 --> 00:10:40.570
which part of me just feels very upset,
but look, our window stayed alive.

220
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.030
How fantastic is this awesome, right?

221
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.870
When I close, it's dead, right?

222
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.680
When I close, the ls, it dies.

223
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.953
For those that don't know what is,
check this out.

224
00:10:51.953 --> 00:10:54.460
Let's go back to here,
let's go back to this program.

225
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.090
And let's just take this and go down and
just paste this a bunch of times, right?

226
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.870
There we go,
it's a pretty long program now.

227
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.350
So if I were to cat pipe,
it'd be like a really long program, right?

228
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.550
Like, look at that,
it's the same thing a bunch of times.

229
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.451
But if I were to go a cat,
this thing, pipe it into less,

230
00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:14.037
it shows me what it has,
and then I can scroll down.

231
00:11:14.037 --> 00:11:16.563
All right, so
hopefully that explanation of,

232
00:11:16.563 --> 00:11:19.540
did you even catch the explanation
of less right there?

233
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.300
Hopefully you guys did,
if you guys didn't DLC.

234
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.631
Get out of here, [LAUGH] doing DLC, that's
what we're doing the expansion packs all

235
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:33.240
right, so let me do one more time
just in case you didn't hear it.

236
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.738
When I pipe that into less it will only
show me a screen full and I can use j

237
00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:42.850
to go down K to go up very vim bindings
right D to jump down half page at a time.

238
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.620
There we go, hit q to quit.

239
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.824
So kinda feels more like,

240
00:11:46.824 --> 00:11:52.260
it has kind of like an ad ish feel to it,
a vim ad feel to it.

241
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.811
So it's pretty easy to use, there's a few
things you need to know about less and

242
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:58.080
that's pretty much all you need to know.

243
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.110
And so let's go back into vim now.

244
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.110
And let's go back to
your little cheat sheet.

245
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.630
So there we go, so
we just piped into less, so it would work.

246
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.540
And then, of course, let's fix that very
poor vertical thing to make it horizontal.

247
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.290
And let's run it again, I close them
again, out clearly out of my element here.

248
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.050
Enough, and there we go.

249
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.520
Now I have this and so now I can scroll
around here to see what's going on.

250
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.800
So obviously there's nothing here.

251
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.780
So the moment I press Q, it quits,
it also quits the split we're back here.

252
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.840
That's actually pretty cool, that's
a pretty good experience right there.

253
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.660
Obviously I usually program
not this zoomed in.

254
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.528
But since I've been streaming so
much, I'm actually so

255
00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:37.160
used to like having this
much zoomed in this.

256
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.290
It's hard for
me to program back now to like this.

257
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.410
I don't even know it's happening.

258
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.583
So for me, the splits might not work as
well because now I have weird stream brain

259
00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.660
on, but that's actually
a pretty cool way to use it.

260
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.410
And not only can you do that with splits.

261
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.650
Let's just say you don't need
it to be that split, right?

262
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.740
I bet if we go back to tmux,
a man tmux, right?

263
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.030
And go to split window, I guarantee you,
we are gonna find, my goodness.

264
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.680
There it is, I bet you, we're gonna
find some sort of percentage, P percent.

265
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.420
Okay, so there you go, that's what it is.

266
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.510
So we could also do something like P 35 or
32, I guess we're doing 32.

267
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.720
Here, 42, right?

268
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.595
You can set some amount of the window
space to be able to take up.

269
00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:20.847
So that means you could still
have your primary viewport and

270
00:13:20.847 --> 00:13:24.229
then just quickly split it off
on the side in a smaller amount,

271
00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:26.545
cuz maybe you don't need a lot of it.

272
00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:29.693
And then you can do that side by
side workflow that makes sense for

273
00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:31.085
just a little bit.

274
00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:35.475
And there we go, I, to me, this seems like
a pretty, pretty nice little workflow.

275
00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:37.435
And it's kind of fun to do on the fly too.

276
00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:39.815
And so, of course, we can do
the same thing right here, right?

277
00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:44.695
I can just delete that Vi, these little
curly braces, and let's go right here.

278
00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:47.582
Let's paste that, all right,
this is awesome, and

279
00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:50.116
we don't really need
anything up until here.

280
00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:53.930
There we go, I think that's about right.

281
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.770
That's about right there, there we go.

282
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.940
We have the exact same thing, and
now we can do it for a language.

283
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.130
So let's just try that again,
let's cheat sheet.

284
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.098
Let's go to find,
then it's gonna say give me a query,

285
00:14:05.098 --> 00:14:07.002
let's use exact and so there we go.

286
00:14:07.002 --> 00:14:10.575
We have that 32% file,
which is pretty annoying for me.

287
00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:13.820
But you can imagine if it was like
a little bit it'd be pretty easy to see

288
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.130
right here, right?

289
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.600
All right, rock on, that is awesome.

290
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.390
And there we go, we quit, it's gone.

291
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.220
It's awesome, you can transfer
between panes pretty easily.

292
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.980
What I have set up inside my vim or
my team ox RC.

293
00:14:26.078 --> 00:14:27.750
My goodness.

294
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.310
Here, let's go right here, okay,
that's really obviously easy to see.

295
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.200
I have this right here is that I
actually have a bind Kj h now, so

296
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.200
it feels like them.

297
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.917
And then I can go up down left and
right for my pain so when I have multiple

298
00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:45.067
of them I just do prefix h to
jump over prefix l the jump over,

299
00:14:45.067 --> 00:14:46.680
so I added that in there.

300
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.290
Some t mux like pain switching,
it feels pretty good.

301
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.760
All right, exit, awesome.

302
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.250
Zooming back in or feeling good
