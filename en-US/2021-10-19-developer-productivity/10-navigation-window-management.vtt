1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.745
All right, so
let's just do a little bit of section 2.

2
00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.160
I think section 2 is really exciting.

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.266
So section 2 I feel like is
more exciting because section

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.955
2 influences everything
you do in your day to day.

5
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.172
So we just kinda got done
talking about the longer term,

6
00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:18.122
the more thoughtful kinda
approaches to systems.

7
00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.936
Now we're narrowing it in.

8
00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.636
We're onto the best part.

9
00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:23.975
I think it's like the best part, okay?

10
00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:27.306
And so the first thing I wanna
talk about is our window managers.

11
00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:30.397
If you're not familiar like window
managers, I don't use Windows.

12
00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.303
I use Mac OS X.

13
00:00:31.303 --> 00:00:33.718
Okay, well, we will talk about
two different things here.

14
00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:36.263
For those that are not
familiar with window managers,

15
00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.319
they simply are things that will
literally manage your windows.

16
00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.811
Now, I've put a few of them up here.

17
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.097
I have one for what I use for
you bun to I3.

18
00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:47.543
There's also Yubie for
Mac and Bug n for Windows.

19
00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.598
And they all seem to do
about the same thing, or

20
00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:51.729
at least as close as
possible to the same thing.

21
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.415
At this point, you're probably wondering
because I've been sharing my screen and

22
00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:57.477
going through it.

23
00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:00.052
Though when I'm saying, hey,
I'm gonna start coding now.

24
00:01:00.052 --> 00:01:02.922
It just seems like it goes
to where I'm going, right?

25
00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:06.468
And obviously, normally my Zoom
window would be over here.

26
00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:07.910
This is where we have the chat, right?

27
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.624
Normally I have slack open up my goodness,
I have slack open now.

28
00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:16.434
Normally I'm not supposed to like docs,
my goodness Jim, look at that.

29
00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:20.981
Jim Young's advertising his front
end masters class in my email.

30
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.670
Jim, I mean I found your Jim but
this is a little inappropriate here.

31
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.389
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

32
00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.555
I'm gonna have to talk to his manager,
No, he's a manager now, gosh, no.

33
00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:33.660
All right, anyways, then I have like
GIMP over here number six, right?

34
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.073
So and then I have whatever this is
called, my work window on number two.

35
00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:41.441
My private one this summer I did
my little discord notification for

36
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:42.801
doing the front end masters, right?

37
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.148
I did that over here right?

38
00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:47.906
I can quickly jump between all these
things without having to think about it.

39
00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:50.012
They're just all hotkey doubt.

40
00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:54.007
Now a lot of people do have that thing
where they have like that little exploded

41
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:55.676
view It shows all your windows.

42
00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:59.025
And then you play a game of where's
waldo for your Chrome or Firefox or

43
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:01.050
brave if you're super awesome.

44
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.952
And you're like, okay, I gotta use
all these different things, right?

45
00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:10.015
It's such a painful experience really,
that we do that over and over again.

46
00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:13.718
If you've never really thought about it,
how often do you manage your windows?

47
00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:15.422
I don't really like the size of this one.

48
00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:16.642
I want to split this one in half.

49
00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:18.137
I can split that one in half.

50
00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.621
This one's on number three.

51
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.160
I wanna move it to desktop two.

52
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.692
Okay, we can move it to desktop two.

53
00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:23.436
There we go.
Okay,

54
00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:25.022
we can move back to desktop three, right?

55
00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:29.415
You have this really smooth,
really creamy feel that is available.

56
00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.242
But most people don't even
realise that is even a thing.

57
00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:35.722
It's not something I ever thought about.

58
00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:39.958
Eventually I got really tired of
just having to use a Mac back then.

59
00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.214
And that's when I started
using better touch tools.

60
00:02:42.214 --> 00:02:46.484
And that's what set me down this long path
of what the heck is a window manager.

61
00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:50.542
And I'm so sick of having to like
manually size everything in my life.

62
00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:54.057
And so I kinda wanna just talk about
in general my navigation theory.

63
00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.363
Is what I like to call
it navigation theory.

64
00:02:57.363 --> 00:02:59.641
I call it my harpoon lifestyle.

65
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:00.971
Harpoons library,

66
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.361
but I try to model everything after
this certain type of workflow.

67
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:09.294
Meaning that I always have everything
effectively separated out.

68
00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.431
And I do wanna take a quick
moment to pause here.

69
00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:15.111
Did you just see that
freehand line I just drew?

70
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.063
Look how straight that line, like
that's look how straight that freehand.

71
00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:21.311
My goodness, I should be an artist.

72
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.110
Anyways, so

73
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.839
I have this whole notion that everything
kinda hangs off keys that I can go to.

74
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.965
All right, and so I'm gonna want to put
everything off individual keys if I can.

75
00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.503
If I cannot put things
off of individual keys,

76
00:03:35.503 --> 00:03:39.688
I want to then put things
off of fuzzy finders, right?

77
00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:40.970
That's like my life.

78
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.291
I don't want to ever have
to do anything manual.

79
00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.080
All right.

80
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.633
I just find that to be so
annoying when I have to go.

81
00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.350
Okay, I want to find this thing.

82
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.119
Let me pretend like I'm a computer and

83
00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.502
go through things individually until
I find the thing I'm looking for.

84
00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.032
It's just super inefficient.

85
00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:00.023
And it just feels like it's
just a drain of brainpower.

86
00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:02.782
And so this in general is my
navigation theory for everything.

87
00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:03.835
That line was not straight.

88
00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.460
Please let's not talk about it.

89
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.973
And that box kinda sucks.

90
00:04:07.973 --> 00:04:12.486
But that's how I decided to
start using window managers.

91
00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:15.573
And the ones that I suggested they
all have very similar features.

92
00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:20.842
So this one comes with ten independent
Individual desktops that you can go to.

93
00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:23.525
So, like I said, two is always
where we're going to go for work.

94
00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:26.426
So when I'm wondering, hey,
I need to go back to my site and

95
00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.352
start going through my presentation.

96
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:30.350
I just simply press mode two.

97
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.147
You get a set, your mode key,
can be control, super windows.

98
00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:35.511
Whatever you want it to be, right?

99
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:40.092
And if I wanna go to coding, I just go
mod three, I'm back into my coding side.

100
00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:41.581
I can do these things really fast.

101
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:45.930
If you use VS code,
put VS code on its own window, right?

102
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.594
So you can jump in between these two.

103
00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:51.304
If you need them onto the same page,
you can then swap them and move them.

104
00:04:51.304 --> 00:04:57.331
But you no longer spend just needless
energy thinking about where to go.

105
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.933
You just simply have
the same setup all the time.

106
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.540
It always goes where it goes.

107
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.610
You just have to think where you wanna go,
and you go there, right?

108
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.044
It really just makes life
feel a lot better honestly.

109
00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:11.191
And I didn't want to prescribe
anything like super specific.

110
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:14.149
Notice that I'm not bringing up an config.

111
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.249
Or talking about how do you configure
the one for Mac or for windows?

112
00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.002
It's because there's a lot of
windows managers out there.

113
00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:21.464
Some of them let you break, right?

114
00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:26.367
So if you use DWM you get the break
because you have the right C to

115
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.507
make it work.

116
00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:32.001
I have kids once again, I don't have
time for this type of lifestyle.

117
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:37.362
But I feel like this it's just
like kind of like a tipping point.

118
00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.724
And I wanted to make sure that you even
know that this thing is available.

119
00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:43.442
Because a lot of people they
just don't know that these

120
00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.112
things are even available
to invest their time into.

121
00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:49.285
And so that's why I'm not
going into any specifics.

122
00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:51.397
There's just two specific for
each operating system.

123
00:05:51.397 --> 00:05:52.941
But they are all available.

124
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:54.806
So please check one of those out,

125
00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:59.010
it'll make one of the biggest indents
into just waste of time in your life.
