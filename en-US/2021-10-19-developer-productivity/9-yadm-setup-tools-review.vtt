00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.660
Lets talk about a different dotfile
manager, just for a moment.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.560
Cuz I do think it's important to know
that there's other options available.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.630
I don't wanna just say, hey, here's
the best thing, and tell you nothing.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.820
It's kind of rude.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.680
And in reality,
it's just use what you like.

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.376
Now if you go to the homepage of Yet
Another Dotfile Manager they did write

7
00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:20.628
this for you and
I feel obligated to read it.

8
00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:27.075
[COUGH] When you live in a command line
configurations are deeply personal thing.

9
00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:30.600
They are often crafted over years
of experience, battles lost, and

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.375
lessons learned, advice followed and
ingenuity rewarded.

11
00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.403
When you are away from
your own configurations,

12
00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.850
you are in an orphaned refugee and
an unfamiliar and hostile surroundings.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.260
Little intense I would agree.

14
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.205
You feel clumsy and out of sorts,

15
00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:47.109
you are filled with a sense of longing
to be back in a place you know.

16
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.299
A place you've built.

17
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.361
A place where all the short-cuts have
been worn bare by your own travels.

18
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.940
A place you proudly call $Home.

19
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.620
Yeah, so that's a little intense, right?

20
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.071
It's a little intense for so right away
I'm like, I don't know if I can use yet

21
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:01.650
another dotfile manager.

22
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.478
It almost feels like Lord of the Rings
without all the Lord talent skill and

23
00:01:04.478 --> 00:01:06.800
all the things that kind of
gone into Lord of the Rings.

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.330
So I was just like, okay, this is kind
of silly, but whatever, we'll let it go.

25
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.622
And so yeah, Adams actually,
it's a clever program.

26
00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:17.490
I'm gonna use clever in a proper way.

27
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.820
It does some neat things.

28
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.000
It actually wraps Git, and it creates
your home directory into a Git repo.

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.080
But obviously if you did git status in
your home directory what would happen?

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.465
All of your personal projects,
all of your work projects,

31
00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:35.740
all the enormous amounts of node module
files will all be in there, right?

32
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.002
You won't even be able to tell what's
going on if you did get status,

33
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.510
it might even freeze your computer.

34
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.921
I actually am very curious to see what
happens if I tried to get add my entire

35
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:43.810
computer.

36
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.570
It'd be very exciting to
see what would happen.

37
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.218
But nonetheless what got him does
is it wraps get in and allows for

38
00:01:50.218 --> 00:01:53.380
you to clone into your home directory.

39
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.599
And then on top of it It allows
when you do like yiadom status,

40
00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.830
it only shows you the things
that have changed.

41
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.590
It doesn't show you your entire system,
right?

42
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.060
Because that'd be just crazy.

43
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.532
And so then if you want to add something,

44
00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:10.990
it's just like Git yiadom add this file,
I want to add the lsp.vim.

45
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.630
Awesome.

46
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.210
Great everything's working right?

47
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.570
So it behaves a lot like Git,
but it allows things to work.

48
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.390
It also has a vaulting technique just like
Ansible, so you can store your SSH keys.

49
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.434
So fairly convenient, but it doesn't have
quite the same level as Ansible does for

50
00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:27.390
power usage.

51
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.320
It's not as powerful but
it does have things available.

52
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.950
So you're probably asking yourself,
well what do I do?

53
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.060
Do I use the YADM or do I use Stow?

54
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.837
I haven't even mentioned dotbot,
but dotbots,

55
00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:38.370
another one of these really popular ones.

56
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.560
You can go look it up.

57
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.610
I don't even use it.

58
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.050
But what should you use?

59
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.808
Well, I'm gonna tell you what I use and
why I use it,

60
00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:49.839
cuz I'm not a super opinionated
person in most things.

61
00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.019
I just find that I like certain trade offs
more than other people like certain trade

62
00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.070
offs, right?

63
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.570
I'm a very singular screen, individual.

64
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.090
Some people my goodness,
they just love splits, right?

65
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.780
I can't do that it stresses me out.

66
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.170
I just want one screen, right?

67
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.630
And so we all have our own likes and
dislikes.

68
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.490
So for me, as far as I see, YADM doesn't
have a spot to me, or first spot for me.

69
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.410
It's simpler than Ansible, meaning that
Ansible has a really rich ecosystem.

70
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.848
Lots of plugins,
really easy way to do installation,

71
00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:17.930
working with SSH keys doing faulting.

72
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.180
It's all kind of built in.

73
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.540
It has a really great system for it.

74
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.048
And yet I'm just isn't there, but

75
00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:29.160
it's way more complex than Stow meaning
that it just still is so simple.

76
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.920
It has this really beautiful
separation of concerns, right?

77
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.220
Stow just manages your siblings and your
siblings happened to be your dotfiles.

78
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.293
Ansible manages your computer setup
beautiful symmetry right there right our

79
00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:43.884
beautiful asymmetric
relationship right there.

80
00:03:43.884 --> 00:03:47.176
It's just they do they work with
each other so well up Ivan.

81
00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:48.257
&gt;&gt; What about bear repos?

82
00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:51.824
&gt;&gt; So well YADM does use technically
a bear repo I did use a bear repo for

83
00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:54.130
a little YADM It's just as a helper right.

84
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.236
If you use bear repos,
you should just use the YADM honestly,

85
00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:00.510
because it creates all of that
within your home directory.

86
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.816
But then it just has all the nice
things built around it so

87
00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:05.466
you don't have to have like that
Git ignore that you're uncut,

88
00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:07.700
ignoring certain things like
it just does it for you.

89
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.600
So it's nicer just use YADM.

90
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.450
I guess I should have mentioned
that you are right, though.

91
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.443
Bear repos are like I'd say
the predecessor to YADM or DAPA.

92
00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:18.350
Really those two are kind of like the,
that.

93
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.190
So what are the pros and cons?

94
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.467
One thing that's neat about YADM,
obviously it has the ansible vault,

95
00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:26.230
like nature.

96
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.800
It does the bear repo makes it really,
really nice.

97
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.040
But I'd say a major con and such a con
that it makes me not wanna use the system.

98
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.240
And it's the same reason why
I don't use a bear repo also.

99
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.230
Is that when you're all by
the way YADM also as OS switches.

100
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.650
So you can actually do some OS independent
operations, which is pretty cool.

101
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.660
So it actually can be
a multi OS kind of system.

102
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.270
But one thing that I really,

103
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.240
I just can't do is that let's say
you've added a new script, right?

104
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.300
You add a new program,
you add to download some work thing and

105
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.160
it comes with a configuration file.

106
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.030
So you need to get it up there and
you need to get it in.

107
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.995
Well, unfortunately,
you forgot to add it to YADM.

108
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.324
So if you go YADM status ,is
it gonna show you that file?

109
00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:09.353
No, you don't know what you are and
are not added to YADM, right?

110
00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:14.204
You're gonna have to go review your files,
make sure you have those things running.

111
00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:16.080
And for me that's really painful.

112
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.680
And the reason why I love Stow
is that if I go to my .files,

113
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.360
which I'm already here in my .files,
there we go.

114
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.020
That if I change something like
git status, I have nothing here.

115
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.985
So if I change anything, if I just add
a file file, right, and I save it,

116
00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:34.040
I can literally go git status and
I go, wow, yeah,

117
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.870
I still haven't committed this thing yet.

118
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.021
And so Stow allows me to have
this really nice management but

119
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:42.820
I know exactly what
the state of my stuff is in.

120
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.566
Now obviously the con to stow is that
before I put any RC into my system,

121
00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:50.542
I first have to create
its file structure and

122
00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.440
folder-like nature inside
of my Stow directory.

123
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.020
And then properly put it where it should
be mapped into my home directory.

124
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.460
And then on top of that, I need to create
the file and make sure it's saved there.

125
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.851
And then I have that nice Git kind of,
I've made this change,

126
00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:04.970
I need to commit it.

127
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.820
And for me, I have to do a piece of
work no matter what for either approach.

128
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.577
It's just one of them is really easy to
know when I've screwed up the other one is

129
00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:16.510
much harder, I feel like and
I don't know I like Stow better.

130
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.180
Stow just feels more natural.

131
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.330
Whereas the YADM just takes such
advantage of your home system.

132
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.390
I could see myself constantly
forgetting to add files.

133
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.040
So, personal choice, go check it out,
make your own determination.

134
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.090
I think that's just the best
way to live anyways.

135
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.790
So this really kind of marks
the end of section one.

136
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.651
This is how you get your computer
kind of up and running and

137
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:42.850
being something right away.

138
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.102
Hopefully if you if everyone here takes
the time it might take you a day now, but

139
00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:51.236
it's gonna save you days in the future
when you have all these things set up.

140
00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:55.245
Because that's the reality is like even
we were talking about this last night.

141
00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:58.605
It's like that thousand cut problem
where you get a new computer,

142
00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.145
you think you have everything up and
running day two day ten comes by and

143
00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:04.197
you're like, I forgot that one thing.

144
00:07:04.197 --> 00:07:08.336
Then if your computer's broken, like it's
gone forever, but if you still have your

145
00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:12.416
plane, that weird game of getting one file
to the other computer, it's just like,

146
00:07:12.416 --> 00:07:14.030
it's always such a mess.

147
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.300
It's never smooth.

148
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.090
And so I've just finally decided after
having to do it way too many times.

149
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.730
I'm just going to simply have a system
that I can recreate at any moment.

150
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.006
Now, inevitably libraries are going to
change, things are going to change,

151
00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:28.970
I am going to have to do some
level of maintenance to my script.

152
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.182
So my goal is to try to
keep it pretty simple and

153
00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:34.010
only have the things that
are really important.

154
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.935
And then try to actually have
maybe separated scripts one for

155
00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:38.180
just my job right.

156
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.010
Here are all the teams I work on,
here's all their installation processes.

157
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.904
So it's always a little bit easier to
know when things have gotten out of sync,

158
00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:48.520
a little easier to just
kind of maintain those.

159
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.490
Cuz then if I have a new computer,
I don't have to have everything ready.

160
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.220
I may only need my personal stuff, plus
the one team I'm currently working on.

161
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.930
It just makes life, I'd say,
a little bit easier.

162
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.060
We did talk about Ansible.

163
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.570
So hopefully you feel that hopefully
you're really excited about Stow.

164
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.870
I think Stow is really great.

165
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.694
And really, I'd say the hardest part
about this section is it's just adopting

166
00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:09.240
a new mindset, right?

167
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.115
The mindset is that you have to be
willing to change a few things of how you

168
00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:15.840
do it now to gain the benefit for
you in the future.

169
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.560
Because let's just face it,
we all don't care about me in the future.

170
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.670
We're all like, I'll just he'll just
get the computer running, right?

171
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.850
And so it's like, really,
you gotta wanna help yourself later on.

172
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.220
Because it is going to just save
you just a enormous amount of time.

173
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.453
I feel like today I could honestly
get a brand new computer up and

174
00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:37.605
running in about 30 minutes, right
because installation just takes so long.

175
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:41.895
Getting i three installed I have to shut
things down and relaunch and backup with i

176
00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:46.160
three running all that so it should be but
it should be fairly darn quick.

177
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.271
You should also probably follow my
approach if you're gonna do this,

178
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:50.910
create a Docker image right?

179
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.665
Create a docker image with nothing
on it so you can just test hey.

180
00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:55.510
I want to make sure I
have this installed or

181
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.883
if you like fish you use fish by the way
I used to sit next to the ridiculous fish

182
00:08:58.883 --> 00:09:00.820
the guy who wrote fish is pretty nice guy.

183
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.930
But you just test it.

184
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.173
Make sure all of your installation
works cuz when it comes to actual game

185
00:09:06.173 --> 00:09:08.890
time like you're now it's time
to put it on your computer.

186
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.630
You don't want things failing, then.

187
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.340
Make it fail now use a Docker image really
simple as doing the exact same thing.

188
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.269
Plus if you don't know how to use Docker,

189
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:20.010
great time to learn a little
bit about Docker, right.

190
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.410
It will help you a bunch
throughout your career.
