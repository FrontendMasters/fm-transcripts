00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.810
So there we go that's really all,
I want to talk to you about today.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.700
This was the developer
productivity course.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.106
I feel like this,
covered a lot of topics we covered and

4
00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:14.930
good amount we covered getting your
computer up and running dot files.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.430
Working with the terminal hopefully
liked that terminal thing I really do.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.060
I mean to me that was just been something
that saved a ton of time for me.

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.800
And then ultimately knowing these core
utils being able to take advantage more of

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.335
what's already freely available to you,
too.

9
00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:30.615
Lastly a little quick
pitstop into the future.

10
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:34.373
Unfortunately today,
the future maybe your future here at front

11
00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:37.455
end masters isn't as good
as it is where I'm living.

12
00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.935
So maybe copilot wasn't
able to work as well.

13
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:41.305
So who knows what's happening.

14
00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:44.923
But I don't know if it has positional
GPS into its code generation, but

15
00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:47.835
either way it was pretty
it's pretty great, right?

16
00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:50.247
I think that it's gonna be
I think the next few years,

17
00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:53.450
it's gonna be very interesting
to see where these things go.

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.010
And so definitely if you have a chance,
try it out, try to write something.

19
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.604
I tried to write like a bigger server in
it and it got really complex really quick

20
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.015
and it actually made the project
a lot harder to track, but

21
00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:08.970
I just think that's because it's so new.

22
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.560
Thank you everyone for sticking around.

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.310
Really honestly, thank you for
sticking around I really appreciate that.

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.996
The hours and the effort people put into
making these workshops is always really

25
00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:21.310
nice when people stick around,
chat and chat, all that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.433
So I just like to let you know thank you
very much it means a lot to me it means

27
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:26.470
a lot to probably a lot of other people.

28
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.640
And if I can fearlessly
she'll one last time.

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.510
Don't forget I also have a VIM workshop,
VIM workshops are great I love them.

30
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.410
Anyways, there we go,
I got I always do that.

31
00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:41.480
And then I show VS code at the end,
my goodness, here there we go, all right.
