1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.330
Let's dive into tmux.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.017
For those that don't remember
where we're at, including myself,

3
00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:05.560
let's just jump back to the terminal.

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.210
Remember we got Dan talking
about alacritty guy, Kitty guy.

5
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.089
And then what are we gonna talk about,

6
00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.860
talked all about tmaxing
that we're gonna be testing.

7
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.890
Terminal multiplexing we're gonna really
solve that problem where there's all those

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.089
terminals everywhere and

9
00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.990
you just have this problem of
navigation kinda getting there.

10
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.567
I really want to kinda provide something
that is a much better path and

11
00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.513
then I wanna kinda take it up another
level beyond that and actually make it so

12
00:00:28.513 --> 00:00:30.117
that you can start crafting and

13
00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:33.605
customizing it into a solution
that you want for yourself.

14
00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:37.139
Not just simply something that
I think is good, but a way for

15
00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:40.080
you to see how to take
it much much further.

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.320
So I first thought I'd just at least
start off with just a simple example.

17
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.540
So here's my screen.

18
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.390
I'm just in a terminal that is it.

19
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.850
Nothing else is on my screen.

20
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.450
Well, there's technically
little zoom widgets.

21
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.380
You can see the zoom widgets I can.

22
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.003
It's very bothersome, but I can press
a quick button I'll get a nice fuzzy find,

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:01.639
hey, here's all the folders in my home,
in my personal and in my work directory.

24
00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.886
I can then go to my say my favorite
personal project refactoring, and

25
00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:08.990
I can press enter,
I now have a session created.

26
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.155
I'm in the refactoring directory,
everything's looking good,

27
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.270
I can then launch them.

28
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.250
And here I can have another window here,
run some sort of servers.

29
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.390
If I really, really, really want to
over here, they're just all there.

30
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.650
They're all ready to rock.

31
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.280
That's awesome.

32
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.070
I can go back here.

33
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.930
Great, I think close things down,
open it back up.

34
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.110
Just jump right back in.

35
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.840
We're bright back exactly where
we were nothing has changed.

36
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.020
Yes, even on that other one,
it still has all the nonsense over there.

37
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.280
This is beautiful, right?

38
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.500
It allows me to always be really
like tightly bound to my system.

39
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.030
I don't have to worry
about things getting lost.

40
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.830
I can really jump to where I want to,
if I want to jump to another project.

41
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.850
There we go with them with me.

42
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.940
I can go to my work project,
my work project, my work project, right?

43
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.110
I can just keep jumping around.

44
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.210
I can go back and
forth between them ultimate file style.

45
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.851
I have everything on a very
short fast leash for

46
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:58.120
me to be able to go exactly where I
want to go with very few keystrokes.

47
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.320
And more than just that, I can also,
say, open up something, with no JS,

48
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.666
something I always forget,
the splice interface.

49
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:06.505
There we go.
Okay, yep,

50
00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:07.980
that's how you do the splice interface.

51
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.710
Awesome, I'm back in my project, right?

52
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.429
I have very fast access to enter
information, and it's very optimized for

53
00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.310
my usage.

54
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.282
So that is really what I wanna talk
about today is just crafting and

55
00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:23.195
creating a better terminal experience to
really kind of move out of the way some of

56
00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:25.527
the silly things we do as developers.

57
00:02:25.527 --> 00:02:30.312
Specifically just slow navigation
looking up information that can be

58
00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:32.022
looked up differently.

59
00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.162
That kinda stuff, all right?

60
00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:34.750
So we're gonna talk TMUX.

61
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
That's really the primary thing here,
there's some alternatives to TMUX.

62
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.015
If you use a Lac ready, I believe
it has a multiplexer built into it,

63
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:44.970
I don't use it I like TMUX.

64
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.230
Like I said it works everywhere.

65
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.672
It's how I want it to be,
I assume alacrity works everywhere but

66
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.520
I just stick with TMUX.

67
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.460
So here we go.

68
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.745
I wanted to share this picture I thought
this was one of the I thought this was one

69
00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.840
of the best pictures yet to describe TMUX.

70
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930
It seems to be the most accurate.

71
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.618
Now obviously if you don't know what
TMUX is you are not too familiar with

72
00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.930
the terminal, this may feel overwhelming.

73
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.704
But really let me just kinda slowly walk
you through this to the point where,

74
00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:14.251
it will feel really easy to understand.

75
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:18.573
All right, so at the very base of
everything, there is a TMUX server,

76
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.760
this is the thing that runs.

77
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.270
Every server has one or more sessions.

78
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.710
Every session has one or more windows.

79
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.320
Every window has one or more panes.

80
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.960
It's fairly straightforward.

81
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.600
Just in this picture, you can kinda
see that but really, what's a server?

82
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.390
What's a session?

83
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.040
What's a window?

84
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.920
What's a pane?

85
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.810
Let's kinda go through
all of that at once.

86
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.270
So I'm gonna jump over here to GIMP.

87
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.450
We've had all of our fantastic drawings.

88
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.050
And let kinda write
some things about that.

89
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.940
Actually, I'll write
that here in a moment.

90
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.280
Let me first go down first.

91
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.110
So, install tmux first.

92
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.700
Okay, if you want to join in on all this,

93
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.770
I'll give everybody
a moment to install tmux.

94
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.620
I think this is really important
just to at least minimally use it.

95
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.910
Cuz when you first use tmux,
you'll probably be a lot like me.

96
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.684
You'll start it and go.

97
00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:10.480
I don't know what this does,
I don't get it.

98
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.800
I'm pressing funny buttons.

99
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.320
This is weird,
I don't wanna use this ever again.

100
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.888
And that;s kinda what I did, as I learned
a couple quick things and that was it and

101
00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.840
then I never touched any of them.

102
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.688
I felt confused and disjointed and
then all sudden I took some

103
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:28.440
time learned about it and it became
really obvious what was going on.

104
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.200
Now I love it.

105
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.820
Let's start using tmux.

106
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.480
Now to start using tmux,
you just need to type the word tmux.

107
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.040
It should be pretty easy so
I will join you with it.

108
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.310
Let me just go like this.

109
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.490
All right, here we go.

110
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.430
I'm gonna just start using tmux,
just with you.

111
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.500
So I do this tmux boom.

112
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.910
What just happened right there.

113
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.860
Obviously not a lot of things
just happened right there.

114
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.970
Yours is gonna look slightly
different than mine.

115
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.507
If you just for
the first time ever installed it,

116
00:04:56.507 --> 00:05:01.610
you probably have green down here as
opposed to my more pleasant blue.

117
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.790
Just the way it is.

118
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.350
So let me just kinda explain to
you what just happened there.

119
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.611
So first off, when you typed in tmux,
you sent obviously,

120
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.840
remember we talked about the terminal.

121
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.721
The terminal is the thing that
are taking in all your keystrokes and

122
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:15.960
making everything happen.

123
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.647
Your shell interpreted,
called the right program,

124
00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:19.800
made sure everything happened
in that program, then launched.

125
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.050
That's tmux, right?

126
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.410
So we sent all these keys over through
your terminal, blah, blah, blah, blah,

127
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.960
blah, and tmux went, all right,
I'm gonna run, is there a server running?

128
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.230
Remember at the bottom of our diagram,
the server was the largest portion.

129
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.120
It's gonna say, hey,
there's no server running.

130
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.050
So let's create a server, right?

131
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.822
And then after that,
it's gonna go, all right,

132
00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.868
since we are now doing a new session or

133
00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:44.488
now since it's a new command will create a
new session, which we need to add a window

134
00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:48.935
to this one session which we need to
add a pain to the, this one session.

135
00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:53.543
And so that's exactly what you're seeing
here right now is a server with one

136
00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:58.511
session, with one window, with one pane,
it'll become more obvious as we start

137
00:05:58.511 --> 00:06:02.240
moving and doing things but
just kind of keep that in mind.

138
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.180
We've just created a singular thing.

139
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.250
And to really drive this home.

140
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.430
Yeah, what do we do next?

141
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.200
Well, let me show you what we do next.

142
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.940
Well first, let's exit.

143
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.180
So easy way to exit Ctrl D,
Ctrl D actually sends an end of file,

144
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.500
note our end of file
into the input stream.

145
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.030
And a file is the end of
what needs to be running and

146
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.398
so then tmux goes what,
this pain can be closed.

147
00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:26.860
There's no more pains in this window.

148
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.292
This window can be closed.

149
00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:30.070
There's no more windows in this session.

150
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.900
This session can be closed.

151
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.290
You need to leave tmux now.

152
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.886
Thank you very much for being around
here goodbye, whole thing closes and

153
00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:40.075
I bet if we check there won't
even be anything running.

154
00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:44.867
All right, just a little side note
whenever you see this syntax in my

155
00:06:44.867 --> 00:06:49.829
mark down or if you're watching from
right here because I don't think

156
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:53.632
the website is still up C-D means ctrl D,
all right?

157
00:06:53.632 --> 00:06:54.790
Just so you know.

158
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.900
So C- anything,
is ctrl plus that character.

159
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.553
So the example we're using right now
is CD which is just end of file,

160
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:08.810
throw right in the STN and but, so
let's start using tmux, all right?

161
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.551
Now I did wanna be a little
bit of a warning here.

162
00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:15.814
My tmux experience will be slightly
different than yours because I

163
00:07:15.814 --> 00:07:18.030
have that RC changes a few things.

164
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.187
So all the commands will be the same, but

165
00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:24.830
some information might be slightly
differently displayed for you than for me.

166
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.280
And then second,
why am I showing you all these commands?

167
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.019
It's a little weird.
Why am

168
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.880
I gonna go through all
the things we're gonna go?

169
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.106
Well a big thing is is that you need to
know these commands not because it makes

170
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:37.880
you a better hacker, you're more awesome.

171
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.964
But in reality,
it allows you to understand that tmux,

172
00:07:40.964 --> 00:07:45.240
though interactable with a bunch of
keyboard shortcuts is also scriptable.

173
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.000
Meaning that you can actually write out
these commands and create things you want.

174
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.870
Not just what is currently available.

175
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.350
I think that's a really important
kind of aspect of tmux.
